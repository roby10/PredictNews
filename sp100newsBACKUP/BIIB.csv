1,BIIB,"Analysis: After 34 years, Forest's CEO takes stand","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N chief Howard Solomon will likely have to cede some control over the drugmaker he has stewarded for over three decades to resolve a showdown with billionaire Carl Icahn.  As Forest solicits shareholder input ahead of its annual meeting on August 15, 83-year-old Solomon should hear enough support to keep his job, investors and analysts say.  But he is expected to face calls for some fresh perspective on the nine-member board, where Icahn is seeking to place four of his own nominees. Icahn may gain at least one seat, allowing him to push for more cost cuts and share buybacks and to influence a succession plan that could favor Solomon’s son, David.  “There are a lot of larger holders of this stock who I think probably are not interested in ousting Solomon,” said Cowen & Co analyst Ian Sanderson. “But I do think that even the large holders probably would not mind if there was some new blood brought onto the board.”  Those holders could include ClearBridge Advisors, Forest’s fifth-largest shareholder at 6.35 percent, which supported Icahn’s 2007 bid for a seat at mobile phone maker Motorola.  Responding to the possibility that he might only gain one board seat, Icahn said in an interview that his group deserves more presence given his track record in driving value at other biopharmaceutical companies, such as ImClone, Genzyme and Biogen-Idec Inc (BIIB.O).  “It takes a strong representation on the board, and we think we deserve a strong representation,” Icahn said. “I really believe that shareholders will support us because look at what we’ve done for shareholders in the biopharmaceutical world. We’re going to try to enhance value as we’ve done in the past.”  Losing any measure of control would be notable for Solomon. Though virtually invisible to Wall Street — he tends not to speak on earnings calls or at investor conferences; one analyst recalls meeting him just once in 17 years — Solomon is deeply identified with the company he has run since 1977.  “He is Forest Labs,” said Scott Richter, a portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management.  Solomon has become more vulnerable to attack as Forest struggles to address future revenue holes from top drugs going off patent and as the U.S. government threatens sanctions against him personally.  U.S. regulators are weighing whether to bar Solomon from participating in federal healthcare programs after his company last year agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $313 million to resolve charges over improper marketing of several drugs.  Indeed, the government action could eventually force Solomon out, regardless of Icahn’s desires.  Having built a roughly 7 percent stake that makes him Forest’s fourth-largest shareholder, Icahn has chided the board for spending money to back Solomon against the government and has sued to get access to details of the case.  “We think that governance has been an issue at Forest, and we think that investors are better off with Icahn,” said David Maris, an analyst at CLSA. “The current management has positioned the company poorly.”  Forest declined to comment.  Solomon had already been facing a turbulent period after building Forest into a formidable marketing machine.  Revenue at the New York-based company, with a market value of more than $11 billion, is projected to drop by about one-fourth after its Lexapro antidepressant loses patent protection early next year. Another big patent expiry — for its Namenda Alzheimer’s drug — is expected in 2015.  Company shares are worth about half of what they were at their height in 2004 and a third less than peak 2007 levels, though they had begun to rebound before Icahn made his move.  “I’m sure it’s a huge distraction for him and the senior management team,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Gary Nachman said of the Icahn and government challenges. “This is a company that Howard built and it’s very much his and I think he would prefer to keep it that way.”  To replace losses of Lexapro and Namenda revenue, Forest is following a course long-implemented under Solomon, a Yale University-trained lawyer: It buys or licenses products in the late stages of development and then uses its sales force to sell them in the United States.  It paid $1.2 billion for Clinical Data Inc and its new antidepressant Viibryd. Forest recently won approval for respiratory drug Daliresp and antibiotic Teflaro and has drugs in late-stage development for irritable bowel syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  That marketing strategy has paid off in the past. Solomon built Forest into a company with more than $4 billion in annual revenue largely due to two antidepressants, Celexa and then Lexapro, its chemical cousin.  For Solomon, the drugs are also personal: His son Andrew suffered from severe depression and wrote the award-winning book, “The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression.”  Now, however, some question whether Solomon’s strategy will be enough to sustain profits.  Richter, the Fifth Third portfolio manager, sold his stake in Forest earlier this year but is weighing whether to buy the stock again now that Icahn is involved. Richter said he would hope the famed investor could cut costs or buy back more shares.  “Forest is kind of charging down this same-as-it-ever-was path,” Richter said. Icahn’s entry could mean “a more fiscally responsible, shareholder-friendly posture and that’s why I’m intrigued with it again.”  Solomon is also fighting the potential exclusion by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Inspector General. An OIG spokeswoman said no decision had been made.  A Freedom of Information Act request by Reuters for information about the case was denied by the OIG, which cited the fact that it is “an open and ongoing investigation.”  Icahn has not yet demanded Solomon’s ouster. But he has criticized the company’s strategy for dealing with the Lexapro expiration, pointed to its share price decline over the past seven years and questioned Solomon’s stock sales.  While Icahn has tried to engineer the sale of many of the biotech companies in which he has become active, analysts are skeptical that Forest is a legitimate takeover target.  Some believe the company’s emphasis on primary care markets would not appeal to large drugmakers more interested in specialty areas, while Forest’s tangle of partnerships on many of its licensed drugs could complicate an acquisition.  The board, however, may be vulnerable. Aside from Solomon, 84-year-old William Candee has served as a director since 1959, while two other board members have served since 1977, according to the company’s preliminary proxy filing.  Icahn’s involvement may also have a role in succession planning. Forest in November promoted four executives, including David Solomon, the company’s senior vice president for corporate development and strategic planning.  After Forest’s Chief Operating Officer Lawrence Olanoff retired last year, some shareholders are concerned that Solomon is grooming his son for the top job, Sanderson said.  “While David may be fully capable, I think investors just don’t like the looks of that, and David has not been a visible operating officer of the company,” Sanderson said.

3,BIIB,"Sanofi sells skin unit, MS drug results underwhelm","PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) plans to sell its Dermik skincare business to Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) for $425 million in cash, the latest drug giant to move to shed non-core assets.  The group said separately on Monday that late-stage tests on its Lemtrada experimental multiple sclerosis (MS) drug were “positive,” although analysts viewed the results as underwhelming. Sanofi inherited Lemtrada through the purchase of U.S. biotech firm Genzyme.  Sanofi had stated previously that it planned to divest its dermatology business in the United States and Canada, whose brands include acne treatment BenzaClin and the anti-face wrinkle injection Sculptra.  “Our strategy is based upon our growth platforms and innovation,” Sanofi Chief Executive Christopher Viehbacher said in a statement. “This divestiture allows us to rationalize our portfolio and improve focus on our core businesses.”  Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said the deal added another strong dermatology franchise to the Canadian company’s business, giving it opportunities to leverage the combined portfolios in current markets and expand into new territories. Valeant shares rose 0.8 percent in early trade.  The sale reflects wider moves by major pharma groups to ditch non-core assets.  Pfizer (PFE.N) said last week it might sell or spin off its animal health and nutrition units — businesses valued at more than $16 billion — to focus on its main pharmaceutical business, while GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) is currently looking to sell a portfolio of over-the-counter products in an auction.  MS treatment Lemtrada is a key drug candidate at Sanofi’s Genzyme unit, with the fortunes of the drug closely watched by holders of Genzyme Contingent Value Rights GCVRZ.O issued to shareholders as part of the takeover deal.  In the latest Phase III clinical trial, Lemtrada reduced the rate of relapses by 55 percent compared to Merck KGaA’s (MRCG.DE) widely used drug Rebif.  Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark said the result was comparable to the 52 percent relapse rate reduction that Novartis’s NOVN.VX Gilenya produced versus Biogen Idec’s (BIIB.O) Avonex but “noticeably less impressive” than the 74 percent reduction Lemtradahad achieved in a Phase II study.  Furthermore, the Phase III trial was unable to provide evidence of a significant impact on disability in MS sufferers. Sanofi said this reflected the fact very few patients accumulated disability at the rate expected from previous clinical trials.  Genzyme CVRs, which are traded on Nasdaq, lost 7.5 percent of their value by 1355 GMT.  The results of another Phase III study to compare Lemtrada with Rebif in MS patients who have relapsed while on therapy are expected to be available in the fourth quarter.  The company expects to file for U.S. and European Union approval of Lemtrada in early 2012 and has been granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Deutsche’s Clark said he currently forecast risk-adjusted 2015 sales for Lemtrada of only 180 million euros ($261 million), or less than 1 percent of Sanofi’s revenue, reflecting scepticism about the product’s prospects in an increasingly competitive MS market.  Sanofi shares were 1.7 percent in afternoon dealings in Paris. They are up 16 percent this year.

5,BIIB,"Analysis: Biotech buys seen in cancer, immunology, neurology","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Biotech companies focused on cancer treatments are some of the hottest acquisition targets in the drug industry, growing in value with novel drugs that have the potential for high price tags.  Other takeover candidates include companies with promising drugs for immunological or neurological disorders  The group already has lofty valuations, partly fueled by takeover speculation. But they could still command premiums as high as 30 to 40 percent from larger drugmakers pressed to find new growth, according to investment bankers and industry sources.  “We have seen some very successful oncology drugs,” said Fariba Ghodsian, chief investment officer at hedge fund DAFNA Capital. “Novel drugs with novel targets are in demand.”  Current takeover candidates — all of which operate at a loss — include Dendreon DNDN.O, Pharmacyclics PCYC.O, Synta Pharmaceuticals SNTA.O, Threshold Pharmaceuticals THLD.O, Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O) and Exelixis (EXEL.O), analysts and industry bankers said.  “Over the next year or two, you’d be right on at least half of these names (getting sold),” said one investment banker who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  Past successes in oncology-related deals include Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) 2009 purchase of Medarex, which has yielded the first successful treatment for melanoma, but the field is riddled with risk when it comes to the actual value of medical breakthroughs and regulatory scrutiny.  Seattle Genetics is a case in point. Shares in the company are up 32 percent this year, on hopes for its experimental drug to treat two rare types of blood cancer, compared with an 11 percent gain for the Amex Biotechnology Index. The medicine, Adcetris, is up for review this week by U.S. health regulators who cautioned on Tuesday it may be suitable for a smaller-than-expected patient group.  “Seattle Genetics I feel is very highly valued,” Ghodsian said, adding that because the drug would be the company’s first commercial product, potential acquirers are likely to hold off until they see how it does in the marketplace.  Another cancer drug developer with an expensive share price is Dendreon, which last year launched sales of Provenge, a novel vaccine treatment for prostate cancer that costs $93,000 per year. The company’s shares have gained 10 percent in 2011.  “They have strong pricing power with Provenge,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “A deal could hit the bottom line (of an acquirer) a lot quicker than some of the other firms out there.”  Ghodsian said Dendreon will also likely “have to show that the launch is going really well for a period of time,” before any buyers step up.  The allure of new cancer drugs is high — growth in the global oncology market is expected to be twice that of the overall pharmaceutical market, reaching up to $80 billion in sales by 2012, according to IMS Health.  The drug research firm also estimates that $25.4 billion in U.S. drug sales are at risk of generic competition this year as patents expire on iconic drug brands like Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) Lipitor or Bristol and Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) Plavix.  At the same time, large drug makers are cutting research and development, giving them a greater appetite for buying products with significant sales potential.  In addition to cancer, Alzheimer’s, rheumatoid arthritis and other “old age ailments” are cornerstone areas that all big pharma need to have more exposure to, bankers said.  Targets range from Biogen Idec (BIIB.O), with a price-to-earnings ratio near 25, to smaller companies like InterMune ITMN.O, which trades at around 17 times trailing 12-month earnings. Shares in the S&P 500 trade, on average, at around 16 times earnings.  Conover said Biogen is an attractive buyout candidate given its relatively robust drug development pipeline combined with the profit-boost of existing products like multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri.  “There is at least a 30 percent chance of Biogen being taken out in the next three years,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said, citing the company’s diversified product lines and capacity for manufacturing biotech drugs.  Full data from a key trial of the company’s experimental MS drug, BG-12, will be presented this fall. Positive initial results, announced in April, sent Biogen shares up as much as 24 percent to an all-time high.  Two other biotechs with recently launched drugs — Human Genome Sciences HGSI.O with lupus treatment Benlysta and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX.O) with hepatitis drug Incivek — have new drugs that will define their value.  “They have to prove that they can deliver on the blockbuster potential of these franchises,” said RBC’s Yee.  He named Pharmasset VRUS.O as another potential buyout target involved in development of hepatitis drugs.  Ghodsian cited InterMune, which saw its pulmonary fibrosis drug Esbriet approved by European regulators in March, as a strong takeover candidate, even though the company said in April that it was not considering a sale.  “The feedback from physicians is that it (Esbriet) will be used extensively in Europe,” she said. “The valuation is relatively low.” InterMune is conducting a separate pivotal trial of the drug for review by U.S. regulators.

6,BIIB,Forest pushes new board members in fight vs Icahn,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N said on Monday it plans to nominate a 10-person board slate that includes three new members at its shareholder meeting, as the drugmaker fends off a challenge from billionaire investor Carl Icahn.  In addition to seven incumbents, Forest plans to nominate Christopher Coughlin, former chief financial officer of Tyco International Ltd TYC.N; Gerald Lieberman, former president of AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB.N); and Brenton Saunders, chief executive officer of eye-care company Bausch & Lomb. Previously, Forest’s board has had nine members.  William Candee, a board member since 1959, and George Cohan, a director since 1977, will not stand for reelection at the meeting, which will be held August 18.  The U.S. drugmaker, with a market value of about $11 billion, also urged shareholders to reject the four nominees from Icahn, who has built a roughly 7 percent stake in the company to make him its fourth-largest shareholder.  In a letter to shareholders, Forest said Icahn’s nominees are “far less qualified than our slate” and said two of Icahn’s nominees were “hopelessly conflicted” because they serve on boards of biotech companies that have potentially competing products.  According to Forest’s proxy filing, Forest approached Icahn on July 12 about a possible settlement to avoid a proxy fight. The company said it told Icahn it would be adding several new nominees and might be willing to offer him “input” with regard to one of them. Icahn rejected the proposal, according to the proxy.  Icahn did not immediately return a request for a comment. He previously told Reuters, in response to the possibility that he might only gain one seat on the board, that his group deserved more presence given his track record in boosting value at other biopharmaceutical companies, such as ImClone, Genzyme and Biogen-Idec Inc (BIIB.O), and that he believed shareholders would support him.  Forest shares were off 2.4 percent to $37.55 in Monday afternoon trading, a compared with a roughly 1 percent drop for the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX.  Irina Rivkind, an analyst with investment bank Duncan-Williams, said the stock was down because some shareholders might be hoping for Icahn’s involvement and are concerned that following Monday’s announcement it could be more difficult to elect his board picks than expected.  Forest CEO and Chairman Howard Solomon, who has led the company for 34 years, had been expected to hear calls from shareholders for some fresh perspective on the board in the wake of Icahn’s challenge.  “Shareholders have been waiting for a shake-up for some time,” Rivkind said. Forest’s new nominees, if elected, “may not represent a sufficiently bold shift in strategy or direction to assuage shareholders. I do think it is a step in the right direction, however.”  Solomon has become more vulnerable to attack as Forest struggles to address future revenue holes from top drugs going off patent and as the U.S. government threatens sanctions against him personally.  U.S. regulators are weighing whether to bar Solomon from participating in federal healthcare programs after his company last year agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $313 million to resolve charges over improper marketing of several drugs.  Icahn criticized the board for spending money to back Solomon against the government and sued to get access to details of the case.  Company shares are worth about half of what they were at their height in 2004 and a third less than peak 2007 levels, though they had begun to rebound before Icahn made his move.  To replace revenue declines when its top-selling Lexapro antidepressant loses patent protection early next year, Forest has been licensing or buying rights to products in late-stage development — its long-held strategy under Solomon.  In its letter to shareholders, Forest said it will have nine products launching between 2008 and 2013 and six more now in Phase II/III development expected to reach the market after 2014.

Forest CEO and Chairman Howard Solomon, who has led the company for 34 years, had been expected to hear calls from shareholders for some fresh perspective on the board in the wake of Icahn’s challenge. [ID:nN1E7671L5]   “Shareholders have been waiting for a shake-up for some time,” Rivkind said. Forest’s new nominees, if elected, “may not represent a sufficiently bold shift in strategy or direction to assuage shareholders. I do think it is a step in the right direction, however.”   Solomon has become more vulnerable to attack as Forest struggles to address future revenue holes from top drugs going off patent and as the U.S. government threatens sanctions against him personally.   U.S. regulators are weighing whether to bar Solomon from participating in federal healthcare programs after his company last year agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $313 million to resolve charges over improper marketing of several drugs.   Icahn criticized the board for spending money to back Solomon against the government and sued to get access to details of the case.   Company shares are worth about half of what they were at their height in 2004 and a third less than peak 2007 levels, though they had begun to rebound before Icahn made his move.   To replace revenue declines when its top-selling Lexapro antidepressant loses patent protection early next year, Forest has been licensing or buying rights to products in late-stage development — its long-held strategy under Solomon.   In its letter to shareholders, Forest said it will have nine products launching between 2008 and 2013 and six more now in Phase II/III development expected to reach the market after 2014.

8,BIIB,UPDATE 1-Biogen wins conditional approval for MS drug in EU," * Europe gives conditional approval to Fampyra   * Regulators recommend Biogen conduct additional study   * Study to evaluate safety, efficacy over the long term   BOSTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) said on Monday that European regulators have granted conditional approval for the company to sell Fampyra, a drug to improve walking ability in patients with multiple sclerosis.   The decision follows a recommendation in favor of approval made in May by the European Medicines Agency, which advises the European Commission on whether to approve new drugs.   Conditional approval is granted to drugs in which the benefit is seen to outweigh the risk but where additional information is needed to confirm that view. A conditional approval is renewable annually.   As part of the conditions of the approval, regulators have recommended Biogen carry out an additional study to discover more about the drug’s benefits and safety over the long term.   Biogen acquired European rights to Fampyra from Acorda Therapeutics Inc (ACOR.O). The drug was approved in the United States in January 2010, where it is sold under the brand Ampyra.   In January 2011, European advisers rejected the drug, saying they were not convinced it conferred a clinically meaningful benefit.   Analysts currently see Fampyra/Ampyra reaching total sales of around $600 million by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma consensus forecasts.   Under terms of their agreement, Biogen paid $110 million upfront for the European rights to the drug, and agreed to pay up to $400 million more in milestone payments. Acorda will also receive a double-digit royalty. European approval triggers a $25 million milestone payment to Acorda.

9,BIIB,Biogen net falls; Tysabri sales top expectations,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) reported higher-than-expected sales of its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri in the second quarter as the net number of new users grew at the highest rate in more than a year.  The strong Tysabri sales helped push Biogen’s revenue forecast up slightly for the year, to the low to mid-single digits from a prior forecast of flat to low-single digits.  The company’s shares rose 1.2 percent to $105.22 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.  Biogen said its second-quarter net income fell about 2 percent to $288 million, or $1.18 a share, hurt by a charge of 15 cents a share due to arbitration between its partner Roche Holding AGROG.VX and Hoechst GmbH. Biogen and Roche share profits from the cancer drug Rituxan.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.36 a share. Analysts on average expected earnings, excluding items, of $1.37, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue was flat at $1.2 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $1.18 billion.  “Overall, second-quarter results were better than expectations, with a good quarter for Tysabri,” JPMorgan analyst Geoff Meacham said in a research note.  Global sales of Tysabri, which is administered once a month through an infusion, rose 31 percent to $389 million. The drug faces increasing competition from new products entering the market, particularly from oral drugs such as Novartis AG’s NOVN.VX Gilenya, and laquinimod, an experimental pill being developed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  (TEVA.TA)TEVA.O  Biogen is developing its own oral multiple sclerosis drug, BG-12, which, if approved, could help the company take the lead in the oral MS drug market.  Promising data from a clinical trial of BG-12 sent Biogen’s shares soaring as much as 24 percent in April, helping drive a gain of 98 percent since last August, when the shares hit a year low of $53.14.  The share increase has also been driven by a structuring initiated by the company’s chief executive, George Scangos, who took over the top job a year ago. The company has cut jobs, streamlined its research programs and consolidated certain facilities.  Biogen said it expects sales of Tysabri, which the company sells in conjunction with Irish drugmaker Elan Corp Plc ELN.I to remain competitive as a treatment for patients who have failed to respond to other therapies.  Tysabri was temporarily withdrawn from the market in 2005 after being linked with a potentially deadly brain infection known as PML. It was reintroduced in 2006 with stricter safety warnings, but sales have been held back.  Revenue from Tysabri to Biogen rose 28 percent in the quarter to $281 million.  As of the end of June, Biogen said about 61,500 patients were using the drug worldwide.  Paul Clancy, Biogen’s chief financial officer, said in an interview that the stronger-than-expected sales of Tysabri were driven in part by the growing adoption among physicians of a test that screens patients for the JC virus. The virus is thought to cause PML.  “The interest in risk stratification as a tool seems to be gaining momentum,” Clancy said.  Biogen is allowed to promote the test to physicians in Europe since regulators have allowed the company to note on the drug’s label that the presence of the JC virus in a patient’s blood is considered a risk factor for PML. The United States has not yet given such an approval, though patients are able to be tested as part of an ongoing clinical trial.  Still, Clancy said that for the next few quarters he remains “in a cautious mode” when thinking about Tysabri’s growth potential. Over the long term, he said, the company is optimistic that growth will be strong.  Sales of the company’s cancer drug Rituxan fell 29 percent to $216 million in the quarter. Sales of the drug were reduced by $50 million due to the Roche arbitration.  Sales of the company’s older multiple sclerosis drug Avonex rose 5 percent to $659 million.  The company maintained its 2011 forecast for earnings per share above $5.70, excluding one-time items.

11,BIIB,Lawmakers may relax FDA drug conflict rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers likely will change the criteria for advisers reviewing new medicines next year because of complaints that the rules meant to prevent conflicts of interest make it harder to find real experts.  Congressional lawmakers may require the Food and Drug Administration to relax the rules that bar advisers from reviewing a drug if they have even indirect financial ties to related manufacturers, as part of an FDA funding bill.  Senators raised the issue during a hearing last week at the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.  “Based on today’s hearing and the comments from Senators Franken and Enzi, I think there is a good chance that this issue could end up in the final FDA user fee bill,” said a congressional staff member familiar with the matter. The staff member was referring to Mike Enzi, the top Republican on the committee and Al Franken, a Democratic committee member.  Fees from makers of drugs and medical devices provide more than a third of the FDA’s funding, which means that the bill often serves as a vehicle for broader FDA-related changes.  The agency often must delay panel meetings while it searches for experts without conflicts, lawmakers and FDA officials say. Top doctors are usually the ones drugmakers hire as speakers or consultants.  “We have had difficulty in recruiting highly qualified people. And we’ve had delays in having panels because of this,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA’s drugs center, told a House of Representatives hearing earlier this month.  The result is that 23 percent of FDA advisory panels have vacancies, more than double the agency’s stated goal, according to the FDA’s quarterly report at the end of May.  The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisers, but it usually does, leading to scrutiny of who is providing advice.  The FDA tightened guidelines in 2007 to minimize industry ties that could sway a panelist’s view, partly inspired by the scandal with Merck’s pain reliever Vioxx.  Ten of the 32 panelists advising the FDA on the drug consulted for drugmakers. Nine of the 10 recommended putting the drug back on the market after it was pulled in 2004 over concerns about heart risk.  The restrictions go too far, say lawmakers who want the FDA to approve more new medicines, in part because they promote American jobs.  “No longer can we deny experts simply because they have ties to industry,” said Georgia Representative Phil Gingrey during a House of Representative hearing on FDA funding last month. The committee’s chairman, Fred Upton from Michigan, called the conflict of interest rules “rigid and unrealistic.”  Industry executives, who want the FDA to speed drug approvals, also support relaxing the rules. Biogen Idec CEO George Scangos said the guidelines “exclude a lot of people who would be the best qualified.”  Dr. Abraham Thomas, a specialist in diabetes, obesity and bone and mineral disorders, would seem to be the perfect expert to advise the FDA about a new AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb diabetes pill, which was also tied to some cancer risks and liver and bone injury.  But Thomas works at Henry Ford Hospital, which received as much as $50,000 to study a competing diabetes medicine.  Under the guidelines, even indirect financial links to a competitor barred Dr. Thomas from participating in an advisory panel for the diabetes pill, called dapagliflozin, without a waiver. The FDA decided to grant him one of six waivers given this year, citing his expertise.  Limits on the number of waivers the agency can issue mean the FDA must exclude some experts, which critics say means settling for advice from second-tier specialists who make uninformed decisions.  Ira Loss of Washington Analysis calls the current rules “overkill” for lumping together those with a direct financial relationship to a company or competitor with those who have more indirect links, such as Dr. Thomas.  “If a doctor is involved in a clinical trial, he shouldn’t be allowed on the panel,” he said. “But the rules about the institution where you work. I think that’s ridiculous. ... The result is that you have people on the advisory committee who have no idea what they’re talking about.”  Others say that the agency is not looking hard enough.  A March study from the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine found that 44 percent of cardiologists do not have industry ties.  The study “flat out dismisses this idea that there are no experts who don’t have relationships,” said Eric Campbell, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and one of the study’s authors.  “There are lots of people out there who are smart and who don’t have conflicts of interest,” said Sid Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. “It just takes much more work for the FDA to find them. But the result is you have much less tainting of the panel discussion.  Advocates of stronger rules say the agency lacks the power to force full disclosure, and defines conflicts too narrowly. Members with past financial ties to a company are not considered under the rules, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families.  “Those ties affect their voting, whether or not they currently are on the payroll,” she wrote in an email. “Research shows that even small gifts, such as an expensive meal or a $500 honorarium, will affect how a doctor or faculty member feels about a company and could affect how they vote.”  Consumer advocates and lawmakers are more likely to agree when it comes to reviewing drugs for rare diseases.  “If waivers need to be granted, we hope that the FDA will limit them to rare and neglected diseases where there are truly few experts available,” Consumers Union wrote in comments to the FDA’s conflicts of interest regulation.  FDA Commissioner Hamburg said calls to relax some conflict of interest rules were “a valid concern.  “Especially when you’re talking about rare and unusual diseases, getting new experts is more challenging, as many were involved in the development or trials of drugs under consideration,” she told the Senate hearing last week.  “I’m not surprised this issue keeps coming up,” Hamburg said after the hearing.  (Corrects 11th paragraph to show that 10 of the 32 panelists  consulted for drugmakers, not “the drugmaker”. And that nine of those 10 recommended putting Vioxx back on the market, not all 10, as first sent)  ",8012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fda-bias/lawmakers-may-relax-fda-drug-conflict-rules-idUSTRE7703R320110801
12,BIIB,Actelion drug cuts brain lesions in MS patients,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Actelion’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug ponesimod met its main goal in a mid-stage trial, giving the Swiss biotech’s pipeline a much-needed boost.  Actelion has had a bumpy ride after a string of product setbacks last year, and it has faced tough criticism from its main shareholder Elliott Advisors, which urged the group to consider putting itself up for sale.  Europe’s largest pure-play biotech group said on Tuesday its selective S1P1 receptor agonist, ponesimod, cut the number of new active inflammatory lesions in the brain in a Phase IIb dose-finding study in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  At 0856 GMT, Actelion shares were down 0.3 percent, outperforming a 1.2 percent drop in the European healthcare index.  “The product, assuming competitive efficacy, has a profile that would position it well in the market and as such we believe it has blockbuster potential,” Nomura analyst Samir Devani said.  Actelion said 464 patients were enrolled, making this the largest ever dose-finding study conducted in this autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system.  Actelion said it would now move ponesimod to the final stage of clinical development, and analysts at Jefferies said the mid-stage data could pave the way for a partnership deal.  “Given the number of emerging oral MS drugs, together with Actelion’s relative inexperience conducting large pivotal CNS trials and finite financial resources, we believe a partnership deal for ponesimod could be announced within the next 6-12 months now that the Phase IIb data are in-house,” the Jefferies analysts said.  Novartis has seen strong demand for its recently launched its MS pill Gilenya, which rivals older treatments such as Biogen Idec’s Tysabri.  Biogen is now developing its own oral MS drug, BG-12, which, if approved, could help it to take the lead in the oral MS drug market. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is also developing experimental pill laquinimod.  Actelion is trying to cut its dependence on key drug Tracleer, which treats a rare heart and lung disorder and rakes in more than $1 billion a year, but is now starting to face competition from Gilead Sciences’ Letairis.  Investors are now awaiting data from a phase II trial of macitentan in lung fibrosis for more insight into its safety profile. Macitentan is being billed as Tracleer’s successor, and results of a late-stage study in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are due in the first half of 2012.

13,BIIB,UPDATE 2-Glass Lewis backs one Icahn nominee to Forest board," * Glass Lewis backs Richard Mulligan for Forest board   * Says dubious of board’s ability to enact reforms  (Adds details from Glass Lewis report)   NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Proxy voting advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co said it is backing one of Carl Icahn’s four nominees to the Forest Laboratories FRX.N board of directors.   Glass Lewis issued a report in which it recommended that Forest shareholders vote for Richard Mulligan on the proxy card that includes the Icahn nominees, The Icahn Group announced in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.   Forest has been trying to fend off a proxy challenge from the billionaire investor, who owns about a 7 percent stake in the drugmaker, and has urged shareholders to vote for its slate of directors and reject Icahn’s nominees.   “We believe the dissidents have identified several noteworthy issues regarding the company’s overall performance,” the report dated Aug. 8, which was obtained by Reuters, said.   “We believe that shareholders should support the nomination of Richard Mulligan,” the Glass Lewis report said.   “Mr. Mulligan currently serves on the boards of Biogen Idec (BIIB.O) and Enzon (Pharmaceuticals) ENZN.O, both of which are companies where the Icahn Group has sought and successfully obtained board seats. We note that share prices of Biogen and Enzon have both increased since Mr. Mulligan became involved with those respective boards,” the independent proxy advisory firm said.   It said in putting up Kenneth Goodman, Forest had failed to nominate a truly independent candidate to oversee its board.   “We believe that the Forest Labs board has had ample opportunities to identify and appoint an independent chairman or presiding director. However, we see that the incumbent directors instead appointed a presiding director whose independence is highly questionable,” the Glass Lewis report said.   It went on to say that the Forest choice, “leaves us feeling highly dubious of the board’s ability to enact truly positive corporate governance reforms and only serves to drive home the Icahn Group’s argument that the company’s board is filled with entrenched directors.”   Glass Lewis noted that the average board tenure of the incumbent directors is 17 years, and that board tenure of the four directors that the Icahn group is seeking to remove is at least 13 years.   “We further note that one dissident nominee would represent 10 percent of the total expected board seats, which we believe is reasonable given the Icahn Group’s current ownership stake in the company.   While admitting that one dissident director would wield limited power, Glass Lewis said that he along with the board-nominated independent directors, “should help provide the company with fresh perspective.”  (Reporting by Bill Berkrot, editing by Bernard Orr and Carol Bishopric)   ",8092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/forest-icahn/update-2-glass-lewis-backs-one-icahn-nominee-to-forest-board-idUSN1E7781Q320110809
14,BIIB,"UPDATE 2-Biogen, Abbott MS drug hits mid-stage study goals"," * Relapse rates in line with newer treatments   * Side effects a concern, analysts say   * Biogen shares up 2.8 percent, Abbott little changed   (Adds details from study, analyst comments, shares)   By Lewis Krauskopf   NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) and Abbott Laboratories Inc’s (ABT.N) experimental once-monthly injected drug for multiple sclerosis achieved the main goals in a mid-stage trial, the companies said on Tuesday.   Analysts said the drug, daclizumab, showed effectiveness on a par with some of the new medicines for the often disabling neurological disease, but that some of the side effects, such as infections, were worrisome.   A wave of new drugs, including several oral treatments, has brought some optimism for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, which has no cure, while generating fierce competition in the pharmaceutical industry.   Daclizumab was injected once every four weeks in the Phase IIb study of 600 patients.   According to initial results, daclizumab significantly reduced annualized relapse rates by 54 percent for patients on the 150 milligram dose and 50 percent for those on the 300 mg dose compared with those taking a placebo.   That performance puts daclizumab’s effectiveness in line with Novartis AG’s NOVN.VX newly approved Gilenya and Biogen’s experimental drug BG-12, both of which are pills, but below the roughly 67 percent relapse rate for Tysabri, sold by Biogen and Elan Corp ELN.I, analysts said.   Serious infections occurred in 2 percent of patients on daclizumab compared to none taking the placebo, while more patients in the treatment group had high liver function abnormality tests — 4 percent versus less than 1 percent in the placebo group. Two deaths occurred with patients in treatment arms of the study.   JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham said the safety data were a concern and that he wanted to see more results from the study.   While the data were better than his expectations on the efficacy side, Meacham said in a research note, “it is not yet clear where in the treatment paradigm the agent would fit, particularly with an influx of oral agents entering the MS market.”   Leerink Swann analyst Joshua Schimmer estimated that the drug could garner peak annual sales of $400 million to $500 million.   Patients are currently being enrolled in a late-stage Phase III study of the drug. The companies expect to seek approval for the medicine in 2014, an Abbott spokeswoman said.   Abbott gained the rights to daclizumab when it bought Facet Biotech for more than $700 million last year. Biogen had been developing the drug with Facet, and had earlier failed in a hostile bid for the smaller biotech company.   Biogen shares were up 2.8 percent at $90.47 in morning trading on Nasdaq. Abbott shares were unchanged at $48.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.  (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Gerald E.

15,BIIB,Scientists unravel genetic clues to multiple sclerosis,"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have found 29 new genetic variants linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) and say the findings should help drugmakers focus treatment research on precise areas of the immune system.  In a study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, researchers said the newly-found links point to the idea that T-cells — a type of white blood cell responsible for mounting an immune response — and chemicals called interleukins play a key role in the development of the debilitating disease.  Drugs in development that target the immune system include rituximab, sold under the brand name Rituxan by Roche and Biogen to fight leukemia, Tysabri from Biogen and Elan, Lemtrada, sold as Campath by Sanofi’s unit Genzyme for cancer, and Abbott and Biogen’s Zenapax or daclizumab.  “We have implicated genes that are highly relevant to the actions of those drugs,” said Alastair Compston of Cambridge University, who co-led the study. “It is now clear that multiple sclerosis is primarily an immunological disease. This is the way to nail this disease and get on top of it.”  Mid-stage trial data for daclizumab released on Tuesday showed the drug on a par with other new medicines for MS, but some of he side-effects were worrisome.  Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common neurological conditions among young adults, affecting around 2.5 million people worldwide.  It occurs when the protective coating, known as the myelin sheath, around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord begins to break down, slowing the brain’s communication with the rest of the body.  The affected pathways — responsible for everyday activities such as seeing, walking, feeling, thinking and controlling the bowel and bladder — lose the ability to function properly and are eventually destroyed.  In a second study in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Genetics on Wednesday, researchers found that many of the genes linked to MS are also linked to other autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s disease and Type 1 diabetes. This also points to potential new uses for existing drugs in development, they said.  “We have known for some time that many devastating diseases of the immune system must have common genetic causes,” said Chris Cotsapas of Yale University in the United States, who led the PLoS study. “Now we have the outline of a map that tells us where we can look for common treatments.”  Most people who develop MS experience their first symptoms in their 20s and 30s, but Compston and colleagues told a briefing in London the trigger for the disease could happen in early childhood when genetic risk factors coincide with some as yet unknown environmental factor.  For their study, Compston and Peter Donnelly of Oxford University worked with some 250 other researchers and studied the DNA from 9,772 people with multiple sclerosis and compared it with a control group of more than 17,300 healthy people.  Their analysis confirmed 23 previously known genetic links and identified another 29 new genetic variants.  Experts think both genetic and environmental factors are equally important in determining who is likely to develop MS, and taken together, the known genetic variants probably explain about 20 percent of the genetic links, they said.  Previous research has suggested a link between Vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of MS. Compston’s team said that along with the many genes which play a role in the immune system, they had also found two involved in the metabolism of Vitamin D — which mostly comes from sunlight — lending weight to a possible link between genes and the environment.

16,BIIB,Forest Labs wins ISS backing in Icahn board battle,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N won backing from proxy advisory firm ISS for all 10 of its board nominees, dimming the chances that billionaire investor Carl Icahn will win a significant presence on the drugmaker’s board.  The support for Forest comes after another proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, on Tuesday recommended shareholders support one of the four nominees put forth by Icahn. Still, ahead of the August 18 shareholder meeting, Icahn was gearing up for the fight, disclosing he had increased his stake in Forest to 9.2 percent.  “I’ve always thought it was kind of a long shot to get board members on there,” Jefferies & Co analyst Corey Davis said. “The ISS recommendation probably seals it.”  One of Icahn’s major arguments for change weakened after the U.S. government decided last week not to pursue efforts to bar longtime Forest Chief Executive Howard Solomon from participation in federal healthcare programs. The government had initially moved against Solomon after the company settled federal charges last year of improperly marketing several drugs.  “The Street believes that Forest will be able to keep all the slate of directors they have nominated or they currently have and Icahn doesn’t have a great chance,” Collins Stewart analyst Louise Chen said.  Icahn was not immediately available for comment.  In addition to the government probe, Forest became vulnerable to an activist investor because it faces steep revenue declines as its products lose patent protection, a fate awaiting most of the pharmaceutical industry.  Revenue at the New York-based company, with a market value of about $10 billion, is projected to drop by about one-fourth after its Lexapro antidepressant loses patent protection early next year.  Company shares are worth less than half of what they were at their height in 2004 and about 40 percent less than peak 2007 levels, though they had begun to rebound before Icahn made his move.  After Icahn began his challenge in June, Forest named three new nominees to the board, while saying that two longtime members would not stand for reelection.  “There are benefits to their involvement that are still there even if they don’t get board seats,” Davis said of Icahn’s group.  Thursday’s report from Institutional Shareholder Services found that Icahn had pointed to some legitimate concerns about corporate governance and Forest’s share price performance, but not enough to upend the board.  “Despite these concerns about how attentive the incumbent directors have been to the practice and responsibility of director independence, we do not find, on balance, that the dissident has made a compelling case that change is needed at the board level,” the ISS report said.  The report also found “little evidence to support the dissidents’ contention that the board has made major strategic missteps in planning for the upcoming patent cliffs.”  Glass Lewis said on Tuesday that shareholders should back one of Icahn’s nominees — Richard Mulligan, a Harvard Medical School genetics professor who sits on the boards of biotech companies Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) and Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc ENZN.O.  An Icahn victory next week could boost the stock, as investors may feel that he would agitate for a sale of the company. Duncan Williams analyst Irina Rivkind said she believed that that any win by Icahn would “result in an upward movement in the stock.”  Chen, however, said Icahn might need to get all four of his nominees on the board to spark a significant stock move.  “He’d have to get some meaningful amount of coverage,” Chen said. “I think it’d have to be all or nothing.”  Icahn’s previous stake of about 7 percent made him the second-largest Forest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. With his increased stake, Icahn would still appear to rank second behind Wellington Management Co, which had a 12.2 percent stake, according to the data.  Forest shares were off 2.8 percent at $33.78 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly greater than the drop for the broader market.

19,BIIB,UPDATE 2-Forest Labs fends off Icahn at annual meeting,"   * Shareholders approve Forest board in Icahn proxy fight   * Board includes three new members   * Forest shares fall 4 pct, in line with market drop  (Adds comments from Icahn, adds analyst comments, details of meeting, updates share price)   By Lewis Krauskopf   NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N won its showdown with activist investor Carl Icahn on Thursday, saying shareholders backed the company’s slate of 10 board members over nominees proposed by the billionaire.   Forest was in a strong position to garner support for its entire slate after it won backing last week from influential proxy advisory firm ISS, although some company-watchers had said Icahn could secure a seat for one of his four nominees.   Shares of Forest were down 4.1 percent at $33.05 in afternoon trading, in line with the decline for the broader market.   Icahn has built up the second-largest stake in Forest, according to Thomson Reuters data. The investor, who has won representation at several biotechnology companies, has criticized Forest’s governance practices and preparation for patent expirations for its biggest medicines.   Forest’s slate included three new board members nominated after Icahn announced his challenge. Two longtime directors did not stand for re-election.   Alexander Denner, one of Icahn’s nominees, said at the meeting that the alternate slate would have brought “something to the table” and that the investor had been able to work with other companies to help bring value.   Forest Chief Executive and Chairman Howard Solomon, who presided over the event, responded by saying the company would be in touch to set up a meeting.   The board sweep represents a new victory for Solomon, who has led the company since 1977. Earlier this month, the U.S. government dropped plans to bar Solomon from doing business with federal healthcare programs, weakening a key plank in Icahn’s argument for change.   The preliminary margin in favor of Forest’s nominees ranged from three-to-one to five-to-one, excluding Icahn’s shares, according to a source familiar with the situation. A final count was expected by next week.   Icahn reported last week a stake of 9.2 percent, from about 7 percent in June. He ranks second behind Wellington Management, which has a 12.5 percent stake, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.   Even with the proxy fight behind it, Forest still faces challenges. Analysts expect revenue at the New York-based company to drop by about one-fourth after its Lexapro antidepressant loses patent protection early next year. Its Namenda Alzheimer’s drug will lose patent protection in 2015.   Forest has a market value of about $10 billion. Its shares are worth less than half of what they were at their height in 2004 and about 40 percent less than peak 2007 levels.   Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Gary Nachman said Forest is now less likely to change its strategy dramatically.   “Shareholders are concerned about the patent cliffs that are coming up and they want to see the company get more aggressive in different ways, but I don’t think Icahn was really offering a good solution at this point,” Nachman said.   ISS and another proxy adviser, Egan-Jones, backed Forest’s entire slate. Glass Lewis recommended Icahn nominee Richard Mulligan, a Harvard Medical School genetics professor who sits on the boards of biotech companies Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) and Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc. ENZN.O   Denner, a managing director at Icahn Partners, said that the ISS recommendation made it very difficult to win.   But he said Icahn’s challenge was responsible for the three new board members nominated by Forest and that “any time you run a proxy fight ... it puts pressure on the companies to think about their shareholders a little bit more clearly.”   He also compared the Forest outcome to that of Biogen. It took Icahn three years to win three seats on the board of the biotechnology company. In 2007, on his first try, he won none.   In a statement, Icahn said that “activism, especially in biotech, usually takes longer than you believe it will.” He cited Genzyme and ImClone — two companies that were eventually sold after Icahn’s involvement — as well as Biogen.   To replace its revenue declines, Forest has been licensing or buying rights to products in late-stage development — its long-held strategy under Solomon — touting the group of experimental and newly approved drugs as its “Next Nine.”   “There’s going to be a significant drop in earnings next year and the company is going to continue to spend at pretty high levels through it,” Nachman said. “So you have to have a lot of confidence that these new products are going to turn out to be pretty meaningful.”  (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Lisa Von Ahn and Matthew Lewis)   ",8182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/forestlaboratories/update-2-forest-labs-fends-off-icahn-at-annual-meeting-idUSN1E77H0QM20110818

21,BIIB,"Twice rejected, Icahn wants all Clorox board seats","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Carl Icahn wants to scrub the Clorox Co (CLX.N) board clean.  In a letter to Clorox on Friday, Icahn said he wants to nominate himself, his son and nine other people for election to the board at its next annual shareholder meeting.  Last month, the bleach maker’s board unanimously rejected two offers from the billionaire investor, who is Clorox’s largest shareholder.  The attempt to replace the entire board differs from tactics Icahn has used with other companies, where he targeted only a small number of seats. He nominated four people to Forest Laboratories Inc’s FRX.N then nine-member board in June. On Thursday, Forest Labs won its showdown with Icahn as its shareholders backed the company’s slate of 10 board members over the nominees Icahn proposed.  “People typically will nominate less than a majority slate so that they send a signal to the board and have an impact on the board to create value without seeking control,” said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.  “When you try to seek control, the focus becomes what you’ll do with control as opposed to the failings of the earlier management team.”  Clorox stood by the work its board has done, such as doubling the dividend in the past five years and pushing its household name brands to gain more market share than competitors in its categories over the last three years.  Icahn’s most recent offer to buy the company for $80 per share was rejected as “inadequate” by Clorox on July 26. Icahn already owns about 9.37 percent of Clorox’s shares.  “We believe that Mr. Icahn is nominating candidates solely to advance his own agenda,” said Clorox, noting that 10 of its 11 directors are independent and that all are elected annually.  The company, whose other products include Brita water filters, Burt’s Bees lotions, Glad bags and wraps and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, has not announced a date for its annual meeting. It is typically held in mid-November.  “His plans for the board are clear, but his plans to improve the company and shareholder value are still opaque,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj.  “We would like to see Icahn provide much more clarity to all shareholders on what he has in mind.”  Clorox shares were up 0.3 percent at $64.34 in afternoon trading, more than $15 below Icahn’s July 20 offer and below the stock’s closing price of $68.43 on July 14, the day before Icahn made public his first bid of $76.50 per share.  The shares have not hit even the first offer price, suggesting investors do not anticipate a deal.  When Icahn made his first offer, he suggested that some of Clorox’s rivals should buy the company for more than he was offering. No one has stepped up.  “We continue to believe there is little chance other strategic buyers for (Clorox) will emerge,” said Wells Fargo Securities analyst Tim Conder, who sees “little potential” for a bid above Icahn’s $80 offer.  Icahn would like to see his son Brett and nine other men on the board: A.B.

Brett Icahn, Schechter, Intrieri and Ninivaggi work for entities affiliated with Carl Icahn.  While Icahn’s latest attempt at Forest Labs fell short, he got seats on the boards of companies such as Mentor Graphics Corp MENT.O, Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO.O). He also urged Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc (MMI.N) to consider splitting off its patent business in July, weeks before Google Inc (GOOG.O) said on August 15 it would buy the company for $12.5 billion.

The company also said Shane Cooke, the company’s former chief financial officer, would retire from the board.   The announcement follows years of pressure from Elan investors who accused the board of lacking relevant expertise and independence.   Amid much battling, last September the company succeeded in forcing two directors who had challenged its transparency and corporate governance practices to quit the board.   Elan and Biogen jointly make and sell the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. During his time at Biogen, which culminated in becoming COO, Hasler served as head of international business overseeing the launch of Tysabri in Europe.   Elan’s relationship with Biogen has historically been troubled. Last July, a new chief executive, George Scangos, took over at Biogen.

25,BIIB,Analysis: Biogen investors place bets ahead of MS drug trial,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Over the past year, Biogen Idec Inc has given investors little to complain about. The biotechnology company, operating under new management, has restructured its operations, reported promising clinical trial data and seen its shares rise 72 percent.  The question is: can it hang onto its gains?  Much depends on the results, to be released within weeks, of a second, late-stage clinical trial of its experimental multiple sclerosis drug, BG-12.  Results from the first trial, known as DEFINE, were unexpectedly strong. If data from the second trial, known as CONFIRM, are similarly positive, Biogen’s shares could rise as much as 10 percent, analysts say. If it falls short of expectations, they could fall as much as 20 percent, according to some estimates.  Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system and can lead to numbness, loss of vision and paralysis. BG-12 is designed to treat relapsing-remitting MS, in which flare-ups are followed by periods of remission. About 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease.  Results of the DEFINE trial showed BG-12 cut the annualized relapse rate by 53 percent at two years versus those treated with a placebo. That compares favorably with the efficacy of a drug made by Novartis AG, Gilenya, that has shown a reduction in annualized relapse rates of about 54 percent.  Unlike most MS drugs, which are given by injection or infusion. Gilenya and BG-12 are both taken orally. Gilenya, given once a day, was approved in 2010. BG-12 will probably be given twice a day, but may have a more benign safety profile. That could help it gain an edge in the market if approved.  “Gilenya has the advantage of first-arrival and once-daily administration, but there is still some anxiety about the possibility of safety issues yet to emerge,” said Harry Tracy, a pharmaceutical industry consultant and publisher of NeuroPerspective, a monthly publication focusing on central nervous system disorders.  “Neurologists are going to be reluctant to switch people off injectables, but over the next few years, I expect Gilenya and BG-12 to become the preferred first drug options to be tried with newly diagnosed patients,” he said.  Some analysts expect BG-12 to generate more than $1 billion in annual sales.  “In our view, the biggest threat to BG-12 becoming a blockbuster is an unforeseen safety issue,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen and Company in a recent research note. He expects, however, that the CONFIRM safety profile will “remain essentially clean.”  The design of the CONFIRM trial is similar to that of DEFINE. DEFINE had 1,200 patients while CONFIRM has 1,400. The studies were run more or less contemporaneously and were conducted in similar geographies with the same entry criteria.  The main difference is that CONFIRM has a third arm — a group of patients taking Copaxone, a drug made by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. In a pivotal trial, Copaxone, which was approved in the United States 15 ago, was shown to reduce the annualized relapse rate by 29 percent. Analysts expect that rate to have improved over the years, potentially confounding results from CONFIRM.  “We expect comparator Copaxone to perform better than expected,” said Jim Birchenough, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, who advised clients in a recent research note to sell Biogen shares in advance of the results.  “We believe commercial expectations for Biogen Idec’s multiple sclerosis franchise, in particular for BG-12, have been overestimated and that risk to upcoming CONFIRM data has been underestimated.”  Weston, Massachusetts-based Biogen also makes the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri.  Biogen’s shares have risen 72 percent over the past 12 months and have roughly doubled since George Scangos took over as chief executive in July last year. By April this year, shortly before news emerged that results of the BG-12 trial were positive, they had risen to about $73, helped in part by a restructuring program. By the end of June they touched$109.52.  The stock has fallen back since then and was trading at about $99.40 on Thursday. The decline partly reflects concerns among some investors that CONFIRM may not live up to the promise of DEFINE.  Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said most analysts are expecting “generally good data” from CONFIRM though perhaps not as strong the 53 percent relapse rate reduction reported in DEFINE.”  “People expect a mid-40s percent reduction in annualized relapse rate,” he said. “If the number comes in above that consensus, the stock could go $10 higher.”  The best case scenario, to which he assigns a 20 percent probability, would be for the drug to show a relapse rate of 50 percent or higher versus placebo, and for Copaxone to show a relapse rate of 30 to 35 percent.  The most likely scenario, he says, and one to which he ascribes a 60-70 percent probability, is for BG-12 to show a relapse rate of between 40 and 49 percent versus placebo and for Copaxone to show a relapse reduction of 35 to 40 percent.  Yee assigns a 10 percent probability of BG-12 showing surprisingly negative data, but if it did, the stock could drop to below BG-12 levels, he said.  Douglas Williams, Biogen’s head of research and development, feels “confident going into the study, or as confident as you can feel without the data in your back pocket.”  Options traders are sounding an optimistic note too.  Traders have been purchasing Biogen calls — which give investors the right to buy stock at a fixed price up to a certain date — at a greater pace than puts, which give investors the right to sell at a preset price.  “This suggests there are some bullish bets coming in on Biogen ahead of the event,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.  Over the past 10 trading days, investors have bought 1.94 calls for every put as a new position on three U.S. options exchanges, according to Schaeffer's. That ratio is greater than 72 percent of the readings over the past year. (For a related graphic click on r.reuters.com/pus73s)  Biogen hopes to file for approval of BG-12 early next year.

Kingsley has served as Biogen’s senior vice president of U.S. commercial operations, responsible for marketing, sales, patient services, training and sales operations since January 2010.   Granata is leaving the company to “pursue other opportunities.” He had held the position for about a year and a half.   Before joining Biogen, Kingsley, 48, was senior vice president and general manager of gynecological surgical products at Hologic Inc (HOLX.O) and was division president, diagnostic products, at Cytyc Corp. Prior to that he was a partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Co, where he worked with biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies.   Weston, Massachusetts-based Biogen, which makes the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri, has implemented a series of restructuring moves over the past year or so that have cut costs and streamlined the company’s portfolio of experimental drugs.   “With (Kingsley’s) combination of strategic insight and operational expertise, I am confident he is the right person to build on the positive momentum in our global commercial business and prepare the organization for the potential launch of multiple products in the next several years,” George Scangos, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement.   The change comes as Biogen prepares for the potential launch of a new multiple sclerosis drug, currently known as BG-12, which some analysts expect could become the leading oral treatment for the disease.   Biogen’s shares closed on Wednesday at $95.04. They are down from a year high in June of $109.63.

28,BIIB,Biogen MS trial data reveals no safety surprises," * Details of DEFINE trial consistent with top-line data   * Safety profile encouraging, analysts say   * Results bode well for upcoming CONFIRM trial   By Toni Clarke   Oct 5 (Reuters) - Detailed data from a key trial of Biogen Idec Inc’s (BIIB.O) experimental multiple sclerosis drug BG-12 revealed no new safety concerns, and showed similar efficacy when given twice or three times a day, according to a summary of results to be presented at an upcoming conference.   Initial results from the trial, known as DEFINE, were released in April and showed the drug, when given twice a day, cut the annualized relapse rate by 53 percent at two years compared with placebo, and cut the rate of disability progression by 38 percent.   Biogen said at the time that the side effects were similar to those seen in an earlier, mid-stage trial, but did not elaborate.   Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system and can lead to numbness, paralysis and loss of vision. BG-12 is designed to treat relapsing-remitting MS, in which flare-ups are followed by periods of remission. About 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease.   A summary of detailed data to be presented at a meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) later this month, and posted on the group’s website late on Tuesday, did not show a meaningful difference in safety or efficacy than that seen in the initial data.   Moreover, the ECTRIMS summary showed a 48 percent reduction in annual relapse rate with three times a day dosing and a reduction in disability progression of 34 percent, in line with the results seen with twice a day dosing.   “These data confirm that the efficacy of the twice a day and three times a day arms were numerically very similar in DEFINE, and increase our confidence in the data,” said Thomas Wei, an analyst at Jefferies and Company, in a research note. “We are particularly encouraged that there is no material difference in discontinuations due to adverse events.”   About 16 percent of patients dropped out of the twice a day and three times a day group, compared to a rate of 13 percent for the group treated with a placebo.   Side effects included flushing of the face, which affected 38 percent of patients in the twice a day group and 32 percent in the three times a day group, compared to a rate of 5 percent in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar to the placebo, as was the incidence of infection.   “We view the safety profile as largely manageable,” said Geoff Meacham, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, in a research note. “As of right now, BG-12’s overall clinical profile does appear to be shaping up nicely.”   However, Meacham noted that investors’ expectations of BG-12 are relatively high, leaving Biogen little room for error.   Biogen is due to release data from a second late-stage trial of BG-12, known as CONFIRM, by the end of the year. If data from CONFIRM are positive, Biogen’s shares could rise as much as 10 percent, according to some analysts, and have the potential to fall as much as 20 percent if the data disappoints.   Biogen’s shares closed on Tuesday at $91.66 on Nasdaq.   Unlike most MS drugs, which are given by injection or infusion, BG-12 is taken orally. Oral drugs are expected to eventually become the most popular option for patients. So far the only oral drug to be approved in Gilenya, a drug made by Novartis AG NOVN.VX that is given once a day.   Gilenya has shown a reduction in annualized relapse rates of about 54 percent.   Some analysts expect BG-12, if approved, to generate more than $1 billion in annual sales.

29,BIIB,FDA extends review of Tysabri JC virus label,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have extended their review of Biogen Idec Inc’s application to update the prescribing information for its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, the company said on Thursday. Biogen, which sells the drug with Irish drugmaker Elan Corp Plc, is seeking to add information to the drug’s label to show that measuring a patient’s antibodies to the JC virus can help assess the risk of a patient developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a potentially deadly brain disease. The JC virus is thought to cause PML. Tysabri, considered the most effective multiple sclerosis drug on the market, has been beset by concerns that it can cause PML, especially over time. Biogen is seeking to implement a risk-stratification program, showing that patients who test negative for the JC virus are far less likely to develop PML than those who test positive. Biogen said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration indicated that the extension of the review is needed to allow more time to review changes being incorporated into the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) program for Tysabri, to be consistent with the anticipated prescribing information. Weston, Massachusetts-based Biogen said FDA’s three-month extension is a standard extension period.

31,BIIB,UPDATE 2-Biogen MS trial data robust; shares jump,"* Final DEFINE results consistent with initial data * Results presented on Friday at ECTRIMS * Investors now eye second trial, CONFIRM * Shares jump as much as 6.7 pct By Toni Clarke Oct 21 (Reuters) - Full data from a late-stage clinical trial of Biogen Idec Inc’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug, BG-12, showed robust results across multiple measures and revealed no new safety concerns. The news sent the biotech company’s shares soaring as much as 6.7 percent on Friday. Earlier this year the company released initial data from the trial, known as DEFINE, which showed the drug, when given twice a day, cut the annualized relapse rate by 53 percent at two years compared with placebo, and cut the rate of disability progression by 38 percent. Full data from the trial was presented on Friday at a meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and showed the drug reduced the risk of relapse by 49 percent in patients who took it twice a day and 50 percent in patients who took it three times a day. “BG-12 may be a valuable treatment option for MS patients, combining strong efficacy, a favorable safety profile and oral administration,” said Dr. Ralf Gold, a trial investigator and professor at St. Josef-Hospital/Ruhr-University in Bochum, Germany. “Preclinical research has shown that BG-12 has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.” Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system and can lead to numbness, loss of vision and paralysis. BG-12 is designed to treat relapsing-remitting MS, in which flare-ups are followed by periods of remission. About 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease. Gold said that if the clinical responses seen in DEFINE are replicated later this year in a second late-stage trial known as CONFIRM, then “BG-12 has the potential to provide a new approach to treating MS and be an important step forward for patients.” Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed that at two years, patients receiving BG-12 experienced significant reduction in the number of brain lesions compared to patients on placebo. “Coming out of Dr. Gold’s presentation, BG12’s clinical profile remains competitive with efficacy at the upper end of the range for all oral MS therapies,” said Geoff Meacham, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, in a research note. “Importantly, there were no new safety concerns in the data presented, removing a major risk, and the immediate feedback from neurologists at the session was positive.” Adverse reactions were reported by 95 to 96 percent of patients, whether in the placebo group or treatment group. The most frequently reported events were flushing, MS relapse, nasopharyngitis, headache, diarrhea and fatigue. There were no deaths related to study treatment. There was no increase in infections, serious infections, opportunistic infections or malignancies, data showed. Thomas Wei, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, said the data show that continued dosing of BG-12 beyond six months strengthens efficacy benefit, giving him increased confidence that the efficacy in DEFINE “will likely be replicated in CONFIRM.” The improvement in results with longer treatment likely explains why results from the two-year-long Phase III trial were significantly better than the six-month-long Phase II trial. “BG-12 is clearly the trend of ECTRIMS 2011,” said Geoff Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “The sentiment is very positive and every physician that we spoke to repeated the same phrase: “If the CONFIRM data is as strong as DEFINE, this drug will be the best selling drug in MS in a few years.” Shares of Weston, Massachusetts-based Biogen were up 5.7 percent at $107.48 in mid-morning trading on Nasdaq after rising as high as $108.46 earlier in the session.",10212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/biogen-ms/update-2-biogen-ms-trial-data-robust-shares-jump-idUSN1E79K0AN20111021

33,BIIB,Biogen 4th quarter profit up; 2012 forecast falls short,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec (BIIB.O) is spending heavily to prepare for the expected launch of its new drugs to treat multiple sclerosis and hemophilia, hoping to avoid the fate of several other companies whose initial product launches failed to live up to expectations. On Tuesday, the Weston, Massachusetts-based biotech issued a 2012 earnings forecast that was lower than Wall Street expected after patients enrolled in several clinical trials, including one for its drug to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, at a faster rate than expected. The company’s chief executive, George Scangos, told analysts on a conference call that more than half of its expenditures are going to support those trials and the funding is necessary to ensure the drugs are fully supported when they launch, some as early as 2013. “You can look at many of the product launches that have been done recently and some of them have gone well and some of them haven’t,” Scangos said on the call. “We need to make sure we get ours right.” Initial sales of Dendreon Corp’s DNDN.O much hyped prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, launched in 2010, and Human Genome Sciences’ HGSI.O lupus drug Benlysta, launched last year, disappointed investors and hurt the companies’ stocks. Companies now are spending increasing amounts of time working with physicians, insurance companies and patients to familiarize them with a product before it reaches the market. Scangos’s comments came as the company reported a bigger-than-expected increase of 25 percent in fourth-quarter earnings. Net profit rose to $300.2 million, or $1.22 a share, from $240 million, or 99 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $1.3 billion from $1.22 billion. Earnings excluding one-time items were $1.51 a share. On that basis, analysts expected $1.49 a share on revenue of $1.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, the company’s most important growth driver, rose 14 percent to $380 million, somewhat lower than Wall Street’s expectations of around $401 million. Biogen sells Tysabri in partnership with Irish drugmaker Elan Corp Plc ELN.I. “Overall, we’d characterize the quarter as solid, though many expected Tysabri sales and new starts to meaningfully pick up, which didn’t happen,” Geoff Meacham, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a research note. Sales of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drug Avonex rose 8 percent to $703 million, while revenue from its cancer drug Rituxan, which it sells as part of a joint venture, were $258 million, roughly the same as last year. The company expects 2012 earnings, excluding one-time items, of $6.10 to $6.20 a share, and revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. Analysts expect 2012 earnings, excluding items, of $6.32 a share and revenue of $5.28 billion. Biogen said it expects to file for approval of its experimental oral multiple sclerosis drug BG-12 in the first half of 2012. It expects data from late-stage trials of its long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX hemophilia drugs in the second half of 2012, as well as results for dexpramipexole, its experimental ALS drug. The company expects to spend between 24 percent and 25 percent of its revenue on research and development to support these trials in 2012, up from 24 percent of revenue in 2011, but down from 26.5 percent in 2010. Scangos said the company’s goal is to bring that percentage down to around 20 percent as late-stage trials are completed and the drugs move toward the market. In the meantime, Biogen plans to continue building its early-stage pipeline through targeted investments in its own research and by selective acquisitions, and has no immediate plans for additional share buybacks. “If we decide to return cash to shareholders we will communicate that and update accordingly,” the company’s chief financial officer, Paul Clancy, said on the conference call. Biogen shares rose as high as $119.30 from a close on Monday of $116.58, before slipping back to $117.50, up 0.8 percent, in midday trading.

35,BIIB,Biogen to acquire developer of fibrosis treatments,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) has agreed to acquire Stromedix Inc, a privately held company developing treatments for fibrosis and organ failure, for $75 million cash and additional payments of up to $487.5 million if drugs in development achieve certain milestones. Stromedix’s most advanced drug candidate, STX-100, is a monoclonal antibody that is entering a mid-stage, or Phase II, trial in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an almost always fatal disease in which patients experience difficult breathing due to scarring of the lungs. More than 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe have IPF and no treatment for the disease has been approved by U.S. regulators. Fibrosis is the accumulation of scar tissue that affects organs and results from the body’s attempt to repair chronic tissue injury. Michael Gilman, founder and chief executive of Stromedix, led Biogen’s research organization from 2000 to 2005. STX-100 was originally developed at Biogen, but put on the shelf in 2006 as the company focused on other areas. After Gilman left Biogen, he worked at Atlas Venture, a biotech venture capital firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Gilman decided to put together a fibrosis company, Stromedix, and Atlas helped fund it. Knowing that Biogen had a fibrosis product on their shelves Gilman obtained a license for it and continued to develop it. In June, 2010, Biogen brought in a new chief executive, George Scangos, who restructured the organization, streamlined the research and development operation and honed its focused on a few core therapeutic areas, including immunology. Fibrosis is a result of tissue damage which is often related to inflammation or immune system disorders. Atlas partner Peter Barrett said in an interview that his firm had known Scangos previously, since Atlas was an early investor in Exelixis Inc (EXEL.O), which Scangos ran before joining Biogen. Gilman said Biogen is getting “what I would say is a flagship program in their nascent fibrosis portfolio, which they want to develop. This becomes their anchor tenant.” The deal, announced by the companies on Tuesday, is part of Biogen’s strategy of making targeted acquisitions in areas where there are few or no treatments available, especially for neurological disorders, immune system disorders and hemophilia. The company currently makes the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri and is preparing to file for approval in the first half of this year of BG-12, a new oral multiple sclerosis drug that many analysts believe could become the leading product in the field. The company is also expecting data from the first late-stage trial of dexpramipexole, a treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.

36,BIIB,Biogen profit below Street view; outlook strong,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc’s (BIIB.O) quarterly profit fell short of analysts’ estimates on weak sales of its Avonex multiple sclerosis treatment, its biggest-selling product. But the biotechnology company said the Avonex shortfall stemmed largely from temporary issues and it also issued an encouraging forecast for 2012. The company’s shares were off about 1 percent in afternoon trading. Biogen shares have soared 80 percent in the past year, largely on hopes for its oral MS drug, known as BG-12, which some analysts believe could become the leading MS treatment if approved. “I expect the Street for the most part to look past this (earnings) miss,” Cowen & Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. “Biogen is definitely a high-expectation stock, and you never want to see a high-expectation stock put up anything but a real strong quarter. But despite this lackluster result they upped the guidance, so that’s comforting.” Wall Street is also heavily focused on Biogen’s experimental drugs for hemophilia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Biogen expects late-stage data for those drugs in the second half of the year. The company is increasing spending on sales and research and development to support these new medicines. Some analysts said spending was above their estimates, contributing to the quarterly earnings miss. In an interview, Biogen Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy said the company would likely seek out fewer acquisitions or collaboration deals in the short term to focus on bringing potential new products to market. “Our first order of priority is execution of the existing really strong late-stage pipeline that we have,” Clancy said. Still, Clancy said the company remained active in seeking out potential “tuck-in” deals, especially in the company’s core areas of neurology and immunology. Biogen hunts largely for products in early- and mid-stage development, as opposed to late-stage. “In this industry, it’s pretty hard to create shareholder value for the later-stage assets,” Clancy said. “It’s not impossible, but it’s actually much harder because they get bid to a premium well past their value.” Net income rose to $302.7 million, or $1.25 per share, from $294.3 million, or $1.20 a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.40 per share, 8 cents below the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $1.29 billion, some $200 million shy of analysts’ estimates. Avonex sales rose 3 percent to $662 million, about $38 million below Wall Street’s consensus estimate. “Avonex was probably the culprit,” Schmidt said of the earnings miss. Avonex sales were particularly weak in January. Biogen executives said wholesalers presumably stocked up on the drug at the end of 2011, but demand for the injected treatment remained solid. MS is a chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system and can lead to numbness, paralysis and loss of vision. Sales of Biogen’s other important marketed MS drug, Tysabri, were $399 million, up 14 percent. Biogen sells Tysabri in partnership with Irish drugmaker Elan Corp Plc ELN.I. BG-12 would be Biogen’s first oral drug to treat MS. The company applied for approval for BG-12 earlier this year in the United States and Europe. Biogen expects a standard-length U.S. review for BG-12, but would be prepared if the Food and Drug Administration decided the drug was worthy of a faster, priority review, Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos told analysts on a conference call. Biogen said it now expects 2012 earnings, excluding items, “above” $6.15 per share, compared with a range of $6.10 to $6.20 previously. Analysts have been looking for $6.19. It expects revenue growth in the mid-single digits, compared with low- to mid-single digits previously. Biogen shares were down nearly 1 percent at $132.91 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

But despite this lackluster result they upped the guidance, so that’s comforting.” Net income rose to $302.7 million, or $1.25 per share, from $294.3 million, or $1.20 a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings of $1.40 per share fell 8 cents below the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $1.29 billion, some $200 million shy of analysts’ estimates. Avonex sales rose 3 percent to $662 million, about $38 million below Wall Street’s consensus estimate. “Avonex was probably the culprit,” Schmidt said of the earnings miss. BG-12 would be Biogen’s first oral drug to treat the disease. Biogen applied for approval for BG-12 earlier this year in the United States and Europe. Biogen said it now expects 2012 earnings, excluding items, of “above” $6.15 per share, compared with a range of $6.10 to $6.20 previously. It also expects revenue growth in the mid-single digits, compared with predicting growth of low- to mid-single digits previously.

39,BIIB,"Biogen MS drug application accepted by U.S., EU regulators","(Reuters) - Both U.S. and European regulators have accepted for review Biogen Idec’s application for experimental multiple sclerosis drug BG-12, the company said on Wednesday. The pill is seen by some Wall Street analysis as having the potential to become the world’s leading treatment for the chronic, disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system and can lead to numbness, paralysis and loss of vision. Biogen already makes multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri, which are given by injection. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted a standard 10-month review for BG-12 and the European regulatory agency has validated its application. Both applications were submitted in the first quarter of this year. ",5092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-biogen/biogen-ms-drug-application-accepted-by-u-s-eu-regulators-idUSBRE8481F120120509
40,BIIB,Biogen 2nd-quarter profit up on MS drug sales,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) said on Tuesday its second-quarter earnings topped expectations on higher sales of its drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, and the company increased its profit forecast for the year. The company’s shares rose 3.5 percent in premarket trading. Higher-than-expected sales of Avonex, its biggest-selling multiple sclerosis drug and Rituxan, its cancer drug, offset lower-than-expected sales of its newer multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. The Weston, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company raised its full-year profit forecast to above $6.20 a share from a previous forecast of above $6.15 a share. It left its revenue guidance unchanged for growth in the mid-single digits. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, said the forecast could be conservative. Net profit rose to $387 million, or $1.61 a share, from $288 million, or $1.18, a year earlier. Last year, the company’s earnings were hurt by a charge of 15 cents per share due to arbitration involving its partner Roche Holding AG ROG.VX. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.82 a share. Analysts were on average expecting earnings of $1.56 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 18 percent to $1.4 billion, driven by sales of the Avonex pen, a new form of delivery of the drug. Avonex sales rose 16 percent to $762 million. Analysts were expecting Avonex sales of about $698 million and total revenue of $1.33 billion. Global sales of Tysabri, which is administered once a month by infusion and is the company’s biggest growth driver, rose 2 percent to $395 million. Analysts were expecting sales of $419 million. Revenue from Rituxan was $285 million. Analysts were expecting revenue of $266 million. The company sells the cancer drug as part of a joint venture with Roche. Biogen’s shares have risen 70 percent over the past year, largely on optimism about its experimental new multiple sclerosis drug, BG-12, which is expected to be approved as early as the end of this year. BG-12 would be the second oral drug to reach the market and would compete with Gilenya, an oral treatment from Novartis AG NOVN.VX. Sales of Gilenya rose about 15 percent in the second quarter to $283 million. That level of growth was stronger than some investors had expected. In April, European and U.S. regulators ruled that the drug should carry stronger warnings about its potential to cause heart problems. Novartis said it expects sales of Gilenya to exceed $1 billion this year. Analysts expect sales of BG-12 of $392 million in 2013 and $1.02 billion in 2014, according to Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. BG-12, which appears to have a more benign safety profile than Gilenya, is ultimately expected, if approved, to become the leading MS drug on the market. In addition to hopes for BG-12, Biogen’s shares have been lifted by improved sentiment toward Tysabri, which was temporarily withdrawn from the market in 2005 after being linked with a potentially deadly brain infection known as PML. It was reintroduced in 2006 with stricter warnings but safety concerns have remained ever since. Physicians are increasingly adopting the use of a test that screens patients for the JC virus, which is thought to cause PML. Investors are also awaiting the release later this year of data from late-stage clinical trials of Biogen’s experimental treatments for hemophilia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The company’s shares rose 3.5 percent to $144 in premarket trading from a close on Monday of $139.18 on Nasdaq.

41,BIIB,Biogen's hemophilia drug meets late-stage trial goal,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Wednesday its experimental treatment for patients with hemophilia B, a rare inherited blood disorder that impairs coagulation, met the main goal of controlling bleeding in a late-stage trial. A single injection of the long-lasting clotting factor, being developed in partnership with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, controlled bleeding in 90.4 percent of all episodes. Biogen, which makes the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri, said it plans to submit an approval application for the hemophilia drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2013. The study, known as B-LONG, enrolled 123 male patients age 12 and older, divided into four groups that were treated at different intervals. Overall, 93.5 percent of patients completed the study. The companies said the treatment was generally well-tolerated, but one serious event was considered to be possibly related to the drug. A patient experienced obstructive uropathy but continued treatment with Biogen’s drug and the condition was successfully treated. Obstructive uropathy is a condition in which the flow of urine is blocked, causing it potentially to back up and injure the kidney. The most common side effects were nasopharyngitis, influenza, joint pain, upper respiratory infection, hypertension and headache. The companies said they expect to file an application with European health authorities after completion of a study in children younger than age 12, as required by the European Medicines Agency. Hemophilia B is one of two forms of the disease. The company is also testing a drug for the more common hemophilia A, and expects to present results from that trial by the end of the year. Hemophilia B is caused by a lack, or insufficient amount, of the blood coagulation factor IX protein, needed for normal blood clotting. Patients with hemophilia A lack or have reduced levels of coagulation factor VIII. There are currently multiple hemophilia treatments on the market, but they must generally be given multiple times per week by infusion. Hemophiliacs, including children, are taught to inject themselves in a burdensome process that involves finding a vein and piercing it with a butterfly needle. Current treatments for hemophilia B generate about $1 billion a year, according to Biogen, while the market for hemophilia A is worth about $5 billion. Biogen’s products are designed to cut the number of infusions needed to control bleeding. Existing Factor VIII products must be taken as many as three to four times a week. Factor IX products must be taken intravenously two or three times a week. The B-LONG trial showed that the median dosing interval for patients taking Biogen’s drug is only once every two weeks, an improvement that Geoff Meacham, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said could be “game changing” based on physician feedback. However, Meacham said that while the data is encouraging, “hemophilia is a new disease area for Biogen, so there is some commercial risk associated with the potential launch.” Glenn Pierce, chief medical officer for Biogen’s hemophilia program, said the company has hired multiple experts in the hemophilia field and is confident it can manage a successful launch. Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, or Sobi, may choose to market the drug in Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Northern Africa. If it does so it will contribute to the cost of research and development, a reimbursement that would be recouped by Biogen through adjustments to the cross-royalty structure for the first six years. It remains to be seen whether results from the hemophilia A trial will replicate those from the hemophilia B trial, an uncertainty that caused Biogen’s shares to give up early gains and close 0.8 percent lower at $151.62 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. Pierce said that while the trials are different, the technology behind the two drugs is the same. “One can never predict the outcome,” he said. “But we’re hopeful that we will see good results.” ",9262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-biogenidec-trial-blooddisorder/biogens-hemophilia-drug-meets-late-stage-trial-goal-idUSBRE88P1MN20120926

44,BIIB,Biogen says new look at data bolsters oral MS drug,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Friday that a closer look at data from two late-stage studies supported previous findings that its high-profile multiple sclerosis pill BG-12 significantly reduced relapses and progression of disability related to MS. The company said its confidence was bolstered by analyzing combined data from the two Phase 3 studies, called DEFINE and CONFIRM, and suggested that it could win U.S. marketing approval for BG-12 by the end of the year. Approval has been expected for this year or early next year. Biogen already markets two MS drugs, but BG-12 would be one of the first oral drugs to reach the market and compete with Novartis AG’s Gilenya. It is ultimately expected, if approved, to be one of the leading MS drugs on the market. “We are optimistic we could have approval in the U.S. by the end of this year,” Alfred Sandrock, chief medical officer of Biogen, said during a press conference at the European Committee for the Treatment and Research of Multiple Sclerosis conference in Lyon, France. Biogen is already one of the world’s biggest players in the market for drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, a progressive neurological disease that can lead to paralysis. It is caused by an overactive immune system that destroys the myelin sheath that protects nerves. The company’s currently marketed products are injectable Avonex and newer Tysabri, which is given by infusion. When asked if BG-12 will wrest sales away from Avonex and Tysabri, Sandrock said, “There will be some people who will move to BG-12 from all drugs, but I don’t think it will a complete shift. There will be a place for other drugs.” Biogen’s drugs also compete with Rebif, sold by the Merck Serono division of German drugmaker Merck KGaA, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s Copaxone and Bayer AG’s Betaseron.

45,BIIB,FDA extends review of Biogen's multiple sclerosis drug,"(Reuters) - Biotechnology company Biogen Idec Inc said U.S. health regulators extended by three months the review date of its much-awaited multiple sclerosis (MS) drug BG-12, but analysts said the delay was only a minor setback. Shares of Biogen were down 2 percent at $150.72 in morning trading on the Nasdaq. The stock has risen more than 50 percent over the past 12 months, largely on optimism about BG-12, which showed robust results in trials and had no safety concerns. Analysts said the delay would push the review date to March, but added such extensions were not uncommon. “The registrational studies for BG-12 - DEFINE and CONFIRM - enrolled about 1,200 and 1,400 patients, respectively. Given the size and complexity of the filings, we are not surprised that the FDA would require additional time to review the application,” Barclays Capital analyst Anthony Butler said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it needed additional time to review the application, but did not ask for additional studies, according to Biogen. Butler and Wells Fargo Securities analyst Brian Abrahams pointed out that Sanofi’s oral MS drug Aubagio also had its review extended earlier this year, but was later approved. BG-12, also known as dimethyl fumarate, would be the third oral MS drug on the market, competing with Novartis AG’s Gilenya and the recently approved Aubagio. Analysts expect sales of $390 million and $980 million for BG-12 in 2013 and 2014, Barclays’s Butler said in a note. The oral drug is currently also under regulatory review in the European Union, Australia, Canada and Switzerland. Biogen also markets Avonex and Tysabri to treat relapsing-remitting MS, the most common kind of MS.

The results were also helped by lower-than-expected costs, analysts said. “They put up a nice solid quarter,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. “What’s being appreciated in biotech is the consistent beat and raise by all four of the large cap biotechs this week and that’s got the sector on the move.” In addition to Biogen, Amgen Inc, Gilead Sciences Inc, and Celgene Corp all reported higher-than-expected third quarter profits and raised their full-year earnings forecasts. Excluding one-time items, Biogen earned $1.91 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 31 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Biogen shares rose 2.6 percent. Biogen now expects 2012 earnings of $6.40 per share to $6.50 per share, excluding items, up from its prior view above $6.20. The company also now expects 2012 revenue growth to be in the mid-to-high single digits in percentage terms, compared with 2011. It had forecast growth in the mid-single digits. Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note the new forecast was in a range that he and Wall Street had expected, adding “and with this quarter’s performance seems easily achievable or beatable”. However, most investors are focused on Biogen’s experimental oral MS drug BG-12, which is expecting a U.S. approval decision around March, after the Food and Drug Administration earlier this month extended its review of the medicine by three months. The company told analysts the agency had some questions for which Biogen submitted written responses, but that they did not involve any additional safety analysis. It said the FDA simply needed more time to review the BG-12 data and characterized the delay as the normal course of business. It had previously said the FDA was not seeking any additional data. Biogen shares have nearly doubled during the last 18 months, driven primarily by enthusiasm over the impressive data for BG-12, also known as dimethyl fumarate. Once approved, BG-12 would be the third oral treatment for the debilitating disease, but based on its safety and efficacy data it is expected to become the industry leader with annual sales in excess of $1 billion, according to analysts. MS affects more than 400,000 people in the U.S., and 2.1 million worldwide, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The company told analysts on a conference call it was “well prepared for upcoming product launches” and said costs would likely rise in the fourth quarter as it gets ready to start selling what is seen as by far its most important future growth driver, BG-12. Biogen also expects to submit an application in the first quarter of 2013 seeking U.S. approval of its promising long-acting treatment for hemophilia B - the less common form of the disorder in which patients lack certain proteins necessary for blood clotting. Hemophilia will be a new market for the company. Key data on an experimental drug for ALS, also known as Lou Gherig’s disease, is expected late this year or early next year, Biogen said. Biogen’s net profit in the third quarter rose to $398 million, or $1.67 per share, from $354 million, or $1.43 per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 6 percent to $1.39 billion, a tad above Wall Street estimates of $1.38 billion. Sales of the MS drug Avonex rose 8 percent to $736 million. Biogen reported that its revenue from its other multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri dipped 1 percent to $275 million. Irish drugmaker Elan Corp, Biogen’s Tysabri marketing partner, previously reported worldwide sales of $404 million for the quarter, with U.S. sales of the infused drug higher than expected, while sales outside the United States fell short of analysts’ estimates. The company said 2,100 new Tysabri patients were added in the third quarter. The medicine is approved for patients who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of other MS treatments. Avonex demand was being driven by the recently available, more convenient pen-like injector for the drug. Biogen said it was seeing significant conversion from the older needle delivery system, and that more than two-thirds of new Avonex patients were using the once-weekly pen injector. International Avonex sales were $274 million. While the result was strong, it was hurt somewhat by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and price decreases in some markets like Spain and France. Company revenue for Rituxan, the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis drug Biogen co-markets with Roche, rose 8 percent to $288 million.

50,BIIB,"Biogen third-quarter profit rises, as does 2012 forecast","(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) reported much higher-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday on increased sales of its drugs for multiple sclerosis and cancer, and the U.S. biotechnology company raised its full-year earnings forecast. The results were also helped by lower selling, general and administrative costs for the quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.91 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 31 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Biogen now expects 2012 earnings of $6.40 per share to $6.50 per share, excluding items, up from its prior view of earnings above $6.20. The company also now expects 2012 revenue growth to be in the mid-to-high single digits in percentage terms, compared with 2011. It had forecast growth in the mid-single digits. Biogen’s net profit in the third quarter rose to $398 million, or $1.67 per share, from $354 million, or $1.43 per share, a year ago. Revenue was $1.39 billion, a tad above Wall Street estimates of $1.38 billion. Sales of the MS drug Avonex rose 8 percent to $736 million. Biogen reported that revenue from its other multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri dipped 1 percent to $275 million. Irish drugmaker Elan Corp ELN.I, Biogen’s Tysabri marketing partner, previously reported worldwide sales of $404 million for the quarter, with U.S. sales of the infused drug higher than expected, while sales outside the United States fell short of analysts’ estimates.

53,BIIB,Biogen says hemophilia-A drug met late-stage trial goal,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Wednesday its experimental treatment for patients with hemophilia A, a disorder that inhibits coagulation of the blood, controlled bleeding with fewer treatments in a late-stage clinical trial. About 30 percent of patients in one arm of the trial were able to go five days without requiring a new dose of the drug, which was, however, a lower percentage than some analysts had expected. Biogen’s shares fell 4 percent in midday trading on Nasdaq. Still, the data showed that those who took the Biogen’s drug prophylactically required one to two injections per week, compared with an average of three to four treatments a week with existing therapies, a benefit Biogen argues patients will find compelling. “Where people got the idea that we were going to get everyone out to five days is beyond me,” said Dr. Glenn Pierce, Chief Medical Officer for Biogen’s hemophilia program. Patients who prophylactically took doses of the drug tailored to their own body make-up had an annualized bleed rate of 1.6, Biogen said, while those who took a fixed weekly dose had an annualized bleed rate of 3.6. By comparison, those who took the drug only in response to a bleed had an annual bleed rate of 33.6. “Frankly,” Pierce said, “this is very positive data.” It suggests that patients who currently treat themselves episodically could dramatically reduce their bleed rates by moving to a fixed weekly dosing. This would not give them the level of coverage conferred by individualized dosing, but could represent an attractive option for some patients. Currently, about 65 percent of adult patients take hemophilia A drugs on an as-needed basis in the United States, Pierce said, while most children take it prophylactically. In some European countries more than 80 percent take the drug prophylactically. Biogen, best known for its multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri, said it plans to submit an application to market the hemophilia A drug with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2013. It will file with European regulators after it completes a study of the drug in children. Last month, Biogen and its partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Sobi), reported promising results of a trial of their drug to treat hemophilia B, a less common form of the disease. Hemophilia A is caused by a lack, or insufficient amount of, the blood coagulation factor VIII. Patients with hemophilia B lack or have reduced levels of coagulation factor IX. Biogen’s drugs are designed to cut the number of infusions needed to control bleeding. Existing Factor VIII products must be taken as many as three to four times a week. Factor IX products must be taken intravenously two or three times a week. In Biogen’s latest study, known as A-LONG, 98 percent of bleeding episodes were controlled with one or two injections of its long-lasting Factor VIII drug. The market for hemophilia A treatments is worth about $5 billion, according to Biogen, while the market for hemophilia B treatments is about $1 billion. If approved Biogen’s hemophilia A treatment would compete with a variety of shorter-acting products, including Baxter International Inc’s market-leading drug Advate. There were no serious safety problems reported with the drug. Biogen’s shares were trading at $137.11 in midday trading. Earlier they fell as low as $136.98.

55,BIIB,Biogen Lou Gehrig's disease drug fails in key trial,"(Reuters) - An experimental drug to combat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig’s disease in the United States, failed to work in an important trial and Biogen Idec said it would stop development of the treatment. The drug, dexpramipexole, had shown promise and seemed to work against ALS in a mid-stage clinical trial in 2011, creating hope for patients suffering from the progressive, fatal disease, who currently have few options. Biogen shares, which rose 25 percent in 2012, fell 2 percent. “There was a lot of hope behind this particular treatment,” said Carrie Martin Munk, a spokeswoman for The ALS Association. “Other companies are presently developing treatments to help fight ALS, so while we are saddened by today’s news and had obviously hoped for better results, we’re going to keep working with companies to advance treatments and bring them to patients as soon as possible,” Munk said. ALS is a disease of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that affects about 30,000 Americans, according to The ALS Association. About 5,600 Americans each year are diagnosed with the disease, long associated with legendary New York Yankees baseball player Lou Gehrig, whose career was cut short by ALS. He died of the disease in 1941. There is currently only one drug available to help people with ALS - Rilutek, or riluzole, made by Sanofi. It has been shown to prolong the life of people with ALS, who have a life expectancy of two to five years after diagnosis. The news was an uncommon blow for a company that has had a steady drum beat of positive news over the past few years. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, said the failed study had been viewed as a high risk trial. Schoenebaum said Wall Street was estimating sales of about $350 million for the drug in 2016, but that he had figured on only about $100 million in sales by then. In the 943-patient late-stage trial, dexpramipexole failed to slow decline of physical or respiratory function or improve survival, the company said. There was also no evidence of efficacy in subgroups of patients who were analyzed, leaving no path forward for the drug. “We share the disappointment of members of the ALS community, who had hoped that dexpramipexole would offer a meaningful new treatment option,” Biogen Executive Vice President of Research and Development Douglas Williams said in a statement. Biogen said it is looking at other potential ALS treatments in preclinical programs and is working in collaboration with academic researchers at a variety of institutions. “We’re in it for the long run and we are committed to finding a treatment for ALS,” Biogen spokeswoman Ligia Del Bianco said.

58,BIIB,Teva questions safety of MS drug from rival Biogen,"(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, which makes the market-leading multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, has filed a petition with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that could, if granted, delay entry to the market of a rival drug developed by Biogen Idec Inc. Teva’s petition asks that the FDA not approve any new multiple sclerosis drug until its safety has been evaluated by a panel of outside advisors, and said it had uncovered “troubling information” on a publicly accessible website about the safety of Biogen’s drug, BG-12. Israel-based Teva said the information showed that kidney changes were observed after repeated administration of BG-12 in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. The company suggested that as a result, “there is a substantial probability the risk is applicable to humans as well.” Biogen spokeswoman Kate Niazi-Sai, echoing comments made by company chief executive, George Scangos, at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference earlier this week, said the company is “confident” in BG-12’s safety data. Niazi-Sai said the incidence of kidney problems was similar between patients taking BG-12 and those taking a placebo, she said. A late-stage clinical trial showed that 21 percent of patients taking the placebo experienced kidney problems, compared with 22 percent of patients taking BG-12 twice a day and 25 percent of patients taking BG-12 three times a day. Teva asked the FDA not to approve any new MS drug unless or until it has convened a panel of outside advisors and listened to the panel’s recommendations. And it said its motives were to protect patients. “Teva filed the petition, on behalf of the more than 300,000 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in the U.S.,” Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva, said in an emailed statement. She said the company wants to “ensure that appropriate safeguards are implemented to maintain an acceptable risk-benefit profile.” So far the agency has not scheduled such a meeting for BG-12, though it could do so at any time. An advisory committee meeting would delay BG-12’s entry to the market. The FDA is scheduled to rule on whether to approve BG-12 by the end of March, three months later than the original decision date. Biogen has said the agency did not require additional information, just more time to review application. Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said he doubts Teva’s petition will cause the FDA to delay BG-12’s approval, “though one cannot rule out the possibility of a minor process-related delay as FDA necessarily evaluates/responds” to the petition.

59,BIIB,"Biogen, Elan seek okay for first-line Tysabri use in MS","LONDON (Reuters) - Biogen Idec and Elan have filed for approval to sell their drug Tysabri as a first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis, a move that could boost sales of the drug. Demand for Tysabri has been curtailed due to concerns over its association with a potentially fatal infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, which is caused by the JC virus. Now, however, there is a test for the virus to predict if patients are at risk of developing PML, opening the possibility that Tysabri could be used more widely and at an earlier stage of treatment. Biogen and Elan said on Wednesday they had submitted applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency seeking approval for first-line use in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) who have tested negative for antibodies to the JC virus. The JC virus is generally harmless, but in people with weakened immune systems, such as those using immune system-suppressing drugs like Tysabri, it can lead to an increased chance of developing PML. Tysabri use is currently limited to between 10 and 12 percent of treated MS patients, due to the risk of PML, and analysts said the hoped-for wider approval would improve uptake and send a positive signal to doctors. Berenberg analysts said Tysabri’s share of the MS market could increase to about 15 percent by 2015, representing sales of $2.9 billion, while today’s share price for Elan implied peak sales of only some $2 billion. Tysabri was briefly pulled from the market over PML concerns - but it was considered to be so effective, compared with other available treatments, that MS patients argued the risk was worth taking and demanded its return. Health regulators bowed to the pressure and allowed the drug’s relaunch with restrictions. “A first-line approval would allow people with MS access to a highly efficacious treatment earlier in the course of the disease, potentially leading to better outcomes,” said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer. “This is an important consideration for people with MS who may want or need more efficacy.” Both the U.S. and European regulators are expected to decide on the applications for first-line use later this year.

60,BIIB,Biogen's injectable MS drug effective in trial,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Thursday that a late-stage clinical trial of an experimental multiple sclerosis treatment showed it to be safe and effective in cutting the annual rate of relapse in patients with the autoimmune disease. The injectable treatment, peginterferon beta-1a, also known as Peg-Avonex, is designed to reduce the dosing schedule typical of standard interferon drugs such as Biogen’s own Avonex, as it is designed to last longer in the body. Biogen said the results “support peginterferon beta-1a as a potential treatment dosed every two weeks or every four weeks for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.” The company said fewer patients relapsed on an every two-week dosing schedule than those on an every four-week schedule in the trial. The study included more than 1,500 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Both schedules of use worked at about the same rate to reduce the progression of disability with MS, an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, the company said. Still, analysts are mainly focused on another multiple sclerosis drug in development by Biogen, BG-12, a pill that some expect could become the leading treatment for the disease. David Ferreiro, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said in a research report that he expects peak sales of Peg-Avonex of around $830 million a year. “We see the drug’s convenience benefit as modest and expect a diminishing injectables market in the advent of BG-12, an oral with stronger efficacy than injectables,” he said. Biogen said it plans to submit the drug for approval in 2013 and Mark Schoenebaum, a research analyst at ISI Group, said in a note that he expects approval in 2014.

The oral drug BG-12, to be sold under the brand name Tecfidera, is expected to become a leading treatment for multiple sclerosis after its planned second quarter introduction. Gene Mack, an analyst at Brean Capital LLC, estimates that by 2015, Tecfidera will account for $1.4 billion, or roughly 25 percent, of the company’s multiple sclerosis drug sales. In the fourth quarter, global sales of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri rose 14 percent to $433 million a year ago, while sales of another MS treatment, Avonex, rose 7 percent to $753 million, the company said. Biogen markets Tysabri in conjunction with Elan Corp Plc ELN.I. “We believe we are entering into an era of significant long-term growth driven by multiple potential new product launches,” George Scangos, Biogen’s chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call. Biogen’s shares rose 3.4 percent to $151.14 in morning trading on Nasdaq. Earlier, they traded as high as $156.94. Net earnings in the quarter were $292 million, or $1.23 per share, compared with $300 million, or $1.22 a share a year ago. Revenue rose 7 percent to a higher-than-expected $1.4 billion. “The revenue beat was primarily driven by higher than expected Avonex sales,” said Geoff Porges, an analyst at Bernstein Research. Excluding the amortization of certain assets, restructuring charges, and other items, the company earned $1.40 a share, down from $1.51 per share a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.46 a share according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said that an error in its tax accounting related to its Denmark facility accumulated over several years had hurt earnings by an unexpected 12 cents per share. Paul Clancy, Biogen’s chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company’s auditor is PricewaterhouseCoopers but he declined to assign blame, saying, “it’s our responsibility, we collaborate with them.” The Weston, Massachusetts-based company said it expects 2013 earnings per share excluding one-time items to be between $7.15 to $7.25 per share and revenue to grow 10 percent from $5.5 billion in 2012. Analysts on average were forecasting earnings of $7.27 a share and revenue of $5.98 billion. The short-fall versus expectations is likely due to higher expenses related to the introduction of BG-12, which analysts on average expect will generate around $350 million in 2013. Clancy cautioned that it is too early to tell what the compliance rate will be for patients taking BG-12, which must be taken twice a day, adding an element of uncertainty to Wall Street’s forecasts. Biogen also sells the cancer drug Rituxan and is in late-stage development of drugs to treat hemophilia. The company expects to launch two hemophilia drugs in late 2013 or early 2014. It is hoping to provide a new injectable interferon for multiple sclerosis that requires fewer doses than current injectable treatments, including Avonex.

Biogen also sells the cancer drug Rituxan and is in late-stage development of drugs to treat hemophilia. The company expects to launch two hemophilia drugs in late 2013 or early 2014. It is hoping to provide a new injectable interferon for multiple sclerosis that requires fewer doses than current injectable treatments, including Avonex.

63,BIIB,Biogen's purchase of MS drug ends rocky partnership with Elan,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc’s agreement to buy Elan Corp Plc’s interest in the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri gives Biogen full control of a product that is poised for further growth and ends a long partnership that has often been contentious. Analysts have speculated for several years that Biogen could acquire Elan to take control of Tysabri. The current agreement, under which Biogen will pay Elan $3.25 billion in cash plus royalties, gives Biogen the asset it is most interested in while leaving Elan with money to spend on acquisitions and to develop its pipeline of experimental drugs. “With this deal Biogen does not have to deal with Elan’s pipeline baggage,” said David Ferreiro, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. Still, analysts expressed some surprise that Biogen has chosen this moment to double down on Tysabri. The company is poised to launch a new MS drug, BG-12, at the end of March. The drug, if approved, will be sold under the brand name Tecfidera. It is expected by many investors to become the leading treatment for the disease but is set to lose patent protection in the mid to late 2020s. “By that point, BG-12 could be the dominant MS therapy. And then it will suddenly go to zero,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group. Oral drugs such as BG-12, also known as small molecule drugs, are easier to replicate than complex, large molecule biologic drugs such as Tysabri that are given by infusion. Schoenebaum said he and many other analysts have believed that for this reason Biogen has wanted to acquire Elan’s portion of Tysabri. “Tysabri is a long duration asset that will never face true small molecule-like erosion,” Schoenebaum said, adding that since Tysabri is far more effective than BG-12, “Biogen has taken a step toward filling in the post-BG-12 P&L.;” Biogen’s chief executive, George Scangos, said in an interview that the timing of the deal was a matter of happy coincidence. “We’ve been talking to Elan for a while about how to restructure the relationship in a way that would be beneficial to both companies,” Scangos said. “We are doing it now because the interests of both companies are aligned.” The deal also ends a partnership that Scangos described as “cumbersome” but that others say was often hostile. In 2009, a U.S. judge ruled that Elan had breached the collaboration agreement with Biogen over Tysabri after Elan agreed to sell an 18.4 percent stake in itself to Johnson and Johnson and gave J&J; an option to acquire a half share in Tysabri. Elan’s chief executive, Kelly Martin, sounded ebullient about the Tysabri sale. “You can do a lot of things with $3 billion,” he said in an interview. “We are not necessarily restricting ourselves to one therapeutic area or one type of clinical asset. We will not be restricted to our past, which was by and large neurological.” As part of the deal, Biogen will make future payments to Elan amounting to 12 percent of global sales of Tysabri for the first 12 months. After that Biogen will make payments of 18 percent on global sales of Tysabri up to $2 billion and 25 percent on annual sales that exceed $2 billion. Geoff Porges, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said the transaction would generate around $400 million in annual cash flow for Elan, “and will probably sustain that company’s operations for many years.” Tysabri is widely considered the most effective drug for multiple sclerosis, but it has been linked to a potentially deadly brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML. It is currently approved to treat patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, alternative therapies. Biogen has since developed a test, however, that can predict with high accuracy which patients are likely to develop PML and which are not, removing much of the anxiety among physicians and patients that has curbed growth of the drug since its introduction in 2004. It was temporarily withdrawn after several patients developed PML but was reintroduced in 2006 with stricter safety warnings. Last month the Weston, Massachusetts-based company applied to U.S. and European regulators for the right to market the drug for newly diagnosed patients who have tested negative for antibodies to the JC virus, thought to be the cause of PML. About 40 percent of MS patients are JCV negative, the company said. Biogen already makes the injectable drug Avonex for newly diagnosed patients and competes in this segment of the market with drugs from Pfizer Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. BG-12 will compete with an oral drug from Novartis AG that is currently on the market. Other drugs for the disease are waiting in the wings. Total sales of Tysabri in 2012 rose 8 percent to $1.6 billion. Analysts on average expect sales of the drug in 2013 to rise to $1.86 billion and to $2.34 billion in 2015. Biogen’s MS drugs account for about 30 percent of the roughly $12 billion global MS market. Scangos said he expects that share to rise to “well north of 30 percent.” In addition to increased revenue generated by full ownership of Tysabri, Biogen hopes to expand the patient population for which the drug can be used. It is currently approved to treat patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, which accounts for about 75 percent of the patient population. Biogen is also testing the drug in patients with secondary progressive MS, which typically follows the relapsing-remitting form, the company said. Oppenheimer’s Ferreiro is not optimistic, however, about the prospects for Tysabri in secondary progressive MS. Biogen said the transaction will add 20 to 30 cents to its net earnings per share in 2013 and 50 to 60 cents to its adjusted earnings per share. The company’s shares rose 2.3 percent to close at $160.98 on Nasdaq. Earlier in the day they rose as high as $167.35.

66,BIIB,Biogen pays Elan $3.25 billion to take over MS drug,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Biogen Idec is to take full ownership of blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri after agreeing to pay Irish partner Elan $3.25 billion plus future royalties on sales of the drug. Irish drugmaker Elan, which has co-marketed the drug with the larger U.S. company for 12 years, said it would receive a royalty of 12 percent of Tysabri global net sales for the first 12 months after the restructuring closes. A tiered royalty structure will kick in after that, it said, with Elan receiving 18 percent on up to $2 billion of global net sales and 25 percent on any sales over that amount. Sales of Tysabri, which provides Elan with almost all of its revenue, rose 8 percent to $1.6 billion last year. A filing last month for approval to sell the drug as a first-line treatment for could boost sales further. “The restructuring of this business collaboration provides Elan with significant strategic flexibility ... The risk of one asset and a single collaborator was not ideal,” Elan chief executive Kelly Martin said in a statement. “We are enthusiastic about the market opportunities around the globe and remain flexible and creative about the manner in which we would participate in those opportunities.” The deal boosts Biogen’s MS business at a crucial time for the U.S. biotech company, which hopes to win approval soon for a new pill to treat the debilitating neurological disease. Its oral drug BG-12, to be sold under the brand name Tecfidera, is expected to become a leading treatment for MS after its planned second quarter introduction. Biogen will be able to offer BG-12 alongside Tysabri and another MS treatment called Avonex, both of which are given by injection, providing a range of treatment options for patients. Rivals in the MS space include Novartis, Teva, Merck KGaA and Bayer. ",2062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-elan-brief/biogen-pays-elan-3-25-billion-to-take-over-ms-drug-idUSBRE91509420130206
67,BIIB,UPDATE 2-Elan to return $1 bln to shareholders from MS drug sale,"* Elan to buy back $1 bln of shares after Tysabri sale * Deal is “unique opportunity” to reward shareholders * Firm still working on acquisitions with rest of proceeds * Shares climb over 4 percent By Stephen Mangan DUBLIN, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Irish drugmaker Elan will return $1 billion to shareholders, giving them an immediate boost from the sale of its stake in multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Tysabri to partner Biogen Idec. Elan shares climbed over 4 percent following the announcement on Friday, which also reiterated the company’s intention to make acquisitions with the rest of the $3.25 billion raised from the deal. Tysabri was by far Elan’s most important product, responsible for almost all its revenue and its sale creates uncertainty over the future shape of the company. “Close to 40 percent of Elan’s current market cap could be invested in as yet unknown assets ... we are unlikely to gain the visibility needed to become constructive on the shares until transactions are concluded,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes. Elan is already pursuing potential deals for the next 12-18 months, Chief Executive Kelly Martin told Reuters in an interview this month, which he said may not necessarily be restricted to the firm’s past areas of activity. “By unlocking a portion of the Tysabri asset value ... we have a unique opportunity to reward shareholders, diversify our business and create a highly distinctive business platform upon which to advance to the benefit of shareholders and patients around the world,” Martin said on Friday. Elan, which has operations in Ireland and the United States, indicated last year it would look to return some profit to shareholders from the sale of Tysabri. The drugmaker has co-marketed Tysabri with Biogen, the larger U.S. company, for 12 years and said it would receive a royalty of 12 percent of Tysabri’s global net sales for the first 12 months after the deal is completed. For Biogen, which plans to pay for the deal using existing cash reserves, the Tysabri deal will add around $0.20 to $0.30 to 2013 earnings per share and continue to be accretive thereafter.

69,BIIB,Elan offers special dividend to fend off Royalty,"DUBLIN/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Irish drugmaker Elan has sweetened the terms on offer to shareholders under a $3.25 billion disposal plan to try to stave off an approach for the company from U.S. investment firm Royalty Pharma. Elan said on Monday it would give shareholders 20 percent of future royalties from multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, in which it holds a 50 percent interest that it plans to sell to its U.S. partner Biogen Idec. The Irish group had unveiled the restructuring a month ago, saying it would gain flexibility to buy new assets. It has already said it would also return $1 billion to shareholders. Those plans were put under question when New York-based Royalty made its $6.6 billion approach last week. Royalty’s indicative approach, worth $11 per Elan share, could scupper Elan’s plans to spend the rest of the proceeds from the Tysabri deal on a series of acquisitions, effectively reinventing itself as a company. Despite Elan’s rejection, Royalty plans to make its case to some of the drugmaker’s largest shareholders later this week. Elan said on Monday most of its shareholders did not view Royalty’s idea as worth consideration. “We simply don’t view the Royalty indication of interest as credible. The vast majority of our investor base simply don’t view Royalty’s indication as worthy of any discussion,” Chief Executive Kelly Martin told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I wish Royalty well, they can do what they need to do, but we’re not in any discussions with them at all on any topic and we don’t see any need to have those discussions,” Martin said. The CEO said he was referring to Elan’s outside investors and had not discussed the approach with Johnson & Johnson, which owns 18 percent of the group. Royalty Pharma, which buys royalty streams of patented drugs, is not giving up, however. “We have approached Elan’s Chairman with a possible offer at a cash premium, and we are very serious about our offer,” said Pablo Legorreta, chief executive officer of Royalty Pharma, in a written statement Tuesday. “I’m therefore struggling to understand why this offer is, in the words of Kelly Martin, “not credible.” We look forward to meeting a number of Elan’s large shareholders who have agreed to meet with us later this week.” At least one investor, Larry Feinberg, founder and president of Greenwich, Connecticut-based Oracle Investment Management, backed Martin’s plan and has bought 2 million shares of Elan since the Tysabri deal was announced. “I think Elan is signaling that they are going to be not just a development stage company and that they are really looking for commercial stage businesses,” Feinberg, whom Elan has not contacted about the deal, told Reuters. “I think the Royalty Pharma bid puts a floor on the stock now. The management has to prove that they can create value and I believe they will.” Elan shares are up more than 10 percent at $11.48 since Royalty made their deal public, a signal that the market believes the New York firm will have to increase its offer. Martin dismissed Royalty’s criticism that Elan’s senior management had little experience making acquisitions. He said potential deals the group was looking at included some assets worth more than $1 billion. The Tysabri deal should close in the coming month or two, Martin said, adding Elan would provide further clarity on its plans in coming days and weeks. Once the deal closes, the Dublin-based company said shareholders could expect the first of twice-yearly dividend payments on the drug in the fourth quarter of 2013. In the deal with Biogen, Elan’s royalty payments on future Tysabri sales, which rose 8 percent to $1.63 billion in 2012, will be 12 percent for the first year, 18 percent after that, and 25 percent when annual sales rise above $2 billion. Martin said shareholders would therefore get 5 percent of any income on the drug above $2 billion. Biogen aims to increase patient numbers over time to 100,000 from the 72,700 at the end of last year, a level that would make Tysabri a $2 billion drug. Using its Tysabri sales and share buyback assumptions, analysts at Berenberg Bank said the dividend equates to $68 million in 2014 and increases to $175 million in 2023. “This news reduces Royalty’s options and, if serious in its intentions, increases the need for a higher formal offer that more fairly reflects Tysabri upside,” Berenberg said in a note.

He added that the group believed that establishing a direct link between shareholders and a drug’s cash flow was a unique proposition in an industry where it said biotech group Amgen (AMGN.O) was alone it paying out a consistent dividend. “We want to create what we think is a unique company because I think this industry is totally ripe for a completely different approach to how it assesses assets, manages assets and values assets,” Martin said. “I think this industry in some regards is in the stone age as far as how it looks at its business ... This opens up an entire group of new investors.” No-one at Royalty could immediately be reached for comment.

The company, which presented its results at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting, said the drug reduced the proportion of patients who relapsed by 39 percent compared with patients who took a placebo. Peginterferon beta-1a, which will be marketed, if approved, under the brand name Plegridy, is an injectable drug designed to reduce the dosing schedule of standard interferon drugs such as Biogen’s own Avonex, which are typically dosed at least once a week. In addition to Avonex, Biogen makes the MS drug Tysabri, which is widely considered the most effective on the market but has been linked with a potentially deadly brain infection known as PML. The company is also poised to launch a new MS drug, Tecfidera, a pill that many analysts believe could become the leading treatment for the disease. The company hopes that Plegridy will provide an option for patients seeking a less frequent dosing schedule. Biogen said the drug reduced the risk of 12-week disability progression by 38 percent compared with a placebo when given once every two weeks. When given once every four weeks, Plegridy was also shown to be effective and met the main goals of the trial, but patients who received the drug once every two weeks responded better. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic condition that occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the protective sheath surrounding nerve cells in the brain, optic nerve or spinal cord. Symptoms may include loss of balance, difficulty moving arms and legs, weakness, numbness and blindness.

75,BIIB,Biogen wins EU backing for big new MS drug hope,"LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators have recommended approval of two new multiple sclerosis pills from Biogen Idec and Sanofi, both of which are expected to become major sellers. Friday’s decision by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was particularly significant for Biogen, since the U.S. biotech company is still awaiting a verdict on Tecfidera, or BG-12, in the United States. Shares in Biogen, which have more than trebled in the last three years on rising hopes for Tecfidera, hit a new all-time high of $178.66 on Friday and stood 1 percent up on the day by 11.40 a.m. ET. Tecfidera is one of the most highly anticipated new drug approvals for the pharmaceuticals industry in 2013, with analysts predicting billions of dollars a year in sales. It will compete in the oral MS drug market against Novartis’s existing Gilenya and Aubagio, but many investors already see it as best in class. “We believe Tecfidera will raise expectations for what people living with MS can achieve with their therapy,” Biogen CEO George Scangos said in a statement welcoming the news. Oral drugs are changing the MS market dramatically, by offering patients a highly effective alternative to traditional injections, which can be painful and may cause flu-like symptoms. Tecfidera and Sanofi’s Aubagio were both endorsed for treating relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), though the EMA decision still needs to be finalized before the drugs can be launched. Aubagio was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the same use in September, while an FDA decision on the Biogen product is due by March 28. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group, said the European decision on Tecfidera was reassuring since the EMA only flagged up two safety issues.

Friday’s decision by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was particularly significant for Biogen, since the U.S. biotech company is still awaiting a verdict on Tecfidera, or BG-12, in the United States. Shares in Biogen, which have more than trebled in the last three years on rising hopes for Tecfidera, hit a new all-time high of $178.66 on Friday and stood 1 percent up on the day by 1540 GMT. Tecfidera is one of the most highly anticipated new drug approvals for the pharmaceuticals industry in 2013, with analysts predicting billions of dollars a year in sales. It will compete in the oral MS drug market against Novartis’s existing Gilenya and Aubagio, but many investors already see it as best in class. “We believe Tecfidera will raise expectations for what people living with MS can achieve with their therapy,” Biogen CEO George Scangos said in a statement welcoming the news.

Under a deal announced in February, Biogen Idec will take full ownership of the blockbuster drug for an upfront payment of $3.25 billion plus royalties of up to 25 percent on future sales. Elan plans to give shareholders one-fifth of that royalty share as well as a further $1 billion from a share buyback, and spend what is left on a series of acquisitions that would effectively reinvent itself as a company.

83,BIIB,"Biogen profit beats estimates, raises 2013 forecast","(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) reported higher-than-expected first quarter profit on Thursday and raised its full year forecasts, and the U.S. biotechnology said it sees its new drug Tecfidera becoming the leading oral medicine for multiple sclerosis. Biogen management declined to give any sales details from Tecfidera’s first few weeks on the market, but Chief Executive George Scangos called the March 27 U.S. approval “a watershed event for our company.” Shares in the company jumped 4.3 percent in early trading to $215.00 on Nasdaq. Tecfidera is widely seen as Biogen’s most important future growth driver, with analysts estimating 2013 sales of about $300 million and eventual peak sales in excess of $3 billion. The new drug is expected to gain European approval during the current quarter, with an initial launch in Germany, followed by other European nations in 2014, the company said. Biogen also said it expects to launch two new long-acting drugs for the hereditary blood disorder hemophilia in 2014. Tecfidera is the third oral MS drug on the market, but is expected to eclipse both Gilenya, sold by Novartis AG NOVN.VX, and Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) Aubagio due to its favorable safety profile and efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials. Biogen’s stock has advanced more than 40 percent so far this year and has nearly quadrupled over the past three years, largely driven by positive Tecfidera data and expectations for its future sales potential. The company’s quarterly results were helped by low taxes and sales growth of its older injectable multiple sclerosis treatments, Avonex and Tysabri. Biogen said it now expects earnings, excluding items, of $7.80 to $7.90 per share, up from its prior view of $7.15 to $7.25 per share. The company now sees full-year revenue growth of 16 percent to 18 percent. It had previously projected 10 percent growth. Analysts are estimating adjusted earnings of $7.81 per share on revenue of $6.44 billion. Biogen said it raised the forecast due to its greater share of Tysabri revenue following a deal last month with partner Elan Corp ELN.I, a tax benefit seen in the first quarter, and strength in its core business. “We are on a very promising trajectory for the remainder of the year and for years to come,” Scangos told analysts on a conference call. Biogen said it had a net profit of $426.8 million, or $1.79 per share, in the first quarter, up from $302.7 million, or $1.25 per share, in the year earlier period. Excluding special items, the company earned $1.97 per share, topping analysts’ average forecasts by 36 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results were helped by a $33 million tax benefit and other tax credits that added 16 cents a share to net profit. Its tax rate for the quarter was just 13.2 percent. Total revenue grew 10 percent to $1.42 billion, matching Wall Street expectations. Sales of Avonex jumped 13 percent to $746 million, edging past Wall Street estimates of about $740 million. Elan, which shares revenue from the MS drug Tysabri with Biogen, said on Wednesday that global sales of the medicine grew 14 percent in the quarter to $456 million. That, too, was a bit better than Wall Street estimates of about $447 million. Beginning in May, Biogen will get a far higher percentage of Tysabri sales after the company paid Elan $3.25 billion to gain full rights to the lucrative product. Under the agreement, Elan will get just 12 percent of global Tysabri sales for the first 12 months, rising to 18 percent after that. Scangos addressed an article in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine, which attracted the attention of analysts. The report detailed four previously known cases of patients who suffered a potentially fatal brain infection, known as PML, after taking a drug for psoriasis that used an active ingredient also in Tecfidera. Scangos stressed that there have been no cases of PML or other serious infections with Tecfidera. “It’s hard to understand why these old reports are deemed worthy of publishing. This is old news,” he said. ",4252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-biogenidec-results/biogen-profit-beats-estimates-raises-2013-forecast-idUSBRE93O0Q920130425

90,BIIB,Biogen delays MS drug's EU launch to secure market exclusivity,"May 30 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc expects a delay in the European launch of its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera as the drugmaker works to secure exclusive data that could potentially protect its treatment from generic competition for a longer period. Biogen said in a filing it was working to make the drug’s regulatory data protection clearer prior to the launch, and expects the European launch to be delayed until the second half of 2013. The company’s shares were down about 1 percent in premarket trade. They closed at $238.99 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq. “The company does have a granted patent in EU which would, in theory, protect the compound, until 2028. However, the patent is not a ‘compound’ patent and thus could be challenged,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a note. Apart from patents, the European regulators also grant a “new active substance” (NAS) designation that can protect new drugs from generic competition. Without this designation, generic copies of a drug can be launched in Europe in as little as three years. “Biogen has said repeatedly that they believe (Tecfidera) should qualify for 10 years of protection, although it might not be through the NAS designation,” Schoenebaum said. “We suspect this pathway is exactly what Biogen is discussing with the EU regulators now,” he added. Tecfidera, which is expected to receive European regulatory approval this quarter, was recommended for European approval in March, along with Sanofi’s MS pill Aubagio. However, EU regulators declined to give Aubagio the NAS designation because it is similar to an older drug, an action that could hurt sales of other MS drugs on the market as well. Biogen launched Tecfidera in the United States earlier this year. The drug is widely seen as its most important growth driver, with estimated 2013 sales of $300 million and eventual peak sales of $3 billion.",5302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/biogen-msdrug-eu/biogen-delays-ms-drugs-eu-launch-to-secure-market-exclusivity-idUSL3N0EB2Y920130530

In its first quarter on the market, Tecfidera posted sales of $192 million, including inventory stocking. Biogen said about $110 million of the total represented underlying patient demand. Analysts had expected about $66 million, with the more bullish forecasts at about $90 million. Biogen also reported a much higher-than-expected second-quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts. Its shares, which have already gained more than 50 percent this year on high hopes for the drug, rose as much as 3 percent on Thursday before giving back most of its gains. Biogen last traded up 0.43 percent at $227.58 on Nasdaq. In a research note, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum called the initial Tecfidera sales the “holy mother of all launches,” and noted that 75 percent of patients had been switched from other medicines. “About a quarter of the patients are new to disease-modifying therapies or are returning quitters. We are potentially expanding the market here, which is extremely important,” Biogen Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy said in a telephone interview. The company said no other MS drug had done as well in its first three months on the market. “We are at the beginning of a new era for Biogen Idec,” said Chief Executive George Scangos. Tecfidera is the third oral MS drug to market after Gilenya from Novartis and Sanofi’s Aubagio, but is widely expected to dominate the class. Analysts consider the drug Biogen’s most important future growth driver and forecast eventual peak sales in excess of $3 billion. Biogen told analysts on a conference call that 3,500 physicians had prescribed Tecfidera so far. It cautioned, however, that while sales will remain strong, they are likely to moderate once initial pent-up demand is satisfied. The company said Tecfidera will also require strong and sustained marketing efforts in the highly competitive MS field. It expects the drug’s European launch will be further delayed as the company works to ensure long-term patent protection there, and did not anticipate any meaningful EU Tecfidera revenue this year. It has already been approved in Canada and Australia. For Biogen’s two older MS drugs, second-quarter sales rose 2 percent to $774 million for Avonex and fell 2 percent to $387 million for Tysabri. Its share of sales of the cancer drug Rituxan for the quarter was $289 million. The company called it a challenging quarter for Tysabri, but noted that two-thirds of the patients who discontinued its use had done so to switch to Tecfidera. Based on the past experience of long-term Tysabri users who switch to alternative medicines, Biogen said it anticipates seeing some cases of a rare but serious and potentially fatal brain infection known as PML to crop up in some those new Tecfidera patients. Earlier this week, there were reports of a women who had died of a form of pneumonia two and a half weeks after she had stopped using Tecfidera due to gastrointestinal side effects. The company reiterated that her death was highly unlikely to be connected to the drug. The biotechnology company said net profit rose to $491 million in the quarter, or $2.06 per share, from $387.1 million, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, such as a legal settlement charge, Biogen earned $2.30 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 37 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Biogen now expects full-year 2013 earnings of $8.25 to $8.50 per share, excluding items, up from its prior forecast of $7.80 to $7.90. The company also anticipates full-year revenue growth of 22 percent to 23 percent, up from previous expectations of 16 percent to 18 percent. Revenue rose 21 percent to $1.7 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $1.62 billion. Biogen expects to gain U.S. approval for its long-acting hemophilia drug Eloctate in the second quarter of 2014. It also has under regulatory consideration a second long-acting hemophilia drug and an interferon for MS that only needs to be injected every two weeks or once a month. “We have the potential for three new therapies to be launched in 2014,” Clancy said.

In its first quarter on the market, Tecfidera had sales of $192 million, including inventory stocking. Biogen said about $110 million of the total represented underlying patient demand.

95,BIIB,UPDATE 1-Biogen bets more on Isis technology for neurological drugs,"By Deena Beasley Sept 9 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec has agreed to pay another $100 million upfront to Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc  as part of a broad collaboration to develop new medicines for neurological disorders, the companies said on Monday. The news sent Isis’s shares up 9 percent in premarket trade. The deal is the fourth between the companies in the last two years, and aims to use the “antisense” technology invented by Isis to accelerate discovery of drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Biogen has the option of using the research to develop either antisense drugs, traditional small molecule drugs or antibody-based compounds. Antisense drugs aim to interfere at the genetic level to prevent the formation of disease-causing proteins. “This is a more expansive collaboration in which we will work together over the next several years to use the Isis technology to probe the biology of a disease, develop drug targets and then potentially take those molecules forward,” Biogen Chief Executive Officer George Scangos said in a telephone interview. Biogen is a leader in the market for drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, a progressive neurological disease that can lead to paralysis. Biogen and Isis are already working to develop an experimental treatment for spinal muscular atrophy which is set to enter late-stage testing in humans. Earlier collaboration has also resulted in an experimental drug for myotonic dystrophy that will soon begin development. By next year the companies expect to have drug candidates for three other targets, said Isis CEO Stanley Crooke. “With the efficiency of antisense we believe we should have a drug moving forward pretty much every year,” he said. Crooke said the first focus of the new collaboration with Biogen will likely be neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those involved with motor dysfunction. He put the potential value of the deal for Isis at “several billion dollars,” noting that royalty payments for any eventual antisense drugs would be in the double digit percentages, with smaller payments for non-antisense compounds. Isis shares were up at $30.35 in trading before the bell. They had closed at $27.92 on Friday on the Nasdaq. Biogen shares were up slightly at $226 premarket.

97,BIIB,Biogen's new MS drug maintains efficacy long term -study,"Oct 4 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec’s hot-selling new multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera remained effective for patients taking the medicine for at least four years with no new safety problems, according to interim data from a long-term study. Tecfidera, which analysts expect to eventually dominate the MS market, had sales of $192 million in its first quarter on the market - nearly triple average Wall Street expectations. The Endorse extension study followed patients who had taken part in two pivotal Phase III trials that led to the U.S. approval of Tecfidera. The drug maintained its ability to reduce disease activity as measured by relapses and disease progression in patients treated for four years, the interim data showed. In addition, there were no new or worsening safety problems observed even in patients taking Tecfidera for up to six and a half years, according to the interim analysis presented on Friday at a major multiple sclerosis medical meeting in Copenhagen. Patients in the extension study also experienced a low frequency of new MS brain lesions similar to what had been observed after two years. “These interim Endorse findings reaffirm, over the longer term, the outcomes we have previously observed with Tecfidera and provide important information for physicians and patients,” Dr. Ralf Gold, chairman of the department of neurology at St. Josef Hospital in Bochum, Germany, said in a statement. There was no increased risk of serious infections or cancers and no overall increased risk of kidney dysfunction or liver problems seen in the long-term study, Biogen said. Patients in the earlier two-year Phase III studies who had been in the control groups that received either a placebo or Copaxone - the current MS market leader from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries - were given Tecfidera in the Enforce extension trial. They had similar favorable clinical responses as those who had received the Biogen drug in the earlier trials, the company said. In those studies, Tecfidera led to a 54 percent reduction in the risk of MS relapse compared with placebo. Researchers will continue to follow the 1,738 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the Endorse trial. They are receiving 240 milligrams of Tecfidera either two or three times a day. About two million people suffer from MS worldwide. RRMS is the most common form of the disease, characterized by episodes of worsening neurologic function followed by periods of remission involving partial or complete recovery, according to the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation.",10042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/biogen-multiplesclerosis/biogens-new-ms-drug-maintains-efficacy-long-term-study-idUSL1N0HT20P20131004

But the overall market was little changed, with the Dow and Nasdaq ending down slightly, after the recent sharp run-up in the stock market lost some momentum. The S&P; 500 has risen 6.4 percent since Oct. 8, when it hit its lowest point during the U.S. government’s partial shutdown and the debate over raising the debt ceiling. The benchmark index is up 23.6 percent for the year so far. Relief over the end of the political impasse and investor expectations that the Fed will keep stimulus measures in place for at least several months because of the 16-day shutdown have propped up prices. Fed policymakers will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. “I would like to say it’s all about people waiting for the Fed, but I don’t know what they’re waiting for because I don’t expect any change in Fed policy this week, given the fact they pointed out repeatedly the fiscal issues they’re cognizant of,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “My concern with the market at this level is that without signs eliciting some evidence the economy is actually strengthening from the pace we’ve had, the multiple expansion doesn’t seem rational.” Shares of Apple Inc rose 0.8 percent to $529.88 ahead of the release of its earnings, expected after the bell.   While Apple’s advance helped the S&P; 500, the consumer staples sector index, up 1.2 percent, gave the index its biggest boost. A number of traders appear to be picking up call options on the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR fund on hopes that the sector will continue to perform well through the end of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 1.35 points, or 0.01 percent, to end at 15,568.93. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.34 points, or 0.13 percent, to finish at a record 1,762.11. The S&P; 500 also posted another lifetime intraday high at 1,764.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 3.23 points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 3,940.13. After the bell, Apple’s shares fell 5 percent following the iPhone maker’s results. Among the latest signs that the economy’s momentum may be easing, U.S. manufacturing output barely rose in September and contracts to buy previously owned homes recorded their largest drop in nearly 3-1/2 years, according to economic data released on Monday. On the down side, Dow component Merck & Co fell 2.6 percent to $45.35 and was one of the biggest drags on the Dow after the company reported a decline in sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment, raising concerns about growth prospects for its biggest product. Biogen Idec posted a rise in its third-quarter profit and boosted its full-year earnings and revenue outlook, sending the U.S. biotech company’s stock up 0.9 percent at $254.43.

The S&P; 500 has risen more than 6 percent since Oct. 8, its lowest point during the partial government shutdown and debate over raising the debt ceiling. The gains have sent the benchmark to a series of record highs, largely on investor expectations the Fed will keep stimulus measures in place for at least several months as a result of the damage done to the economy by the political wrangling in Washington. Fed policymakers will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. “You’re not going to have tapering probably until March or June. Energy prices are going down, which will help the consumer discretionaries.

102,BIIB,Biogen's new MS drug tops expectations; ups 2013 forecast,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc on Monday reported $286 million in third-quarter sales of its high-profile new multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, providing fresh evidence that the medicine is off to an impressive launch and exceeding all expectations. The company also reported higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings and raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts, and its shares rose nearly 4 percent before paring gains. In just its second quarter on the market, Tecfidera sales easily topped Wall Street analysts’ increased forecasts of between $205 million and $235 million. It had chalked up sales of $192 million in its first quarter on the market, surpassing initial Wall Street estimates of about $66 million. “Tecfidera crushed (expectations),” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. “This is really, truly incredible.” Tecfidera is the third oral MS drug to market after Gilenya from Novartis and Sanofi’s Aubagio, but is seen as likely to dominate the class. According to IMS, which provides data on prescription medicines, it has already laid claim to being the leading oral drug for multiple sclerosis after just six months, Biogen said. More than 5,000 doctors had already prescribed Tecfidera, Biogen said, with about three-quarters of patients switching over from other drugs, including older Biogen products. Analysts consider the drug to be Biogen’s most important future growth driver and forecast eventual peak annual sales in excess of $3 billion. “The company commentary suggests that the spectacular launch trajectory has started to slow down, but it’s still on track to becoming a dominant, if not the dominant, treatment for MS,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said. The company provided no new details on its efforts to ensure patent protection for Tecfidera in Europe but suggested an approval decision could be coming soon. The drug is approved in Canada and Australia, as well as the United States. Biogen cautioned that there was a possibility of an approval delay for its experimental long-acting drug for hemophilia A, eloctate. It said discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration involved manufacturing issues and not safety of the treatment. “We’re not talking jeopardy to approval here, we’re talking time lines,” Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos told analysts on a conference call. Eloctate approval had been expected late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2014. “We were expecting a time to market advantage,” said Bernstein’s Porges. “If this is a three- to six-month delay it narrows the window to convert patients before rivals come to market.” The U.S. biotechnology company said net profit for the quarter rose to $488 million, or $2.05 per share, from $398 million, or $1.67 per share, a year before. Excluding items, Biogen had adjusted earnings of $2.35 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 25 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Biogen said it now expects 2013 earnings, excluding items, of $8.65 to $8.85, up from its prior forecast of $8.25 to $8.50 per share. Wall Street is forecasting earnings of $8.62 per share for the year. Biogen now sees full-year revenue growth of 23 percent to 25 percent. It had previously projected growth of 22 percent to 23 percent. Revenue for the quarter rose 32 percent to $1.8 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $1.78 billion. Sales of Biogen’s older injectable MS drug Avonex decreased slightly to $733.4 million from $736.2 million a year ago, as the drug likely lost some sales to the company’s own new drug. Biogen reported a 46 percent increase in sales of its other injectable MS drug Tysabri to $401 million, largely due to the company’s acquisition of the portion of the medicine held by Irish drugmaker Elan Corp earlier this year. Biogen now owns full rights to Tysabri. The company also recorded $303 million from its portion of sales of Rituxan, the lymphoma drug it shares with Roche Holding AG. Biogen Idec shares were up 35 cents to $252 in morning trading on Nasdaq after earlier reaching a new high of $262.

The gains this year have largely come from expectations that the Fed would not slow its stimulus policies for several months. The Fed’s policy-making committee will meet Tuesday and  Wednesday and, according to analysts, is extremely unlikely to alter its policies. “In order for the ball to keep rolling on Wall Street, we’ll need to know that the Fed’s stimulus will stay in place, giving us abundant liquidity,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “In the meantime, we’ve gone something like 500 days without a 10 percent correction, and at some point earnings will have to catch up with current valuations.” Third-quarter results have been mixed, with revenue growth a concern in particular. Dow component Merck & Co fell 2.2 percent to $45.52 after reporting a decline in sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment, raising concerns about growth prospects for its biggest product. Biogen Idec posted a rise in its third-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year earnings and revenue outlook. Shares rose 2.3 percent to $257.76. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 17.60 points, or 0.11 percent, at 15,552.68. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.02 points, or 0.00 percent, at 1,759.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3.42 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,939.94. The S&P; 500 is up about 23 percent this year, just shy of the 23.5 percent gain in 2009. Surpassing the 2009 advance would give the index its biggest annual gain in a decade. Much of those gains have come recently, with both the Dow and S&P; 500 posting their third straight week of gains last week. The Nasdaq has climbed for seven of the past eight weeks while the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks  registered its eighth week of gains last week, its longest streak since 2003. Given the length of the rally, weak corporate results could trigger a pullback. Apple, the largest U.S. company by market cap, reports after the market closes and investors are looking for clues into demand for the company’s low-cost iPhone. Tech companies have done well this season, with bellwethers like Microsoft and Amazon.com rallying after results last week. Based on the latest Thomson Reuters data, S&P; 500 earnings are expected to have risen just 3.4 percent in the third quarter, with 69 percent of companies reporting earnings above analysts’ expectations. Revenue growth is seen at 2.2 percent for the quarter, with just 54.2 percent beating sales estimates, below the long-term average of 61 percent. Cable television network AMC Networks Inc on Monday said it agreed to buy Chellomedia, the international content unit of Liberty Global Inc, for about $1.04 billion. AMC fell 2.6 percent to $68.51 while Liberty was flat at $80.20. Mosaic Co agreed to buy CF Industries Holdings Inc’s  phosphate mining and manufacturing business for $1.2 billion in cash. Shares of CF jumped 4 percent to $217.96 while Mosaic was up 1.7 percent at $46.74. Shares of Consol Energy Inc dropped 2.4 percent to $37.27 after the company said it would sell five West Virginia coal mines for $850 million in cash, as well as $184 million in future royalty payments for coal reserves. In the latest economic data, pending home sales slumped 5.6 percent in September, a rate that was far steeper than expected and the biggest drop in more than three years. While markets were little impacted by the report, it did hit housing stocks. Beazer Homes fell 1.3 percent to $19.29 while Toll Brothers was off 1.4 percent to $33.35.",10282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-flat-near-record-levels-merck-falls-idUSL1N0II0SI20131028

The Dow industrials ended at another record high above 16,000. Both the Dow and the S&P; 500 recorded their seventh straight week of gains in what has been a very strong year for stocks. The seven-week advance comes just ahead of December, which since 1950 has been the best month for both the Dow and the S&P.; “We’re advising our clients to take this ride until the end of the year,” said Drew Nordlicht, managing director and partner at Hightower San Diego. The Nasdaq Biotech Index jumped 3 percent, driven by a surge in Biogen Idec. Shares of Biogen shot up 13.2 percent on heavy volume to $285.62 after the company won 10 years of exclusivity protection for its multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, from regulators in Europe. “Healthcare is the place to be. It’s a hot area. People want stocks in healthcare, industrials and consumer discretionary. That’s where tactical investors have been focused, and that’s where the money has been flowing,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc, in San Antonio, Texas. European regulators also recommended approval of a new drug for hepatitis C from Gilead Sciences, which pushed its shares up 3.7 percent to $74.27. The S&P; 500 healthcare sector index has gained 37.5 percent so far in 2013, making it the S&P; 500’s best-performing sector this year. Such moves give investors who have enjoyed some of the 26.5 percent surge in the S&P; 500 this year an opportunity to reduce their positions ahead of an eventual market correction. The CBOE Volatility Index fell 3.2 percent to close at 12.86. With volatility low and the price of options cheap, “you  lighten your stock position, but replace it with a derivative. This way, if the market were to tank, you would lose a lot less on the derivative than you would lose on the stock,” Matousek said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 54.78 points, or 0.34 percent, to end at a record 16,064.77. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 8.91 points, or 0.50 percent, to finish at 1,804.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 22.50 points, or 0.57 percent, to close at 3,991.65.

The Dow extended gains beyond Thursday’s 16,009 close and the S&P; 500 reached an intraday high above 1,800. The Nasdaq Biotech Index rose 2.6 percent, driven by a surge in Biogen Idec.

114,BIIB,Biogen wins protection for MS drug Tecfidera in Europe,"LONDON (Reuters) - Biogen Idec has won regulatory protection for its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera in Europe, paving the way for its launch in markets that could account for a large proportion of future sales. The European Medicines Agency said on Friday it had granted the oral medicine a “new active substance” (NAS) designation, securing Biogen 10 years protection through data exclusivity that will stop generic firms from launching copycat versions. In March, Tecfidera was approved in the United States and also recommended for approval in Europe - but its EU launch has been delayed, pending a resolution of uncertainty over data protection. Without this protection, Biogen would have to rely on relatively weak patents relating the drug’s use, which analysts believe might not prevent generic rivals launching cheaper copies in key markets like Germany. Tecfidera competes with Novartis’ Gilenya and Sanofi’s Aubagio, two other oral therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Oral treatments have proved a popular alternative to traditional drug injections for the debilitating neurological disorder and Tecfidera sales have exceeded market expectations, reaching $286 million in the third quarter. Annual sales are expected to reach $4.55 billion by 2018, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma, with 36 percent of that coming from Europe and other non-U.S. markets. Tecfidera was launched at a U.S. price of $54,900 per patient a year. However, a Biogen executive said at a broker conference last week that Tecfidera might be priced at around half this level in Europe.

Biogen will use Sangamo’s genome-editing technology to develop drugs targeting sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.

Sangamo will also be eligible for milestone payments of about $300 million, as well as double digit royalties on product sales.

121,BIIB,Biogen profit rises as new multiple sclerosis drug shines,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Wednesday its new, high-profile oral multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera had sales of $398 million in the fourth quarter, easily exceeding estimates for a third successive quarter and keeping it on track to top $1 billion in its first year on the market. Some of those sales were due to U.S. inventory stocking ahead of a 10 percent Tecfidera price increase in December. Biogen said underlying patient demand for the drug represented about $348 million of the U.S. sales, still ahead of analysts’ consensus expectations of about $335 million. Biogen provided forecasts for 2014 that were likely to be viewed as a mixed bag, with revenue growth projections ahead of Wall Street expectations but an earnings outlook that fell short of the current analysts’ view. The company forecast revenue growth of about 22 percent to 25 percent and earnings of $11 to $11.20 per share, excluding items. Analysts, on average, were looking for revenue growth of about 20 percent and earnings of $11.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The guidance was very robust on the top line,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “A conservative management team like Biogen starting the year off with guidance that’s significantly above consensus, that’s a strong signal.” The earnings forecast shortfall was likely due to $200 million in the research and development budget that the company has earmarked for future business development, Schmidt said. “The EPS guidance appears conservative in light of revenue growth expectations,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note. “Historically, Biogen has been able to beat initial guidance by 7 percent in the top line and 12 percent in the bottom line.” Investors gave Biogen management the benefit of the doubt, sending shares up nearly 2 percent on a down day for the broader markets. Biogen was one of the best performers of 2013, with the stock soaring more than 90 percent. Investor focus has been squarely on the performance of Tecfidera, which has become the top-selling oral MS treatment in the United States despite being third to market. The company expects European approval in the coming days or weeks, which would be another major catalyst for sales. Biogen said it was set to begin selling the drug in Germany as soon as European Union approval comes through with subsequent launches on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement is secured. The drug is already approved in Australia and Canada. Biogen said more than 6,000 doctors have prescribed Tecfidera so far, and that more than 30 percent of new patients in the fourth quarter had not been on prior therapies, such as Biogen’s injectable MS drugs Avonex and Tysabri. Biogen said its fourth-quarter profit jumped 57 percent, fueled by Tecfidera. The net profit rose to $457.3 million, or $1.92 per share, from $292.1 million, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Biogen earned $2.34 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 39 percent to $1.97 billion, edging past the average analyst estimate of $1.93 billion. Avonex sales were flat at $751 million, but were about 3 percent ahead of analysts’ expectations. Tysabri sales of $427 million fell well short of Wall Street estimates of about $470 million, in part due to an Italian reimbursement dispute that was expected to be settled in the quarter but carried over to 2014. Biogen said Tysabri discontinuation rates improved in the quarter, but that it remained under pressure in Europe due to competition from oral medicines sold by Novartis and Sanofi. The company said it continued to expect approvals this year for hemophilia drugs Eloctate and Alprolix, putting Biogen into that market for the first time. It sees a mid-year launch of Plegridy, a new interferon drug for relapsing MS. Biogen Idec shares rose $5.79 to $311.44 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

126,BIIB,Biogen multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera wins European approval,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc’s high profile new multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera won European approval, the company said on Monday, opening the door for its launch in one of the world’s largest markets for MS treatments. The approval was widely expected after the European Medicines Agency endorsed the drug in November. European health regulators typically follow EMA recommendations within a couple of months. Tecfidera will be the third oral MS drug available in Europe. However, if its impressive early performance in the United States is any indication, the Biogen drug is likely to surpass sales of Novartis’ Gilenya and Aubagio from Sanofi. Tecfidera has consistently shattered Wall Street sales forecasts and is well on the way to racking up more than $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market. Biogen reported Tecfidera sales of $398 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, only the medicine’s third full quarter since winning U.S. approval. It is also approved for sale in Canada and Australia. The introduction in Europe will start in the coming weeks, although its full roll-out will take place over the course of this year and next as Biogen must negotiate reimbursement for the treatment on a country by country basis. First up will be Germany, “where you can get pricing reimbursement rather quickly,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of global commercial operations, said in a telephone interview. “We’re ready to go,” said Kingsley, adding that Biogen’s Germany sales force for the new drug has been in place for months. Tecfidera’s prospects in Europe had been in doubt at one stage because of uncertainty about protection against generic copies. This issue was resolved in November when Biogen won 10 years of regulatory exclusivity. There are an estimated 400,000 people in Europe with multiple sclerosis. Biogen declined to comment on what type of market share Tecfidera was likely to seize in Europe. “We’re very encouraged by our U.S. experience,” Kingsley said. Robert W Baird analyst Christopher Raymond forecast 2014 Tecfidera sales outside the United States of $291 million. Looking further ahead, analysts on average forecast annual worldwide sales of the drug reaching some $6 billion by 2019, with more than a third of that coming from Europe and other non-U.S. markets, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma.

Shares declined late in the session due in part to trades related to options expiration, according to market participants. U.S. home resales, also known as existing home sales, fell more than expected in January and hit an 18 month-low as the combination of cold weather and a lack of housing stock sidelined potential buyers. Traders have selectively dismissed weak economic data, which is being blamed on the extreme weather that has affected large swaths of the United States. An index of homebuilder stocks rose 0.8 percent to hit a nine-month closing high. “The bigger picture theme is we continue to see economic reports that have been pretty underwhelming, but any disappointing data has been shrugged off and attributed to weather,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “You would have expected that the markets would be a fair amount lower than where they are.” The S&P; 500 ended 0.66 percent below its record close of 1,848.38 set on Jan. 15. “The late-day selling was somewhat induced by the futures and options expirations on the close; it’s hard to put too much credence in the market’s action in the last couple hours because there’s so much positioning that has to do with where things close,” James said. February individual equity options and some options  on stock indexes stopped trading at Friday’s close and will settle on Saturday. Typically, options expiration is orderly, but some volatility may occur as players unwind those positions against stock and index products. Volume, however, was below the recent average. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.93 points or 0.19 percent, to end at 16,103.30. The S&P; 500 lost 3.53 points or 0.19 percent, to finish at 1,836.25. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.135 points or 0.10 percent, to close at 4,263.41. For the week, the Dow fell 0.3 percent and the S&P; 500 dipped 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq, up 0.5 percent, scored its third consecutive week of gains. Giving support to equities, data showed that fund investors worldwide poured a net $8.3 billion into funds that specialize in U.S. equities in the week ending Feb. 19. Inflows into global stock funds were $13.4 billion, the biggest in 12 weeks. Shares of Isis Pharmaceuticals surged 15.5 percent to $59 after the company said a mid-stage trial of its experimental treatment for a rare spinal disorder showed that it increased muscle function in children. Shares of Biogen , Isis’ partner in the drug’s development, hit a record high of $349.77 on the news before closing up 3.6 percent at $347.11. Priceline.com stock rose 2.5 percent and ranked as one of the S&P; 500’s biggest gainers, rising to close at a record $1,315.65 a day after the online travel company reported results that beat expectations. Hewlett-Packard Co also reported results that topped expectations, and the computer maker raised its 2014 profit view, though its stock fell 1.3 percent to end at $29.79. Investment firm G Asset Management said it had offered to take a 51 percent stake in either Barnes & Noble Inc or in the bookseller’s Nook digital books and device business. Barnes and Noble shares rose 5.4 percent to $17.69. Shares of Safeway Inc rose 4.3 percent to $36.84 on news that the U.S. grocery store operator is in advanced talks with private equity firm Cerberus Capital over a leveraged buyout deal that may come within the next few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Groupon shares tumbled 21.9 percent to $8.03 a day after the daily deals website unexpectedly forecast a quarterly loss, even as it reported revenue that was ahead of expectations. About 6.55 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, according to the latest available data from BATS Global Markets, below the 7.0 billion average so far in February. Despite the slight drop in the major indexes, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 4 to 3.

Home resales in the United States fell more than expected in January and hit an 18 month-low as the combination of cold weather and a lack of housing stock sidelined potential buyers. Traders continue to selectively dismiss weak economic data which is being blamed on the extreme weather that has affected large swaths of the U.S. territory. An index of homebuilder stocks rose 1 percent and could close at its highest since mid 2007. Giving support to equities, data showed fund investors worldwide poured a net $8.3 billion into funds that specialize in U.S. equities in the week ending Feb. 19. Inflows into global stock funds were $13.4 billion, the biggest in 12 weeks. “You have very strong momentum and there’s cash on the sidelines,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. He said softer data is being dismissed because of the weather and, with the U.S. 10-year note yielding less than 3 percent, “equities are one of the few games in town.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.62 points or 0.07 percent, to 16,122.61, the S&P; 500 gained 0.23 points or 0.01 percent, to 1,840.01 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 1.756 points or 0.04 percent, to 4,269.301. All three indexes are gunning for a third week of advances, and the S&P; is within striking distance of its record close of 1,848.38 reached Jan. 15. Shares of Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 13.6 percent to $58 after the company said a mid-stage trial of its experimental treatment for a rare spinal disorder showed that it increased muscle function in children. Shares of Biogen, Isis’ partner in the drug’s development, hit a record high on the news. Priceline.com rose 3 percent as one of the S&P; 500’s biggest gainers, rising to $1,321.79 a day after reporting results that beat expectations. Hewlett Packard Co also reported results that topped expectations, and the computer maker also raised its 2014 profit view, though shares dipped 1.7 percent to $29.67. Investment firm G Asset Management said it had offered to take a 51 percent stake in either Barnes & Noble Inc or in the bookseller’s Nook digital books and device business. Barnes and Noble shares rose 5.8 percent to $17.76. Groupon shares tumbled 20.1 percent to $8.13 a day after unexpectedly forecasting a quarterly loss, even as it reported revenue that was ahead of expectations. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co  late Thursday forecast 2014 earnings in line with Wall Street expectations and said it expects long-term earnings growth of up to 20 percent per year.

130,BIIB,FDA delays decision on Biogen's multiple sclerosis drug,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration extended the review process for the company’s multiple sclerosis drug by three months to evaluate the application. Biogen, which was expecting to launch the drug, Plegridy, by mid-2014, said the FDA did not ask for additional studies. Plegridy, is an injectable drug designed to reduce the dosing schedule of standard interferon drugs such as Biogen’s own Avonex, which are typically dosed at least once a week. Interferon is hard to tolerate as it leads to flu-like symptoms, prompting patients to delay or discontinue treatment.

132,BIIB,Biogen Idec wins Canadian approval for hemophilia drug Alprolix,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Friday it had won Canadian approval for its long-lasting hemophilia B drug Alprolix. Hemophilia B, a rare inherited disorder in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired, affects some 4,000 people in the United States and roughly 25,000 worldwide. Biogen is developing the drug in partnership with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB. It is expected to be approved in the United States later this year. Traditional hemophilia treatments must be infused two to three times a week, while Biogen’s drug needs to be administered only once a week or once every 10 to 14 days to protect against bleeding episodes. Alprolix is a bioengineered version of the blood coagulation factor IX, a protein needed for normal blood clotting.

Patients with hemophilia A lack or have reduced levels of coagulation factor VIII. Current treatments for hemophilia B generate about $1 billion a year, according to Biogen, while the market for hemophilia A therapies is about $6 billion. If approved in the United States, Alprolix is expected to generate sales of $286 million by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data. Elocate is expected to generate sales of $1.1 billion.

The late-stage trial tested Eloctate in previously treated children under 12 years with severe hemophilia A. The main goal of the study was to evaluate the frequency of antibody development that can interfere with the therapy and none were detected.

141,BIIB,Exclusive: Biogen prices hemophilia drug on par with older therapies,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc is pricing its newly approved long-acting hemophilia drug, Alprolix, to cost U.S. patients, and insurers, about the same per year as older, less convenient therapies whose price can reach about $300,000 annually. The move could pressure rivals such as Pfizer Inc to lower prices for existing hemophilia treatments, which provide patients with life-saving infusions of a blood clotting agent, according to doctors and industry analysts. Biogen last month won U.S. and Canadian approval for Alprolix to treat hemophilia B, the more rare form of the condition that affects about 4,000 people in the United States and about 25,000 worldwide. “We think we have priced (Alprolix) to create parity with existing therapies on an annual cost of therapy basis,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of global commercial operations, told Reuters in a telephone interview. Drug pricing in the U.S. market has come under new scrutiny as state governments and health insurers balk over the $84,000 cost of Sovaldi, a new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. It is the first of several new drugs expected on the market over the next two years that are seen as a major breakthrough in treatment of the liver-destroying disease. Treating two-thirds of the estimated 3.2 million U.S. hepatitis C patients with the drug could top $200 billion, according to some analysts. The Biogen hemophilia drug targets a relatively minuscule patient population. But the U.S. biotechnology company, and its peers including Gilead, have seen their shares drop sharply in recent weeks as investors question how much they will be able to charge for novel medicines in the future. Unlike in Europe and elsewhere, where price controls help keep healthcare costs down and drugs may be rejected outright if they are viewed as too expensive for the benefit they provide, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not allowed to take cost into consideration in approving new medicines, and no such price controls on what drugmakers may charge for their products exist. Extremely high prices for lifesaving drugs for rare diseases and genetic disorders have come under less payer pressure because they treat so few patients, even though they must be taken for a lifetime. In addition, the premium pricing had long been perceived as necessary to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop treatments for extremely rare diseases in order to make the payoff worth their while. The recent pricing pressure has evolved as insurance companies and government health plans, such as Medicare and Medicaid, grapple with the skyrocketing expense of innovative new medicines that could be used by tens of thousands, or millions, of patients. They include therapies combining new cancer drugs that could cost $90,000 or more each for a course of treatment, and the hepatitis C drugs that promise a cure with few side effects. Kingsley said Biogen had been discussing the pricing for its new hemophilia drug prior to the furor over Sovaldi. But it would appear that the company has taken public perception of the new medicine’s cost into consideration. Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos had signaled earlier this year that if he believed Alprolix was likely to be perceived as more of an advance in convenience than efficacy, it would probably be priced on a par with existing treatments. Biogen, which in the next few months expects a U.S. approval decision for another drug to treat the more common hemophilia A, set a price for Alprolix of $2.85 per international unit. That is more than double the price of about $1.19 per unit for Pfizer’s Benefix, one of the most widely used treatments for the disorder. Other approved, older hemophilia B products include Rixubis from Baxter International Inc and Mononine from CSL Behring. But while current drugs are typically needed about two to three times a week, Alprolix is taken once a week or every 10 days, Biogen said. The total annual cost can vary widely based on a patient’s weight, the severity of their clotting deficiency and other factors. Deutsche Bank estimates that Biogen’s hemophilia products can reach annual sales of $1.2 billion by 2017. “We think it’s a meaningful advance in a market that hasn’t seen a significant advance in a decade and a half,” said Kingsley, adding that Alprolix should be available to patients early next month. Hemophilia is a hereditary disorder that prevents blood from clotting properly due to lack of a clotting factor protein in the blood. Patients with more severe hemophilia require larger and more frequent doses of blood clotting factors. Worldwide, about one in 5,000 men are born with hemophilia A and one in 25,000 men are born with hemophilia B each year. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk is also developing a long-acting treatment for hemophilia B, and expects to file next year for regulatory approval. Alprolix is a bioengineered version of the blood coagulation protein known as factor IX, which is needed for normal blood clotting. If not properly treated, hemophilia can lead to bleeding into joints and muscles that can cause stiffness, pain, severe joint damage, disability, and death. Biogen developed the drug in partnership with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum ABN.

142,BIIB,Biogen raises outlook as new MS drug again tops forecasts,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) on Wednesday raised its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts as first-quarter sales of its new Tecfidera multiple sclerosis drug extended a run of eclipsing Wall Street sales expectations. Tecfidera racked up sales of $506 million for the quarter, easily topping analysts’ expectations of about $440 million and the previous quarter’s sales of $398 million. The oral medicine, which was approved in the United States in March 2013, had been on track to become the drug to reach $1 billion in sales in the shortest time. But that pharmaceutical industry record was shattered on Tuesday, when Gildead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) said its Sovaldi hepatitis C treatment logged more than $2 billion in sales in its first full quarter on the market. Based on the strong performance of its MS drugs, Biogen raised its full-year forecast and now expects revenue growth of 26 percent to 28 percent, up from a prior range of 22 percent to 25 percent. The U.S. biotechnology company said it expected 2014 earnings, excluding items, of $11.35 to $11.45 per share, compared with a prior outlook of $11.00 to $11.20. Analysts on average are looking for a profit of $11.32 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Biogen were down 0.6 percent at $304.41 in late afternoon trading. “The raised guidance is a testament to the U.S. beat on Tecfidera sales and signals confidence in both the hemophilia launch as well as the Tecfidera launch in Europe,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said. Biogen plans to begin selling Alprolix, its recently approved long-acting treatment for hemophilia B, in the United States in early May. The company said last week it would price Alprolix on a par with older, less convenient treatments, which should help it get off to a strong start. The company reported net income of $479.9 million, or $2.02 per share for the quarter, compared with $426.7 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Biogen said it earned $2.47 per share, missing the analysts’ average estimate of $2.55. But the company said its earnings were reduced by about 35 cents a share due to a $118 million expense from a collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co (4523.T) on development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments. Without that expense, “the (earnings) number could have been as high as $2.82, which would have crushed expectations,” Yee said. Revenue jumped 51 percent to $2.1 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $1.99 billion. Biogen said $46 million of the Tecfidera sales came from outside the United States. The drug began selling in Germany in February, and the company said it planned to introduce the medicine in additional European countries in the coming months, with reimbursement agreements already secured in Norway and Scotland. “We’re encouraged by the signs from Germany,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of global commercial operations, told analysts and investors on a conference call. Biogen’s older MS drugs also performed well in the quarter. Sales of Avonex rose 2 percent to $761 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $735 million. Tysabri sales were $441 million, an increase of 41 percent, due in part to Biogen’s regaining full rights to the drug in the second quarter of last year. Biogen said some patients were still discontinuing use of Tysabri, but the company had retained 70 percent of that business, primarily due to switchovers to Tecfidera. The company also said in a regulatory filing that it was subpoenaed by state and federal authorities investigating its sales and promotional practices, and by the federal government for documents related to Biogen’s relationship with certain pharmacy benefit managers. The company, which had previously said it was being investigated by governmental authorities, said it was cooperating in the investigations.

The drug began selling in Germany in February, and the company said it planned to introduce the medicine in additional European countries in the coming months, with reimbursement agreements already secured in Norway and Scotland. “We’re encouraged by the signs from Germany,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of global commercial operations, told analysts and investors on a conference call. Biogen’s older MS drugs also performed well in the quarter. Sales of Avonex rose 2 percent to $761 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $735 million. Tysabri sales were $441 million, an increase of 41 percent, due in part to Biogen’s regaining full rights to the drug in the second quarter of last year. Biogen said some patients were still discontinuing use of Tysabri, but the company had retained 70 percent of that business, primarily due to switchovers to Tecfidera. The company also said in a regulatory filing that it was subpoenaed by state and federal authorities investigating its sales and promotional practices, and by the federal government for documents related to Biogen’s relationship with certain pharmacy benefit managers. The company, which had previously said it was being investigated by governmental authorities, said it was cooperating in the investigations.

144,BIIB,Biogen raises outlook as new MS drug again tops forecasts,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) on Wednesday raised its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts as first-quarter sales of its new Tecfidera multiple sclerosis drug extended a run of eclipsing Wall Street sales expectations. Tecfidera racked up sales of $506 million for the quarter, easily topping analysts’ expectations of about $440 million and the previous quarter’s sales of $398 million. The oral medicine, which was approved in the United States in March 2013, had been on track to become the drug to reach $1 billion in sales in the shortest time. But that pharmaceutical industry record was shattered on Tuesday, when Gildead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) said its Sovaldi hepatitis C treatment logged more than $2 billion in sales in its first full quarter on the market. Based on the strong performance of its MS drugs, Biogen raised its full-year forecast and now expects revenue growth of 26 percent to 28 percent, up from a prior range of 22 percent to 25 percent. The U.S. biotechnology company said it expected 2014 earnings, excluding items, of $11.35 to $11.45 per share, compared with a prior outlook of $11.00 to $11.20. Analysts on average are looking for a profit of $11.32 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Biogen were up 1.1 percent at $309.66 in premarket trading. “The raised guidance is a testament to the U.S. beat on Tecfidera sales and signals confidence in both the hemophilia launch as well as the Tecfidera launch in Europe,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said. Biogen plans to begin selling Alprolix, its recently approved long-acting treatment for hemophilia B, in the United States in early May. The company said last week it would price Alprolix on a par with older, less-convenient treatments, which should help it get off to a strong start. The company reported net income of $479.9 million, or $2.02 per share for the quarter, compared with $426.7 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Biogen said it earned $2.47 per share, missing the analysts’ average estimate of $2.55. But the company said its earnings were reduced by about 35 cents a share due to a $118 million expense from a collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co (4523.T) on development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments. Without that expense, “the (earnings) number could have been as high as $2.82, which would have crushed expectations,” Yee said.

148,BIIB,"Biogen, Sobi pledge hemophilia drug donation in developing world","(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc and partner Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB on Monday said they will donate hemophilia drugs for use in developing nations in quantities large enough to treat tens of thousands of patients over the next decade. The potentially life-saving clotting factor medicines would be intended for use in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, where three quarters of the world’s 400,000 hemophilia sufferers have limited or no access to such drugs, and where most fail to live into adulthood as a result. Biogen and Sobi announced their intention to donate one billion international units of clotting factor drugs over 10 years at the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) meeting in Melbourne, Australia. “WFH do their work in countries that consume less than 1 iu per capita. That’s a level below which people are dying, where they don’t even have enough to treat the life-threatening bleeds,” Paula Cobb, Biogen’s head of hematology, said in a telephone interview.  Hemophilia, an inherited disorder in which the blood does not clot properly, is a new therapeutic area for Biogen. The companies last month received U.S. approval for Alprolix, which treats the more rare hemophilia B. The success of the humanitarian effort will hinge on Food and Drug Administration approval of Eloctate for hemophilia A, which would account for at least 85 percent of the donated product. That approval is expected later this year. Biogen, based in Weston, Massachusetts and Stockholm-based Sobi initially committed to donate up to 500 million units to WFH over five years. The remaining 500 million units will be made available for future distribution. The drugs would primarily be used for emergency treatments rather than preventive care as is common in the developed world, where a year of treatment can cost upwards of $300,000. The quantity of donated product would enable doctors to treat more than 75,000 joint bleeding episodes, more than 2,000 life-threatening bleeds and to perform thousands of surgical procedures that would not be possible without access to clotting drugs, the companies said. “We wanted to do something significant that would change and really shift the way donation programs in that field will work,” said John Cox, Biogen’s head of manufacturing and supply. He added that he hopes other companies would be prompted follow suit. It was not possible to put a commercial value on the donation as Biogen has yet to set a price for Eloctate. Alprolix was priced at $2.85 per unit. “It is tens of millions of dollars in terms of internal manufacturing supply and cost,” Cox said. Drugmakers, under pressure from the international community over the high prices of their medicines, have sought to burnish their images by offering HIV drugs and other medicines at drastically reduced cost in Africa and poor nations in other regions. Biogen officials said they were responding to a plea for help from the WFH. “Trying to price this for the developing world was not part of the conversation. When we sat down with the executive team, it was not a public relations discussion,” Cox said.

153,BIIB,U.S. FDA approves Biogen's hemophilia A drug Eloctate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it approved Biogen Idec Inc’s long-lasting hemophilia A drug, Eloctate, adding another product to the company’s nascent portfolio of drugs for non-malignant blood disorders. Hemophilia A is a rare, inherited blood-clotting disorder that can lead to prolonged bleeding, bruising and joint and tissue damage. It is caused by deficient levels in the body of factor VIII, a protein needed to clot the blood. The FDA’s ruling followed its approval in March of Biogen’s hemophilia B treatment, Alprolix. Biogen developed both drugs with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi, and expects the products to form the basis of a new non-malignant blood disorder portfolio. “We see Alprolix and Eloctate as the anchor tenants in a growing franchise,” said Douglas Williams, Biogen’s head of research and development. “We’re in this space to stay.”    Biogen’s biggest products are currently the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex, Tecfidera and Tysabri.     Eloctate is expected to generate annual sales of $1.5 billion by 2019, according to the average estimate of six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Sales of Alprolix are expected to generate annual sales of $286 million over the same time period.     Current treatments for hemophilia B generate about $1 billion a year, according to Biogen, while the market for hemophilia A therapies is worth about $6 billion.     Hemophilia A is the more common form of the disease, affecting about 16,000 people in the United States, Biogen said. Hemophilia B affected about 4,000 people.     Hemophilia drugs must be infused two to three times a week to prevent bleeding episodes. Eloctate cuts the number of doses needed per week to between three and five days. Biogen has not set a price for the drug, but Tony Kingsley, head of commercial operations, said the cost for patients who switch from a short-acting product to Biogen’s longer-acting product should be roughly the same, even though they will be dosing themselves less frequently.     Last month, Weston, Massachusetts-based Biogen and Stockholm-based Sobi said they would donate hemophilia drugs for use in developing nations in quantities large enough to treat tens of thousands of patients over the next decade.

156,BIIB,"Biogen, AbbVie drug slows MS episodes, safety issues recur","(Reuters) - A drug approved to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys significantly reduced relapses of multiple sclerosis in a late stage-trial sponsored by Biogen Idec and AbbVie Inc, but serious infections and potential liver toxicity continued to cloud the drug’s future. The Phase III international study of the medicine, called daclizumab, involved more than 1,800 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the most common form of MS, which can lead to disability and paralysis.  The companies disclosed partial results from the new trial on Monday.  The study, called DECIDE, tested monthly injections of daclizumab against weekly injections of Biogen’s blockbuster Avonex (interferon beta-1a) treatment for MS.  Patients taking daclizumab, which is meant to tame the immune system by blocking a protein called the CD25 receptor, had 45 percent fewer annual relapses than those receiving Avonex. In addition, patients taking daclizumab had 54 percent  fewer new or enlarging brain and spinal lesions at week 96 of the study, compared to those taking Avonex; those results met a secondary goal of the study. The overall incidence of side effects was similar in both patient groups. But there was a two-fold higher incidence of serious infections among those taking daclizumab, at 4 percent, as well as a two-fold higher incidence of elevated liver enzymes - a potential marker for liver toxicity. Daclizumab would be a new approach to treating MS, if it is approved for the condition. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the decline in annual relapses seen with daclizumab was a bit less impressive than the reductions of 52 percent, versus Avonex, achieved in earlier trials by the oral medication Gilenya, which is made by Novartis AG. Gilenya had sales of $1.9 billion last year. “Our first impression is that these results are good enough for (daclizumab) to be competitive” with Gilenya and other oral treatments, Arfaei said in a research note. He predicted the Biogen/AbbVie drug could be introduced in 2016 and conservatively generate U.S. sales of $256 million by 2018. Biogen and AbbVie said they would discuss with health regulators the timing for potential marketing applications for daclizumab.  Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG introduced daclizumab in 1997 to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys, under the brand name Zenapax.

The companies disclosed partial results from the new trial on Monday. Shares of both Biogen and AbbVie were little changed in morning trading. In the study, called DECIDE, once-monthly injections of daclizumab were tested against once-weekly injections of Biogen’s blockbuster Avonex (interferon beta-1a) treatment for MS. Patients taking daclizumab, which is meant to tame the immune system by blocking a protein called the CD25 receptor, had 45 percent fewer annual relapses than those receiving Avonex. Moreover, patients taking daclizumab had 54 percent  fewer new or enlarging brain and spinal lesions at week 96 of the study, compared to those taking Avonex, thereby meeting a secondary goal of the study. The overall incidence of side effects was similar in both patient groups. But there was a two-fold higher incidence of serious infections among those taking daclizumab, at 4 percent, as well as a two-fold higher incidence of elevated liver enzymes - a potential marker for liver toxicity. Daclizumab would be a new approach to treating MS, if it is approved for the condition. Biogen and AbbVie said they would discuss with health regulators timing for potential marketing applications for the drug. MS is believed to be caused by overactive immune system cells, called t-cells, that attack and destroy the protective covering of nerves.

160,BIIB,UPDATE 4-Biogen revenue trounces forecast as MS drug sales surge,"(Adds analyst comment, closes shares) By Ransdell Pierson July 23 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc reported blowout quarterly results and raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday on surging sales of its new Tecfidera oral treatment for multiple sclerosis, boosting shares 11 percent. “These are spectacular results, and this is one of the biggest profit beats for Biogen I’ve seen in years,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Tecfidera, which was approved in March 2013, posted sales of $700 million in the second quarter, making it one of the fastest-growing prescription medicines in history. U.S. sales of $585 million far exceeded Wall Street forecasts in the $485 million range. The drug is taking flight as patients with the progressive neurological disease move from injectable treatments to more convenient pills, including Novartis AG’s Gilenya and Sanofi SA’s Aubagio. Gilenya, with annual sales of more than $2 billion, in 2010 became the first pill approved for MS, followed by Aubagio, which has annual sales of about $400 million. But Gilenya has been associated with cardiovascular risks, and reports of sudden death, while Aubagio is deemed to be somewhat lacking in potency and raises the risk of liver problems. “Tecfidera has the best balance of efficacy and safety” among the three oral agents, said Robert Baird and Co analyst Chris Raymond. He said Tecfidera, which costs about $48,000 a year in the United States and about $30,000 in Europe, could eventually reap annual sales of up to $6 billion. “Clearly, if you have to take a chronic therapy, you’d rather take a pill than an injection,” he said. Multiple sclerosis affects an estimated 2.3 million people worldwide. The condition, often leading to paralysis, is caused by damage to the protective myelin sheath of nerves and is believed to be the result of attacks by an overactive immune system. Biogen’s revenue jumped 40 percent to $2.42 billion, about $250 million above Wall Street expectations. Earnings of $3.49 per share, excluding special items, blew past the $2.83 average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results prompted Biogen to raise its 2014 earnings outlook to between $12.90 and $13.10 per share. In April, it had forecast $11.35 to $11.45. RBC Capital Markets’ Yee said he believed Biogen would likely beat analysts’ estimates in coming quarters and keep raising its forecasts. Avonex, an injectable interferon treatment for MS that is still Biogen’s biggest product, posted slightly lower sales of $774 million. Sales of Tysabri, a high-potency infused MS treatment, leaped 38 percent to $533 million. That included $54 million of previously deferred revenue from Italy. The company on Wednesday received European approval for a longer-lasting interferon treatment for MS called Plegridy that is awaiting U.S. approval. Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said he expects Plegridy sales of close to $300 million next year, as some patients switch from Avonex. Leading rival MS brands include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s Copaxone and its newer version, which is taken less frequently. Others include Bayer AG’s Betaseron and Rebif from Pfizer Inc. Biogen is conducting mid-stage trials of an MS drug meant to restore myelin and thereby improve physical and cognitive function. But data from the trial is not expected until 2016, and Schmidt cautioned that it was a high-risk “speculative” effort. Biogen said it earned $723.1 million, or $3.01 per share, in the quarter, versus $491 million, or $2.06 per share, a year earlier. Shares of Biogen closed up $33.93, or 11.2 percent, to $337.60 on the Nasdaq.

163,BIIB,Biogen wins U.S. approval of long acting multiple sclerosis drug,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Friday approved Biogen Idec Inc’s Plegridy, a long-acting multiple sclerosis drug that the company expects will eventually replace its older big-selling Avonex treatment. The company received European approval on July 23 for the drug that is intended to reduce relapses of the debilitating disease and slow its progression. Plegridy, like Avonex, is a type of interferon. It is designed to be injected every two weeks compared with weekly injections for Avonex. It is also injected subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly, meaning it requires a smaller needle. Some other MS treatments from the interferon class of medicines, such as Pfizer Inc’s Rebif, are dosed more frequently than Avonex. Biogen said it will continue to support Avonex, which has compiled global sales of more than $1.5 billion in the first half of this year, for patients who are comfortable with the treatment and not looking to switch. Avonex has U.S. patent protection until 2026, Biogen said. The company expects Plegridy to diminish Avonex sales and take market share from other rivals even as overall sales from the class decline with the increasing popularity of oral treatments, such as Biogen’s Tecfidera, which was approved in 2013. “We believe Plegridy has the potential to be the leading interferon on the market,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of global commercial operations, said in a telephone interview. “As the class shrinks, we will be in a position gain share within that class,” Kingsley said. “The most convenient product wins over time.” The company will be ready to launch the new drug quickly, Kingsley said, as it already had the MS sales force in place, given its existing portfolio of three other medicines, including Tysabri. The FDA nod marks the fourth U.S. approval for Biogen in the last 16 months along with Tecfidera and two recently approved long-acting hemophilia drugs, Alprolix and Eloctate, that put the MS focused company into a new therapeutic category.

Indexes had traded in positive territory for much of the session, putting the S&P; 500 on track for a fifth straight day of gains. Earnings initially drove the move higher, with technology and material shares up on the back of strong results. Market benchmarks began drifting lower after the government reported a surprise increase in crude oil inventories. Energy shares were off 1.7 percent as crude oil fell, settling near $80 per barrel. Canada’s capital was jolted by the fatal shooting of a soldier and an attack on the parliament building in which gunshots were fired outside a room where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking. Toronto stocks fell 1.6 percent, also affected by oil’s slide. “The situation out of Ottawa hastened the decline a bit, but I think it started with oil because people are very concerned about global growth,” said John Canally, chief economic and investment strategist for LPL Financial. If the Ottawa shooting is related to domestic terrorism, Canally added, “it’ll put weight on the markets along with global growth.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 153.49 points, or 0.92 percent, to 16,461.32, the S&P; 500 lost 14.17 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,927.11 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 36.63 points, or 0.83 percent, to 4,382.85. Weaker oil and the Canada violence offset some encouraging economic news. U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in September as energy costs fell broadly, painting a weak inflation picture that could give the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates low. Among the day’s earnings movers, Biogen Idec fell 5.4 percent to $309.07 after sales of its multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, fell short of lofty expectations. Boeing Co lost 4.5 percent to $121.91, giving back most of the gains from the four prior sessions. Boeing reported higher-than-expected earnings and lifted its outlook, but analysts raised concern about the costs of the 787 Dreamliner.

169,BIIB,Biogen's Tecfidera sales miss estimates; confirms first PML case,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Wednesday sales of its big-selling new multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera fell short of Wall Street’s lofty expectations, and the company confirmed a serious brain infection in a patient who took the oral medication, sending its shares 7 percent lower. Biogen reported the first case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a Tecfidera patient, who had been part of a clinical trial and was taking the drug for 4-1/2 years. The patient, who died of pneumonia, had been suffering severe lymphopenia, a low white blood cell condition, for more than three years, which Biogen said was a risk factor for developing PML. Biogen, which has notified health regulators of the PML case, said 100,000 patients have taken Tecfidera. The drug, which has far exceeded expectations since its March 2013 U.S. approval, had sales of $787 million in the third quarter. Analysts, who in previous quarters had watched Tecfidera sail past their sales estimates, were looking for about $800 million. “We’ve always expected that Tecfidera’s growth rate would moderate over time,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of commercial operations, said on a conference call. Shares of the U.S. biotechnology company fell $22.55 to  $304.21 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon. While Tecfidera has had a clean safety record throughout its  clinical trials and commercial use, PML has long been a concern associated with long-term treatment of MS drugs. Biogen’s injectable MS drug Tysabri was pulled from the market in February of 2005 after three cases of the rare brain infection - two of them fatal - were reported among users. U.S. health regulators allowed it back on the market with certain restrictions in June 2006 after campaigning by patients who felt the medicine was so effective they were willing to take on the PML risk. “We think the risk/benefit is clearly still in favor of using Tecfidera for nearly all patients,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.    Biogen reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, primarily on lower business development and research and development spending expectations. It now estimates 2014 earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.55, up from its previous forecast of $12.90 to $13.10, excluding items. “For a company that’s been beating and crushing numbers, it’s hard to see people getting terribly excited about this,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said. “You have to wonder if this is the new normal for Biogen or whether they can resume that spectacular growth.” Biogen’s net profit jumped to $856.1 million, or $3.62 per share, from $487.6 million, or $2.05 per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Biogen earned $3.80 per share, exceeding analysts’ average expectations by 34 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 37 percent to $2.5 billion, roughly in line with estimates of $2.48 billion. Tysabri had sales of $501 million, beating analyst expectations of about $485 million. The company’s interferon-based MS drugs, Avonex and new longer-acting Plegridy, had combined sales of $745 million, missing Wall Street estimates of about $767 million. Avonex has lost market share to Tecfidera. Biogen said 40 percent of patients switching MS treatments have chosen Tecfidera. “With all of their MS products you have to wonder is there enough incremental revenue to support continued growth or are they just cannibalizing the rest of their franchise every time they launch a new product,” Porges said.

The patient, who died of pneumonia, had been suffering severe lymphopenia, a low white blood cell condition, for more than three years, which Biogen said was a risk factor for developing PML. Biogen, which has notified health regulators of the PML case, said 100,000 patients have taken Tecfidera. The drug, which has far exceeded expectations since its March 2013 U.S. approval, had sales of $787 million in the third quarter. Analysts, who in previous quarters had watched Tecfidera sail past their sales estimates, were looking for about $800 million. “We’ve always expected that Tecfidera’s growth rate would moderate over time,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of commercial operations, said on a conference call. Shares of the U.S. biotechnology company fell $22.55 to  $304.21 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon. While Tecfidera has had a clean safety record throughout its  clinical trials and commercial use, PML has long been a concern associated with long-term treatment of MS drugs. Biogen’s injectable MS drug Tysabri was pulled from the market in February of 2005 after three cases of the rare brain infection - two of them fatal - were reported among users. U.S. health regulators allowed it back on the market with certain restrictions in June 2006 after campaigning by patients who felt the medicine was so effective they were willing to take on the PML risk. “We think the risk/benefit is clearly still in favor of using Tecfidera for nearly all patients,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Biogen reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, primarily on lower business development and research and development spending expectations. It now estimates 2014 earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.55, up from its previous forecast of $12.90 to $13.10, excluding items. “For a company that’s been beating and crushing numbers, it’s hard to see people getting terribly excited about this,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said. “You have to wonder if this is the new normal for Biogen or whether they can resume that spectacular growth.” Biogen’s net profit jumped to $856.1 million, or $3.62 per share, from $487.6 million, or $2.05 per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Biogen earned $3.80 per share, exceeding analysts’ average expectations by 34 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 37 percent to $2.5 billion, roughly in line with estimates of $2.48 billion. Tysabri had sales of $501 million, beating analyst expectations of about $485 million. The company’s interferon-based MS drugs, Avonex and new longer-acting Plegridy, had combined sales of $745 million, missing Wall Street estimates of about $767 million. Avonex has lost market share to Tecfidera. Biogen said 40 percent of patients switching MS treatments have chosen Tecfidera. “With all of their MS products you have to wonder is there enough incremental revenue to support continued growth or are they just cannibalizing the rest of their franchise every time they launch a new product,” Porges said.

171,BIIB,"US STOCKS-Wall St turns lower as Boeing, Biogen weigh","* Indexes turn lower in afternoon trading * Broadcom and Yahoo rally after results * Fall in crude oil weighs on energy shares * Indexes down: Dow 0.4 pct, S&P; 0.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.5 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks turned lower in afternoon trading on Wednesday, with major indexes erasing earlier gains as both Boeing and Biogen sold off following their results. Indexes had traded in positive territory for much of the session, putting the S&P; 500 on track for a fifth straight day of gains. Earnings drove the move higher, with technology and material shares up on the back of strong results. Biogen Idec was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500, falling 7 percent to $303.88 after the company reported sales of its big-selling new multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, that fell short of Wall Street’s lofty expectations. It also reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast. Boeing Co lost 3.4 percent to $122.83 despite reporting higher-than-expected earnings and lifting its outlook, as analysts raised concern about the costs of the 787 Dreamliner. Its decline comes after a rise of 5.8 percent over the four previous sessions. Along with healthcare and industrial names, energy shares  were among the day’s biggest decliners, off 0.5 percent as crude oil lost 1.1 percent. On the upside, Yahoo Inc and Broadcom  rallied a day after both tech companies reported better-than-expected revenue. Broadcom shares climbed 6 percent to $39.59 while Yahoo was up 4.4 percent at $41.96; the two made up the S&P; 500’s top percentage gainers. “The season has been mixed, and the global economy is a concern for big multinational companies, but the fact that the market can shake off some bad reports is indicative of what good footing it is on right now,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville. In the latest economic data, consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in September as energy costs fell broadly, painting a weak inflation picture that should give the Federal Reserve ample room to keep interest rates low for a while. At 12:51 p.m. Eastern time, the Dow Jones industrial average  fell 70.24 points, or 0.42 percent, to 16,544.57, the S&P; 500 lost 5.63 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,935.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.67 points, or 0.49 percent, to 4,397.81.

The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 44 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 53 new highs and 20 new lows. The S&P; 500 moved 14.07 points from its session high to its session low, a move that is below the 15.6 point average over the past 250 sessions. Wednesday marks the first time the S&P; has had a below-average point move since Sept. 23.

Eloctate is approved to treat congenital hemophilia A, not acquired hemophilia A) Drugmaker Baxter International Inc said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved its drug for treating bleeding episodes in adults with a rare bleeding disorder. The drug, Obizur, has been approved for use in patients with acquired hemophilia A, which usually affects older adults, Baxter said in a statement.  The drug will be launched in the United States in the coming months and is being reviewed by European and Canadian regulators, the company said. Obizur will compete with Biogen Idec Inc’s Eloctate, which was approved in June. Both the drugs are long-acting treatments.  Hemophilia A is a rare blood-clotting disorder that can lead to prolonged bleeding, bruising and joint and tissue damage. It is caused by deficiency of factor VIII, a protein needed to clot the blood. The rarer form of the condition is hemophilia B, caused by deficiency to another protein, factor IX. The FDA had in March approved Biogen’s hemophilia B treatment, Alprolix, a bioengineered version of factor IX.  Other approved hemophilia B treatments include Baxter’s Rixubis, Pfizer Inc’s Benefix and CSL Behring Ltd’s Mononine. Baxter’s shares were up about 1 percent at $69.66 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Shares of Biogen, whose main drugs treat multiple sclerosis, were up 6 percent in midday trading on the Nasdaq. Douglas Williams, speaking at the Deutsche Bank BioFEST conference, said the encouraging data was seen in a Phase 1b trial of its BIIB037 drug. It was tested in patients with mild symptoms of the progressive neurological disease, or in those who did not yet have apparent symptoms but had other possible signs of Alzheimer’s. The medicine, like many other experimental Alzheimer’s drugs that have failed in studies or are continuing to be tested, blocks beta amyloid, a protein that plays a key role in the buildup of toxic plaques in the brain that are considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s.     “We are preparing to implement a Phase III study in early Alzheimer’s as soon as we can,” company spokeswoman Kate Niazi-Sai said after Williams’ presentation. The most significant side effects seen with BIIB037 were signs of possible brain swelling and tiny hemorrhages, which the company described as “largely mild to moderate, and self-resolving.” Brain swelling has been a recurrent issue with experimental anti-amyloid Alzheimer’s drugs, including with bapineuzumab from Pfizer Inc and solanezumab from Eli Lilly and Co. It has also been closely associated with an experimental class of drugs called gamma secretase inhibitors that have largely been abandoned. Pfizer and its partner Johnson & Johnson discontinued bapineuzumab after it failed in big late-stage trials to significantly improve cognition in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. But Lilly continues to test solananezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer’s.  One of the biggest hopes for patients is another class of Alzheimer’s drugs called BACE inhibitors. They block an enzyme called beta secretase which plays a key role in production of beta amyloid. Eli Lilly, Merck & Co are considered furthest along in testing such drugs. As many as 5 million people in the United States and 36 million globally are believed to have Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia.

Shares of Biogen were up 6.8 percent in morning trading on the Nasdaq. Douglas Williams said at the Deutsche Bank BioFEST conference that encouraging data was seen in a Phase 1b trial of its BIIB037 drug. The medicine was tested in patients with mild symptoms of the progressive neurological disease, or in patients who did not yet have apparent symptoms but had other possible signs of Alzheimer’s. “We are preparing to implement a Phase III study in early Alzheimer’s as soon as we can,” a company spokeswoman said after Williams’ presentation.

Energy shares continued to struggle amid ongoing volatility in the price of oil. U.S. crude futures fell 2 percent to $67.58 per barrel, contributing to the 0.5 percent decline in the S&P; Energy sector, the worst-performing industry group of 2014. Chesapeake Energy fell 1.3 percent to $19.80 while Devon Energy was off 1.3 percent at $59.14. Crude is down more than 30 percent from a recent peak, and analysts expect the group’s weakness to persist. “Fourth-quarter earnings estimates for the energy sector are down about 20 percent, which is significant. There’s going to be really broad pain when that materializes,” said James Liu, global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. “The broader market should be able to weather this storm, but it will still take a hit.” In the latest deal news, Cypress Semiconductor Corp  agreed to buy Spansion Inc in an all-stock deal valued at about $4 billion. Separately, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said it would buy Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $3.5 billion. Cypress rose 17 percent to $12.20 while Spansion was up 22 percent at $27.97 on heavy volume. Avanir added 13 percent to $16.96. Biogen Idec Inc advanced 6 percent to $327.03 as the S&P;’s biggest advancing stock on favorable data from the Phase III trial of an Alzheimer’s drug. Digital Ally jumped 25 percent to $16.08 on heavy volume a day after U.S. President Barack Obama urged lawmakers to spend $263 million over three years on 50,000 body-worn cameras and law enforcement training programs as part of federal response to civil rights protests in Ferguson, Missouri.

The German company in March unveiled plans to spend more than 500 million euros ($622 million) to set up haemophilia drug production sites in Germany, in a sign of confidence in its development pipeline. Patients have seen new treatment options and more are in the offing. U.S. regulators earlier this year approved Biogen Idec’s  long-lasting haemophilia A drug Eloctate and hemophilia B treatment Alprolix, both co-developed with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB. Novo Nordisk has two long-acting drugs against type A and B in the third and last phase of testing required for regulatory approval. Bayer’s established haemophilia A therapy product Kogenate, had 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in sales last year. Apart from Bay 81-8973, which Bayer aims to bring to U.S. and European markets, the company has another drug candidate against the type A of the bleeding disorder in the third and last phase of testing. Bayer has previously said it expects to seek approval for this drug, known as Damoctocog alfa pegol, in mid-2016. People with haemophilia have a fault in a gene that regulates the body’s production of proteins called clotting factors. This can cause spontaneous bleeding as well as severe bleeding following injuries or surgery.

187,BIIB,Biogen shares fall after optic nerve study results seen as mixed,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said an experimental drug showed evidence of biological repair of the optic nerve in patients with acute inflammation of the optic nerve, but shares fell as analysts wondered how promising the mid-stage study results were. The drug is also being tested in patients with multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease that attacks the protective covers of nerve cells, and investors have been watching for the results of the acute optic neuritis study for an indication of how the treatment might fare in that study. The trial on the drug, called Anti-LINGO-1, demonstrated an improvement in recovery of optic nerve latency, or the time it takes for a signal to travel from the retina to the visual cortex, Biogen said. The company said it showed a 34 percent improvement versus a placebo treatment.  The company said that in the intent-to-treat population, which includes patients who did not complete the study, there was a positive trend, but results did not reach statistical significance.  The drug failed to meet the trial’s secondary endpoint, including change in thickness of the retinal layers and visual function, Biogen said.  “These data certainly do not make us more positive that it will work in MS. If anything, the only clinical evidence we have on LINGO suggests it is less likely to work,” UBS AG analyst Matthew Roden wrote in a research note. Biogen shares fell 2.4 percent to $345 after rising as much as 6 percent in premarket trading. Biogen described the study results as being positive.      “This is the first clinical trial to provide evidence of biological repair in the central nervous system by facilitating remyelination following an acute inflammatory injury,” Alfred Sandrock, Biogen chief medical officer said in a statement.  Remyelination is the regeneration of the insulating myelin sheath of a nerve.  The most common cause of acute optic neuritis is multiple sclerosis, an area where Biogen has produced the leading drugs  Tecfidera and Tysabri. Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams described the data as mixed but said that the signal of activity was encouraging.  Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note the data was “encouraging, but certainly not definitive.” Biogen said there were 82 patients in the trial, that the drug was generally well tolerated and that three people experienced severe adverse effects.  A Biogen spokeswoman described the number of people who did not finish the study as being low, but didn’t provide a figure.

190,BIIB,Biogen to buy private U.K. company with chronic pain drug,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) on Sunday said it would buy small, privately-held Convergence Pharmaceuticals to acquire the U.K.-based company’s portfolio of experimental drugs for chronic nerve pain. The U.S. biotech company, known for its roster of multiple sclerosis medicines, said it would pay Convergence shareholders $200 million up front. Under the terms of the agreement, they would also be eligible to receive up to $475 million more for the achievement of future development milestones. The centerpiece of the acquisition is Convergence’s drug for trigeminal neuralgia, a condition that causes episodes of debilitating facial pain. The drug, CVN1014802, recently had positive results from a midstage trial in which it reduced the severity of pain and number of episodes compared with a placebo. The drug is also being tested for the painful back condition commonly known as sciatica, and has potential as a treatment for other nerve pain conditions, Biogen said. Convergence, formed by investors in 2010 based on drug candidates acquired from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), will continue to operate out of Cambridge, England, Biogen said. “We believe their industry-leading talent, capabilities and pipeline of candidates, starting with CNV1014802, will provide a strong foundation upon which to expand our neuropathic pain portfolio,” Biogen research chief Douglas Williams said in a statement.

192,BIIB,Biogen forecasts 2015 earnings well ahead of Street view,"(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter profit and issued a 2015 earnings forecast that both sailed past Wall Street estimates, driven by strong sales of its oral multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, sending shares more than 7 percent higher.  For 2015, Biogen sees adjusted earnings of $16.60 to $17 per share, compared with analysts’ estimates for $16.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The U.S. biotechnology company forecast 2015 revenue growing 14 percent to 16 percent over 2014 revenue of $9.7 billion. After a quarter in which Tecfidera sales fell short of analysts’ estimates for the first time, the drug topped expectations in the fourth quarter. The company reported  Tecfidera sales of $916 million, while Wall Street was looking for about $880 million. Biogen Chief Executive Officer George Scangos, on a call with analysts, said Tecfidera is now the most prescribed multiple sclerosis (MS) drug in Germany and most prescribed oral MS treatment in the United States.  “We believe Tecfidera will continue to grow in the U.S. and  grow substantially in Europe,” Scangos said. The company said it has secured reimbursement for Tecfidera in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. It expects to gain full reimbursement across other major European markets this year. The biotechnology company posted a net profit of $883 million, or $3.74 per share, compared with a profit of $457.3 million, or $1.92 per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Biogen earned $4.09 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 31 cents. Revenue rose 34 percent to $2.64 billion, matching Wall Street expectations. Sales of the injectable MS drug Tysabri of $484 million fell short of Wall Street estimates of $509 million. But sales of interferon-based MS drugs Avonex and the new longer-lasting Plegridy came in at $777 million, topping estimates of about $757 million. The company said about half of Plegridy patients were switching from Avonex with the rest new patients. The company’s new hemophilia drugs, Alprolix and Eloctate, posted sales of $40 million and $37 million. Biogen shares rose to $379 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $353.25.

194,BIIB,UPDATE 1-Dementia drug research aided by $100 mln venture capital fund,"* Innovative method for financing dementia research * Backers include British govt, GSK, J&J;, Pfizer, Lilly, Biogen * J.P. Morgan acted as financial adviser   (Adds plan for additional investment, J.P. Morgan role) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The world’s first venture capital fund dedicated to finding new ways to prevent and treat dementia has raised more than $100 million with the backing of the British government and several of the world’s leading drugmakers. The global Dementia Discovery Fund is unique in focusing on a single difficult to treat disorder and in bringing together industry and government. Drug companies involved include GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Biogen Idec. The initiative, announced by Britain’s health minister Jeremy Hunt at a meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, follows a Group of Eight (G8) nations conference in London in December 2013 that set a goal of finding a cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia by 2025. GSK’s head of research and development Patrick Vallance told Reuters the 2025 goal was “hugely ambitious” but that pooling resources through the new fund to back promising ideas from academic groups and small biotech firms would help to accelerate research. “It’s tough to crack but the science is moving,” Vallance said. “People are now beginning to look at subsets of dementia and the genetics of neurodegeneration, so there are real opportunities.” Venture capital funds are a common source of finance for high-risk, early-stage life science research, but the new fund is the first to focus solely on dementia. The British government, which has worked with J.P. Morgan  as financial adviser in setting up the fund, said that additional interested investors would have an opportunity to participate at a later stage. As well as providing financial support, research projects that secure the fund’s backing will gain expert advice during the critical early stages of research, with charity Alzheimer’s Research UK also involved alongside industry. Individual pharmaceutical companies wanting to go on to  develop particular projects commercially will be able to bid for rights to do so, with money raised from the bidding process to be reinvested in the fund. The British government, as project leader, is contributing $22 million, while GSK is putting in $25 million and J&J; $10 million, with further money coming from other companies. Dementia, of which Alzheimer’s is the most common form, affects close to 50 million people worldwide and is set to reach 135 million by 2050, according to non-profit campaign group Alzheimer’s Disease International. There is still no treatment that can slow the progression of Alzheimer’s. Current drugs can do no more than ease some of the symptoms.

195,BIIB,Biogen's Alzheimer's drug slows mental decline in early study,"(Reuters) - An experimental drug from Biogen Idec Inc became the  first Alzheimer’s treatment to significantly slow cognitive decline and reduce what is believed to be brain-destroying plaque in patients with early and mild forms of the disease, according to a small study likely to reignite hopes of a treatment. Alzheimer’s affects 15 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to grow to 75 million by 2030 without effective treatments, likely costing billions of dollars year. Any effective treatment is likely to become one of the world’s most lucrative drugs, but the Biogen drug faces years of testing and would not reach the market much before 2020, even if all goes well, analysts said. Biogen shares were up 6.5 percent, or $27.97, at $461.92 in morning trading, after rising as high as $480.18. Biogen is entering a field littered with expensive failures from such drug makers as Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co. Lilly and Roche Holding AG are both conducting trials on drugs that work the same way as Biogen’s, by blocking beta amyloid, a protein that forms toxic brain plaques that are theoretically an underlying cause of the degenerative brain disease.   It marks the first time an experimental drug demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in amyloid plaque as well as  a slowing of clinical impairment in patients with mild disease, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer. “It’s a bigger treatment effect than we had hoped for,” Sandrock said. The trial of the Biogen drug, aducanumab, tested 166 people divided into five groups, four of which each received a different dose, and a fifth that received a placebo.  The Biogen treatment led to reductions in brain amyloid, according to interim data presented at a medical meeting in Nice, France, on Friday. The plaque reduction was more pronounced as the dose of the drug increased and over time. Biogen will begin enrolling patients later this year for a large Phase III trial, whose results could be used to seek approval of its drug.  Lilly’s solanezumab, a drug for patients with mild Alzheimer’s, has been in late-stage trials since 2013, with results expected late in 2016, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. He said the Biogen late-stage trial would not wrap up until 2019.  Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said by email, “The magnitude of the efficacy improvements is really striking.” The trial had safety issues and drop outs, particularly by those on high doses, he said, and he wondered if some comparative success to Lilly may be related to trial design. Biogen said it increased its chances of success by carefully screening patients to exclude those with other forms of dementia misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s, and by testing only those early in the disease.  “We imaged every patient coming into study, so we knew that every patient had Alzheimer’s disease and plaque,” Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos said in an interview. “It’s hard to think of a reason why these data are not representative of the actual activity of the drug.” Safety and tolerability were considered acceptable, the company said. There was a big jump in the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E), or water surrounding brain tissue, at the two higher doses among patients with a gene associated with the highest risk for developing Alzheimer’s. These highest-risk patients also dropped out of the trial at a higher rate. Most of the ARIA-E was asymptomatic or mild and resolved over time, Sandrock said.   Using imaging to measure amyloid in six regions of the brain, researchers found plaque levels were virtually unchanged at 26 and 54 weeks into the study for the placebo group.  Patients who received either 3 milligrams per kilogram of weight, 6 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of aducanumab showed a significant and dose-dependent increase in plaque reduction at 26 weeks. There was an even greater reduction in plaque for patients at the 3 mg and 10 mg doses when they were tested at 54 weeks.  Data for those in the 6 mg arm was not available at 54 weeks because that group started later. A fourth group of patients who received a 1 mg dose were not helped by the drug.     The trial also used two measures to test cognition: a questionnaire with a 30-point scale to test mental acuity and an 18-point Clinical Dementia Rating scale that also tests for loss of ability to function. On the first test, placebo patients worsened by 3.14 points after one year versus significantly smaller declines for patients receiving aducanumab 3 mg and 10 mg, of 0.75 and 0.58 points, respectively.  On the second scale, the placebo group worsened by 2.04 points at one year. While the scores were better for all the drug groups, only the 10 mg dose reached statistical significance, with a decline of 0.59 points. The 6 mg dose could still show a significant slowing on both scales when more data becomes available.

197,BIIB,US STOCKS-Wall St set for higher open as Nike provides lift,"* Nike climbs in premarket after results, outlook * Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug slows mental decline-study * Futures up: Dow 148 pts, S&P; 15 pts, Nasdaq 36 pts   (Adds quote, updates prices) By Chuck Mikolajczak March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were poised for a higher open on Friday, with the S&P; 500 on track to snap a three-week losing skid, buoyed by Nike earnings, as investors assessed the impact of a stronger dollar on corporate earnings. U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as a stronger dollar weighed on oil and other commodity prices, sending energy and materials sectors lower, to continue a recent pattern of trading sessions alternating between gains and losses that began at the start of the month. Dow component Nike’s rose 5.2 percent to $103.42 in premarket after it posted a quarterly profit that beat market estimates. The world’s largest sportswear maker sold more higher margin shoes and apparel, but the company warned Wall Street that the stronger dollar would take a toll on its current quarter. “There is a tug-of-war going on between current valuations in our market and a lot of bad news being priced into a strong dollar with no good news being priced into a strong dollar,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “We are taking the multinationals out to the woodshed and not moving consumer names higher.” Biotechs are likely to continue to rally as Biogen Idec  shares jumped 7.9 percent at $467.99 in premarket trading. The company said its experimental drug became the first Alzheimer’s treatment to significantly slow cognitive decline and reduce brain plaque in patients with early and mild forms of the disease, according to a small study likely to reignite hopes of a treatment. S&P; 500 e-mini futures were up 15 points and fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, indicated a higher open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures rose 148 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures added 36 points. The market may see heightened volatility heading into the close as a result of quadruple witching - the expiration of stock options, index options, index futures and single-stock futures. Tiffany & Co. shares lost 2.9 percent to $83.88 before the opening bell after the upscale jeweler reported quarterly sales fell for the first time in five years and are expected to decline further in the current quarter, hurt by the strong dollar. The dollar was off 0.8 percent against a basket of major currencies and was on track for its first weekly decline in five. Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants reported a quarterly profit above analysts’ estimates due to cost-cutting and better-than-expected sales at its chains such as LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. Its shares climbed 4.7 percent to $67.92 in premarket. Simon Property Group, the No.1 U.S. mall owner, raised its offer for Macerich Co three days after its smaller rival rejected its earlier offer, adopted a poison pill and changed board structure to prevent a hostile takeover. Simon Property advanced 1 percent to $194 while Macerich lost 7.5 percent to $86.50 before the opening bell.

198,BIIB,"Exclusive: Biogen shortens name, expands ambitions in Alzheimer's, ALS","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc has seen its market value quadruple in three years to more than $100 billion on the back of its successful multiple sclerosis drugs. Now it has new ambitions in its sights. The Massachusetts-based company, which made headlines last week when it announced better-than-expected clinical trial results for its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, said that it will drop Idec from its name as of Monday and adopt a new logo. The company merged with Idec Pharmaceuticals more than a decade ago. Chief Executive George Scangos says that going forward he will keep Biogen focused on developing drugs for some of the hardest-to-treat diseases.                “Five years down the road, with some luck, we’ll have an Alzheimer’s drug that’s getting approved,” Scangos told Reuters. “I hope we can transform the treatment of MS. By that time, we will have made substantial progress on ALS and other nerve degenerative diseases, spinal muscular atrophy in kids. All that stuff is on our plate,” he said. “I am sure of two things,” he added. “Not all of it is going to work, and some of it will.” Investors, excited by the aducanumab news, sent Biogen shares up 9.7 percent on Friday, and the company’s stock touched an all-time high of $480.18 during the session. The small trial showed the treatment significantly slowed cognitive impairment in patients with mild symptoms, a rare bit of good news in a field littered with high profile failures from the likes of Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co But some patients, especially those with a gene predisposing them to Alzheimer’s, developed localized brain swelling. The symptom was most common among patients with the gene who were receiving the highest doses of aducanumab, leading about 1/3 of the participants in that category to discontinue the treatment. The company said the swelling was generally “asymptomatic or with mild, transient symptoms.” Biogen plans to begin a larger trial later this year. “If they can replicate the Alzheimer’s data in Phase III, they could conceivably have the biggest drug on the planet,” JMP Securities analyst Michael King said. As many as 75 million people are expected to develop the disease by 2030. For Biogen, which is also working on Alzheimer’s drugs that use other mechanisms of action, research on dementia drugs represents an expansion of the company’s potential reach.  “If the Alzheimer’s thing works, then we’re not just an MS company. We are broadly focused on neuro-degenerative diseases,” Scangos said. The company is also developing a drug it hopes will address not just symptoms but the cause of MS, potentially changing the way the disease is treated. “The future looks pretty exciting for us,” said Scangos, who became Biogen CEO in July 2010 following a period of upheaval in which activist investor Carl Icahn pushed for management changes and the sale of the company. Scangos, who previously led the tiny biotech firm Exelixis Inc, was recommended for the CEO post by Icahn lieutenants on the Biogen board. As it works on new medicines for unmet needs, Biogen is also planning a bigger move into the fledgling field of biosimilars, manufacturing cheaper versions of older biotech drugs as they lose patent protection. Health regulators this month approved the first such drug for the U.S. market, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc’s white blood cell booster Neupogen. Biogen previously disclosed plans to develop six biosimilar drugs in collaboration with Samsung. “We will expand that to include more,” Scangos said. It has filed for European approval of biosimilars of two  blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drugs, Amgen’s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade. Scangos shrugged off the potential impact to Biogen of biosimilars that replicate its own products, even though such competition could result in far cheaper alternatives to its drugs. “I view biosimilars as a good thing,” he said. “When they come for our drugs, they come.”   Biogen’s ambitions are not without risk. The company saw a “spectacular failure,” as Scangos put it, with a large trial of an ALS drug a few years ago, highlighting the challenge ahead. “There was no effect at all,” Scangos said. “We’ve gone back to the drawing board.”  ",3232015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-biogen-ceo-exclusive/exclusive-biogen-shortens-name-expands-ambitions-in-alzheimers-als-idUSKBN0MJ0B520150323

200,BIIB,"Biogen says Tecfidera sales slow, delays data readout on Alzheimer's drug","(Reuters) - Slowing sales of Biogen Inc’s key oral multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Tecfidera and a delay in a data readout for its keenly watched Alzheimer’s drug sent the company’s stock down as much as 8 percent on Friday. The U.S. biotechnology company posted lower-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, saying Tecfidera’s “challenging” quarter was hit by an overall slowdown in the MS market, which has been weighed down by discounting, a single case of a serious brain infection, and the effect of a stronger dollar. A number of patients are switching to the Biogen’s recently launched interferon-based MS drug Plegridy, which has also eaten into Tecfidera sales. If Tecfidera’s U.S. trajectory does not improve, Biogen’s revenue growth may come in at the lower end of its previously issued forecast, Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy said. Tecfidera sales rose to $824.9 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $506 million a year earlier, but came in well below consensus projections of about $931 million, according to Deutsche Bank. Despite sales of the blockbuster treatment falling about 10 percent from the prior quarter, Clancy said Tecfidera would still be the largest contributor to the company’s overall revenue growth. Biogen’s market value has more than tripled in the last three years to more than $100 billion due to its lucrative roster of MS drugs. The company’s attempts to diversify its pipeline received a boost last month when better-than-expected early-stage results for its drug to treat Alzheimer’s sent its stock to an all-time high. The drug, aducanumab, is the first to significantly slow cognitive decline and reduce brain-destroying plaque in early-stage patients, rekindling hope of a cure for a disease that affects more than 15 million people worldwide. However, Biogen said on Friday that data on a 10 mg dose of the drug would not be available until next year, although data on a 6 mg dose would be available in July. Many investors are concerned that, given the 10 mg titration delay, the major 2015 catalyst has now been moved to 2016, Evercore ISI’s Mark Schoenebaum said.

Biogen, a leader in treatments for multiple sclerosis, said under terms of the deal that it would pay $124 million upfront, including a $30 million investment in AGTC shares. AGTC would also be entitled to milestone payments and royalties in the high single-digit to mid-teen percentages of annual net sales of any approved products that come out of the collaboration. “AGTC is an exceptional partner to help us advance our gene therapy capabilities by targeting diseases of the eye,” Olivier Danos, Biogen’s head of cell and gene therapy, said in a statement.

206,BIIB,"Biogen Alzheimer's data disappoints, Lilly gets slight bump","(Reuters) - Disappointing data for Biogen Inc’s experimental Alzheimer’s drug dragged shares of the company lower on Wednesday, while investors took a slightly more positive view of new findings for a treatment from Eli Lilly and Co. Shares of Biogen traded 3.9 percent lower in midafternoon after falling as much as 4.9 percent, while Lilly was up slightly, recovering from a decline of 4.7 percent after the two companies released study data at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Washington.  Wall Street analysts said the initial Lilly drop may have been influenced by the negative take on Biogen, since both of their drugs work by blocking formation of the protein beta amyloid, which is believed to cause brain plaques that are the hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s experts said there were signs for hope for both treatments, but they will wait for results of much larger confirmatory trials before getting excited. “Developments are moving in the right direction, but are not of the magnitude that will change the world tomorrow,” said Dr. David Knopman, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and deputy editor of the journal Neurology. “There are hints of genuine benefits.”  Biogen’s drug aducanumab had been hailed as a potential breakthrough in March, when a small study showed that 3 milligram and 10 mg doses slowed cognitive decline and reduced brain plaques. Investors had hoped that a 6 mg dose could be a safer and effective alternative to the 10 mg dose, which had also produced high rates of a type of brain swelling. On Wednesday, researchers said the 6 mg dose failed to significantly slow mental decline even though it clearly demonstrated an amyloid reduction.     “If they’re getting brain swelling at 10 mgs and their 6 mg dose is showing limited efficacy, it draws into question Biogen’s program,” said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, who is attending the Alzheimer’s meeting. Lilly researchers said on Wednesday that patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease who took the company’s solanezumab early in the course of their disease preserved more of their cognitive and functional ability than patients who received the treatment at a later stage. Boris said Lilly’s solanezumab, if successful in a new large-scale study, is likely to be approved by 2017. That would bring it to the market at least two years before aducanumab, and represent the first medicine to slow progression of the disease affecting 5 million Americans. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the Lilly data was only “slightly encouraging” because it did not compare solanezumab with a placebo. Other analysts said Biogen’s aducanumab could still prove a potent treatment when tested in a larger population. “The benefit still looks robust to us and better than Lilly’s solanezumab,” said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum. He stuck to his estimate of a 50 percent chance for success in planned late-stage trials.

Biogen more than halved its revenue growth forecast for 2015 and its stock lost 22 percent to close just above $300. Stocks in the energy and materials sectors weighed heavily on the market after weaker-than-expected economic data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth. Oil prices hit their lowest since March. “You got underwhelming revenue growth on balance and then you layer on top of that concern over a global economic slowdown, that becomes self-fulfilling,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said of the stock market weakness. Amazon was the bright spot on Friday, rising more than 20 percent at one point and closing up 10 percent at $530.50. The online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit and its market cap ballooned to $247 billion, making it the tenth-largest U.S. company by market value. However, Amazon’s spike highlighted the thinning of leadership in the S&P; 500. Gains on the index so far this year can be attributed to Amazon and just three more companies. At the close of trading on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 163.39 points, or 0.92 percent, to 17,568.53, the S&P; 500 lost 22.5 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,079.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 57.78 points, or 1.12 percent, to 5,088.63. For the week, the S&P; fell 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq slid 2.3 percent in their largest weekly drops since the last week of March. The 2.9 percent fall on the Dow was the largest for any week since January. Selling in stocks accelerated after a report from the Wall Street Journal said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments. Second-quarter S&P; 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts’ profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P; 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months’ earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Dow component Visa ended up 4.3 percent at $74.80 after the credit and debit card company’s results handily beat expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,246 to 831, for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,144 issues fell and 660 advanced for a 3.25-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 13 new 52-week highs and 54 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 200 new lows.

211,BIIB,Biogen halves sales growth forecast as Tecfidera demand stalls,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) more than halved its sales growth forecast for 2015, saying it expects demand for its flagship multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Tecfidera, to continue slowing this year in the United States. Tecfidera has been Biogen’s main growth driver since its launch in 2013, but a saturated U.S. market and reports linking the drug to brain infections meant that sales rose less than analysts expectations for the second straight quarter. Biogen’s stock fell as much as 18.8 percent to a seven-month low, wiping out about $17 billion of its value, after the company’s weak forecast and lackluster second-quarter results on Friday. The company also reported disappointing sales for its other MS drugs. Sales of injectable MS drug Tysabri and interferon-based MS drug Avonex fell more than analysts expected, while sales of the longer-lasting Plegridy also missed estimates. Biogen needs “fixing”, and it does not have the luxury of time to build out its pipeline gradually like Celgene Corp (CELG.O) does, Piper Jaffray’s Joshua Schimmer said. Biogen plans to continue investing in its pipeline, while controlling costs, the biotech company’s executives said on a conference call. “I don’t think we’re in any panic situation but as we see good opportunities we will be aggressive about bringing them in,” CEO George Scangos said after analysts on the call suggested Biogen consider acquisitions to rejuvenate growth. Biogen said it now assumes “extremely limited” U.S. patient growth for Tecfidera sequentially for the rest of 2015, and also highlighted lower-than-anticipated reimbursements in Europe. With Tecfidera’s sales slowing, Biogen chopped its full-year sales growth forecast to 6-8 percent from 14-16 percent. The company’s sales had risen 40 percent in 2014 and 25.7 percent in 2013. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen’s second-quarter sales rose 7 percent to $2.6 billion, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $2.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Biogen’s stock hit a record high in March when tests showed the company’s experimental Alzheimer’s drug significantly slowed mental decline – a potential breakthrough in treating the incurable disease. But that enthusiasm was tempered on Wednesday, after longer term data showed that a particular dose of the drug failed to significantly slow mental decline. Relying on the Alzheimer’s program is too risky, said Schimmer, who hacked his price target on the stock by $49 to $361.

Metal prices hit multi-year lows as weaker-than-expected data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth while oil prices neared four-month lows. The three major indexes were poised to end the week in the red after disappointing corporate results and forecasts added to concerns about the U.S. profit outlook. Adding to the day’s pressure, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments, the Wall Street Journal reported. Data on Friday showed new U.S. single-family home sales fell in June to their lowest level in seven months and May’s sales were revised sharply lower. Other data showed manufacturing activity nudged up in July after slowing for three straight months. “We are not going to see a lot of earnings growth in the second half of the year as the economic data hasn’t been very strong,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “The fall in commodities is also a concerns that global growth is slowing and that ties into U.S. growth too.” Amazon.com shares jumped as much as 20.4 percent to a record high of $580.57, a day after the online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit. Dow component Visa was up 5.4 percent at $75.61 after the credit and debit card company’s results handsomely beat  expectations. Starbucks rose 1.9 percent to $57.65 after the world’s biggest coffee chain reported a higher quarterly profit.

Biogen’s 16.9 percent slump weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 after the biotechnology company cut its 2015 forecast. Six of the 10 major S&P; 500 indexes were lower with the health index’s 1.37 percent fall leading the decliners. Second-quarter S&P; 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies so far beating analysts’ profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. RBC Capital Markets said investors were treating disappointing stocks harshly.

215,BIIB,"CVS strips Viagra, other top drugs, from insurance coverage","Aug 5 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, which operates the nation’s second-biggest pharmacy benefit manager, said that next year it will exclude an additional 31 prescription medicines from insurance coverage, including Viagra and widely used treatments for diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The 2016 excluded drugs, disclosed on Wednesday, also include Vivus Inc’s weight loss treatment Qsymia, which last week was excluded from the 2016 formulary of rival PBM Express Scripts Holding Co. Vivus officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and also run large mail-order pharmacies, have been challenging the rising cost of new medications. When drugs are knocked off their formularies, patients may have to pay full price for them. PBMs often keep or dump a product depending on whether they can obtain favorable pricing. Viagra, the world’s first approved pill for erectile dysfunction, has annual sales of $1.8 billion, including $1.3 billion in the United States. Cheaper generic versions are expected to be launched by December 2017. “Pfizer is committed to ensuring patient access to our medicines,” the drugmaker said in an emailed statement. The CVS formulary, however, does include Eli Lilly and Co’s  rival Cialis anti-impotence treatment. Next year’s formulary will also exclude two interferon-based multiple sclerosis treatments from Biogen, big-selling Avonex and its new longer-acting Plegridy. Avonex, Biogen’s second-biggest product, has annual sales of almost $2.5 billion. “Avonex and Plegridy have broad insurance coverage,” Biogen said in an emailed statement. “We are confident that patients will continue to have access to our medicines.” Johnson & Johnson’s two-year-old diabetes treatment, Invokana, and a related combination treatment called Invokamet, will also be stripped from CVS coverage. Combined sales of the medicines have been growing by leaps and bounds, reaching $318 million in the second quarter. J&J; did not have an immediate comment. Another diabetes drug to be excluded from the CVS formulary is Bydureon, a once-weekly treatment from AstraZeneca Plc . CVS will favor instead similar treatments from Lilly and Novo Nordisk. “Bydureon continues to have excellent access across commercial and non-commercial plans, including (Medicare) Part D,” AstraZeneca said. Express Scripts, the nation’s biggest PBM, last week said it would boot about 20 additional medicines from its formulary in 2016 <ID:nL1N10B2JM>. Express Scripts said it can negotiate lower drug prices through its ability to exclude drugs from its coverage list. The formulary determines whether tens of millions of people with private insurance can easily use an insurance co-pay to buy  prescription drugs.

Last month the patent office also declined reviews requested by Bass and his Coalition for Affordable Drugs on two Acorda Therapeutics Inc patents. The Biogen patent covered a dosing regimen for Tecfidera, which had $2.9 billion in sales last year. Despite recent slowing demand, Tecfidera is the top-selling oral MS drug and widely considered to be Biogen’s most important near-term growth driver. Biogen shares were up 2.8 percent at $300.65 at midday on Wednesday. The Bass group had argued that the Tecfidera patent, which covered a specific dosing regimen for patients, was obvious in light of previously known treatment methods. The USPTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board disagreed. “It is ordered that the Petition is denied as to all challenged claims, and a trial will not be instituted,” the 16-page ruling concluded. In February, Bass began to file reviews to eliminate drug patents through his Coalition for Affordable Drugs. His group claims that drugmakers were improperly extending patent protection in questionable ways, such as changing dosage or delivery methods in order to delay entry to the market of cheaper generic versions of the medicines. The pharmaceutical industry has raised concerns about hedge fund challenges to drug patents, saying they are intended to make money through short-selling by driving stock prices lower.

219,BIIB,"Biogen to cut 11 percent of staff, cancel some drug programs; stock jumps","(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (BIIB.O), whose shares have tumbled since it slashed growth forecasts for its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug in July, said it will cut 11 percent of its workforce and eliminate development of several drugs to focus on high-priority medicines in its pipeline. Wall Street signaled its approval of the belt-tightening as well as better-than-expected third-quarter sales of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drugs, sending its shares up as much as 9.5 percent. But most of the gains evaporated by midday.  The restructuring, announced on Wednesday, will reduce operating expenses by about $250 million this year, it said. The U.S. biotech’s stock had fallen about 35 percent over the past three months over concerns about slowing sales of Tecfidera, its oral multiple sclerosis drug. Biogen will stop developing a drug for lupus and end some immunology and fibrosis research to concentrate on high-risk programs that promise high reward if successful. They include late-stage development of its high-profile Alzheimer’s disease drug aducanumab, two other Alzheimer’s programs, its anti-Lingo drug that aims to repair nerve damage caused by MS, and one for spinal muscular atrophy.  The company will also pour some of the savings into direct-to-consumer marketing of Tecfidera in an effort to reignite growth in the United States and elsewhere. It cut a Tecfidera program in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis after disappointing trial results. Chief Executive Officer George Scangos said, even with mounting pressures to rein in prices of U.S. prescription drugs, medicines like aducanumab and others on which it will focus will justify “attractive pricing” if approved. “In the end, things are going to be priced according to the value they bring to patients,” Scangos said.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said investors had been concerned after the second-quarter disappointment. “What’s most important for people is that things did not get worse, things could get a little bit better, and management’s tone about the pipeline remains positive,” Yee said. “These are really huge opportunities.”  The company said it may have found a way to reduce a type of brain swelling that had been the most concerning side effect seen with aducanumab by adjusting dosing during treatment.   Biogen, which has about 7,550 employees, will take a charge of $85 million to $95 million, primarily in the fourth quarter relating to the jobs cuts. It also plans to announce other non-labor related cost savings by year end. With strong third-quarter sales, cost savings, and a $5 billion share repurchase campaign well underway, Biogen raised its full-year sales and earnings forecasts.

223,BIIB,REFILE-Europe could recommend second biosimilar arthritis drug this week,"(Makes clear that 10th and 11th paragraphs refer to biosimilar versions of infliximab and etanercept) * EMA considers recommendation of biosimilar copy of Enbrel * Drug copy developed by Samsung, Biogen joint venture By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Europe could soon gain a second biosimilar antibody drug for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, with regulators due to decide by Friday whether to recommend South Korean company Samsung Bioepis’s copy of Enbrel. Biosimilar copies of expensive biotech drugs are gaining momentum in Europe, which has been faster to adopt their use than the United States, and antibodies are the big prize because these products are among the world’s top-selling drugs. Worldwide sales of Amgen’s Enbrel, which is marketed outside North America by Pfizer, totalled $9 billion last year, with Europe accounting for about $2.5 billion. Samsung Bioepis, a joint venture between Samsung Biologics and Biogen, is taking aim at that business with its version of etanercept, as Enbrel is known scientifically. A marketing application for biosimilar etanercept is being assessed by experts at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) this week, according to an EMA agenda. A Biogen spokeswoman confirmed the assessment referred to its product. Because biosimilars are made inside living cells they can never be exact duplicates of the original medicine, so manufacturers need to conduct clinical trials to show their products work as intended. That makes them more difficult to produce than conventional generic medicines but potentially more profitable. Biosimilar etanercept, which was recently approved in South Korea, would be the second such antibody product to reach the market in Europe and its arrival is likely to intensify competition. European doctors are already able to prescribe biosimilar infliximab, a copy of Merck’s Remicade. The potential for cheaper biosimilars to take business from expensive brands is worrying investors in companies making the original products. AbbVie, which sells the market-leading rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, is viewed as particularly at risk. Biosimilar infliximab is gaining ground in certain European countries after some surprisingly steep price discounts. Assuming biosimilar etanercept is given a green light from the EMA this week, its approval will still have to be formally ratified by the European Commission, a process that normally takes a couple of months. Biogen will market the drug in Europe and manufacture it at a factory in Denmark. In a further boost for biosimilars, Novartis’s  Sandoz unit said on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had accepted its submission for approval of a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Neulasta, which fights infections in cancer patients.

228,BIIB,Biogen explores sale of hemophilia assets: sources,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, is exploring a sale of its hemophilia treatments, as it increases its focus on core therapeutic areas, according to people familiar with the matter.  The potential sale of the assets, long seen as unusual fits relative to the company’s broader portfolio, come as Biogen implements a sweeping restructuring program announced in October to cut costs and focus on core areas such as neurology and autoimmune diseases. Biogen is working with an investment bank on the sale of the hemophilia assets, the people said this week. There is no guarantee that the discussions will lead to a sale, the people added.  These drugs collectively produced sales of about $500 million in 2015, the first full year in which they have been for sale.  The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Biogen declined to comment. “With the majority of the restructuring now completed, there’s a palpable reinvigorated focus on our key commercial initiatives and high-potential pipeline candidate,” Biogen Chief Executive Officer George Scangos told analysts on the company’s latest earnings call in January.  The potential divestment marks somewhat of an about-face for Biogen. In a February interview with trade publication Xconomy, Scangos said that he had decided to hold on to the products and try to build a platform around them.  Biogen now has two hemophilia products that have already obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Alprolix and Eloctate.  “If all we were going to do was market those two compounds and let them run their life cycle then we should probably just sell them,” Scangos said. “If we are gonna be in it we need to be making investments for the future and the next generation of products, and care about this.” Last year, Biogen made a small investment in its hemophilia platform, partnering with two Italian research institutions to develop gene therapies that treat the root causes of some types of hemophilia.  The hemophilia drugs’ revenues could continue to grow significantly in coming years due to their potential for international expansion. In November, Eloctate was launched in Europe for the treatment of one type of hemophilia.

231,BIIB,Cost cutting helps Biogen top Wall Street estimates for quarter,"(Reuters) - Aggressive cost cutting propelled Biogen Inc to a better-than-expected first quarter profit as the biotechnology company’s reorganization moves began to pay off, and its shares rose nearly 5 percent. Sales of Biogen’s most important products came in shy of Wall Street estimates, but the company slashed expenses, with selling, general and administrative costs down 11.3 percent and  research and development spending down 5 percent. Biogen last year announced a restructuring that involved cutting jobs and development of some medicines to focus on more high-risk, high-reward therapies, such as for Alzheimer’s disease. The company, in a conference call with analysts, said the benefits of the restructuring were realized in the first quarter and that it would continue to focus on further spending reductions, while supporting advance of its drugs in development. Excluding one-time items, Biogen earned $4.79 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “They’re definitely taking costs out of the system and watching their pennies,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “The commercial business is treading water at best. We’re crossing our fingers and hoping that something in the pipeline works,” he said. The company is enrolling patients for two Phase III trials of its high-profile Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, and has high hopes for an experimental treatment for spinal muscular atrophy in partnership with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.   Sales of its most important multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera rose 15 percent from a year ago to $946 million in the  quarter, missing Wall Street estimates of about $960 million. Sales of the oral drug were hurt somewhat by inventory drawdown, which was partially offset by a price increase. Biogen said its Tecfidera television ads had raised patient awareness of the drug and that it planned to halt the campaign in the middle of this year. Biogen management refused to discuss reports, including by Reuters, that it was looking for a buyer for its relatively new two-drug hemophilia franchise, saying it was pleased with the performance of the medicines. “If they weren’t selling the hemophilia business, they’d have said so. They would have put this (rumor) to bed and they didn’t,” said Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges. Given all their cash and borrowing capacity, Porges said,   “you have to wonder what they’re preparing to buy. They’re obviously making room in their balance sheet for a material acquisition.” Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos said the company was indeed in the market for potential deals, including looking at drugs in late-stage development.  “We continue to track companies and compounds that are interesting to us,” he said. Total revenue for the quarter rose 6.7 percent to $2.73 billion, just short of analyst estimates of $2.75 billion. Net income rose 18 percent to $970.9 million, or $4.43 per share, from $822.5 million, or $3.49 a share, a year ago. Biogen shares were up $12.78, or 4.8 pct at $278.67 on Nasdaq.

238,BIIB,Biogen to spin off hemophilia drugs and focus on core neuro business,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc plans to spin off its hemophilia drug business as a publicly traded company, leaving the drugmaker to focus on developing drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, the company said on Tuesday. Biogen said it considered a number of alternatives including a sale before deciding to split the business in a tax-free transaction, which it said would deliver the most value to     its shareholders. The new company will include treatments Eloctate and Alprolix for hemophilia A and B, which had total sales of $554.2 million in 2015, about 5 percent of Biogen’s revenue. Hemophilia is a group of hereditary genetic disorders that impairs the body’s ability to control blood clotting.  Biogen began a sweeping restructuring program in October to cut costs and focus on core areas such as neurology and autoimmune diseases. In April, Reuters reported that it was looking at selling the hemophilia assets. After that report, Citi analyst Robyn Karnauskas said the business could be worth $4.8 billion to $6.4 billion. Biogen expects the transaction to occur by the end of this year or early next year. Biogen will focus on developing drugs for neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and neuropathic pain. It will keep its bestselling MS drug, Tecfidera. The company’s promising Alzheimer’s drug candidate generated excitement last year after early data showed a reduction in amyloid plaque in the brain and some cognitive improvement. Biogen’s collaboration on Eloctate and Alproprix with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB will continue, CEO George Scangos said during a conference call with analysts. The move to spin off the hemophilia drugs would have been premature 6 or 12 months ago, he said.    “It’s not really a shift in strategy. It is the fact that the business has matured. It is doing very well. It is profitable. It can stand on its own,” Scangos said. The area of the company focused on hemophilia also has a pipeline of experimental products that need to be “aggressively” developed, he said. Biogen’s executive vice president, pharmaceutical operations and technology, John Cox, will be the chief executive officer of the new company, which will be based in the Boston area, Biogen said. Biogen shares were largely unchanged in early trading at $274.52, versus their Monday close of $273.67.

244,BIIB,Biogen's MS drug misses main goal in mid-stage study,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc’s keenly watched experimental drug for treating multiple sclerosis failed to meet the main goal of improving some symptoms in a mid-stage study, sending the company’s shares down as much as 9 percent in premarket trading. The drug, opicinumab, did not improve overall physical and cognitive function and the progression of disability in patients, the company said on Tuesday. However, Biogen said the drug showed evidence of a clinical effect in patients, and that it would continue to analyze the data to decide on the next steps for the program. Though Biogen clearly has not ruled out further exploration, moving into a late-stage study at this point seems highly unlikely, Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note. “We see increased risk to the program overall from the mixed results,” he added. Analysts have previously said the drug represents a multi-billion opportunity for Biogen given its potential to repair nerve damage caused by multiple sclerosis, a nervous system disease affecting the brain and the spinal cord. Biogen is targeting high-priority medicines in its pipeline after concerns over stalling demand for its key MS drug, Tecfidera, in recent quarters. The company has embarked on a restructuring program, shifted focus to its much-anticipated Alzheimer’s disease drug and announced plans to spin off its hemophilia drug business as a publicly traded entity. Biogen must do more to extend its core competencies beyond MS, given that the disease has faced a pause in medical advances, Piper Jaffray analyst Joshua Schimmer said on Tuesday. “A new approach to R&D; and asset allocation in our view would be prudent,” he said. The study, which enrolled 418 patients, was the second mid-stage trial testing opicinumab.  The first study was designed to evaluate the effect of opicinumab following a first episode of acute optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve.   Biogen’s shares were down 8.57 percent at $264.99 before the bell. ",6072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-biogen-study/biogens-ms-drug-misses-main-goal-in-mid-stage-study-idUSKCN0YT1FZ
245,BIIB,US STOCKS-S&P; edges closer to record high; energy shares lead,"(Reuters) - The S&P; 500 ended at its best level since July on Tuesday, helped by a big jump in energy shares and investor confidence that higher interest rates will not derail the economy. The index finished below its best levels of the session, though, while the Nasdaq ended lower. Biotech shares dropped following disappointing news from several key companies including Biogen. The Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI was down 2.5 percent, its biggest daily percentage decline since May 11. Giving the S&P; 500 its biggest boost, the S&P; energy index .SPNY jumped 2.1 percent as oil prices reached 2016 highs due to supply constraints and a weak dollar. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) gained 1.5 percent to $90.71. Gains this week have once again put the S&P; 500 within striking distance of record highs reached in May 2015. Comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Monday seemed to ease some worries about the economy, while underscoring views the Fed may be in no rush to raise rates. “The big story for the market right now is, do we break out to all-time highs,” said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at Northstar Wealth Partners in West Hartford, Connecticut.  “If we do so in the near term, we could see a rush of money jump into the market from investors who had been sitting out on the sidelines, in fear missing out on further market gains.” The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended up 17.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,938.28, and earlier broke above 18,000, while the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 2.72 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,112.13, its highest close since July 22.

Volume was relatively light, though, and the Nasdaq was slightly lower. Biotech shares dropped following disappointing news from several key companies including Biogen. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was down 2.2 percent. Giving the S&P; 500 its biggest boost, the S&P; energy index  jumped 2.3 percent and was on track for its best two-day percentage gain since March. Oil prices reached 2016 highs due to supply constraints and a weak dollar. Gains this week have once again put the S&P; 500 within striking distance of record highs reached in May 2015.

Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by the energy index’s 0.8 percent rise as oil prices hovered around 2016 highs. However, the healthcare index tumbled 0.75 percent, led by Biogen and Alexion, both of which reported that their drugs failed in trials. The other sectors were mostly higher a day after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen expressed confidence in the health of the economy, but was vague on when the Fed would raise interest rates. “There is a good possibility we may see the S&P; make a new 52-week high as enthusiasm continues to build.” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

Gains in technology stocks were led by Apple and Microsoft, which were up about 1 percent. The financial index was the only other index beside healthcare to post losses as the chances of a rate hike in June faded. Biogen tumbled 10 percent after its multiple sclerosis drug failed in a mid-stage study, while Alexion dropped 10 percent after its drug failed a late-stage trial. Valeant’s shares slumped 19 percent to $23.47 after the drugmaker posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecasts. Ralph Lauren dropped 7.3 percent after the retailer said it would cut jobs, close stores and reduce its real estate as part of a plan to lower costs and revive sales growth. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,735 to 872. On the Nasdaq, 1,138 issues rose and 1,094 fell.

248,BIIB,UPDATE 2-Biogen's MS drug misses main goal in mid-stage study,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc’s keenly watched experimental drug for treating multiple sclerosis failed to meet the main goal of improving some symptoms in a mid-stage study, sending the company’s shares down as much as 9 percent in premarket trading. The drug, opicinumab, did not improve overall physical and cognitive function and the progression of disability in patients, the company said on Tuesday. However, Biogen said the drug showed evidence of a clinical effect in patients, and that it would continue to analyze the data to decide on the next steps for the program. Though Biogen clearly has not ruled out further exploration, moving into a late-stage study at this point seems highly unlikely, Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note. “We see increased risk to the program overall from the mixed results,” he added. Analysts have previously said the drug represents a multi-billion opportunity for Biogen given its potential to repair nerve damage caused by multiple sclerosis, a nervous system disease affecting the brain and the spinal cord. Biogen is targeting high-priority medicines in its pipeline after concerns over stalling demand for its key MS drug, Tecfidera, in recent quarters. The company has embarked on a restructuring program, shifted focus to its much-anticipated Alzheimer’s disease drug and announced plans to spin off its hemophilia drug business as a publicly traded entity. Biogen must do more to extend its core competencies beyond MS, given that the disease has faced a pause in medical advances, Piper Jaffray analyst Joshua Schimmer said on Tuesday. “A new approach to R&D; and asset allocation in our view would be prudent,” he said. The study, which enrolled 418 patients, was the second mid-stage trial testing opicinumab.  The first study was designed to evaluate the effect of opicinumab following a first episode of acute optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve.   Biogen’s shares were down 8.57 percent at $264.99 before the bell. ",6072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/biogen-study/update-2-biogens-ms-drug-misses-main-goal-in-mid-stage-study-idUSL4N18Z3RH

Samsung Bioepis said in a statement the European Medicines Agency has accepted for review its application to sell its biosimilar of Humira, the world’s best-selling drug that generated $14 billion in sales last year. The company did not say when it submitted the application for its Humira copy. Interest in biosimilars, a cheaper copy of complex biotech drugs, has soared in recent years as copies of some of the world’s best-selling prescription medicines have hit the market. Medical officials and insurers in the United States and Europe hope biosimilars will significantly reduce healthcare costs. Samsung Group hopes its biosimilar company can emerge as a new growth driver as the global smartphone industry matures, clouding long-term earnings prospects for flagship Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Samsung Bioepis, which seeks to be first or second to market with its products, already received regulatory approval earlier this year to sell its copies of Amgen Inc’s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade - two rheumatoid arthritis drugs that are also among the world’s best-selling medicines.  It was not immediately clear how quickly Samsung Bioepis can bring its Humira biosimilar to market even after regulatory approval from the European Union, as AbbVie’s composition patent for Humira will not expire in Europe until October 2018. The U.S.-based company, which earned 61 percent of its 2015 net revenue from Humira, has been filing new patents in a bid to push back sales of biosimilars of the drug. Samsung Bioepis, along with partner and minority shareholder Biogen Inc, filed a lawsuit against AbbVie in Britain on March 24 to stop the U.S. company from blocking the launch of the Humira biosimilar.

256,BIIB,Biogen's profit easily beats Street view; CEO to leave,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc on Thursday reported second quarter profit that blew past Wall Street estimates and significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast, while announcing that Chief Executive George Scangos would step down in the coming months once a successor is found. Shares of Biogen, whose board also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program, rose more than 7 percent. “This is the right time for a new leader to take the reins and lead Biogen through its next stage of development,” Scangos said in a statement. The biotechnology company said it will begin a search for a new CEO immediately, considering both internal and external candidates. “When you look at what the growth of this company has been under him by any metric, it’s been a terrific overall six-year run, even if the last 12 months weren’t up to the par of the first five,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt.   Biogen now expects 2016 adjusted earnings of $19.70 to $20 per share and revenue of $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion, up from its previous forecast of $18.30 to $18.60 per share and revenue of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion.  Excluding special items, Biogen earned $5.21 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose to $1.05 billion, or $4.79 per share, from $927.3 million, or $3.93 per share, a year earlier. Sales of Tecfidera, the market leading oral multiple sclerosis drug, rose 12 percent to $987 million for the quarter, slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates. Sales of Biogen’s other MS drugs, including Tysabri and Avonex, were in line or ahead of Wall Street estimates. Biogen said it expects to begin selling a new once-monthly MS treatment, Zinbryta, in the United States and Europe next month. Hemophilia drugs Eloctate and Alprolix posted sales of $125 million and $80 million, respectively, above estimates of $190 million for both drugs. Biogen in May announced plans to spin off its hemophilia business into a publicly traded entity and said it now expects that to be completed in early 2017. Amid slowing Tecfidera growth, the company last year embarked on a sweeping restructuring program to cut costs and focus on core areas, such as neurology, with high risk, potentially high reward, experimental treatments for Alzheimer’s disease under development.

260,BIIB,Biogen exercises option to develop muscle drug after trial success,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc said it would exercise an option to develop and commercialize an experimental genetic muscle-disorder drug after an interim analysis of late-stage data showed patients experienced statistically significant improvement. The drug, nusinersen, was being developed by Biogen in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc, to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The genetic disease disrupts the part of the nervous system that controls voluntary muscle movement, eventually taking away an individual’s ability to walk, eat, or breathe. Currently, there exists no approved treatment for the condition, which is the leading genetic cause of death in infants. It affects about 1 in 10,000 babies, and some 1 in every 50 Americans is a genetic carrier, according to Illinois-based Cure SMA. Shares of Biogen, which plans to file marketing applications for the potential blockbuster in the coming months, rose about 5.2 percent to $304.95. In the interim analysis of the late-stage trial in infants with a form of SMA, nusinersen met the main goal of improving motor symptoms. Based on this data, the trial will be stopped, and patients can receive the drug in a follow-on study, the companies said. Biogen also said it had paid Ionis a $75 million license fee to take responsibility for the product’s development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs going forward. Facing slowing growth of its flagship drug Tecfidera, Biogen last year embarked on a sweeping restructuring program to focus on core areas, such as neurology, with high-risk, potentially high-reward experimental treatments for Alzheimer’s among others. Nusinersen could provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen, which hasn’t seen big organic growth since the launch of Tecfidera and has faced several late-stage setbacks over the past year, analysts said. Nusinersen is also being evaluated in two other studies in different SMA patient groups that will continue as planned. If approved, analysts expect the drug to generate between $1 billion to $2 billion in peak sales. Ionis is eligible to receive tiered royalties on any potential sales of nusinersen up to a certain percentage, and up to $150 million in milestone payments.

The talks were informal and preliminary, the Journal said, adding they may might not result in a deal, in part because Biogen may not be interested.  Allergan was unlikely to pursue the deal, CNBC said, citing a source. Biogen shares closed up 9.4 percent at $330.11 on Tuesday, valuing the company at about $72.33 billion.

Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur and Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said they do not comment on speculation. The WSJ report came less than two weeks after Biogen reported surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings but said Chief Executive George Scangos, 68, would step down in coming months after a successor is found. Although Biogen significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast, growth for its flagship Tecfidera treatment for multiple sclerosis has been slowing. The slowdown prompted the company last year to embark on a sweeping restructuring program to cut costs and focus on core areas, such as neurology, including treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges said Merck, Allergan or other large drugmakers would benefit from acquiring Biogen and its experimental drugs in late-stage trials, which include treatments for Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. “There’s a scarcity of assets in the industry,” Porges said. “The industry needs to bulk up and consolidate and neither Merck nor Allergan have a multiple sclerosis business today,” he said, while Biogen is leading the field.

267,BIIB,Wall St. falls as weak auto sales spur growth jitters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on Tuesday, with each of the major indexes notching their worst day in about a month as economic data and weaker-than-expected auto sales spurred concerns about growth. Shares of Ford (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N) dropped more than 4 percent each after the two major U.S. automakers reported July vehicle sales slightly below expectations. The automakers’ declines pulled the S&P; consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD down 1.5 percent as the worst- performing of the 10 major S&P; groups.  Data showed U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in June as households bought a range of goods and services. However, personal income rose only 0.2 percent, missing estimates of 0.3 percent, while inflation remained below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. That could keep the central bank on a cautious path to hiking interest rates.  “People are starting to see that things aren’t quite as rosy as they might have thought in the month of July with that big run up,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The S&P; 500 climbed 3.6 percent in July, its best month since March.   Another drop in U.S. crude CLc1 below $40 a barrel also weighed on sentiment, as the commodity settled down 1.4 percent at $39.51.  Pfizer (PFE.N), was the biggest percentage decliner on the Dow, after the largest U.S. drugmaker reported better-than-expected quarterly results but revenue from its branded patent-protected medicines was disappointing.

270,BIIB,Biogen not pursuing a sale - source,"(Reuters) - U.S. biotechnology company Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) has not received any formal expressions of interest from potential acquirers and is not actively soliciting takeover offers, according to a person familiar with the matter.  While some of Biogen’s peers have approached individual board directors of the company over time, nothing has been presented to Biogen’s board for consideration recently, the person said on Wednesday. One reason that no formal offer has materialized is that Biogen values its portfolio of neurology drugs highly, and would expect any proposal to come with a significant premium, the person added. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing sources, that Allergan Plc (AGN.N) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) had sounded out Biogen on the possibility of a takeover. Merck expressed more of an interest in Biogen than Allergan, but this did not result in any offer, the source said. The source asked not to be identified because Biogen’s  deliberations are confidential. Biogen, Allergan and Merck offered no comment. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen has a market value of $70 billion. The company’s $11 billion in annual revenue comes primarily from its multiple sclerosis portfolio, about $4 billion of which may be subject to generic competition in coming years. Earlier this week, Biogen said it would develop and commercialize an experimental genetic muscle-disorder drug called nusinersen after an interim analysis of late-stage data showed patients experienced statistically significant improvement. Facing slowing growth of its flagship multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, Biogen last year embarked on a sweeping restructuring program to focus on core areas, such as neurology, with high-risk, potentially high-reward experimental treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, among others. Last month, the company’s chief executive, George Scangos, announced plans to step down once a successor is named. Meanwhile, Allergan recently announced the closing of a deal to sell its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) for more than $40 billion, providing Allergan with a substantial war chest that could be deployed for acquisitions. In April, Allergan, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, terminated its planned merger with U.S.-based rival Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) after new U.S. Treasury rules reduced the tax benefits of the deal.  In earnings calls, Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, has expressed an interest in growing aggressively through deals, calling business development “a top priority.” In 2015, it closed an acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals for $9.5 billion.

277,BIIB,Allergan pays top dollar for 'stepping stones' from neurology to dermatology,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N) CEO Brent Saunders calls them “stepping stones” - small, bolt-on acquisitions, as opposed to the mega-deals common in the drug industry. And they’re expected to boost dealmaking in sectors ranging from neurology to skin care. Allergan’s agreement on Tuesday to acquire liver drug developer Tobira Therapeutics Inc TBRA.O for $1.7 billion may seem trivial compared to the proposed $160 billion deal Allergan crafted last year to sell itself to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). But that deal was torpedoed in April by the U.S. Treasury’s latest curbs on tax inversions. Now the company, domiciled in Ireland, is taking a new tack, preparing to spend a war chest of more than $20 billion on stepping-stone deals.  The small deals are aimed at filling gaps in its core therapeutic areas, which range from the central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases, to dermatology and eye care. Allergan has added four other small companies to its portfolio this year, three of which sold for less than $100 million upfront, plus performance payments. Two, ForSight Vision and Retrosense Therapeutics, treat eye disorders. The others, Topokine Therapeutics and Vitae Pharmaceuticals Inc. VTAE.O, focus on dermatology.  Allergan agreed to acquire Vitae last week for $639 million. The fact that Allergan is paying top dollar for some of these companies - including a nearly 600 percent premium for Tobira, excluding performance payments - has investors and dealmakers speculating about the company’s next stepping stone. Logical acquisition targets for Allergan would include Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (ACAD.O), a maker of treatments for Parkinson’s disease; Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc (ITCI.O), a developer of psychiatric medications; Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O), which focuses on neurology and women’s health; and Dermira Inc (DERM.O), a dermatology company, according to investment bankers and industry investors.  In an interview with Reuters, Saunders declined to comment on any specific companies that Allergan may want to acquire next. But he said that stepping stones will play a key role in helping the company continue to meet its ambitious annual revenue growth target of 10 percent for years to come.  “I needed to do big deals to get where we are, but the strategic vision was always to get to a point where we could use stepping stones,” Saunders said. 	 Allergan has relied heavily on M&A; because it views inventing its own drugs in-house as too risky. Saunders, 46, has attempted or executed mergers and acquisitions totaling more than $300 billion in the last three years.  Allergan now has the money to embark on a major acquisition spree thanks to the sale of its generic drug portfolio to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). Allergan received $33.4 billion in cash and $5.1 billion in Teva stock last month as a result of that deal.  While Allergan has pledged to spend some of those dollars on share buybacks, it will still have cash reserves of more than $20 billion it can spend on deals.	 Allergan wants to build out its central nervous system franchise, which is one of the largest in the industry and treats diseases including Alzheimer’s, depression, migraines and schizophrenia, Saunders said.      He added that he would like to branch out into other types of neurological treatments, including multiple sclerosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson’s disease.     One of Allergan’s successful endeavors in the central nervous system space, its Namenda Alzheimer’s franchise, took a hit over the past year after one of its key drugs, Namenda IR, lost patent protection. Namenda IR generated more than $500 million in 2015.    Allergan is hoping that a ramp-up of its newly commercialized anti-psychotic drug, Vraylar, can help offset that decline. Saunders said he also is optimistic about opportunities in dermatology and eye care, adding that he would be open to a medium-sized deal to build out its opthalmic products.      In dermatology, Allergan has the world’s biggest franchise by sales, largely due to its flagship drug, Botox, for wrinkle-smoothing. Last year, in a stepping-stone acquisition, Allergan bought a publicly traded dermatology company called Kythera for $2.1 billion, and it has been ramping up sales of its key drug, Kybella, which treats double chins. “There’s definitely potential for more deals like that in dermatology,” said Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Botox is a gateway product into the entire world of aesthetics.” In the interview, Saunders left open the possibility of a transformative acquisition or merger for Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $95 billion. He said a company with a cutting-edge treatment that reversed Alzheimer’s was an example of the type of big deal Allergan would consider making.     Biogen Inc BIIB.N and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) both have late stage drugs that promise to reverse the effects of the degenerative neurological disease. Biogen and Eli Lilly have market capitalizations of $65 billion and $86 billion, respectively. Reuters reported in August that Allergan had held informal conversations with some members of Biogen’s board before deciding against any acquisition offer.

280,BIIB,"Biogen profit tops expectations; focus on CEO search, new drugs","(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) on Wednesday reported better-than-expected third quarter profit, driven by higher sales of its lead multiple sclerosis drug and lower costs, and its shares rose more than 4 percent. However, investor focus is likely to turn to promising new drugs in late-stage development, including a potential blockbuster Alzheimer’s treatment, and the company’s search for a successor to Chief Executive George Scangos, who in July said he would step down once his replacement is found. Scangos, on a conference call with analysts, said the CEO search was progressing and that “very high quality” candidates were being interviewed, but he declined to provide a timeline. “The sooner we have a new CEO come in, the better it is for all of us,” Scangos said. The company expressed encouragement over early data it has seen for the Alzheimer’s drug aducanumab, currently in Phase III testing, and said more data would be presented at a medical meeting in December. “What was most important was comments around Alzheimer’s, noting again their view of consistent efficacy and safety from the prior data, referring to cognitive endpoints as well as biomarker data,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, calling aducanumab “potentially the most exciting Alzheimer’s drug in late stage development.” Any successful Alzheimer’s treatment is virtually assured of becoming a multibillion-dollar product, given the huge need. Biogen also said it filed its application with U.S.  regulators seeking priority review for nusinersen, which would be the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants. Priority review for the drug, being developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS.O), would bring an approval decision within six months. “Many investors are debating whether or not this could get a very, very fast approval given the unmet medical need. There’s a lot of enthusiasm over that,” Yee said. “The are filing for a broad label, which could be significant upside if that occurs.”  Biogen also sees biosimilars as an important growth opportunity. It has begun selling cheaper versions of Amgen’s (AMGN.O) Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Remicade rheumatoid arthritis drugs in Europe. Excluding items, Biogen earned $5.19 per share in the quarter, topping analysts’ expectations by 22 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.       Sales of the biotechnology company’s market-leading oral MS drug Tecfidera of $1.03 billion, edged past analysts’ estimates of $1 billion.

Ionis Pharmaceutical’s stock jumped up as much as 28.16 percent to $34.77 while Biogen shares rose as much as 7.32 percent to $297.27 in trading on Monday. An interim analysis found that patients with a less-severe form of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who received the drug, Spinraza (nusinersen), experienced significant improvement in motor function compared with those who didn’t. A separate late-stage study in August evaluating the drug in patients with the most-severe form of SMA was stopped early after the drug was found effective. SMA disrupts the part of the nervous system that controls voluntary muscle movement, eventually taking away an individual’s ability to walk, eat or breathe. Currently, there is no approved treatment for the condition and it affects about 1 in 10,000 babies, and some 1 in 50 Americans is a genetic carrier, according to Illinois-based Cure SMA. Monday’s announcement increases the probability of Spinraza obtaining a broad initial label, analysts said. Biogen, which agreed to pay Ionis a $75 million license fee to take responsibility for the drug’s development, regulatory and commercialization activities in August, is preparing for a potential U.S. launch of Spinraza, possibly by the end of the year or the first quarter of 2017. This timeline is shorter than what most analysts had forecast, and Ionis is eligible to receive royalties on potential sales of the drug and up to $150 million in milestone payments. Spinraza could provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen, which hasn’t seen big organic growth since the launch of multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera and has faced several late-stage setbacks over the past year. This data gives Biogen and Ionis a head start over rival gene therapy developer Avexis Inc, which is also working on an SMA treatment. “Even with gene therapy competition we still think Spinraza can achieve more than $1 billion-$2 billion in peak annual revenue,” Piper Jaffray & Co analysts said.

288,BIIB,"Alzheimer's setback prompts rethink of Lilly, Biogen stock outlooks","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co’s massive setback for its experimental Alzheimer’s disease treatment on Wednesday sent investors scrambling to re-evaluate shares of the U.S. drugmaker and those of companies making competing therapies, including biotech stalwart Biogen Inc. Lilly shares tumbled 10.5 percent, and fell to their lowest point in two years during the session, after the company said its drug failed to slow loss of cognitive ability in patients with mild symptoms.  The shares were on pace for their biggest one-day percentage decline since the 2008 financial crisis, shaving about $9 billion of market value. Biogen shares were down 4 percent, but had reduced their initial losses by more than half from premarket trading as investors assessed the damage to the prospects of the company’s drug that works in a similar way to Lilly’s. The results for Lilly’s solanezumab were a highly anticipated event on Wall Street, with some analysts saying the company’s shares could have leapt 20 percent or more had the clinical trial succeeded. Although Alzheimer’s disease has been a notoriously difficult area for drug development, some investors were clearly optimistic that the drug would meet the study goals. A buy-side investor survey by Evercore ISI at the end of September found that 56 percent had expected the study to meet its main goal. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover had been factoring in a 50-percent chance of solanezumab approval, with peak probability sales of nearly $4 billion a year.  “Therefore, the negative trial results have a large impact on our fair value estimate.” Lilly’s shares had traded at just over 19 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months ahead of the study results, making their shares more expensive than other large U.S. and European drugmakers. Wednesday’s decline left shares trading at about 17 times estimates, below Bristol-Myers Squibb Co but still well ahead of those of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. The stock valuation shows investor confidence that Lilly’s cupboard is not bare without solanezumab, as medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis are expected to propel its business. Lilly’s earnings per share are expected to rise by 14 percent a year on average over five years, said Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, making the company “among the very best growers in our coverage universe.” According to Starmine data, Lilly’s average annual earnings per share growth is expected to be 7.8 percent over the next five years, nearly double that of peers. Lilly executives themselves have told analysts on recent quarterly conference calls they project average annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent a year through 2020, even without solanezumab.     “They are telling you that their business can work regardless, so in many ways they provided some prophylaxis to the market,” said Tony Butler, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities. The results nonetheless will sting for Lilly investors. Balyasny Asset Management, Franklin Advisers, Wellington Management and Vanguard Group made large additions to their Lilly holdings as of Sept 30, according to securities filings tracked by Thomson Reuters. Lilly’s setback raised questions in the strategy of targeting the beta amyloid protein, believed to cause brain plaques, which Biogen’s aducanumab also targets. But Biogen’s drug is different, including data showing it could be more effective in targeting beta amyloid, according to Raymond James analyst Chris Raymond.  While “the risk has gone up with respect to aducanumab,” Raymond said, part of the reason the stock recovered the bulk of its initial losses on Wednesday was that investors did not completely discount the chance aducanumab could still succeed. Investors should learn more about aducanumab’s potential at an Alzheimer’s conference starting Dec. 8. Another possible support for shares of Biogen, which has a leading franchise of multiple sclerosis drugs: the company, with a market value of about $66 billion, has been the subject of takeover speculation.

290,BIIB,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Lilly's drug for Alzheimer's fails big trial; shares drop,"(Corrects name of Dr. Gandy in paragraphs 16 and 18) By Ransdell Pierson Nov 23 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said its experimental Alzheimer’s treatment failed to slow the loss of mental functioning in patients with mild symptoms, a major setback for the company and millions of people at risk of developing the memory-robbing disease. Many investors and families had been counting on solanezumab to become the first approved medicine to slow progression of the disease, which the Alzheimer’s Association estimates will strike as many as 28 million Americans by midcentury. Lilly shares were down 11.7 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. drugmaker announced the long-awaited results of its large Expedition 3 study, which showed patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a significantly greater slowing in cognitive decline than those given placebos. The news also caused a 4.3 percent drop in shares of Biogen Inc, which is testing a drug that, like solanezumab, targets the beta amyloid protein believed to cause toxic brain plaques that are considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Given the trial’s results, Lilly said it would not seek U.S. approval of its drug for mild dementia. Incoming Chief Executive Officer David Ricks called the news “heart-breaking.” Lilly spent more than $3 billion on Alzheimer’s research over the past 27 years and will keep pushing for effective treatments, he said. He noted solanezumab was being studied in a separate trial called “A4” among people with no Alzheimer’s symptoms but who have the brain plaques. The company said it would take a $150 million charge in the fourth quarter for the failed trial and provide an updated 2016 financial outlook, as well as 2017 forecasts, on Dec. 15. Ricks affirmed Lilly’s forecast for annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent between 2015 and 2020. The company has strong growth prospects without solanezumab because of recently approved treatments for diabetes, cancer and other conditions, he said. Some analysts had said solanezumab, if approved, could generate up to $10 billion in annual sales and boost Lilly’s earnings for years to come. The infused drug works by binding in the bloodstream to beta amyloid. Biogen is racing to complete Phase III trials of aducanumab, which is designed to clear beta amyloid that has already formed plaques. However, the solanezumab data raises questions about whether beta amyloid is a valid target for Alzheimer’s drugs. Biogen officials did not respond to requests for comment. As with cancer, many experts believe combinations of medicines, each having different mechanisms, will be needed to greatly slow Alzheimer’s progress or stop it in its tracks. One of the biggest hopes is a class of experimental drugs called BACE inhibitors, which work by blocking production of beta amyloid. Lilly and others, including Biogen and Merck & Co , are conducting late-stage trials of such drugs. Dr. Sam Gandy, director of Mount Sinai School of Medicine’s Center for Cognitive Health, was not ready to abandon drugs that reduce amyloid. “My guess is that they would be part of a cocktail with something else, that they won’t in and of themselves be enough,” he said. Amyloid drugs may work best in patients who have yet to develop plaques readable on scans, Gandy added. In two original 18-month studies completed in 2012, solanezumab failed to slow cognitive decline or loss of physical functioning for the 1,000 patients with mild to moderate disease in each trial. But the combined data for just mildly affected patients suggested solanezumab caused significant slowdowns of 34 percent in mental decline and 18 percent in loss of functional abilities, compared with those taking a placebo, researchers said. For Expedition 3, Lilly extended the pair of large trials by another two years and enrolled only mildly impaired patients. Researchers continued to provide solanezumab to patients who had taken it during the initial studies and also allowed the placebo groups to switch to solanezumab.

291,BIIB,Further promising data seen with Biogen Alzheimer's drug: study,"(Reuters) - Gradually increasing the dose of Biogen Inc’s experimental Alzheimer’s disease drug appeared to reduce the risk of brain swelling compared to higher fixed doses, interim 12-month results from a small study released on Thursday showed. The closely watched drug, aducanumab, led to significant reductions in amyloid plaques in the brain compared with a placebo among the 31 early-stage Alzheimer’s patients given titrated, or gradually increased dosing, according to data from the Phase I study. “These data appear solid to us, and if anything provide additional confidence in the program and viability of the titration regimen,” Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a research note late on Thursday. Any successful Alzheimer’s drug is expected to reap multibillion-dollar annual sales.  In the group of trial patients given titrated dosing, 35 percent experienced a side effect involving a fluid shift in the brain, compared with 55 percent given a high fixed dose, Biogen said. Biogen last year began enrollment in two Phase III trials of aducanumab using titrated dosing, but those results are still several years away, said Samantha Budd Haeberlein, the company’s vice president, clinical development. The amyloid reduction and slowing of mental decline seen in patients in the titration portion of the Phase I study after 12 months of treatment were similar to what was reported earlier this year for patients who received fixed doses of aducanumab. Full details of the study were being presented at an Alzheimer’s meeting in San Diego on Friday. Patients in the study had either mild or prodromal, meaning early pre-symptomatic, Alzheimer’s disease, researchers said. Aducanumab works by removing brain plaques largely made from a protein called beta amyloid. Other companies have also tried to develop drugs that block beta amyloid, but all failed to significantly slow cognitive declines, and some were also associated with brain swelling. The most spectacular recent failure was Eli Lilly and Co’s experimental solanezumab, designed to soak up beta amyloid from the bloodstream.  Lilly last month said its infused drug failed to slow mental decline, compared with placebo, among patients with mild Alzheimer’s. That largely dashed hopes for the drug and cast further doubt on whether beta amyloid is the right target for attacking the memory-robbing disease that affects millions of people. Some Alzheimer’s experts have suggested the approach might work very early in the course of the disease. They said once brain plaques can be observed it may already be too late for the drugs to provide significant benefit.  Biogen shares rose 1.45 percent to close at $289.54.

292,BIIB,Biogen names top executive Vounatsos as CEO,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc, the U.S. drug maker focused on neurological, autoimmune and rare diseases, said on Monday it had appointed its chief commercial officer, Michel Vounatsos, as chief executive officer, ending a five-month search. Biogen shares fell on the news of his appointment, which is effective as of Jan. 6. Vounatsos succeeds CEO George Scangos, who announced last July he would retire after leading the company since 2010. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen, which has been trying to develop its promising spinal muscular atrophy and Alzheimer’s disease drugs, attracted some takeover interest earlier this year, although it is not pursuing a sale. Biogen shares dropped as much as 4.6 percent after Reuters first reported Vounatsos’ appointment on Monday, and ended trading in New York down 2.7 percent at $278.77, giving the company a market capitalization of $60.7 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote in a note that Biogen shares slid because investors saw the appointment as making a near-term acquisition of Biogen less likely. “The Street has simply not yet had enough time to get familiar with Vounatsos,” the RBC analysts wrote. Vounatsos joined Biogen earlier this year after a 20-year career at rival pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc, where he held leadership positions across Europe and in China.  In his role as executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Biogen, Vounatsos’ responsibilities included overseeing the growth of Biogen’s product portfolio and supporting the development of new drugs.  His CEO appointment is a sign that Biogen is placing a new emphasis on boosting its pipeline. The vast majority of the company’s more than $10.8 billion in 2015 sales came from its multiple sclerosis franchise, which includes the hugely successful drug Tecfidera.  Sales of MS drugs are expected to take a hit in the coming years as cheaper generic competitors come on the market.  That has increased investor scrutiny of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s treatment, aducanumab, which is under a late-stage clinical trial that could establish it as a breakthrough treatment for the memory-wasting disease. The market for Alzheimer’s treatments could exceed $13 billion by 2023, according to healthcare information company GlobalData.  However, disappointing recent data from rival Eli Lilly & Co, which had been working on a similar treatment, raised questions about the scientific theory underlying both companies’ planned treatments.  Biogen has also been working on another potential blockbuster drug, known as Spinraza, which could become the first FDA-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, the leading genetic cause of death in infants. “We intend to gain approval for Spinraza, to provide the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, continue to grow our global multiple sclerosis franchise, fully enroll our phase 3 trials for aducanumab, reinvigorate our pipeline in the areas of neurology and neuro-repair, and invest in our employees as we work together to define our future,” Vounatsos said in a statement.

293,BIIB,Investors see Biogen CEO choice as friendly to potential takeover,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The surprise selection of Michel Vounatsos to run Biogen Inc signals a shift toward a more commercial management focus after years of targeting ambitious scientific gains, and likely keeps the U.S. biotech in play as a takeover target. Vounatsos joined Biogen as chief commercial officer in April after 20 years leading various commercial operations at Merck & Co. Three months later, Biogen CEO George Scangos said he would step down, initiating a search for his successor that concluded with Monday’s announcement that Vounatsos would take the helm Jan. 6. Biogen shares rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday as investors viewed the choice of an internal CEO candidate as keeping alive a potential takeover of the company. Biogen has been subject of takeover speculation since August, when the Wall Street Journal reported it had received early stage overtures from several bidders, including Allergan Plc and Merck.  “The same strategic value of the assets are still there and the company is the same as it was last week. They still have the theoretical potential of being a target for players like Merck or Pfizer,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said.     While Biogen is still focused on producing treatments for devastating illnesses with few treatments, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, Vounatsos is being tasked with a more careful approach to how the company spends on development, and to make the most out of its existing flagship portfolio of multiple sclerosis treatments. Vounatsos stressed this goal during a call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday, saying “we will not leave a stone unturned in order to continue to grow this franchise.” After several years of impressive share price and earnings growth under Scangos, Biogen hit a major bump in the road in mid 2015, when its most important growth driver, the oral MS drug Tecfidera, badly missed sales estimates. That forced the company to lower its earnings forecasts and subsequently announce a reorganization and spin-off of its hemophilia business. Slowing growth of its MS drugs and fears of potential U.S. curbs on drug pricing that hit the entire biotech sector put additional pressure on Biogen shares. Vounatsos said he would be assessing company execution and resource allocation decisions and let Wall Street know in the first half of 2017 whether he will “validate or slightly alter the path forward.” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said many people had assumed Biogen would choose another leader with a scientific pedigree to maintain its traditional culture. Scangos, a scientist by trade, went on to head research for Bayer AG’s pharmaceutical division and led its biotechnology unit before becoming CEO of a discovery stage biotech Exelixis Inc.  “The board seems to be of the opinion that Biogen has matured into a complex commercial organization, and that protecting and growing the company’s $11 billion revenue base is now the most important priority,” Schmidt said. Speculation about internal CEO candidates had centered on two highly regarded executives with longer Biogen tenure - Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy and Chief Medical Officer Al Sandrock.  Some investors were hoping to see an outside candidate chosen to bring a fresh perspective to the company, although that would also likely send a clear message that Biogen intended to remain independent. “Many investors were looking for more of a deal-oriented CEO or an external executive who has already been in a CEO role,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said in a note, calling Vounatsos “a safe choice.” Vounatsos said he would be looking for deals to help fill out all stages of the drug development pipeline. While he has yet to oversee a major new drug launch at Biogen, typically the best way to judge performance of a chief commercial officer, one is in the offing. Biogen is widely expected to get U.S. approval in coming months for the first drug that would treat spinal muscular atrophy, the leading genetic cause of death in infants.  The drug, Spinraza, is seen as a breakthrough therapy and forecast to become a multibillion-dollar product if approved for all SMA patients. And then there is aducanumab, the experimental Alzheimer’s disease drug considered potentially the most valuable pipeline asset in biotechnology, and one that highlights Biogen’s current very high-risk, very high-reward strategy. The drug has shown early promise. But it is at least a few years from reaching the market and could well fail, as over 100  previous attempts to develop an effective Alzheimer’s treatment have already.  If it succeeds Biogen, or any company that buys Biogen, will own one of the great cash cows in pharmaceutical history.

294,BIIB,FDA approves Biogen drug for lead genetic cause of infant death,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday said it has  approved Biogen Inc’s drug to treat spinal muscular atrophy, the leading genetic cause of death in infants. It is the first FDA-approved medicine for spinal muscular atrophy, a devastating disease that affects about one in 10,000 live births.  The drug, nusinersen, which was discovered by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and licensed to Biogen, will be sold under the brand name Spinraza. The FDA approved it for use across the full range and severity of the disease. Dr. Billy Dunn, director of the FDA’s division of neurology products, said the agency “could not be more pleased to have the first approved treatment for this debilitating disease.” In the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy, known as type 1, or infantile SMA, babies rarely make it to their second birthday. Annual Spinraza sales could reach $2 billion, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.   Spinraza will be the first major drug launch under Biogen’s new chief executive, Michel Vounatsos, who will replace George Scangos on Jan. 6. SMA is caused by deficiency of a protein called smn in the spinal motor neurons. It leads to severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness, including in muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Spinraza, which is injected into the spinal fluid, increases levels of the deficient protein. In clinical trials, nusinersen led to dramatic improvement in motor milestones and extended survival. It has been tested with successful results in all severities of the disease, including in infants with the genetic deficiency who have yet to show symptoms of the disease, Biogen said. Type 2, or childhood onset SMA, affects toddlers and children. Even the least severe form, type 3 SMA, can be disabling as it progresses, leaving people needing wheelchairs, Biogen said. There are only about 9,000 patients living in the United  with SMA. Those numbers are likely to rise with an effective treatment that helps children to live longer.

296,BIIB,Biogen to pay Forward Pharma $1.25 bln to protect MS drug,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc said on Tuesday it would pay Forward Pharma A/S  $1.25 billion to license the Danish company’s patents covering multiple sclerosis drugs, providing Biogen an insurance policy on future sales of Tecfidera, its blockbuster oral treatment for the disease. Biogen and Forward Pharma have been locked in a dispute over the patents for dimethyl fumarate, the key active ingredient in Tecfidera, which had sales of about $4 billion in 2016. While the deal gives Biogen a share of Forward’s intellectual property, the legal cases are ongoing. Forward Pharma, whose shares were up 51 percent, said it was looking to return a substantial portion of its cash windfall to shareholders. It said it was considering both stock buybacks and cash distributions. The agreement does not resolve ongoing U.S. and E.U. patent disputes between the two companies, Biogen said. The U.S. biotech could still be on the hook for royalty payments on future Tecfidera sales if it loses those challenges. If Biogen patents on Tecfidera are ruled valid and enforceable the company will owe no future royalty payments. If a Forward Pharma patent ultimately keeps Tecfidera on the market and free of generic rivals, Biogen said it will pay a 10 percent royalty from 2021 through the end of 2028, and a 20 percent royalty beginning in 2029. Biogen can still appeal any patent ruling it might lose. “We believe this agreement will clarify and strengthen our intellectual property for Tecfidera,” Biogen’s new Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos said in a statement. Third-quarter Tecfidera sales of $1.03 billion accounted for about a third of Biogen revenue in the period. It is the market leader for oral MS treatments. Analysts said the agreement removes a major uncertainty that had been hanging over Biogen. The deal is important in the long term as a patent cliff on Tecfidera could have curbed the company’s growth after 2020 and weighed on investors, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said. Forward Pharma shares rose $9.36 to $27.21, while Biogen edged up 48 cents at $285.23.

303,BIIB,Possible liver injury added to label of Biogen MS drug,"(Reuters) - The prescribing label for Biogen Inc’s big-selling oral multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera has been updated to include a  warning of potential liver injury that could require hospitalization, the company said on Wednesday. However, the updated label says signs of liver injury resolved when those patients stopped taking the medicine. Tecfidera, the world’s top-selling oral MS treatment, accounts for about a third of Biogen revenue. It had sales of $1.03 billion in the third quarter. The new liver injury information can be found in a warning section under prescribing information on the drug’s website tecfidera.com. Biogen said the label changes were finalized with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Jan. 19.  “Clinically significant cases of liver injury have been reported in patients treated with Tecfidera in the postmarketing setting. The onset has ranged from a few days to several months after initiation of treatment with Tecfidera,” the warning reads. A Biogen spokeswoman said there have been 14 cases of liver injury reported out of some 230,000 patients treated with Tecfidera. Symptoms of liver injury include significant elevations above normal of serum aminotransferases and bilirubin, the warning says. While the abnormalities resolved when patients stopped taking the medicine, some cases required hospitalization.    None of the reported cases resulted in liver failure, liver transplant, or death, the warning says. Liver enzyme monitoring is standard practice for many multiple sclerosis drugs, so the warning does not represent an added burden for prescribing physicians. It remains to be seen if this tempers enthusiasm for the widely-used medicine or if it will hurt sales. “While this is something to be highlighted to physicians,  in my opinion this is not going to materially change market share or future (sales) projections,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, who forecast 2017 Tecfidera sales exceeding $4 billion. “There was already mention of some rare cases of elevated liver enzymes in the initial label,” Yee noted. Biogen is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday and likely will be asked to discuss the implications of the updated Tecfidera warning. Biogen shares were up 9 cents at $273.91.

305,BIIB,"Biogen sees gradual Spinraza launch, eyes mid-year EU approval","(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) said on Thursday that the first U.S. patients have received its new drug for the leading genetic cause of death in infants and that it anticipates mid-year approval of Spinraza in the European Union. However, the U.S. biotech cautioned it expects Spinraza to be launched gradually throughout the year as it works to secure reimbursement from insurers. The extremely expensive drug, the first approved treatment for the rare, often fatal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), is seen as the most important new growth driver for Biogen, with analysts forecasting eventual annual sales between $1 billion and $2 billion.  Biogen expects its multiple sclerosis business to be stable following recent declines and called Spinraza sales “the biggest ambiguity” in the 2017 forecast it provided. The company forecast adjusted profit of $20.45 to $21.25 per share, with analysts on average estimating $21.02. Biogen, which will spin off its hemophilia business on Feb. 1, sees 2017 revenue of $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion, below the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate of $12.08 billion. But optimistic commentary around Spinraza and a promise of continued expense management helped lift shares more than 3 percent to $282.64. “Biogen provided initial 2017 financial guidance that we view as favorable, based upon a solid top-line growth forecast and substantial cost savings,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said in a research note. Health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) this month said it would limit Spinraza coverage to only the most severe patients, even though it received approval for all grades of SMA. But new Biogen Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos said there have been reimbursement successes as well since the late December approval. “Logic will prevail in patient access for a therapy that will save lives,” Vounatsos said on a conference call. “The demand is there.” Spinraza is the first major drug launch under Vounatsos, who  succeeded George Scangos this month. The list price for Spinraza is a whopping $750,000 for the first year of therapy, dropping to about $375,000 a year after that. Insurers have been amenable to paying for very expensive drugs that extend lives in diseases with small patient populations. But political and payer scrutiny of U.S. drug pricing has intensified with President Donald Trump recently accusing pharmaceutical companies of “getting away with murder.”  Biogen said it has also filed for Spinraza approval in Japan, Australia and Canada and expects to meet with Japanese regulators in the coming days. The company also said patient enrollment for the Phase III trial of its closely-watched experimental Alzheimer’s disease drug aducanumab was ahead of its expectations. Biogen has placed big bets on extremely high-risk, high-reward therapy areas such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.  Excluding items, Biogen reported a fourth-quarter profit of  $2.99 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents. Biogen’s top-seller and market-leading oral MS treatment Tecfidera had sales of about $1 billion for the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street estimates. The company noted that Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) Aubagio had recently made some inroads into Tecfidera’s market share.  Sales of the older injectable MS drugs Tysabri and Avonex both declined.

The ruling came from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board in Washington.

The ruling by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAP) frees Bigoen Inc from future royalty payments to Forward and sent the Danish firm’s shares down nearly 20 percent.

The companies had been locked in a dispute over patents for dimethyl fumarate, the key active ingredient in Tecfidera, the leading oral MS treatment with sales of about $4 billion in 2016. The PTAP ruling found Forward’s written patent description to be insufficient to declare infringement by Biogen. Had Biogen lost it would have had to pay Forward a 10 percent royalty on Tecfidera sales starting in 2021. Biogen’s Tecfidera exclusivity is secured through 2028 under the ruling. Biogen in January had taken out something of an insurance policy against a potential defeat in the patent dispute.

The ruling by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAP) frees Bigoen Inc from future royalty payments to Forward and sent the Danish firm’s shares down nearly 20 percent. Biogen shares were up 1.4 percent. The companies had been locked in a dispute over patents for dimethyl fumarate, the key active ingredient in Tecfidera, the leading oral MS treatment with sales of about $4 billion in 2016. The PTAP ruling found Forward’s written patent description to be insufficient to declare infringement by Biogen. Had Biogen lost it would have had to pay Forward a 10 percent royalty on Tecfidera sales starting in 2021. Biogen’s Tecfidera exclusivity is secured through 2028 under the ruling. Biogen in January had taken out something of an insurance policy against a potential defeat in the patent dispute. It agreed to pay Forward $1.25 billion to license the company’s patents covering multiple sclerosis drugs, giving Biogen a share of Forward’s intellectual property.

321,BIIB,"Bristol-Myers to license two drugs to Biogen, Roche","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday it would license two of its drugs to Biogen Inc and Roche Holding AG for an upfront fee of $470 million. Bristol will license its experimental neurodegenerative disorder drug, BMS-986168, to Biogen as a treatment for progressive supranuclear palsy, which is characterized by brain cell damage. Biogen said the drug also had the potential for use in Alzheimer’s disease. BMS-986089, Bristol’s rare muscle-wasting disease drug, will be licensed by Roche for use in duchenne muscular dystrophy. Bristol, which will receive an upfront payment of $300 million from Biogen and $170 million from Roche, said it expects the deals to close in the second quarter. The deals come amid activist investor pressure. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that billionaire investor Carl Icahn had taken a stake in Bristol and saw the company as a possible takeover target.

327,BIIB,Biogen profit beats on surprisingly strong Spinraza sales,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc’s quarterly profit blew past analysts’ estimates, helped by higher-than-expected sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy drug, Spinraza. Spinraza’s robust sales, which come amid concerns over slowing demand for Biogen’s leading multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, also pushed the company’s shares up 5.4 percent in early trading on Tuesday. Spinraza, a first-of-its-kind medicine for spinal muscular atrophy (SMT), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December. SMT is the leading genetic cause of death in infants. The drug, priced at $125,000 per injection in the first year of use, generated sales of $47 million, handily beating the consensus estimate by $30 million. “We believe well over 100 SMA patients are already on the drug, and our physician survey suggests the majority of patients appropriate for therapy will be on Spinraza by year-end,” Cowen & Co analysts said.  Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy said on a post-earnings conference call that he expected Spinraza adoption to ramp up and that at least 75 percent of all insurance plans now cover the treatment.  Spinraza is the first major drug launch under Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos, who succeeded George Scangos in January.  The company is preparing for potential approvals in the EU, as well as in Japan and Canada this year, Vounatsos said on the call. Biogen said it also expects to submit marketing applications in at least 10 additional countries in 2017.  Sales of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Tysabri came in at $545 million, also well ahead of the consensus estimate of $484 million, boosted by $45 million from an agreement with the Italian health regulator related to prior Tysabri sales.  However, sales of Biogen’s MS bestseller, Tecfidera, came in at $958 million, below Street estimate of $989 million. The company said it had maintained its global MS market share in the quarter, but added that the recent launch of Roche AG’s Ocrevus had impacted sales.  However, Biogen will also benefit from Ocrevus sales, with Roche to pay the part-owner of the drug a royalty under a 2010 agreement. Biogen’s total revenue rose about 3 percent to $2.81 billion, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $2.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.              Excluding items, Biogen earned $5.20 per share, eclipsing the average estimate of $4.97.  The strong Q1 performance puts the company on pace to meet or exceed its revenue 2017 guidance, Cowen analysts said.  The company’s shares gave up some gains and were up 4.7 percent at $290.14.

351,BIIB,"After strong quarter, Biogen rolls out growth strategy","(Reuters) - Biogen Inc laid out long-term plans to strengthen its mainstay multiple sclerosis (MS) business, develop more neuroscience drugs and shop for late-stage assets, after reporting robust second-quarter results on Tuesday. Strong sales for its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug, Spinraza, also spurred the U.S. drugmaker to raise its 2017 profit and revenue forecasts.  Spinraza could become one of the company’s “largest commercial assets, shifting the center of gravity for Biogen beyond MS”, CEO Michel Vounatsos said in a post-earnings conference call.  The treatment generated a whopping $203 million in the quarter, compared with the consensus estimate of $70 million, compiled by Evercore ISI. The company said on Tuesday it may have slightly underestimated the number of patients with SMA, which could partly explain the surprisingly strong Spinraza demand. The injection is priced at $750,000 for the first year of its use but drops to $375,000 a year after that.  Vounatsos said strong U.S. growth for Spinraza would continue as more patients opt for the treatment and expected growth to slow once they shift to maintenance therapy.  The bulk of Biogen’s revenue, however, still comes from its roster of MS drugs.  Despite rising competition, the company has maintained its global market share in the segment in the second-quarter.  Sales of Tecfidera, Biogen’s leading MS drug, came in at $1.11 billion, just ahead of consensus estimates.  Biogen said it expected the MS business to be the primary driver of future cash flow.   The company said it is also planning to develop more neuroscience treatments, including for dementia and movement-related disorders, as the U.S. population ages.  Biogen said it will also focus on developing rare disorder drugs and acquiring late-stage assets.  The company would explore deals of “all sizes”, and the largest transaction could be in $10 billion to $12 billion range, Vounatsos said.  Excluding items, Biogen earned $5.04 per share, handsomely beating estimates of $4.41 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.  The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to a range of $20.80 per share to $21.40 per share, and revenue between $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion. It had forecast earnings of $20.45 per share to $21.25 per share and revenue of $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion in January. The increase in revenue outlook may still be conservative given Spinraza’s performance and prospects, analysts said. Shares of the company were little changed at $282.06 in afternoon trading.

354,BIIB,"US STOCKS-Caterpillar, McDonald's to lift S&P;, Dow at open","* Caterpillar higher after raising forecast for second time * Alphabet falls after saying costs rising faster than sales * McDonald’s, Biogen rise after quarterly results * Futures up: Dow 96 pts, S&P; 6.5 pts, Nasdaq 5 pts (Adds details, comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal July 25 (Reuters) - The S&P; and the Dow looked set to open higher on Tuesday, helped by strong earnings from Caterpillar and McDonald’s, but Google-parent Alphabet may weigh on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Caterpillar’s shares rose 5.4 percent in premarket trading after the company reported quarterly results that smashed expectations and raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. McDonald’s was up 3 percent after reporting a better-than-expected rise in sales. However, Alphabet fell 2.8 percent, after the tech giant warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices. The S&P; tech index has been the best performing sector this year and earnings from big tech companies will be closely watched to see if the rally has legs. Amazon and Facebook report results later this week, while Apple is due to report next week. The market’s run to record highs has left equities relatively expensive and investors are counting on earnings to justify the valuations. The S&P; 500 is trading at around 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, well above their long-term average of 15 times. Earnings are expected to have climbed 8.8 percent in the second quarter, compared with an 8 percent rise estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. This week alone, 190 S&P; 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results. Advanced Micro Devices, AT&T;, Chipotle and Chubb are among the major companies that report after the closing bell. “Investors will have a lot to chew on today as earnings results include at least 12 major companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. “We look for another mixed session as the FOMC meeting begins and the health care vote comes into play.” Dow e-minis were up 96 points, or 0.45 percent, with 23,225 contracts changing hands at 8:26 a.m. ET (1226 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 6.5 points, or 0.26 percent, with 124,438 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 5 points, or 0.08 percent, on volume of 21,534 contracts. The Fed kicks off a two-day meeting later in the day to discuss its monetary stance and the timing of its long-awaited balance sheet reduction. While no rate hike is expected due to subdued inflation, the central bank’s statement on Wednesday will be parsed for clues on the pace of future rate hikes. Investors will also be keeping an eye on a Senate vote on a healthcare bill, with lawmakers voting on whether to push forward with repealing Obamacare or perhaps abandon it entirely. Biogen rose 4.4 percent after the biotech company raised its full-year revenue forecast. Eli Lilly was down 1.5 percent, while 3M fell 2.6 percent after reporting results.

The new drug, Imraldi, marks the third European Commission approval for “biosimilar” versions from the joint venture, Samsung Bioepis, of drugs in a class known as TNF inhibitors. Biosimilar copies of expensive biotech drugs are gaining momentum in Europe, which has been faster to adopt their use than the United States, and their potential to take business from companies making the original products is being monitored closely by investors.  Imraldi was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, pediatric plaque psoriasis, adult and adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis. “As the number of approved biosimilars continues to grow, so does the anticipated potential to increase physician choice and patient access to biologics,” Jean-Paul Kress, head of global therapeutic options at Biogen, said in a statement. Last year, Samsung Bioepis received European Commission marketing authorization for Benepali, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc’s Enbrel, and for Flixabi, a version of Remicade, which is sold by Johnson & Johnson. Earlier this year, Amgen won European approval for the first copy of Humira, also called adalimumab. The green lights clear the way for biosimilar copies of Humira to be launched in Europe in due course, although lawyers do not expect that to happen before October 2018, given the patents protecting adalimumab.

369,BIIB,Biogen dives as Spinraza U.S. sales miss estimates,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc’s (BIIB.O) shares dived 8 percent on Tuesday after U.S. sales of Spinraza, a potential blockbuster drug it is banking on to offset slowing sales of multiple sclerosis drugs, fell short of Wall Street estimates in the latest quarter. Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug, generated $197.6 million in U.S. sales in the third quarter, lagging analysts’ average estimate of $242 million, according to broker SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. The shortfall was due to the dosing regimen of the drug, which was approved in December, as fewer patients took the more frequent “loading”, or initial, dose, Biogen Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos said on an earnings call. The treatment starts with four loading doses, followed by maintenance doses once every four months. The first three loading doses are taken at 14 day intervals and the last 30 days after the third, meaning all four can be taken in one quarter. Many patients who took the loading doses in the second quarter did not get a loading dose in the latest quarter and instead took a maintenance dose, Vounatsos said. He estimated that the impact of the dosing schedule likely means that Spinraza’s revenue growth in the current quarter would be driven mostly by non-U.S. markets. Spinraza costs $750,000 for the first year and $375,000 a year after that to treat SMA, a rare disorder that is the leading genetic cause of death in infants. Biogen is banking on Spinraza to offset slowing growth of its bestselling multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Tecfidera, which is facing stiff competition from Roche AG’s (ROG.S) Ocrevus and Sanofi SA’s (SASY.PA) Aubagio. Vounatsos estimated Ocrevus would have a “modest net negative impact” on Biogen’s MS portfolio, which also includes Tysabri, for the rest of 2017. Separately, Biogen said it would pay Neuimmune Holding AG $150 million to reduce the royalty payment on potential sales of its experimental Alzheimer’s disease treatment, aducanumab. The move would improve Biogen’s economics in its Alzheimer’s pipeline, analysts said. Tecfidera’s sales dipped 3.5 percent to $1.07 billion in the quarter, and also missed analysts’ estimates of $1.09 billion. Biogen’s profit rose 18.7 percent to $1.23 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Excluding one-time items, it earned $6.31 per share. Total revenue climbed 4.1 percent to $3.08 billion. Analysts on average had estimated a profit of $5.73 per share and revenue of $3.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Biogen’s shares fell as much as 8.1 percent, before easing to trade 3.3 percent lower at $317.84.

The index hit another intraday record high and was on track to post its biggest intraday percentage gain since Sept. 11. 3M jumped 7.2 percent and Caterpillar 4.7 percent after the two companies reported quarterly results and gave upbeat forecasts. The S&P; industrial sector , up 0.6 percent, also hit a record high. “It has been encouraging to see some of these industrial names report solid numbers and raise their guidance,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. “Looking at some the earnings we got yesterday and the ones today, you’re seeing strength domestically here in the U.S.” General Motors rose 2.9 percent. The No.1 U.S. automaker reported stronger-than-expected earnings, reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast and promised to slash stocks of unsold vehicles. But the financial index, up 0.9 percent, gave the S&P; 500 its biggest boost, followed by technology, up 0.5 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 200.03 points, or 0.86 percent, to 23,473.99, the S&P; 500 gained 6.5 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,571.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.42 points, or 0.36 percent, to 6,610.25. McDonald’s, another Dow component, also rose following results. The stock was last up 0.8 percent. Strong earnings and optimism about President Donald Trump’s tax plans helped the Dow and S&P; close at a record high on all five trading days last week. Offsetting some of the day’s gains, Biogen slipped 3.4 percent after disappointing U.S. sales of a potential blockbuster drug, Spinraza. Whirlpool tumbled 10.8 percent after the home appliances maker reported profit and sales below estimates and lowered full-year earnings guidance. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

379,BIIB,Biogen boosts multiple sclerosis holding with Alkermes license,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc said on Monday it has licensed Alkermes Plc’s multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, further boosting its position in the race for the next treatment amid slowing sales of its own flagship MS drug, Tecfidera. Biogen’s deal to buy the rights to develop and market Alkermes’ MS drug comes after the drugmaker in January licensed Danish company Forward Pharma A/S’s drug patents covering the same condition for $1.25 billion. Sales of Tecfidera, Biogen’s bestselling MS drug, has slowed amid stiff competition from Roche AG’s Ocrevus and Sanofi SA’s Aubagio. Multiple sclerosis is a disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord. Biogen’s deal with Alkermes is a “defensive play” that could better position the Tecfidera franchise in the long term in an increasingly competitive space, and for a relatively modest cost, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said. He said he did not view Alkermes’ drug as a major competitive threat to Tecfidera, but it could have the potential to help Biogen retain some market share. Biogen said it will reimburse Alkermes half of the expenses it incurred this year to develop the drug and will pay all expenses from next year for the drug, which is in late-stage studies. Alkermes is also eligible to receive milestone-based payments of about $200 million, including an initial $50 million this year, as well as royalties on the drug’s sales. Alkermes’ drug, ALKS 8700, is also being separately tested for its ability to irritate the gastrointestinal functions less than Tecfidera. Data from this study is expected in the first half of 2018.

The company said an independent data monitoring board concluded that its drug, BAN2401, did not show success in patients with Alzheimer’s disease during an interim analysis. However, Biogen said the 18-month trial will continue for further analysis, the data from which is expected in the second half of next year. “The fact that BAN2401 study did not stop for futility suggests some benefits are being observed,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said. The U.S. drugmaker is developing BAN2401 and another Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, in collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co Ltd. Mizuho’s analyst Salim Syed said the interim data announced on Thursday should be viewed separately from the upcoming late-stage data testing Biogen’s aducanumab. “BAN2401 and aducanumab are not the same antibody,” he said. Shares of Biogen, which amended its agreement with Eisai in October by eliminating milestone payments for both its Alzheimer’s drugs, were down 4.3 percent at $319.

388,BIIB,Biogen forecasts robust 2018 as Spinraza sales surge,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) on Thursday posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and set upbeat expectations for the year on strong sales from its expensive rare-disease treatment Spinraza. Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos said the company was looking at large and small takeover opportunities to bolster its pipeline and revenue growth. Spinraza became the first FDA approved treatment for the rare, often fatal disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in December 2016.  The drug powered a 15.3 percent surge in Biogen’s fourth quarter revenue, bringing in $363 million. That beat analyst estimates of $319 million, according to brokerage Cowen & Co., and well outpaced expectations from the beginning of 2017. Growth was strongest for the drug outside the United States. Shares of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company rose 2.3 percent to $354.32 in late morning trading.  The list price for Spinraza is a whopping $750,000 for the first year of therapy, dropping to about $375,000 a year after that. It is a potential blockbuster for Biogen, but does face possible competition as smaller gene therapy company Avexis Inc (AVXS.O) is developing an SMA treatment. Biogen recorded a fourth-quarter loss compared with a year-ago profit, as it recorded a $1.57 billion charge due to the U.S. tax code overhaul.  Despite increasing competition for its key multiple sclerosis drugs, Biogen forecast 2018 adjusted earnings per share between $24.20 and $25.20, above consensus estimates of  $24.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for 2018 is expected to be in the range of $12.7 billion to $13 billion. Analysts on average expect $12.7 billion. Executives on the company’s conference call noted that through cash and leverage, Biogen has access to up to $37 billion for deals and other capital expenditure.

389,BIIB,UPDATE 3-Biogen forecasts robust 2018 as Spinraza sales surge,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) on Thursday posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and set upbeat expectations for the year on strong sales from its expensive rare-disease treatment Spinraza. Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos said the company was looking at large and small takeover opportunities to bolster its pipeline and revenue growth. Spinraza became the first FDA approved treatment for the rare, often fatal disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in December 2016.  The drug powered a 15.3 percent surge in Biogen’s fourth quarter revenue, bringing in $363 million. That beat analyst estimates of $319 million, according to brokerage Cowen & Co., and well outpaced expectations from the beginning of 2017. Growth was strongest for the drug outside the United States. Shares of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company rose 2.3 percent to $354.32 in late morning trading.  The list price for Spinraza is a whopping $750,000 for the first year of therapy, dropping to about $375,000 a year after that. It is a potential blockbuster for Biogen, but does face possible competition as smaller gene therapy company Avexis Inc (AVXS.O) is developing an SMA treatment. Biogen recorded a fourth-quarter loss compared with a year-ago profit, as it recorded a $1.57 billion charge due to the U.S. tax code overhaul.  Despite increasing competition for its key multiple sclerosis drugs, Biogen forecast 2018 adjusted earnings per share between $24.20 and $25.20, above consensus estimates of  $24.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for 2018 is expected to be in the range of $12.7 billion to $13 billion. Analysts on average expect $12.7 billion. Executives on the company’s conference call noted that through cash and leverage, Biogen has access to up to $37 billion for deals and other capital expenditure.  That “gives us a lot of capacity to add to the business and I think our focus is on that — on growing the business, continuing to be active in early stage, but also hopefully being active in mid- to late-stage assets to bring in things that are closer to revenue,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Capello said.

393,BIIB,Biogen stops testing Tysabri to treat stroke after study fails,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc will stop testing established drug Tysabri for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke after it failed a mid-stage study, the U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday. Tysabri, which made nearly $2 billion in 2017 sales, belongs to Biogen’s franchise of multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs that has driven much of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company’s explosive growth in recent years. Tysabri’s stroke trial comes as Biogen’s MS portfolio, which is led by top-selling drug Tecfidera, faces mounting competition from Roche AG’s Ocrevus and Sanofi SA’s Aubagio. Analysts, who have viewed Biogen’s plans to develop Tysabri for stroke as risky, were unsurprised by the trial’s failure. “Tysabri’s failure in stroke this morning is likely to have limited impact, as our sense had been that expectations were quite low,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams. Ischemic strokes require immediate medical attention and occur when blood supply is cut off to part of the brain. In the mid-stage trial, Biogen’s treatment failed to improve patients’ self-dependence and their ability to perform daily activities when compared with a placebo. Biogen also has other drugs in mid-stage trials including treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. Its closely watched Alzheimer’s drug candidate aducanumab is in late-stage testing, while another Alzheimer’s treatment failed a mid-stage study in December. “We continue to believe Biogen’s mid-stage neuro pipeline is scientifically sound and should generate more interest as programs reach later stages,” RBC’s Abrahams said.

Zinbryta was approved by the U.S. regulators in 2016 with a boxed warning due to risks of liver damage, with Biogen selling the self-administered drug in Switzerland, Canada and the EU and AbbVie in the U.S. In November, the European regulator flagged safety concerns about the drug restricting its usage to reduce the risk of serious liver damage. The EMA said on Friday it initiated an urgent review of Zinbryta following seven cases of serious brain disorders in Germany and one in Spain.

This is the second deal AbbVie has signed over the past year as it tries to safeguard patents on Humira, which is the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. The drug, which treats rheumatoid arthritis, raked in $18.43 billion in sales last year and accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie’s net revenue. While terms of the deal were undisclosed, the companies said they agreed to dismiss all pending lawsuits. Samsung Bioepis’ license to market its biosimilar will kick off on June 30, 2023, after which Samsung will pay royalties to license Humira patents, AbbVie said in a statement. Biogen expects to launch the biosimilar, Imraldi, in Europe in mid-October this year. In September, Amgen Inc reached a similar settlement with AbbVie to delay the U.S. launch of its cheaper biosimilar to Humira until Jan. 31, 2023.

Established in 2012, Samsung Bioepis now has five biosimilar drugs approved in Europe, and one approved in the United States so far, according to its website. Samsung C&T;, which owns a 43 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics, did not have an immediate comment. A spokesman for Samsung BioLogics could not be reached. Samsung Bioepis said it was not in a position to comment.

412,BIIB,Biogen boosts investment in neurology with $1 billion Ionis deal,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc struck a $1 billion neurology drug development deal with Ionis Pharmaceuticals on Friday, expanding a partnership that developed the company’s potential blockbuster drug for spinal muscular atrophy. Biogen’s shares, however, fell about 2 percent as investors were looking for a larger deal, especially after rival Novartis AG last week said it would buy AveXis Inc for $8.7 billion to gain access to its gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. “Given the fact that just happened and ...here they are a week later not buying that company and doing a $1 billion pre-clinical deal, I think the Street remains very nervous and uncertain,” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee told Reuters. Biogen, which has a $37 billion war chest, licensed the  spinal muscular atrophy treatment Spinraza from Ionis as part of an earlier agreement.  The company is now banking on Spinraza, with a list price of $750,000 for the first year, to offset slowing growth of its top-selling drug Tecfidera, a treatment for multiple sclerosis. Biogen’s new 10-year agreement with Ionis gives the company the option to license and commercialize a range of neurological therapies for conditions including Alzheimer’s and dementia. “We anticipate advancing up to seven new high potential drug candidates from these collaborations into the clinic in the next two years,” Biogen executives said on a conference call. The executives also highlighted strong safety data for treatments Ionis is working on, including a class of medicines called antisense oligonucleotides over gene therapies. “Opportunities for antisense technology are by far broader and larger (than gene therapy), and technology is far more validated,” Ionis executives said on a conference call. California-based Ionis is also eligible to receive milestone-based payments, license fees and royalties on net sales of the drugs as per the deal. The agreement, which comes ahead of Biogen’s first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, includes a $625 million equity investment in Ionis and a $375 million upfront payment. Ionis’ shares rose 4.7 percent in early trading on Friday. ",4202018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-biogen-deal/biogen-boosts-investment-in-neurology-with-1-billion-ionis-deal-idUSKBN1HR1JF

416,BIIB,Biogen's revenue misses as Spinraza sales disappoint,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Biogen Inc’s (BIIB.O) quarterly revenue missed analysts’ estimates on Tuesday as it had disappointing sales of its promising drug Spinraza to treat spinal muscular atrophy because fewer new patients used the expensive treatment. Biogen shares fell in early trade after sales of Spinraza as well as its flagship drug, Tecfidera, were weaker than expected, underscoring investor concerns about the company’s drug development prospects. But shares pared losses and were up 0.6 percent at $260.94 in midday trade. The company has been banking on Spinraza’s success to prop up slowing growth of its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, which is facing increasing competition. Spinraza, the first Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, had quarterly revenue of $364 million, short of analysts’ estimates of $381.55 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The miss was partly due to lower uptake in the United States and more patients moving to a lower-priced maintenance dose from an induction dose, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee told Reuters.     In the U.S. about 40 percent of Spinraza revenue in the first quarter was from maintenance doses compared with 25 percent in the fourth quarter, Biogen said, noting early adoption was largely from a big influx of new patients. The number of patients receiving Spinraza grew 16 percent in the U.S. from the preceding quarter and Biogen said it would focus on reaching more adults, the largest group of patients afflicted with the disease in the United States. “We believe that the international opportunity for Spinraza is even greater than in the U.S.,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Capello said on a conference call. The company has so far steered clear of big deals and instead focused on smaller investments as it remains under pressure to snap up late-stage drugs, particularly given skepticism about its experimental Alzheimer’s treatments.  “Most investors want them to do a deal that’s of substance so people can see growth on the horizon,” Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed said. “People are just wondering what’s the reason to stay invested in the stock... This is one where if you’re a little bit patient you can make money longer term.” Sales of Tecfidera hit $987 million in the quarter, below estimates of $1.02 billion. Net income rose 58 percent to $1.17 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. Excluding items, Biogen earned $6.05 per share, above analysts’ estimates of $5.94. Revenue rose 11.4 percent to $3.13 billion, shy of the $3.16 billion estimate.

422,BIIB,UPDATE 3-Accounting concerns wipe $6 bln off Samsung BioLogics market value,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean biotech drug manufacturer Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd (207940.KS) lost almost $6 billion in market value on Wednesday in its biggest intra-day share drop, after the country’s financial watchdog said it breached accounting rules.  Shares in the $30 billion company, an affiliate of technology giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), plunged almost 20 percent amid suspicion it breached accounting rules to inflate its net profit before its 2016 listing.  The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), South Korea’s financial regulator, said on Tuesday it had given preliminary notice to Samsung BioLogics and its auditors of measures it could take concerning the suspected breach.  The watchdog did not elaborate on its allegation, but political activists and lawmakers have long questioned the company’s swing into profit two years ago.  Samsung BioLogics said it would prove it followed rules backed by South Korea’s three major accounting firms, and would  sue if the country’s top financial regulator, which makes the final decision, found otherwise.  “If a decision is made that we cannot accept, we plan to file an administrative lawsuit,” BioLogics’ Vice-President Byunghwa Shim told reporters.  The dispute is latest controversy to hit a Samsung affiliate after Samsung Securities’ (016360.KS) damaging fat finger mistake last month. It also follows on the heels of U.S. hedge fund Elliott launching a legal case against the South Korean government over a 2015 merger between Samsung affiliates.          South Korea’s powerful family-run conglomerates, of which Samsung Group is the largest, are under mounting political and investor pressure to boost transparency since Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee was arrested last year on bribery and embezzlement charges. Lee, who has denied charges, was set free in February after a court suspended his sentence.  Samsung BioLogics' shares fell as much as 19.8 percent to their lowest since late January, before paring losses to trade down 17.2 percent. It was their biggest intra-day drop since listing in late 2016. The benchmark KOSPI .KS11 was down 0.4 percent.  Activist group the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy and lawmakers raised questions last year about Samsung BioLogics’ 1.9 trillion won ($1.77 billion) net profit in 2015. A year earlier it had posted a roughly 28 billion won net loss.  The world’s third-largest biotech contract manufacturer after Lonza Group (LONN.S) and Boeringer Ingelheim in terms of manufacturing capacity said the profit was the result of following IFRS accounting standards.   In late 2015 and early 2016, when BioLogics’ books for 2015 were being compiled, the perceived market value of its unit Samsung Bioepis skyrocketed on the back of approvals for its copies of blockbuster biotech drugs in Europe and South Korea.  As Bioepis’s perceived value rose, minor shareholder Biogen said it could exercise its call option to increase its stake to 50 percent minus one share.  Accounting experts told BioLogics that according to IFRS rules, the possibility of the call option being exercised meant Bioepis needed to be categorized as an affiliate, not a unit, which in turn meant the stake needed to be reflected in BioLogics’ books by fair value, not book value, BioLogics said on Wednesday.  The change to fair value, and the subsequent net profit, was approved by KPMG Korea, Deloitte Korea and PricewaterhouseCoopers Korea, and the FSS did not raise an issue when it released the 2015 books in 2016, the company added.   An FSS official declined to comment.  Shares in Samsung C&T; Corp (028260.KS), which held a 43 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, also fell more than 5 percent. Shares of Samsung Elec, which owned a 31.5 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, were on a trading halt on Wednesday ahead of a stock split.
