1,MO,IFR-US CREDIT-Bondholders take backseat to shareholders," by Timothy Sifert  NEW YORK, July 8 (IFR) - The increase in shareholder-friendly activity among investment-grade bond issuers has bondholders concerned that their interest might not be at heart in the boardrooms of their portfolio companies.  US corporations have generally weathered the credit crisis with aplomb, socking away historically high levels of cash. But in many cases executives’ fiscal conservatism has been at the expense of growth, and therefore at the expense of shareholders.  As new opportunities open up many companies are changing their tack, rewarding shareholders with stock repurchaseS, higher dividends and, at times, acquisitions. In this case, what’s good for equity investors isn’t great for bond holders.  So far it has been the better-capitalised credits that have been spending, and bond investors haven’t complained much as a result. But should the shareholder-friendly trend continue on pace, there’s reason to worry.   “I’m surprised bondholders aren’t more concerned about this,” said one head of investment grade syndicate in New York.  There have been a slew of share-repurchase deals this year already, totalling about US$24.8bn and including trades from blue chip names Blackrock (BLK.N), Philip Morris International (MO.N), Best Buy (BBY.N), Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).  Indeed bondholders have said they are concerned about their holdings, but they say it’s not a market-wide problem. Only select names are guilty.  A Fitch report released last week suggests as much. The rating agency sought to highlight which investment grade companies might be most prone to institute shareholder-friendly policies in the future.  The report looked at metrics that might indicate a company would want to engage in share repurchases, restructurings, spinoffs, among other plans that are potentially damaging to bondholders. Borrowers with low ratios of enterprise value to EBITDA versus their high-grade peers, for example, might be acquisition targets or might pursue other potentially leveraging actions to boost the ratio.  The report highlights tens of borrowers. But to illustrate the thrust of the thesis it looked at RR Donnelley (RRD.N), the only company in the report without investment grade ratings. In May, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P downgraded RR Donnelley to junk.  “This company illustrates what can happen to ratings when cyclicality, long-term structural challenges, and accelerated share repurchases collide,” according to the report.  RR Donnelley is currently engaged in a US$1bn buyback programme it expects to complete next year. In addition, the rating agencies expect the company to pursue debt-financed acquisitions to get ahead in the slowing-moving printing sector.  Best Buy is another credit bondholders should be wary about. On June 27, Fitch downgraded the retailer two notches to BBB- in part because the retailer announced a new US$5bn share repurchase and a dividend increase. In March, Best Buy completed a US$650m 5.50% 10-year note at plus 200bp and a US$350m 3.75% five-year note at 162.5bp to fund the repurchase. The 10-year was quoted on TRACE at plus 249bp earlier this week.  Best Buy, like RR Donnelley, has opted to reward shareholders somewhat aggressively despite having many real challenges ahead.  “The company’s business profile faces amplified headwinds from same-store sales, market share, and competition,” Fitch wrote in the report.  Another borrower Fitch expounded on was Expedia (EXPE.O). The agency put the borrower’s ratings on negative watch in April after the company said it planned to spin off TripAdvisor to shareholders. If the divestiture goes ahead, existing bondholders will be left owning a weaker credit. Stockholders, though, will be better off.  Expedia was last in the US dollar bond market on August 2 last year. It printed a US$750m offering of 5.95% 10-year notes to yield plus 300bp. This week it was quoted on TRACE at plus 323bp.

Reynolds, whose shares fell nearly 5 percent in midday trading, posted a 4.4 percent drop in shipment volume to 19.4 billion cigarettes. Marlboro maker Altria’s cigarette shipments fell 0.7 percent, the company said on Wednesday.   A charge from a smoking cessation program in Louisiana and costs for plant closings also cut into profits.   “[Reynolds] eased back on price promotions, which meant that the price gap between their discount brands and Altria’s premium brands shrunk a little bit,” said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham.   Nonetheless, market share for Camel and Pall Mall, Reynolds’ leading brands, rose to 16.3 percent from 14.8 percent growth a year earlier.   Reynolds’ net income was $304 million, or 52 cents a share, in the second quarter, down from $341 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier.   Excluding the charge from the Louisiana program and other one-time items, earnings were 67 cents a share, below the analysts’ average estimate of 71 cents compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Net sales edged up to $2.27 billion from $2.25 billion a year earlier.   Reynolds raised the low end of its full-year earnings forecast, excluding special items, to $2.62 to $2.70 per share from $2.60 to $2.70. Analysts were expecting a profit of $2.67 per share.

8,MO,Newsmaker: Rosenfeld wakes market with Kraft split plan,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N CEO Irene Rosenfeld ended her victorious five-month battle for British chocolatier Cadbury last year saying she wanted a good night’s sleep.  Apparently rested, she woke up the market on Thursday with a predawn announcement that she was splitting Kraft up, separating Cadbury and the rest of the candy, cookie and snacks business from a North American grocery business that includes Kraft cheese and Oscar Mayer lunch meat.  On one hand, the move is typical of Rosenfeld since she took over at Kraft in 2006. On her watch, Kraft made the $18.5 billion Cadbury purchase, acquired Lu biscuits and divested the Post cereal business.  “There seems to always be something going on there,” Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said.  But some analysts wonder what exactly is going on.  Rosenfeld is known for standing her ground, including in her bid for Cadbury, when even Kraft’s largest shareholder, Warren Buffett, warned against overpaying.  In 2009, when she rolled out new operational guidelines for Kraft, she had sharp plans for what to do with employees who resisted.  “You roll right over them,” Rosenfeld said.  Rosenfeld, 58, has sometimes been seen as tough and stubborn, according to Tom Pirko, founder of consulting firm Bevmark LLC, who worked with Cadbury Chief Todd Stitzer when the company, and much of Britain, fiercely opposed the takeover by a foreigner.  But the question now is whether Rosenfeld is rolling back Kraft’s ambition by splitting the company up.  “If anything, I would say that the act is reactionary, based upon shareholder pressure, a measure designed to protect each business from the other,” Pirko said.  The second-most powerful American businesswoman as ranked by Fortune magazine, Rosenfeld has had to deal with powerful and vocal shareholders, including Buffett and activist investors Nelson Peltz and William Ackman.  Peltz, who once pushed Kraft to add two board members of his choosing, disclosed a 12.2 million share stake in Kraft in June through his firm, Trian Fund Management. That sparked speculation the split was pushed by Peltz.  But Rosenfeld insisted Kraft has mulled a split for years.  “It is not a new consideration. We’ve been evaluating it for quite some time and, actually, it dates back to the Lu biscuit acquisition,” Rosenfeld said in an interview.  A source familiar with the situation confirmed this and said Kraft at the time decided the snacks and sweets business was too small to stand alone.  The Cadbury acquisition boosted the business and eventually led to Kraft revisiting the split.  “As we continue to progress in our strategic thinking for the combined company and looking out to the next couple of years, we determined that this was an idea whose time had come,” Rosenfeld said.  Rosenfeld, who listed her childhood ambition as being president of the United States, has charted a steady rise in the food industry since earning a doctoral degree in marketing and statistics from Cornell University, where she played basketball until she broke a leg during her freshman year.  She rose through the ranks at General Foods as that company became part of Philip Morris Cos, which later combined it with another acquisition, Kraft.  Rosenfeld eventually led the integration of Nabisco into the Kraft business and was part of the team that led Kraft’s initial public offering from Philip Morris — now Altria Group Inc (MO.N) — in 2001.  After leaving Kraft in 2003, Rosenfeld became head of PepsiCo Inc’s PEP.N Frito-Lay snacks unit, where she pushed for healthier products.  Meanwhile, Kraft suffered from slow sales growth and a series of restructurings that cut into profits.  In 2006, Rosenfeld went back to Kraft as CEO and became chairman in 2007. She has pushed more money into marketing and product development, which has helped to boost sales and recover some market share.  Rosenfeld knows her reputation depends by how well the split works.  “It will be the legacy of me and my management team,” she added.

11,MO,"As swift bear market bit, some funds were prepared","BOSTON (Reuters) - Some investors burned by the bear market of 2008 have gravitated to funds that use short-term tactics to avoid losses — and the strategy has paid off in recent months.  Such funds, like the $7.3 billion Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Fund or the $14.8 billion Permanent Portfolio, have recently outperformed the market and traditional lower-risk balanced funds.  These are not the leveraged short-selling funds that surge with each market decline. They are diversified funds with a bias: Their managers look for ways to preserve capital during market swoons.  The past month was a key test for the funds as they encountered one of the swiftest bears to bite investors in years. The average U.S. equity mutual fund lost 7.33 percent Monday and 19.31 percent over the past month, according to Lipper data. Even balanced funds known for conservative, diversified investments, lost 4.53 percent and 11.73 percent.  But the risk-reducing strategies of the ‘hedging’ funds appear to have worked better to preserve capital:  —The Eaton Vance fund, which spreads its bets for and against currencies, equities and bonds, lost just 0.56 percent on Monday and 1.19 percent over the past month.  —The Permanent Portfolio, hedging with precious metals and foreign currencies, dropped just 1.26 percent on Monday and 2.63 percent over the past month.  —Quant investing firm AQR’s $155 million Risk Parity Fund, one of the most complicated new offerings, uses a strategy of investing relatively more in bonds than a typical balanced fund. The fund lost 2.22 percent on Monday and 5.21 percent over the past month.  —The $164 million Forester Value Fund combines individual stock picking with hedges using puts on market indexes and the occasional short-positioned exchange-traded fund. The fund dropped just 1.82 percent on Monday and 6.09 percent over the past month.  The funds are not likely to do as well in a rebound as ones that are less risk averse. Stocks rebounded sharply Tuesday, but for a large population of cautious investors it was a fresh reminder to look for safe investing alternatives.  At Eaton Vance, Eric Stein and his co-managers have been anticipating problems in the United States and Europe for quite some time.  The fund’s short positions in European sovereign debt and bets on emerging market currencies have performed well in recent weeks as the crisis rolled on.  In the U.S., Eaton Vance is less concerned with the recent battle over extending the debt ceiling and Standard &Poor’s decision to downgrade. Instead, the firm is far more worried about the weakening economy that can’t seem to get back on its feet after the 2008 financial crisis.  Stein’s fund started shorting Greek debt back in 2005 but lately has cut back and shifted to more fruitful targets like the bonds of Spain, France and Belgium. Triple-A rated French debt looks particularly juicy to short, Stein said.  But this is not just a short-selling ambush. On the long side, the fund has bought the currencies of Malaysia, Indonesia and China. All three offer better yields than U.S. short-term accounts and feature economies with much better growth prospects, he said.  It’s impossible to create a perfect hedge, to be sure, and not all of the funds’ strategies paid off. Seeing a problem on the horizon is one challenge. Timing is another  At the $1.2 billion Leuthold Core Investment Fund, managers saw warning signs of a stock market drop building in July. Co-manager Andy Engel in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said the almost 200 economic and market indicators his firm tracks shifted from positive to neutral around July 15 and flashed “sell” by July 29.  It took a few days for managers to pare their 60 percent long position in stocks down to 45 percent. And they plan to go still lower, shooting for the minimum 30 percent permitted by the fund’s investment guidelines, Engel said.  “We think this is a new cyclical bear market,” Engel said. “From peak to trough, we’re expecting a 25 to 30 percent decline. That’s about 950 on the S&P 500.”  The fund lost 3.57 percent on Monday, slightly better than the average for balanced funds, and 12.22 percent over the past month, also better than most.  The fund was hurt by a small short position against U.S. Treasury 10-year bonds, which rallied sharply on Monday. The surprising strength of U.S. bonds after the Standard & Poor’s downgrade led to losses on the trade.  “The stunning thing was the debt was downgraded and people are flooding into T-bonds still,” he said. “People looking at the Treasury market as a safe haven are going to be sorely disappointed.”  Forester Value manager Tom Forester was able to position for the crash in time.  All year, Forester has been lightening up on financial and industrial stocks, cutting back positions in custody back State Street and manufacturer Honeywell, for example, while adding to defensive picks like Pfizer, Kraft Foods and Altria Group.  “A lot of these blue chip stocks have great balance sheets and their revenues are fairly stable,” Forester, based in Lake Forest, Illinois, said.

12,MO,"As swift bear market bit, some funds were prepared"," BOSTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Some investors burned by the bear market of 2008 have gravitated to funds that use short-term tactics to avoid losses — and the strategy has paid off in recent months.   Such funds, like the $7.3 billion Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Fund (EAGMX.O) or the $14.8 billion Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX.O), have recently outperformed the market and traditional lower-risk balanced funds.   These are not the leveraged short-selling funds that surge with each market decline. They are diversified funds with a bias: Their managers look for ways to preserve capital during market swoons.   The past month was a key test for the funds as they encountered one of the swiftest bears to bite investors in years. The average U.S. equity mutual fund lost 7.33 percent Monday and 19.31 percent over the past month, according to Lipper data. Even balanced funds known for conservative,diversified investments, lost 4.53 percent and 11.73 percent.   But the risk-reducing strategies of the ‘hedging’ funds appear to have worked better to preserve capital:   —The Eaton Vance fund, which spreads its bets for and against currencies, equities and bonds, lost just 0.56 percent on Monday and 1.19 percent over the past month.   —The Permanent Portfolio, hedging with precious metals and foreign currencies, dropped just 1.26 percent on Monday and 2.63 percent over the past month.   —Quant investing firm AQR’s $155 million Risk Parity Fund (AQRIX.O), one of the most complicated new offerings, uses a strategy of investing relatively more in bonds than a typical balanced fund. The fund lost 2.22 percent on Monday and 5.21 percent over the past month.  —The $164 million Forester Value Fund (FVALX.O) combines individual stock picking with hedges using puts on market indexes and the occasional short-positioned exchange-traded fund. The fund dropped just 1.82 percent on Monday and 6.09 percent over the past month.   The funds are not likely to do as well in a rebound as ones that are less risk averse. Stocks rebounded sharply Tuesday, but for a large population of cautious investors it was a fresh reminder to look for safe investing alternatives.   At Eaton Vance, Eric Stein and his co-managers have been anticipating problems in the United States and Europe for quite some time.   The fund’s short positions in European sovereign debt and bets on emerging market currencies have performed well in recent weeks as the crisis rolled on.   In the U.S., Eaton Vance is less concerned with the recent battle over extending the debt ceiling and Standard &Poor’s decision to downgrade. Instead, the firm is far more worried about the weakening economy that can’t seem to get back on its feet after the 2008 financial crisis.   Stein’s fund started shorting Greek debt back in 2005 but lately has cut back and shifted to more fruitful targets like the bonds of Spain, France and Belgium. Triple-A rated French debt looks particularly juicy to short, Stein said.   But this is not just a short-selling ambush. On the long side, the fund has bought the currencies of Malaysia, Indonesia and China. All three offer better yields than U.S. short-term accounts and feature economies with much better growth prospects, he said.   It’s impossible to create a perfect hedge, to be sure, and not all of the funds’ strategies paid off. Seeing a problem on the horizon is one challenge. Timing is another    At the $1.2 billion Leuthold Core Investment Fund (LCORX.O), managers saw warning signs of a stock market drop building in July. Co-manager Andy Engel in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said the almost 200 economic and market indicators his firm tracks shifted from positive to neutral around July 15 and flashed “sell” by July 29.   It took a few days for managers to pare their 60 percent long position in stocks down to 45 percent. And they plan to go still lower, shooting for the minimum 30 percent permitted by the fund’s investment guidelines, Engel said.   “We think this is a new cyclical bear market,” Engel said. “From peak to trough, we’re expecting a 25 to 30 percent decline. That’s about 950 on the S&P 500.”   The fund lost 3.57 percent on Monday, slightly better than the average for balanced funds, and 12.22 percent over the past month, also better than most.   The fund was hurt by a small short position against U.S. Treasury 10-year bonds, which rallied sharply on Monday. The surprising strength of U.S. bonds after the Standard & Poor’s downgrade led to losses on the trade.   “The stunning thing was the debt was downgraded and people are flooding into T-bonds still,” he said. “People looking at the Treasury market as a safe haven are going to be sorely disappointed.”   Forester Value manager Tom Forester was able to position for the crash in time.   All year, Forester has been lightening up on financial and industrial stocks, cutting back positions in custody back State Street (STT.N) and manufacturer Honeywell (HON.N), for example, while adding to defensive picks like Pfizer (PFE.N), Kraft Foods KFT.N and Altria Group (MO.N).   “A lot of these blue chip stocks have great balance sheets and their revenues are fairly stable,” Forester, based in Lake Forest, Illinois, said. All three declined in Monday’s crash but less than the overall market. “People are starting to appreciate risk again. You can’t eliminate risk but we try to manage it.”  ",8092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-investors/as-swift-bear-market-bit-some-funds-were-prepared-idUSN1E7771QP20110809
13,MO,US SEC says will fix whistleblower rule if any problems," * New rules provide incentives for whistleblowers   * SEC says rules won’t undermine internal compliance   * Website for whistleblowers to be unveiled Friday   By Andrea Shalal-Esa   WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s controversial new whistleblower law takes effect on Friday after opponents failed to file any legal challenges, but the man in charge said the agency stood ready to make changes if any unintended problems cropped up.   The rules, approved on a 3-2 vote, emerged as one of the most contentious requirements of last year’s Dodd-Frank Wall Street overhaul law. It will allow tipsters to be paid between 10 and 30 percent of sanctions over $1 million for original and useful information.   “If our program is not doing what it’s intended to do, then we’ll look at it and figure out ways to fix it,” Sean McKessy, the former corporate lawyer who joined the SEC in late February to run the whistleblower program, told reporters after a speech at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.   Companies from Google Inc (GOOG.O) to JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said they feared the rule would undermine internal compliance programs at public companies by encouraging employees to go directly to the SEC.   In the end, no lawsuits were filed, McKessy said.   McKessy, who worked for AOL AOL.N and Altria (MO.N), parent of cigarette maker Phillip Morris, before taking on his new role, said he had taken every opportunity to explain the new law to corporate lawyers, compliance officers and other interested parties since coming to the SEC.   He said he had participated in at least 10 panel discussions and webinars, reaching over 1,000 participants.   Earlier this week, he told Reuters that he had received an invitation to attend an anti-fraud conference in Beijing, although he would likely participate via videoconference due to budget constraints at the small regulatory agency.   Whistleblowers remain loathed in industry, but financial incentives should help the SEC ferret out more wrongdoing and could make investigations quicker and cheaper, McKessy said.   “Look in a thesaurus under ‘whistleblower’ and see what kind of words you get out. I’m either the head of the office of the rats, or the rat finks, or rat bastards,” McKessy said.   “If even one fraud is stopped before it gets to a Madoff-type situation, then all the effort has been worth it.”   Whistleblowers are still eligible for a reward if they reports wrongdoing to the company, and the company, in turn, reports it to the SEC, he said. In fact, they potentially stand to get more if they report it to the company first.   Another common concern was that the rules would incentivize corporate lawyers, compliance officers and external auditors to violate their professional ethics to grab big monetary rewards for any wrongdoing at their companies.   McKessy insisted the rules allowed those people to submit tips only under under “narrow circumstances.”   No flood of tips had occurred after the rules were finalized, he said. But he said he and his staff, soon expanding to seven, would keep close tabs to see what happened when the rules actually take effect.   The SEC will unveil a new website on Friday, but tips can also be submitted via mail or fax.

14,MO,UPDATE 3-Cigarette makers sue FDA over new labeling rules," * First Amendment violation alleged   * Graphic labels, ads set to take effect in Sept. 2012  (Adds FDA and Altria comment, lawsuit details and background)   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Four big cigarette makers sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, seeking to void as unconstitutional new graphic labels and advertising that warn consumers about the risks of smoking and induce them to quit.   The lawsuit by Reynolds American Inc’s RAI.N R.J. Reynolds unit, Lorillard Inc LO.N, Liggett Group LLC and Commonwealth Brands Inc, owned by Britain’s Imperial Tobacco Group Plc IMT.L, said the warnings required no later than Sept. 22, 2012 would force cigarette makers to “engage in anti-smoking advocacy” on the government’s behalf.   They said this violates their free speech rights under the First Amendment, according to a complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.   “The notion that the government can require those who manufacture a lawful product to emblazon half of its package with pictures and words admittedly drafted to persuade the public not to purchase that product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny,” said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment specialist representing the cigarette makers, in a statement.   An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment, citing an agency policy not to discuss pending litigation.   The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act requires color warnings covering the top half of the front and back panels of cigarette packages, and the top 20 percent of printed advertising.   Dead bodies, diseased lungs and rotting teeth are among the images expected to appear, in the first change to U.S. cigarette warnings in 25 years.   Reynolds’ brands include Camel, Winston and Kool; Lorillard brands include Newport and True; Commonwealth brands include Davidoff, and Liggett brands include Eve.   The cigarette companies are the largest in the United States other than Altria Group Inc (MO.N), whose brands include Marlboro and which is not part of the case. Altria had previously supported the 2009 law.   “Certain provisions of the final rule raise constitutional concerns,” Altria spokesman Bill Phelps said. “We continue to work constructively with the FDA, and reserve our rights and options to protect the company.”   A smaller cigarette maker, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co, is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, which also seeks to delay enforcement of other parts of the tobacco law.   Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services, in June said the new warnings would ensure that “every person who picks up a pack of cigarettes is going to know exactly what risks they are taking.” [ID:nN1E75K04A]   She said the goal was to stop children from starting to smoke, and to give adult smokers a new incentive to quit.   “MINI-BILLBOARD”   But in their complaint, the cigarette companies said the labels illegally force them to make consumers “depressed, discouraged and afraid” to buy cigarettes, and turn each package into a “mini-billboard” for the government.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 46 million U.S. adults, or 20.6 percent, smoke cigarettes, but there has been little change in the percentage since 2004.

17,MO,"UPDATE 1-Fewer Americans smoke, pace of decline slowing -CDC"," * Roughly 45 million Americans over age of 18 smoke   * CDC says more work is needed to curb smoking  (Recasts throughout, adds background, comments from CDC, American Heart Association)   By Julie Steenhuysen   CHICAGO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Fewer American adults are smoking cigarettes, and those who still smoke have cut back on the number of cigarettes they smoke, but the rate of decline has begun to slow, U.S. health experts said on Tuesday.   Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States, killing an estimated 443,000 Americans each year.   The report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows 19.3 percent of American adults over age 18 — roughly 45 million people — smoked in 2010, down from 20.9 percent in 2005.   “That represents 3 million fewer smokers in 2010 than there would have been five years ago,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters in a telephone conference.   According to the CDC, 21.8 percent of smokers had fewer than 10 cigarettes a day in 2010, compared with 16.4 percent in 2005.   Only 8.3 percent of smokers were considered heavy smokers in 2010 — smoking more than 30 cigarettes a day — compared with 12.7 percent in 2005.   “People who smoke are smoking less, but we can do much better,” Frieden said.   Smoking rates in the United States have fallen sharply following the first warnings in the mid-1960s that cigarette smoking could cause lung and other cancers and a host of other health problems such as heart disease and stroke.   And while smoking rates are still falling, CDC officials said, the pace of decline between 2005 and 2010 is slower than in the previous five-year period.   Between 2006 and 2007, there was no change in U.S. smoking rates at all.   Dr. Tim McAfee, director of the CDC Office on Smoking and Health, said the slowing trend signifies the need for states to intensify tobacco control efforts.   He urged states to spend more revenues from tobacco taxes on tobacco control, noting that states with the strongest tobacco control programs have the greatest success at reducing smoking.   “We know what works: higher tobacco prices, hard-hitting media campaigns, graphic health warnings on cigarette packs, and 100 percent smoke-free policies, with easily accessible help for those who want to quit,” he said.   Nancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, called the report “encouraging news” at a time of increasing challenges from the tobacco industry to block new regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require graphic warnings on cigarette packages about the risks of smoking. [ID:nN1E77F1S6]   Frieden said while smokers appear to be cutting back on cigarettes, quitting smoking was the best way for them to improve their health.   For every one smoking-related death, an additional 20 people live with a smoking-related disease, including lung and other cancers, respiratory diseases such as emphysema and cardiovascular disease.   More than 221,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2011, according to the American Cancer Society. The World Health Organization predicts tobacco will kill nearly 6 million people this year, including 600,000 non-smokers.

18,MO,Dealtalk: AB Inbev seen brewing up final mega deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - In a global brewing industry marked by huge consolidation over the last decade, bankers are hopeful of an $80 billion plus deal to end all deals between the industry’s two giants, Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) and SABMiller SAB.L.  If AB InBev buys SABMiller it could be the biggest cash takeover in history and would create a group brewing a third of the world’s beer. Analysts and bankers suggest 2013 as a likely time frame for a takeover that is seen as the final play in deal making in big world brewing.  They say the world’s No 1 brewer AB InBev will not be deterred from making a move for SABMiller even after the No 2 brewer swallows up Australia’s Foster’s by the end of 2011 in a $10.2 billion deal.  A Foster’s deal may delay an AB InBev-SABMiller linkup by six to twelve months pushing a possible deal to 2013, after AB InBev’s Chief Executive Carlos Brito said its debt would fall during 2012 to levels which made further acquisitions possible.  A deal would close out a decade of rapid consolidation led largely by AB InBev and SABMiller and leave few remaining easy targets, with the remaining big global brewers like Heineken (HEIN.AS) and Carlsberg (CARLb.CO), as well as AB InBev, controlled by families, individuals or charity shareholders.  “The Foster’s deal may delay an AB InBev-SABMiller tie up, but it doesn’t change the strategic view that eventually it will make sense for these two to link up,” said one banker who has worked for one of the big brewers.  AB InBev’s Brito is said to like the high-margin Australian beer market and although a Foster’s deal will add to the cost of an eventual SABMiller takeover, it would give a combined group an even wider spread of the world’s beer market.  A deal would link AB InBev’s Budweiser, Stella Artois and Brahma beer brands with SABMiller’s Peroni, Miller Lite and Grolsch, and cause only major anti-trust headaches in the U.S. and China which would force sell-offs in those markets.  AB InBev swallowed Budweiser-brewer Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion in 2008 in the world’s biggest ever cash takeover, and due to big cost savings, sell-offs and hefty cash generation has cut its debt to be able to start thinking about its next move.  SABMiller is attractive to AB InBev due to the London-listed brewer’s large operations in the high-growth emerging markets of Africa, South America and eastern Europe which will help AB InBev reduce its reliance on the tough U.S. beer market  “Over 90 percent of AB InBev’s earnings come from America, so a move for SABMiller would create a real powerhouse with big operations on six continents,” said another banker.  “AB InBev has been built by a string of good M&A deals over the last decade so the market is likely to support one final deal based on its impressive record especially with the Anheuser-Busch deal,” the banker added.  Analysts say the Foster’s deal will not change the rationale behind a bigger tie-up after SABMiller last week agreed a $10.2 billion cash deal to take over the Australian brewer which it hopes to complete by the end of 2011.  This takeover will gives SABMiller a near half share in the Australian beer market where AB InBev has virtually no presence, so will create no new competition hurdles, and the only downside is it will make any eventual deal more expensive.  The Foster’s deal is set to dilute SABMiller’s exposure to emerging markets to just above 70 percent of its earnings from over 80 percent. AB InBev’s big reliance of the U.S. beer market sees it make just 45 percent of its earnings from emerging markets.  A potential tie up would entail at least $13 billion of disposals to get around anti-trust issues in the U.S. and China, but annual cost savings could potentially top $1 billion.  Disposals would likely include the sale of SABMiller’s 58 percent stake in U.S. brewer MillerCoors, probably to 42 percent co-owner Molson Coors (TAP.N), for around $9 billion as MillerCoor’s near-30 percent U.S. market share added to AB InBev’s 50 percent would be too much for U.S. authorities.  A further move would likely be the sale of SABMiller’s 49 percent share in leading Chinese brewer CR Snow, to appease Chinese authorities as AB InBev already has a significant Chinese presence.  AB InBev’s Brito has said its cash and balance sheet usage is an issue to be addressed only when group’s debt to core EBITDA profit fall below 2 times, which is due “during 2012” according to the company.  The Belgium-based brewer’s record of cutting debt after deals is impressive as its net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 2.9 times from 3.7 times during 2010, and many analysts believe it will fall below the company’s 2 times target in 2012.  AB InBev’s ability to do and then make deals pay is illustrated by its shares outperforming DJ Food and Beverage index .SX3P by around 45 percent since it sealed the Anheuser-Busch deal in late 2008, analysts said.  SABMiller is more vulnerable than other big brewers such as Heineken and Carlsberg as it has a relatively open shareholder base. While other possible targets in the beer world such a MolsonCoors or Africa’s Castel are family controlled.  SABMiller’s two big shareholders include U.S. cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) which has a 27.1 percent stake as a legacy of SABMiller’s 2002 deal to buy Miller, and the Colombian Santo Domingo family with a 14.2 percent stake which dates back to SABMiller’s deal to acquire South American brewer Bavaria in 2005.

19,MO,Altria seeks to tap wide-ranging tobacco users,"BOCA RATON, Florida (Reuters) - Today’s smokers are more open to trying different types of tobacco than smokers of previous generations, and Altria Group Inc is working on new products to entice consumers who want a change from cigarettes, the company said. The company, best-known for its Marlboro cigarettes, also stood by the profit forecast it gave in late January. Altria, whose other products include Skoal and Copenhagen smokeless tobacco and Black & Mild cigars, has seen a shift in tobacco usage in the United States. While the number of smokers of both cigarettes and cigars has remained relatively flat, usage of smokeless tobacco has risen. Still, Marlboro - with 42 percent retail market share in the cigarette industry - remains the dominant brand in Altria’s portfolio. Some smokers have been trying alternative products, such as smokeless tobacco, amid concerns about the health risks of smoking. Altria is encouraged by the early sales of its new Marlboro Black brand, Vice Chairman Dave Beran told analysts and investors at the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York, or CAGNY, conference held in Boca Raton, Florida. Marlboro Black, which Altria’s Philip Morris USA unit began shipping in December, had over 1 percent retail market share earlier this month, said Beran, who is set to become Altria’s president and chief operating officer in May. The new product is what the company calls a bold, modern spin on the traditional brand, and is packaged in a black box for menthol and nonmenthol varieties. The Marlboro brand had a 42 percent share of the market in 2011, down from 42.6 percent in 2010. Marlboro is the best-selling cigarette in all U.S. states, but like other cigarettes faces a continued decline in the number of American smokers. Altria said it has not seen much of a change in the mix of premium and discount brands. There has been some volatility among price-sensitive shoppers who seek out promotions and shift between different discount brands, but consumers who buy the company’s premium products tend to be loyal, Chairman and Chief Executive Mike Szymanczyk told reporters at the conference. About 90 percent of Marlboro smokers buy only that brand, according to the company’s research. Altria also expects adjusted earnings to grow by 6 to 9 percent in 2012, to a range of $2.17 to $2.23 per share, executives said on Wednesday. Analysts, on average, expect Altria to earn $2.20 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Over time, Altria still aims to post average annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 7 to 9 percent and issue a dividend that grows in line with its adjusted earnings per share growth. Szymanczyk said last month that he plans to retire in May, and will be succeeded as chairman and CEO by Marty Barrington. Shares of Altria were up 0.3 percent at $29.71 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

22,MO,Altria to pay $500 mln to settle US tax dispute,"* Payment to resolve IRS tax dispute * Leveraged lease transactions were under scrutiny * Altria boosts 2012 forecast, citing lower interest cost May 22 (Reuters) - Altria Group Inc, the tobacco company, on Tuesday said it expects to pay $500 million to resolve a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over its tax treatment of leveraged lease transactions. The parent of Philip Morris USA said the payment includes $450 million of federal income taxes and interest for the 2000 through 2010 tax years, plus $50 million of state income taxes and interest. Altria said the interest payout is lower than it expected, allowing it to boost its forecast for 2012 profit per share by 3 cents to a range of $2.28 to $2.34, before items. This forecast includes a $68 million benefit in the second quarter. The Richmond, Virginia-based company affirmed its 2012 profit forecast of $2.17 to $2.23 per share excluding items.

Michelle and Columbia Crest wines. The tax issue concerned leveraged lease transactions at its Philip Morris Capital Corp unit. In recent years, the IRS has challenged some companies’ efforts to take deductions related to such transactions. Court approval of Altria’s settlement is required.

(PMCC) had taken related to lease-in lease-out (LILO) and sale-in lease-out (SILO) leveraged lease transactions. Under the settlement, Altria expects to pay about $500 million in federal and state income taxes (including estimated interest), of which the company estimates $450 million related to federal taxes will be paid by June 30, 2012. We expect the company to primarily use cash on hand and free cash flow generation to fund its settlement payments.

We expect the company will continue to manage planned share repurchases and its overall financial policy so as to fund these settlement payments primarily through existing cash on hand and cash flow generation. We expect the company will maintain lease- and pension-adjusted total debt to EBITDA in the low-2x area throughout 2012, and that the company will continue to generate significant free operating cash flow, which we estimate will be close to the $3.5 billion area in 2012.",5242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-ratings-altria-group/text-spbulletin-altria-group-rtgs-unaffected-by-tax-agreemnt-idUSWNA799920120524
24,MO,TEXT-Fitch Assigns 'BBB+' to Altria's $2.8B Notes Issuance; Outlook Stable,"CHICAGO, August 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BBB+’ rating to Altria Group, Inc.’s (Altria) $2.8 billion senior unsecured notes, which were issue in two tranches: $1.9 billion 2.85% notes due 2022 and $900 million 4.25% notes due 2042. Fitch currently rates Altria’s debt as follows: Altria (Parent) —Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘BBB+’; —Guaranteed bank credit facility at ‘BBB+’; —Guaranteed senior unsecured debt at ‘BBB+’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F2’; —Commercial paper (CP) at ‘F2.’ Philip Morris Capital Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria) —Long-term IDR at ‘BBB+’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F2’; —CP at ‘F2’. UST LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria) —Senior unsecured debt at ‘BBB+’. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Altria had $13.7 billion of debt at June 30, 2012. Debt Issuance and Tender Offer Net proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used to fund the cash tender offer and the related premium for any of the company’s 9.7% $3.1 billion notes due 2018, 9.25% $2.2 billion notes due 2019, 9.95% $1.5 billion notes due 2038 and 10.2% $1.5 billion notes due 2039. The amount of each series that may be accepted for purchase will be determined in accordance with a first priority given to 9.7% notes due 2018 and the 9.25% notes due 2019, limited to the $2.8 billion tender cap. If the amount of the first level priority notes tendered is less than the tender cap, the 9.950% notes due 2038 and 10.2% notes due 2039 (second level priority notes) will be accepted with a purchase sublimit of $500 million. The tender offer is scheduled to expire Aug. 31, 2012. Altria has the right to increase or decrease the tender cap and/or the purchase sublimit. Net proceeds not immediately used will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments. Fitch expects the net proceeds less the premium to be used to refinance the company’s debt and general corporate purposes. The notes rank equal to the company existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are guaranteed by Philip Morris USA, Inc. (PM USA) the company’s wholly owned operating subsidiary. The guarantee will be released if PM USA consolidates or merge into Altria or any successor of Altria, if Altria or any successor consolidates or merges into PM USA or if the company’s long-term senior unsecured debt is rated ‘A’ by a rating agency. The notes also have a provision which require the company to repurchase the notes at a purchase price of 101 plus accrued interest if there is a change of control concurrent with a ratings downgrade below investment grade by the rating agencies. Rating Rationale —Leading Market Share Position Altria’s ratings are supported by the company’s leading market share of U.S. tobacco segments. Altria’s PM USA subsidiary’s Marlboro brand has an estimated market share of 42.6% and total cigarette market share of 49.7%. PM USA has maintained U.S. market share of about 50% for several years. Altria’s U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Com pany (USSTC) has roughly 55% U.S. market share in smokeless tobacco, driven by the two large brands of Copenhagen and Skoal. —Substantial Cash Flow The ratings reflect that Altria’s operations consistently generate large cash flows. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2012 (LTM period). The company generated $3.1 billion of cash flow from operations (CFFO) down from the $3.6 billion in 2011. The reduction reflects a $456 million IRS payment for the disallowance of tax benefits resulting from leverage lease transactions by Philip Morris Capital Corp., which is winding down its operations and $514 million pension plan contribution. Altria’s healthy operating EBITDA margin, which was 40.5% for the LTM period, drive the company’s high operating cash flow to revenue ratio. Manufacturing optimization and cost reduction efforts and price increases has helped improve margins from 32.5% in 2008. —Significant Liquidity Altria has ample liquidity which Fitch expects will be maintained given the company’s CFFO. Altria maintains a significant cash position throughout the year to meet its annual Master Settlement Agreement payment. Bolstering Altria’s liquidity is the company’s 27% equity ownership of SABMiller plc, one of the world’s largest brewers, currently valued at roughly $19 billion. —Shareholders Prioritized Fitch recognizes Altria’s goal to return cash to shareholders in its ratings. The company’s target dividend payout ratio of 80% is high but typical for U.S. tobacco firms. Fitch believes Altria’s dividend reduces its flexibility since management teams are reluctant to reduce dividends in periods of operational weakness. Additionally, dividends in excess of CFFO have been funded periodically by incremental borrowings which can weaken the company’s credit profile. —Industry Risk Factors Altria’s ratings are lower than those of companies with similar credit metrics, largely due to industry factors of continued cigarette volume declines of 3% to 5%; increasing regulatory risk and ongoing, albeit reduced, litigation risk. Altria has historically been able to offset declining volumes with price increases to continue to grow cigarette revenue. Fitch would contemplate a negative rating action if Altria loses pricing power because cigarette consumers become more price sensitive. Credit Measures, Expected Performance, Liquidity Debt Structure —Credit Measures Altria’s total debt-to-operating EBITDA of 2.0 times (x) for the LTM period is in line with Fitch’s expectations. Leverage has decreased slightly over the past year. Operating EBITDA to gross interest expense was 5.4x, substantially consistent with the year-end. FFO adjusted leverage increased to 3.2x from 2.9x at Dec. 31, 2011. FFO was negatively impacted by pension contributions and IRS payment previously discussed. Fitch expects credit metrics to be stable. —Expected Performance Fitch expects continued cigarette volume declines in the low- to mid-single digits to be offset by pricing in 2012. With continued cost improvements anticipated by Altria, overall operating income is forecast to increase in the low single-digit range. —Liquidity Position As stated previously, Altria has ample liquidity. At June 30, 2012, the company had a $1.5 billion of cash and $3 billion, five-year revolving credit facility which was undrawn and expires on June 30, 2016. The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support the company’s CP issuances. Altria did not have any CP issued at June 30, 2012. The credit agreement requires that Altria maintain (i) a ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and (ii) a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 4.0 to 1.0. These financial covenants were met for the period. —Debt Structure The notes of UST Inc. are structurally superior to the notes and debentures issued by Altria Group, Inc. Fitch has chosen not to make a distinction in the ratings given the notes in total are a small portion of total debt and the low risk of default at the ‘BBB+’ rating level. Altria has not issued notes from its UST subsidiary since acquiring UST Inc. in January 2009. What Could Trigger A Rating Action? Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: —An upgrade is not likely as upside to credit protection measures is limited by Altria’s reliance on the mature to declining cigarette sector, which inhibits growth potential; —Altria’s focus on returning cash to shareholders signals stable to rising debt levels, which would not be consistent with an upgrade; —A deceleration of cigarette volume declines, industry growth, or material diversification outside of the tobacco industry, would be positive for the company’s ratings. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: —Shareholder friendly actions; such as, a large debt-financed share buyback or acquisition would be credit-negative; —An increase in leverage to the low 2.0x range without a reasonable expectation for lower leverage going forward would result in a negative rating action. —Altria declining to maintain its credit profile through the use of its financial flexibility would be viewed negatively.",8062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-ratings-altria/text-fitch-assigns-bbb-to-altrias-2-8b-notes-issuance-outlook-stable-idUSWNA284120120806

(BBB/Stable/A-2; parent company of Philip Morris USA), Reynolds American Inc. (BBB-/Stable/—; parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company), and Lorillard Inc. (BBB-/Stable/—; parent company of Lorillard Tobacco Co.) are currently unaffected by the announcement that their respective operating subsidiaries have reached agreement in principle with 17 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (the signatory States) that resolves disputes under the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) involving the payment adjustments relating to nonparticipating manufacturers for the years 2003 to 2012.   The agreement would result in the tobacco subsidiaries receiving credits  against future MSA payments over a period of up to five years, entitle the  signatory States to receive a portion of their allocable share of the amounts  currently being held in escrow resulting from these disputes, and put into  place a new method for calculating the adjustment beginning in 2013.  Standard & Poor’s views this agreement in principle, which should boost the  companies’ cash flows over a period ranging from one to five years, as a  positive for the three tobacco manufacturers. However, it is uncertain at this  point how the companies will utilize the incremental cash flows from the  settlement.

32,MO,Fitch Rates Altria's $3.2B Debt Issuances 'BBB+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Altria  Group, Inc.'s (Altria) senior unsecured notes issuances. The notes are being  issued in two tranches with $1.4 billion due in 2024 and $1.8 billion due in  2044. The Rating Outlook is Stable. At Sept. 30, 2013, Altria had approximately  $14.9 billion of total debt. The senior unsecured notes will rank equal to Altria's other existing and future  senior unsecured indebtedness. The notes will be guaranteed by Philip Morris USA  Inc. (PM USA), Altria's wholly owned subsidiary and subject to a Change of  Control provision, whereby the company will be required to make an offer to  purchase the notes at 101% plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of  control and a downgrade below investment grade. Net proceeds from the offering  will be used for general corporate purposes, including the tender offer to  repurchase $2 billion of debt.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Superior Market Share Positions:  Altria's ratings are supported by the company's commanding market share  positions in the U.S. tobacco industry. The company's PM USA subsidiary has held  about 50% share of the total cigarette market for several years while its  Marlboro brand currently has an estimated 43.6% market share. Altria's U.S.  Smokeless Tobacco Company (USSTC) and PM USA smokeless tobacco products have  roughly a 55% share of the smokeless market, driven by the two large brands,  Copenhagen and Skoal.  Substantial Cash Flow Generation:  Altria's operations consistently generate large operating cash flows. For the  LTM ended June 30, 2013, the company generated $4.6 billion of cash from  operations, which is exceeding Fitch's expectations. Pricing and cost management  continues to support Altria's healthy operating EBITDA margin, which exceeds 40%  and drives its high operating cash flow to revenue ratio. Fitch anticipates that  pricing and cost savings from the company's periodic rationalization of  manufacturing, distribution and marketing footprint will continue to support its  high margins. Highly Stable Credit Measures:  Altria's leverage total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.97x for the LTM ended June 30,  2013, which was slightly lower than Fitch had forecasted. The company leverage  ratio has ranged from 1.8x-2.1x for the past three years. Gross interest  coverage improved to 7.6x for the LTM ended June 30, 2013 compared to prior year  due to lower interest expense and higher earnings. Funds from operations (FFO)  adjusted leverage was 2.8x for the same period. These credit measures are  adequate for the rating given the industry factors (discussed below) and they  are expected to remain stable as debt levels are balanced with EBITDA growth.  Fitch anticipates that any excess cash flow is likely to be returned to  shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Significant Liquidity:  Altria has ample internally generated liquidity that Fitch expects will be  maintained given the company's high levels of cash flow from operations.  External liquidity is provided by the company's five-year revolving credit  facility that expires June 2016. At Sept. 30, 2013, Altria had $4.2 billion of  cash and full revolver availability of $3 billion. Tobacco firms typically  accumulate cash throughout the year to make their annual Master Settlement  Agreement (MSA). Altria made its $3.1 billion MSA payment on April 15, 2013.  Significantly bolstering Altria's liquidity is the company's 26.8% share of  SABMiller plc., one of the world's largest brewers, currently valued at more  than $20 billion.  Shareholders Prioritized:  Dividends for the LTM ended June 30, 2013 totaled $3.5 billion. The company's  target dividend payout ratio of 80% is high, but typical for U.S. tobacco firms.  In August, Altria's Board of Directors increased the $300 million share  repurchase program to $1 billion, of which $709 million remained at the end of  the third quarter, accounting for repurchasing activities during the year.  Industry Factors Limit Ratings:  Altria's ratings are lower than those of companies with similar credit metrics,  largely due to industry factors of continued annual mid-single-digit cigarette  volume declines; ongoing, albeit reduced, litigation risk; and regulatory risk.  Recent budget proposals to increase excise taxes at the state and federal  levels, if enacted, have the potential to reduce volume, and decrease pricing  flexibility and operating income at least in the near term.  Recent Operating Performance and Debt levels: For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2013, total revenues net of excise taxes  increased 6.6% to $4.76 billion from the same period in 2012. Net revenues for  smokeable products rose 4.6% to $4.1 billion due to increased volume of 1.2% and  favorable pricing. Smokeless products net revenues jumped 9.8% to $448 million.  Total operating income for the third quarter grew faster than revenues at 8.3%.  As mentioned previously, Altria total debt was $14.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2013,  rising $1 billion from the end of 2012, with debt leverage remaining  commensurate with the rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future development that may individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action:  --Deceleration of industry volume declines or volume growth; --Continue moderation of litigation risk; --Significant diversification; or --Demonstrated commitment to more conservative financial policies related to  dividends and share repurchases.  Future development that may individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action:  --Increased litigation risks similar to those experienced in early 2000s, which  was marked by material adverse judgment(s), prompting renewed legal scrutiny in  multiple jurisdictions; --Significant increase of leverage due to (i) material declines in EBITDA  resulting from volume and/or margin contraction, possibly due to heightened  competition; (ii) a large debt-financed acquisition without meaningful EBITDA  and cash flow contribution; (iii) a large debt-financed share repurchase moving  leverage beyond the mid-2.0x.  Fitch currently rates Altria debt as follows: Altria Group Inc. (Parent) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --Guaranteed bank credit facility 'BBB+'; --Guaranteed senior unsecured debt 'BBB+';  --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper (CP) 'F2.'

34,MO,"UPDATE 1-Philip Morris, Altria team up on cigarette alternatives","LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Altria Group and Philip Morris International (PMI), the makers of Marlboro cigarettes in the United States and internationally, are teaming up to market electronic cigarettes and other “reduced risk” tobacco products. Less dangerous alternatives to cigarettes are a key focus for big tobacco firms as governments worldwide crack down and consumers cut back. “PMI firmly believes that reduced-risk tobacco products, as well as e-cigarettes, represent an important step toward achieving the public health goal of harm reduction, a potential paradigm shift for the industry and a significant growth opportunity for the company,” said PMI Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos in a statement on Friday. Under the terms of a set of licensing, supply and cooperation agreements, Philip Morris has the right to exclusively sell Altria’s e-cigarettes outside the United States while Altria has the right to exclusively sell in the United States two “modified risk tobacco products” being developed by Philip Morris, which heat the tobacco without burning it. Financial terms of the agreements were not disclosed. The companies, which were combined until 2008, also said they would work together on scientific assessments and regulatory authorizations. PMI already planned to test its “reduced risk” products in international markets during the second half of 2014.

35,MO,RPT-Fitch: Altria Green Smoke Buy Highlights Industry e-Cig Interest,"Feb 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency) E-cigarettes provide tobacco companies with a  compelling source of diversification and the potential to reverse secular  declines over the long term, Fitch Ratings says. Altria’s recently announced  acquisition of E-cigarette company Green Smoke highlights the industry’s  commitment to this promising product category. Altria Tuesday said its Nu Mark LLC subsidiary would acquire Green Smoke Inc.’s  E-vapor business for approximately $110 million in a transaction expected to  close during the second quarter. Green Smoke’s offering is differentiated from  NuMark’s MarkTen E-cigarette brand by in the vapor itself, which is delivered in  a higher volume. Green Smoke has limited distribution capability as its products  are mainly sold via the Internet. Altria’s much larger retail channel can now  offer an E-cigarette portfolio combining the relatively new MarkTen brand with  the highly rated Green Smoke products. The entrance of large tobacco companies has legitimized the E-cigarette  marketplace. Lorillard, the first major tobacco company to jump into the space  with the purchase of blu eCigs in April 2012, has since committed to rapidly  expanding the number of retail outlets for the blu brand. British American  Tobacco acquired     Ltd in 2012. Shortly thereafter, Altria and  Reynolds American introduced their MarkTen and Vuse e-cigarette brands,  respectively. Growth prospects for the E-cigarette industry are compelling, with sales  estimates for the U.S. marketplace reaching $1.5 billion in 2013, compared to  less than $10 million in 2007. Demand has essentially doubled every year since  the introduction of the vapor products in late 2006 in the US, which is the  world’s largest E-cigarette marketplace. The vast majority of this demand is  derived from current tobacco smokers. The consistent, rapid growth of the industry has led to predictions that  E-cigarette sales will overtake those generated by tobacco cigarettes within the  next decade. Today, the size of the E-cigarette category pales in comparison to  that of the overall tobacco industry, estimated at $697 billion in global retail  value in 2012 by Euromonitor international. While promising, growth via the nascent E-cigarette product category could be  stifled under potentially strict government regulation. The U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) may soon regulate E-cigarettes, which are currently  unregulated as either a tobacco product or a smoking cessation medical device.  The FDA wants to address concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the vapor  cigarettes as well as the potential influence of their use on youth smoking  initiation.

36,MO,Altria to appeal revived $10.1 billion 'light' cigarette verdict,"(Reuters) - An Illinois state appeals court has reinstated a $10.1 billion verdict against Philip Morris USA in a lawsuit accusing the Altria Group Inc unit of misleading consumers about the risks of smoking “light” cigarettes. Philip Morris USA said it will appeal immediately. Tuesday’s decision by the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Mount Vernon, Illinois, revives a 2003 judgment handed down by a state trial judge. That judgment against the maker of Marlboro cigarettes had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2005, a ruling that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the following year. In 2008, the plaintiffs sought to revive their case after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rescinded a 42-year-old policy on how cigarette makers could describe tar and nicotine levels in their advertising and packaging. A state court judge dismissed the case in December 2012, but Justice Melissa Chapman wrote for a three-judge appeals court panel that he lacked authority to speculate how the policy change might affect damages. She said the effect of overturning the dismissal was to reinstate the original verdict. The lawsuit, brought on behalf roughly 1.4 million Illinois smokers, began in 2000. It was the first class action case to reach trial over using the word “light” to promote cigarettes. Plaintiffs led by Sharon Price and Michael Fruth accused Philip Morris USA of violating an Illinois consumer fraud law by deceiving consumers into believing that “light” or “low tar” cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. Philip Morris USA countered that the FTC had permitted the use of such terms through prior settlements, or consent decrees, with other cigarette makers. “The law does not allow the Fifth District to reopen a decision by the Illinois Supreme Court based on speculation about the possible impact of subsequent events,” Murray Garnick, an associate general counsel at Altria, said in a statement. Altria said its appeal puts Tuesday’s decision on hold automatically. The Richmond, Virginia-based company controls roughly half of the U.S. cigarette market. U.S. regulators have since June 2010 banned companies from using “light,” “low” and “mild” in tobacco labeling. Unlike in many other smoking cases, the plaintiffs had not sought to recoup money for health-related claims, but rather for sums they spent on light cigarettes. “The plaintiffs believe very strongly that this was the correct decision,” said Stephen Tillery, a partner at Korein Tillery in St. Louis and lead counsel for the plaintiffs. “The law is abundantly clear. I don’t think, as a matter of fact or law, that Philip Morris has a strong appellate outlook.” Bonnie Herzog, a beverage and tobacco analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, called Tuesday’s decision “very much an unexpected move,” but predicted it would be reversed on appeal. Shares of Altria were down 11 cents at $40.01 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In voiding the original verdict, the Illinois Supreme Court had said that the FTC intended that its consent decrees would “provide guidance to the entire cigarette industry.” But according to the Fifth District, the FTC later changed its approach, saying it had neither defined “light” or “low tar,” nor “provided guidance or authorization” as to their use. The plaintiffs then sought to revive their case, but Circuit Judge Dennis Ruth in Edwardsville, Illinois, said they had not shown it was “more probably true” that the Illinois Supreme Court might ultimately rule in their favor on damages. In Tuesday’s decision, however, Chapman said the top state court had not resolved the issue. “The only ruling it reversed was the trial court’s decision to deny the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the basis of (the) Consumer Fraud Act,” she wrote. “Vacating the dismissal order will reinstate the proceedings with the verdict intact.” The case is Price et al v.

37,MO,UPDATE 2-Altria to appeal revived $10.1 bln 'light' cigarette verdict,"(Adds labeling changes, market share, updated stock price, paragraphs 10-11 and 15) By Jonathan Stempel April 30 (Reuters) - An Illinois state appeals court has reinstated a $10.1 billion verdict against Philip Morris USA in a lawsuit accusing the Altria Group Inc unit of misleading consumers about the risks of smoking “light” cigarettes. Philip Morris USA said it will appeal immediately. Tuesday’s decision by the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Mount Vernon, Illinois, revives a 2003 judgment handed down by a state trial judge. That judgment against the maker of Marlboro cigarettes had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2005, a ruling that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the following year. In 2008, the plaintiffs sought to revive their case after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rescinded a 42-year-old policy on how cigarette makers could describe tar and nicotine levels in their advertising and packaging. A state court judge dismissed the case in December 2012, but Justice Melissa Chapman wrote for a three-judge appeals court panel that he lacked authority to speculate how the policy change might affect damages. She said the effect of overturning the dismissal was to reinstate the original verdict. The lawsuit, brought on behalf roughly 1.4 million Illinois smokers, began in 2000. It was the first class action case to reach trial over using the word “light” to promote cigarettes. Plaintiffs led by Sharon Price and Michael Fruth accused Philip Morris USA of violating an Illinois consumer fraud law by deceiving consumers into believing that “light” or “low tar” cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes.

40,MO,UPDATE 1-Cigarette makers lose challenge to NYC's no-discount law,"(Adds Altria comment, Reynolds and Lorillard not immediately available for comment) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge said on Wednesday New York City may prevent retailers from offering discounts on cigarettes and other tobacco products, rejecting an industry effort to halt enforcement of a law designed to curb tobacco purchases. U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan said the city may block stores from selling the products at below list price, whether by running sales, redeeming coupons, offering bulk discounts or providing free lighters or other non-tobacco products with purchases. Industry trade groups, as well as cigarette makers, including Philip Morris parent Altria Group Inc, Reynolds American Inc and Lorillard Inc, complained that the limits violated their free speech rights and were pre-empted by other federal and state laws. The limits on discounts were part of a sweeping law signed last November by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg as part of an effort to dissuade people from smoking. Other changes included raising the minimum legal age to buy tobacco to 21 from 18, setting a minimum $10.50 price for a pack of cigarettes, boosting penalties for illegal tobacco sales and increasing enforcement against non-payment of excise taxes. In upholding the limits on discounts, Griesa said pricing restrictions “designed to discourage consumption of a potentially harmful product” were constitutional so long as retailers could still provide “truthful, non-misleading information” to consumers. “The ordinance only regulates an economic transaction - the sale of tobacco products below the listed price,” he wrote. “It does not restrict the dissemination of pricing information and thus, it does not violate the First Amendment.” Altria spokesman Brian May said: “We disagree with the court’s decision, and are considering our appellate options.” Spokesmen for Reynolds American and Lorillard, as well as lawyers for both companies, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “This is a huge victory for the city’s comprehensive efforts to reduce tobacco usage,” Nicholas Ciappetta, a senior lawyer for the city, said in a statement. Bloomberg’s more than decade-old campaign to ban smoking in various public and private places and to discourage New Yorkers from smoking altogether has become a blueprint for other cities. The City Council has estimated that the enacted changes have helped reduce smoking rates in the city by nearly one-third for adults and roughly one-half for children. Bloomberg left office 5-1/2 months ago, after serving 12 years as mayor. The case is National Association of Tobacco Outlets Inc et al v. City of New York et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-00577.

41,MO,E-cigs may be tempting non-smoking youths to smoke - CDC study,"CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Electronic cigarettes may be more tempting to non-smoking youths than conventional cigarettes, and once young people have tried e-cigarettes they are more inclined to give regular cigarettes a try, U.S. researchers said on Monday. A report, released by a team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lends evidence to the argument that electronic cigarettes encourage youth smoking. The study, based on nationally representative youth surveys, found that more than a quarter-million adolescents and teens who had never smoked used an electronic cigarette in 2013, a threefold increase from 2011. Youths who had tried e-cigarettes were nearly twice as likely to say they would try a conventional cigarette in the next year compared with those who had never tried an e-cigarette, according to the study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research. E-cigarettes are slim, reusable, metal-tube devices containing nicotine-laced liquids that come in exotic flavors. When users puff, the nicotine is heated and released as a vapor containing no tar, unlike conventional cigarette smoke. Health experts have raised concerns that the burgeoning $2 billion e-cigarette industry, which has been virtually unregulated, would reverse gains in the decades-long effort to curb youth smoking in the United States. Just 15.7 percent of U.S. teenagers reported smoking in 2013, the lowest rate on record. In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed rules that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under 18 but would not restrict flavored products, online sales or advertising, which public health advocates say attract children. Earlier this month, attorneys general from 29 states urged the FDA to strengthen those rules to better protect young people from nicotine addiction. “We are very concerned about nicotine use among our youth, regardless of whether it comes from conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes or other tobacco products,” Dr. Tim McAfee, director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health, said in a statement. “Not only is nicotine highly addictive, it can harm adolescent brain development.” In the CDC study, researchers analyzed data from the 2011, 2012, and 2013 National Youth Tobacco Surveys of students in grades 6-12. They found that more than 263,000 who had never smoked a conventional cigarette used e-cigarettes in 2013, up from 79,000 in 2011. Among non-smoking youth who had tried electronic cigarettes, 43.9 percent said they intended to smoke conventional cigarettes within the next year, compared with 21.5 percent of those who had never used e-cigarettes. Lorillard Inc leads the U.S. e-cigarette market, while Reynolds American Inc and Altria Group Inc  are rolling out their own brands nationwide this summer. A Wells Fargo analyst report in July projected that U.S. sales of e-cigarettes would outpace conventional ones by 2020.

49,MO,Tobacco companies to settle smoking lawsuits for $100 million,"(Reuters) - Three major U.S. tobacco companies - R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, Lorillard Inc and Altria Group’s  Philip Morris USA - will pay $100 million to settle hundreds of federal lawsuits over smoking, according to an announcement from plaintiffs’ lawyers on Wednesday. The agreement will cover more than 400 lawsuits filed in federal court in Florida by smokers or their families, according to court filings. The settlement will not cover cases that have already gone to trial, or thousands of lawsuits in state court. The tentative agreement will be finalized if all individual plaintiffs participate, or the parties otherwise agree. Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds will each pay $42.5 million, and Lorillard will pay $15 million, according to a lead lawyer for plaintiffs, Joe Rice of law firm Motley Rice. Rice and other plaintiffs’ firms that negotiated the deal said Wednesday they were pleased their clients would be compensated after years of litigation. It is the first major agreement reached by the three companies to resolve a chunk of so-called Engle cases, named after a class action brought by Florida residents over injuries or deaths they said were caused by tobacco-related medical conditions. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court overturned a $145 billion award for the class and ruled that plaintiffs had too many individual issues to proceed as a group. However, the court said plaintiffs could bring individual lawsuits based on findings from earlier in the litigation that nicotine is addictive and that tobacco use can cause diseases. After that ruling, thousands of cases were filed in Florida federal and state courts. All three companies have been hit with millions of dollars in damages from dozens of Engle cases that have gone to trial. In 2013, Liggett Group and parent company Vector Group Ltd  paid $110 million to nearly 5,000 smoking lawsuits. Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said the agreement was in the company’s best interests and that it will vigorously defend unsettled lawsuits. R.J. Reynolds Assistant General Counsel Jeff Raborn said the agreement presented an opportunity for the company, an indirect subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc, to put the federal litigation behind it.

51,MO,UPDATE 1-Tobacco companies to settle smoking lawsuits for $100 million,"(Adds Lorillard comment, background on litigation) By Jessica Dye NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Three major U.S. tobacco companies - R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, Lorillard Inc and Altria Group’s Philip Morris USA - will pay $100 million to settle hundreds of federal lawsuits over smoking, according to an announcement from plaintiffs’ lawyers on Wednesday. The agreement will cover more than 400 lawsuits filed in federal court in Florida by smokers or their families, according to court filings. The settlement will not cover cases that have already gone to trial, or thousands of lawsuits in state court. The tentative agreement will be finalized if all individual plaintiffs participate, or the parties otherwise agree. Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds will each pay $42.5 million, and Lorillard will pay $15 million, according to a lead lawyer for plaintiffs, Joe Rice of law firm Motley Rice. Rice and other plaintiffs’ firms that negotiated the deal said Wednesday they were pleased their clients would be compensated after years of litigation. It is the first major agreement reached by the three companies to resolve a chunk of so-called Engle cases, named after a class action brought by Florida residents over injuries or deaths they said were caused by tobacco-related medical conditions. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court overturned a $145 billion award for the class and ruled that plaintiffs had too many individual issues to proceed as a group. However, the court said plaintiffs could bring individual lawsuits based on findings from earlier in the litigation that nicotine is addictive and that tobacco use can cause diseases. After that ruling, thousands of cases were filed in Florida federal and state courts. All three companies have been hit with millions of dollars in damages from dozens of Engle cases that have gone to trial. In 2013, Liggett Group and parent company Vector Group Ltd  paid $110 million to nearly 5,000 smoking lawsuits. Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said the agreement was in the company’s best interests and that it will vigorously defend unsettled lawsuits. R.J. Reynolds Assistant General Counsel Jeff Raborn said the agreement presented an opportunity for the company, an indirect subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc, to put the federal litigation behind it. Lorillard general counsel Ronald Milstein said the company was pleased to have resolved the federal cases on favorable terms. Shares of Lorillard were up 0.2 percent in morning trading, while Reynolds American and Altria each gained 0.3 percent.

54,MO,Philip Morris expands e-cigarette deal with Altria,"LONDON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International (PM.N) and its American counterpart Altria Group (MO.N) announced on Thursday an expansion of their agreement on e-cigarettes to include research and development, as the market for tobacco alternatives continues to evolve.  The companies, which split from each other in 2008, said in 2013 that Philip Morris would have the exclusive right to sell Altria’s e-cigarettes outside the United States, and Altria the exclusive right to sell two of Philip Morris’s “heated tobacco products” in the United States. They also said they would cooperate on scientific assessments of the products, engaging with regulators and sharing improvements in the products. On Thursday, the companies said they were expanding that framework to include a joint research, development and technology-sharing agreement, which a Philip Morris spokeswoman said would set a framework to develop the next generation of e-cigarettes.  E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into an inhalable vapor, have been growing in popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, but remain the subject of much debate due largely to a lack of long-term data about their effects on health. Still, many scientists believe they are much safer than traditional cigarettes.  Altria sells an e-cigarette called MarkTen in the United States, which Philip Morris sells in Spain under the brand name Solaris. Philip Morris also sells Marlboro HeatSticks, made from tobacco, in Italy and Japan.    Separately on Thursday, Philip Morris, the world’s leading tobacco company, said it was dissolving a joint venture with Swedish Match (SWMA.ST) that was aimed at selling snus, a type of smokeless tobacco, outside Scandinavia and the United States. The companies said there was a small but growing demand for snus in those markets but that “development has ... taken longer than the parties had initially anticipated”. The companies will now pursue their own strategies, though there are transitional agreements in place whereby Swedish Match will supply snus to Philip Morris for certain markets, and Philip Morris will distribute the Swedish company’s snus in Canada and Russia.

56,MO,AB InBev talked to SABMiller investor Altria before approach: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA (ABI.BR) reached out to SABMiller Plc’s SAB.L largest shareholder, Altria Group Inc (MO.N), before making a takeover approach, Bloomberg reported. Cigarette maker Altria, which owns a 27 percent stake in SABMiller, has signaled it is open to considering a proposal, depending on the terms, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  SABMiller, the world’s No. 2 brewer, said on Wednesday it had been informed that AB InBev intended to make an offer which it would have to do by Oct. 14 under British rules.

Analysts have said AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SABMiller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller’s debt.

58,MO,AB InBev faces delicate balance in structuring SABMiller bid,"BRUSSELS/LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A $70 billion debt package being arranged to fund Anheuser-Busch InBev’s  takeover of SABMiller still leaves the world’s largest brewer with a tricky balancing act in satisfying a range of shareholder camps with different needs. SABMiller’s two major shareholders face potential capital gains taxes, so may want to get paid in shares - which would conflict with AB InBev’s controlling shareholders’ desire to limit the dilution to their control that would come with issuing new shares. Furthermore, some shareholders might have geographical restrictions tied to the location of the share listing. Marlboro maker Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia together own 42 percent of SABMiller, and are widely believed to prefer shares in an enlarged company rather than cash, to avoid triggering capital gains taxes on the proceeds of their stakes, worth about $24 billion and $13 billion, respectively, at current prices. “We can say with confidence that Santo Domingo and Altria will want a decent chunk of equity, probably the majority,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Eamonn Ferry. “The wild card is how much of the free float would want equity too,” he added, referring to shareholders beyond the major two. AB InBev, maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona,    is expected to have offered between 40 and 45 pounds per share for its nearest rival within the next two weeks. It is already asking banks to underwrite up to $70 billion in debt financing, sources have told Reuters. With a deal therefore costing as much as $110 billion, that leaves a likely share issue of as much as $40 billion, a ratio that roughly fits the 60/40 split expected by analysts, who note the Brazilian and Belgian founding families of AB InBev, who own 52 percent of its shares, would not want to largely dilute their control by issuing too much new equity. “It is hard to over-estimate the importance that ABI assigns to this ownership structure,” said Nomura analysts earlier this month. “This drives an ownership culture and a long-term view.” SABMiller said on Sept. 16 that AB InBev had approached it about a friendly takeover that would form a combined group brewing a third of the world’s beer. UK takeover rules require AB InBev to make a formal offer by Oct. 14, though the parties are not required to disclose the offer. Despite the combination having been discussed for years, sources say one of the difficulties in pulling it off is finding a structure that ensures the two biggest shareholders get shares and the rest cash, while still offering the same to all shareholders. “That’s the problem,” said an industry banker not involved in the deal. SABMiller and AB InBev declined to comment. Officials representing Altria and the Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached. One way to ease dilution of control is to bring the Santo Domingo family into the core group of controlling insiders, say analysts. That would makes sense given the family are founders of a Colombian brewer that SABMiller bought in 2005, and the controlling group includes the founding families of AB InBev. “The Santo Domingos clearly know the beer business quite well. They’d be more than happy to have money invested in ABI and the 3G guys,” said Exane’s Ferry, referring to private equity firm 3G Capital, which is run by some of AB InBev’s controlling shareholders. 3G gained control of U.S. food group Kraft Heinz  following deals financed in part by billionaire Warren Buffett. Members of the Santo Domingo family have invested with 3G, according to the Wall Street Journal. Depending on price, AB InBev’s core shareholder group could see their ownership of the merged group fall from 52 percent to just over 40 percent with that level of new equity. If Santo Domingo’s shares were added to the core group, it could rise back to nearly 50 percent, according to some analysts. Equity financing would mean a far higher new share component than when InBev bought Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion in 2008. A rights issue of just 6.4 billion euros meant AB InBev’s net debt to EBITDA (core profit) ratio soared to more than five times. In an SAB deal, analysts see that multiple being just over four, after likely required disposals in the United States and China. Furthermore, there is a group of South African shareholders, three of which own 5 percent of the company, who have long ties with the South African-born brewer and might like to participate in its future growth. But their future ownership could hinge on a continued stock listing in Johannesburg. If the dilution is too great, Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland suggests a “backstop” share buyback at a later stage. “The disadvantage is that the buyback would have to be done as a tender offer, which would probably have to be at a premium to whatever ABI’s shares trade on at the time,” he said.

61,MO,AB InBev CEO delays talk of hostile bid for SABMiller,"LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev  Chief Executive Carlos Brito does not want to talk about making a hostile bid for rival brewer SABMiller, saying he hopes shareholders will urge the board to engage concerning the existing offer. “I don’t want to go there now. I think there’s too much to be gained in the next few days,” Brito told a conference call for analysts and investors. SABMiller, the world’s second largest brewer, has promptly rejected an improved offer from AB InBev on Wednesday, saying the 68 billion-pound ($104 billion) offer “very substantially undervalues” it. Brito looked to SABMiller shareholders for next steps, saying he hoped they would voice support for it, and urge the board to engage. The offer includes a discounted “partial share alternative that was “designed with and for” SABMiller’s two largest shareholders, Altria Group and Bevco, controlled by the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Altria has expressed support for the offer, but Brito said AB InBev currently does not have the support of Bevco. “We hope to get support from the SAB shareholders including Bevco. An irrevocable from them is a precondition,” Brito said. “But we can always waive that at a later point and do something different.”   (Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by David Evans)",10072015,http://www.reuters.com/article/sabmiller-ma-hostile/ab-inbev-ceo-delays-talk-of-hostile-bid-for-sabmiller-idUSWLB008Z720151007
62,MO,UPDATE 2-AB InBev CEO appeals to SAB shareholders for second day,"* CEO repeats frustration, says rival’s view lacks credibility * SABMiller board says proposal substantially undervalue company   (Adds Breakingviews link) By Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev  Chief Executive Carlos Brito repeated his appeal to SABMiller shareholders on Thursday, again urging them to push the brewer’s board into more serious takeover discussions. The Brazilian boss of Belgium-based AB InBev expressed frustration at the board of its UK rival, continuing a strategy begun on Wednesday, which one analyst called going “hostile lite”, referring to an acquirer putting its terms direct to a target’s shareholders. The stakes are high for both, the world’s No. 1 and 2 brewers, whose combination would be the fifth largest merger in corporate history, according to Thomson Reuters data. AB InBev said it was surprised the SABMiller board said its takeover offer of 42.15 pounds per share, made public on Wednesday, “still very substantially undervalues” SABMiller. It noted the price is a 44 percent premium to SAB’s share price on Sept. 14, the last day before renewed speculation of its approach. The premium, and the fact that SAB’s largest shareholder, tobacco group Altria, supports the offer, show SAB’s stance “lacks credibility”, it said. “How long will it be before shareholders see a value of over 42 pounds in the absence of an offer from AB InBev?” Brito said in a statement on Thursday. “If shareholders agree that we should be in proper discussions, they should voice their views and should not allow the board of SABMiller to frustrate this process and let this opportunity slip away.” An SAB spokesman said the company noted AB InBev’s announcement, which it said “contains nothing new.” AB InBev has until Oct. 14 to make a formal bid, unless SAB agrees to continue talks and applies for an extension. The deadline and lack of board engagement were the reasons Brito gave on Wednesday for going public with his third offer. The appeal to SAB’s minority shareholders “could be interpreted as a ‘hostile lite’ approach,” said Berenberg analyst Javier Gonzalez Lastra. “If AB InBev does indeed have the support of both Altria and BevCo ... it would appear natural that there is some probability that AB InBev eventually goes hostile,” Lastra said. Altria and the BevCo company of Colombia’s Santo Domingo family together own almost 41 percent of the company. Brito on Wednesday said it was premature to talk about a hostile bid. While AB InBev’s cash offer of 42.15 per share would give SAB a market value of 68 billion pounds, the company would only really pay 65 billion pounds because of an alternative discounted offer of cash and shares, designed for Altria and BevCo. Altria, with a 26.6 percent stake, has endorsed the proposal, but the Santo Domingos have not. AB InBev also said SABMiller’s board had referred to significant regulatory hurdles in the United States and Canada on which AB InBev had “not yet provided comfort”. AB InBev said it had done significant work to find solutions and had repeatedly offered to share this analysis with SABMiller. “Each time the board of SABMiller has refused to engage,” the brewer said.

67,MO,Illinois top court voids $10.1 bln Philip Morris 'light' verdict,"(Reuters) - The Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday threw out a $10.1 billion verdict against Philip Morris USA in a long-running lawsuit accusing the Altria Group Inc unit of misleading smokers about the health risks of “light” cigarettes. By a 4-2 vote, the court said lower-level state courts lacked authority under Illinois law to reimpose the verdict, which was first rendered in 2003 and reinstated in 2014, against Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro cigarettes. Writing for the majority, Justice Anne Burke said the plaintiffs could instead ask the Illinois Supreme Court itself to reinstate the award, and overturn its own 2005 ruling that threw it out. She did not address the merits of such a request. Wednesday’s decision voids one of the largest U.S. verdicts against a tobacco company related to smoking and tobacco smoke exposure, which the Surgeon General estimates cause 480,000 premature deaths annually in the country. The class-action case was brought in 2000 on behalf of 1.4 million Illinois smokers who said Philip Morris deceived them into believing that Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. Instead of suing over health problems, the plaintiffs sought to recoup sums spent on light cigarettes. It was the first case to go to trial over the marketing of cigarettes as “light.” Justice Charles Freeman dissented from Wednesday’s decision. He said the lower courts had power to punish Philip Morris for its “appalling” conduct in long concealing the risks of light cigarettes, and fueling a “public health epidemic” caused by smoking and tobacco exposure. Altria is based in Richmond, Virginia, and controls roughly half of the U.S. cigarette market. George Zelcs, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients are “disappointed” in the outcome and will review their options. The plaintiffs had revived their lawsuit after the Federal Trade Commission in 2008 changed how cigarette makers could describe tar and nicotine levels in advertising and packaging. A state court judge dismissed the case again in 2012. But in 2014, a state appeals court said that judge lacked authority to decide how the FTC action affected damages, and reinstated the original verdict.

68,MO,Illinois top court voids $10.1 billion Philip Morris 'light' verdict,"(Reuters) - The Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday threw out a $10.1 billion verdict against Philip Morris USA in a long-running lawsuit accusing the Altria Group Inc unit of misleading smokers about the health risks of “light” cigarettes. By a 4-2 vote, the court said lower-level state courts lacked authority under Illinois law to reimpose the verdict first rendered in 2003 against Philip Morris, a unit of Altria Group Inc that makes Marlboro cigarettes. Nonetheless, Justice Anne Burke wrote for the majority that the plaintiffs could still ask the Illinois Supreme Court itself to reinstate the award, which it had thrown out in 2005. The court did not address the merits of such a request. Justice Charles Freeman dissented. He said the lower courts had power to punish Philip Morris for its “appalling” conduct in long concealing the risks of light cigarettes, and fueling a “public health epidemic” caused by smoking and tobacco exposure. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris had no immediate comment. Wednesday’s decision for now voids one of the largest U.S. verdicts against a tobacco company related to smoking and tobacco smoke exposure, which the Surgeon General estimates cause 480,000 premature deaths annually in the country. The class-action case was brought in 2000 on behalf of 1.4 million Illinois smokers. They said Philip Morris deceived them into believing that “light” or “low tar” cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. Instead of suing over health problems, the plaintiffs sought to recoup sums spent on light cigarettes. It was the first case to go to trial over the marketing of cigarettes as “light.” In 2008, long after the original verdict was overturned, the Federal Trade Commission changed how cigarette makers could describe tar and nicotine levels in advertising and packaging. That prompted the plaintiffs to revive their lawsuit, only to have a state court judge dismiss it again in December 2012. But in May 2014, a state appeals court said the judge lacked authority to decide how the FTC action affected damages, and reinstated the original verdict. Wednesday’s decision overturned that reinstatement. That verdict was put on hold during Philip Morris’ appeal.

71,MO,"AB InBev, SABMiller extend takeover deadline to November 11","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brewer SABMiller Plc SAB.L has extended the deadline for rival Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) to make a formal $100 billion-plus takeover offer by a further week in order to finalize shareholder support for the deal. The two companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday that London’s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers had granted SABMiller’s request to push back the deadline to 5 p.m. (12.00 midnight ET) on Wednesday, November 11. The Takeover Panel has already granted a series of extensions since AB InBev and SABMiller said they had reached a preliminary agreement on a takeover on Oct. 13. Since then, AB InBev has completed a due diligence review of its target, reconfirmed the terms of its proposed offer and negotiated facilities to fund a takeover at short notice.  The two companies said on Wednesday that they had made good progress in agreeing terms and AB InBev had entered into the funding facilities, but still needed a further week to finalize discussions and satisfy pre-conditions. Last week, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said the extension was needed for lawyers to finalize documents related to shareholder support for the deal. AB InBev is offering 44 pounds per SABMiller share, along with a discounted alternative mostly of shares and designed for SABMiller’s two largest shareholders, cigarette-maker Altria (MO.N) and BevCo, the vehicle of Colombia’s Santo Domingo family, who together own 40.5 percent of the target company. The takeover currently worth $107 billion would create a brewing colossus making about a third of all beer drunk and would be the largest of a British-based company and the fourth-biggest overall in corporate history.

72,MO,Long-term thinking could become focus for a new index fund,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - S&P; Dow Jones Indices is negotiating with asset managers to license its new index, which it says represents companies that focus on the long term rather than the current quarter.    The Long-Term Value Creation Global Index .SPLTVCUN could be the basis for one or more mutual funds, exchange-traded funds or structured products, Vinit Srivastava, S&P;’s senior director of equity strategy, said in an interview last week.     S&P; created the index over the past year in response to concerns that company executives, under pressure from hard-charging board overseers and the earnings calendar, have put short-term wins ahead of building businesses that thrive over time. Designed with the help of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the index consists of companies with what S&P; considers strong corporate-governance plans and solid financial numbers. “We have to do things to stop that short-term focus,” said Poul Winslow, managing director at Toronto-based CPPIB. He said the index relied on a scoring system that draws out important details about how companies are governed. The CPPIB and other institutional investors have committed $2 billion to private funds tracking the index. S&P;, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc MHFI.N and the largest provider of indexes tracked by U.S.-listed ETFs, has not decided whether such a license would be exclusive to one asset manager. Srivastava declined to name any bidders or comment further on the discussions. Bringing such a product to market could take several months of planning and regulatory approvals. Asset managers have already had something of a hand in the effort. Focusing Capital on the Long Term, a group that advocated for the index and was founded by CPPIB and management consultant McKinsey & Co in 2013, counts senior management from fund-managing companies BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N) among its members and advisers. DEFINING LONG-TERM To come up with its index, S&P; starts with the largest public companies and allocates money to those that produce a hefty return on equity and seem to develop strong policies on legal compliance, environmental reporting and philanthropy. Such practices, advocates like Winslow said, can predict performance better than balance sheets. Among the top companies in the index are health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N), coffee chain Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and industrial conglomerate 3M Co (MMM.N).  However, the index does not screen out companies that spend cash buying back their own shares, even though such repurchases have been criticized by investors who would rather see the money go to long-term ventures like capital expenditures or workforce development. One of the long-term index’s top holdings, retailer O’Reilly Automotive Inc (ORLY.O), is also one of the largest components of the S&P; 500 Buyback Index .SPBUYUP. Srivastava said companies with good governance rules tend to do buybacks “for the right reasons.” The index’s focus on corporate governance does not necessarily mean a focus on social issues, even though pension funds often consider such criteria. Two of the index’s top 10 holdings are tobacco companies Reynolds American Inc RAI.N and Altria Group Inc (MO.N), which socially conscious investors often screen out.

73,MO,"Activist TCI takes SABMiller stake, investors scent sweetened offer","LONDON (Reuters) - The Children’s Investment Fund Management (TCI) has taken a stake in SABMiller SAB.L, the second activist to buy into the brewer in recent weeks, raising the prospect of a late push for improved takeover terms from AB InBev (ABI.BR). The move by TCI comes ahead of SABMiller’s annual meeting in London on Thursday when investors could question terms of a $100 billion-plus deal that now appear to favor its two largest shareholders after a steep drop in the value of sterling. British-based TCI, best known for its investments in troubled carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and French aerospace group Safran (SAF.PA), has acquired just under 1 percent of SABMiller’s stock, a source familiar with the matter said. TCI’s acquisition of a small stake follows news that fellow hedge fund Elliott Advisors had taken a 1.3 percent stake in the London-listed maker of beers like Peroni and Grolsch, which it later raised to about 1.5 percent, regulatory filings showed.  The appearance of two of the world’s most powerful activists on the SABMiller shareholder register has prompted talk among some institutional investors that Elliott and TCI could lead a push for AB InBev to improve its 44 pounds-per-share cash offer, aimed at the majority of shareholders.  SAB shares traded at 44.31 pounds at 1130 GMT on Monday. The source declined to describe the motives or rationale behind TCI’s stakebuilding, but did say the hedge fund “obviously has an interest in the deal and how it pans out”. TCI and SABMiller declined to comment. The main offer is now lower than a special cash-and-stock offer designed for SAB’s biggest two investors, cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family, who together own about 40 percent of the company. When the deal was announced in November, that partial share alternative — which avoids triggering large tax bills — was worth about 39 pounds. But the recent fall in the pound and rise in ABI’s shares have increased its value to about 51 pounds. “Given all the regulatory hoops that the deal has already had to jump through it might be dangerous to rock the boat too much, but Elliott must have taken a view that they can get the offer upped without altering the timetable of the deal materially,” one of SAB’s top 15 investors told Reuters. Investor advisor Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. has written to clients to point out the relative improvement in the value of the partial share alternative, noting that it now represents a 16 percent premium to the broader offer, instead of a 4.9 percent discount.  It also pointed out that while the alternative offer was technically open to all investors, it seemed “designed to be unappealing” to most fund managers since the shares are unlisted and cannot be traded for five years. The deal is currently structured as a “scheme of arrangement” which requires approval by 75 percent of SAB’s shareholders. The vote is expected to take place only once outstanding antitrust approvals have been granted.  Another source close to the deal suggested the activists might struggle to garner enough support among SAB shareholders to call for a rewrite of the terms at this late stage, especially since the deal has already received two of the four required approvals from European and South African regulators. “It’s a dangerous game and there’s no certainty that ABI is willing to raise its offer,” the source said. “The pound is going back up and this plays in favor of the existing arrangement...Shareholders want to get this deal done.” ",7182016,http://www.reuters.com/article/sabmiller-tci/activist-tci-takes-sabmiller-stake-investors-scent-sweetened-offer-idUSL1N1A405O
74,MO,SABMiller board to weigh AB InBev takeover terms as shareholder meeting looms -source,"LONDON (Reuters) - SABMiller SAB.L has not ruled out asking Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) to revamp its proposed $100 billion-plus takeover offer before formally recommending the bid, a source close to the London-listed brewer told Reuters, amid rising shareholder disquiet about the terms.  SABMiller’s board is meeting on Wednesday, a day before its annual shareholder meeting, to discuss how to quell unease about the disparity between ABI’s 44-pounds per share cash offer and a stock-and-cash alternative designed for SAB’s biggest investors, cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family, the source said. When the original deal was announced in November, that partial share alternative — which avoids triggering large tax bills — was worth about 39 pounds.  But the recent fall in the pound and rise in ABI’s shares have increased its value to about 51 pounds, representing a premium of around 15 percent to the cash offer. All investors have the option to take the stock and cash offer but under current terms the stock cannot be traded for five years, rendering the option highly unattractive for most fund managers. “At this stage the board will reassure investors and tell them their concerns will only be addressed after the deal gets regulatory clearance,” the first source close to SAB said. “After the pre-conditions are satisfied, (the board) will need to decide whether to refresh its recommendation for the ABI bid or ask for improved terms,” the source added. SABMiller declined to comment. A second source close to SABMiller described the long-planned meeting as “routine” prior to an AGM and said it was unconnected to recent stakebuilding by activist investors The Children’s Investment Fund Management (TCI) and Elliott Advisors.  Those investments have raised the prospects of a late opportunistic push for more cash from ABI, which counts Budweiser and Stella Artois among its top brands.     ABI’s proposed takeover has already been approved by European and South African regulators but U.S. and Chinese antitrust authorities have yet to sanction the union. Until then, the deal terms remain flexible and subject to revision, the first source said.  “Regulatory approval is expected very soon. It could come any time now and this is why agitators are building stakes,” the source said. Minority investors meanwhile are waiting nervously to see if any last-minute jostling could secure them more cash or derail the merger altogether. “They (Elliott) have previous form here in trying to extract value close to decision day ... but the deal feels done so it may be too little too late,” said one SABMiller investor, who said he would back a campaign for fresh terms as it was in his clients’ interests. “The fall in sterling makes the cash offer less attractive to general shareholders. The ‘insiders’ got a better deal here than the other shareholders,” he said. Besides increasing the cash offer to minority investors, sources have suggested that ABI could also address the disparity by increasing the cash component offered to Altria and the Santo Domingos or reducing the lock-up period on the shares.  Currently structured as a ‘scheme of arrangement’, the deal needs approval by 75 percent of shareholders but sources also said ABI could switch to a straight takeover offer, which only needs a majority.

75,MO,UPDATE 3-Brewer AB InBev seeks to nail SABMiller bid with sweetened offer,"BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) raised its $100 billion-plus bid for rival brewer SABMiller on Tuesday in an attempt to quash investor dissent over an offer made less attractive by a post Brexit vote fall in the pound.     SABMiller SAB.L said its chairman spoke with his AB InBevcounterpart on Friday about that offer in the light of exchange rate volatility and market movements, but there was no talk or agreement on the terms of the revised offer of 45 pounds a share, up from 44 pounds in October.    The change comes after a number of activist investors, such as Elliott Capital Advisors and TCI Fund Management, bought stakes in SABMiller and several shareholders voiced concerns at least week’s annual general meeting that the cash deal was less attractive for most investors than before and was below a share-and-cash alternative.     AB InBev (ABI) said the revised terms were final, which under British law means the price is set, unless the bidder drops its offer and waits six months to make another.      However, Aberdeen Asset Management ADN.L, with a 1.17percent SABMiller stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said the revised offer was still unacceptable, although analysts said they thought the deal was now likely to go through.     Bernstein Research beverage analyst Trevor Stirling said SABMiller’s shares would probably drop to 41.50 pounds if ABInBev’s takeover bid failed.      “The broader base of shareholders can take the money and run.... or seek to call ABI’s bluff,” said Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling. Another analyst likened the situation to a game of chicken that ABI was trying to head off.     The world’s largest brewer, seeking to secure attractive markets in Latin America and Africa by taking over its nearest rival, also improved the terms of an alternative share-and-cash offer designed for SABMiller’s two largest shareholders.     The slide in the value of the pound following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has made the deal less attractive for all the other investors, while the rise of AB InBev shares in the past nine months has made the alternative option more so.     The new offer values SABMiller at around 79 billion pounds ($103.6 billion). In November, when the original bid was officially launched, it was worth around 70 billion pounds, or$106 billion based on exchange rates at the time. That original bid had since dropped to about $100 billion.    The share and cash offer, designed exclusively for Altria and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family who together own about 41percent of SABMiller, had been worth less than the all-cash option last year, but with the fall of sterling and a rise of ABInBev shares, has since surpassed it.     For a foreign dollar-based investor, the cash offer had dropped 12 percent since the British referendum on June 23.Meanwhile, AB InBev shares are more than 35 percent higher than in October.          Aberdeen Asset Management said the revised offer undervalued the company and continued to favor Altria and Bevco, the Santo Domingos’ investment vehicle.     AB InBev said the share-and-cash offer value was now 51.14pounds, so above the 45 pounds of pure cash, but the new shares offered would have to be held for at least five years.     “I wouldn’t like to second guess what the activists were hoping for, but the increase is quite modest,” one SABMiller shareholder told Reuters.    Liberum analyst Alicia Forry said she believed the revised bid was likely to be successful by throwing a “small bone” to activist investors and shutting the door to further increases.     “The main thing from ABI’s perspective is they don’t want this to drag and if they engaged (activists) it would,” she said.     SABMiller, which provisionally agreed the deal struck in October, said it had taken on Centerview Partners as a new financial advisor and would consult with shareholders before formally considering the revised offer.     The takeover is still awaiting regulatory approval in China. SABMiller shareholders would expect to vote on it after that.     At 1445 GMT, SABMiller shares were down 0.4 percent at 44.20pounds. AB InBev’s were up 0.6 percent at 115.50 euros. ",7262016,http://www.reuters.com/article/sabmiller-ma-abinbev/update-3-brewer-ab-inbev-seeks-to-nail-sabmiller-bid-with-sweetened-offer-idUSL8N1AC1IC

77,MO,Top SABMiller shareholder says revised AB Inbev offer 'remains unacceptable',"LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Aberdeen Asset Management , a top-10 shareholder in drinks firm SABMiller, said on Tuesday that a revised $100 billion-plus bid for the company from rival AB Inbev remained “unacceptable”. Aberdeen said the revised offer of 45 pounds ($59.14) a share, up from 44 pounds a share previously, undervalued the company and continued to favour SABMiller’s two major shareholders, Altria and Bevco. “We have engaged with SABMiller’s Board on the differential treatment of shareholders since the deal was first constructed. The way that the value of the partial share offer has diverged from the cash offer has compounded our discomfort,” it said. Altria and Bevco should not be able to vote on the cash offer as they were inherently conflicted by their future stakes in AB InBev if the deal completes, it said. “We believe the board’s only choice is to treat Altria and Bevco as a separate class of shareholders and would urge them to make a public statement to this effect.” Failing a new offer, Aberdeen would “happily” remain a long-term shareholder in SABMiller, it added.

79,MO,UPDATE 2-SABMiller pauses AB InBev integration amid new offer,"LONDON (Reuters) - SABMiller SAB.L has told employees to pause the integration of  its operations with those of Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) as the brewer’s board weighs its sweetened takeover offer, two sources familiar with the matter said.   The pause is not an indication of the board’s thinking, said one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the matter is private.  Still, AB InBev’s U.S.-listed shares fell 3 percent and shares of Molson Coors (TAP.N), which is set to take over SAB’s U.S. operations, fell 5 percent on concerns about the fate of the $100 billion-plus deal, one of the biggest in corporate history. The world’s top brewers agreed to merge late last year and for months have been engaged in back-office preparations, the sources said, aimed at smoothing the combination that was expected to start in the second half of the year when the deal was due to close. The deal, however, has hit the rocks in recent weeks amid investor dissent over an offer made less attractive by a sharp fall in the pound following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. In an effort to calm a stream of investor complaints, AB InBev sweetened its offer on Tuesday. That prompted SABMiller Chief Executive Alan Clark to call for a pause in “convergence planning workstreams,” according to a company memo published on Wednesday by the Financial Times’ blog Alphaville. “There should be no contact with AB InBev with immediate effect, and all meetings and calls will be postponed until further notice,” the memo said, noting that it also applied to brewers Molson Coors and Asahi (2502.T), which are picking up assets that need to be divested in the deal, and all advisers and consultants. “This is another big piece of news to take in and I appreciate this will cause lots of internal and external speculation. However, please stay focused and I will keep you updated as soon as I am able to,” Clark added.  SAB officials declined to comment on the memo or the pause in integration, which was mentioned earlier on Wednesday by trade publication Beer Business Daily.   Denver-based Molson Coors, which on Monday announced leadership changes to take effect once the deal closes, also declined to comment, as did AB InBev.  AB InBev’s new offer is worth around 79 billion pounds, up from a November deal worth about 70 billion pounds. The steep weakening of the pound versus the dollar had reduced the value of that offer for U.S. investors, while a rise in AB InBev shares has increased the value of a special cash-and-share alternative aimed at SAB’s two largest shareholders. The new offer, which is final, has met a mixed reception. Top 10 shareholder Aberdeen Asset Management ADN.L said the offer remained “unacceptable” as it undervalued the company and continued to favor those two major shareholders, cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family.   By contrast, New York-based hedge fund Twin Capital Management, also a shareholder, applauded the raised offer. “I’m hopeful it gets done. It should get done,” Twin’s CEO David Simon told Reuters, adding that he had conveyed that message to SABMiller management. South Africa’s Public Investment Corporation (PIC), a top five shareholder, told Reuters it was in talks with SAB over the revised offer, but declined to make its view public.

80,MO,"Aberdeen Asset Management says will vote against SABMiller, AbInbev deal","LONDON (Reuters) - Fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management ADN.L reiterated on Friday it would vote against the takeover of SABMiller SAB.L by Belgian rival AB Inbev (ABI.BR) after the company said it backed the revised terms. However, it said it welcomed the SAB board’s decision to treat leading shareholders Altria and Bevco as a separate class of shareholder. “This acknowledges the reality of the situation and will help to ensure that the views of the rest of the investor base have due weight,” Aberdeen said, although it continued to dislike the deal structure and thought it undervalued SABMiller. “We would welcome other investors who value good corporate governance and recognize the superior value from continuing to hold SABMiller as a standalone entity voting in a similar fashion.”  ",7292016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sabmiller-abi-aberdeen/aberdeen-asset-management-says-will-vote-against-sabmiller-abinbev-deal-idUSKCN10921N
81,MO,UPDATE 3-SABMiller backs AB InBev offer for biggest-ever consumer takeover,"LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The board of brewer SABMiller SAB.L will recommend its shareholders approve a sweetened takeover offer by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the company said on Friday, capping a week of high drama about the fate of the consumer industry’s biggest-ever merger. The deal, worth 79 billion pounds ($104.9 billion), remains to be voted on by shareholders - a hurdle that could become harder to clear since the board intends to request that shareholders be divided into two classes, with each needing to  approve the terms. One prominent investor - Aberdeen Asset Management ADN.L -  voiced opposition to the revised offer, saying it still undervalued the maker of beers including Castle Lager and Pilsner Urquell, which has a strong footprint in fast-growing markets of Latin America and Africa. AB InBev added a pound-per-share to its cash bid on Tuesday to quash investor dissent over what would be the largest-ever takeover of a British company. Its earlier offer had been made less attractive by a sharp fall in sterling following Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union.   “The board’s decision was difficult given changes in circumstances since the board originally recommended £44 per share in cash last November,” said SAB Chairman Jan du Plessis. “We believe the final cash consideration of £45 per share to be at the lower end of the range of values considered recommendable.”     “In reaching its decision, SAB’s board considered the best interests of the company as a whole, taking into account all salient facts and circumstances,” du Plessis said, adding that it had received extensive shareholder feedback. Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling said that at current exchange rates, he expects the deal to get approved. “It’s better than walking away,” he said. “But if sterling falls another 5-10 percent then all bets are off.” AB InBev, the Belgium-based maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, also raised by 88 pence a special cash-and-stock alternative aimed at SAB’s two largest shareholders, Altria (MO.N) and Bevco. That alternative had been at a discount to the cash offer last year, but given current exchange rates, is now at a premium. The board said it plans to ask the UK court overseeing the process to treat Altria and Bevco as a separate class of shareholders. Under that scenario, three-quarters of both classes of voting shareholders would be needed to pass the deal. If treated as a single class, the hurdle would be lower since Altria and Bevco have already pledged to vote in favour. Together they control about 41 percent of the company. Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland said SAB had effectively upped the requirement on backing for the deal to a potential 85 percent. “They appear to be cooperating but they’re doing it in a way that is somewhat unhelpful to ABI.” AB InBev said it believes the proposed combination “represents a compelling opportunity for all SABMiller and AB InBev shareholders”. AB InBev has secured conditional regulatory approval in China, its final pre-condition for the deal. Aberdeen reiterated on Friday that it would vote against the deal but said it welcomed the decision to treat the shareholders as different classes. The vote is likely to take place in October or November, and if the offer is approved, this would allow AB InBev to meet its target of closing the deal this year.

83,MO,AB InBev clears China hurdle in SABMiller takeover deal,"BRUSSELS/BEIJING (Reuters) - Brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) cleared a major hurdle toward its takeover of SABMiller SAB.L with regulatory approval from China on Friday, leaving the acquisition’s future in the hands of the British company’s board. China’s ministry of commerce said it had approved the acquisition on condition that AB InBev fulfilled its commitment to sell SABMiller’s stake in Chinese beer joint venture CR Snow. The maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona said the conditional clearance meant it had satisfied all pre-conditions following earlier green lights from EU, U.S. and South African authorities. It is now waiting for the SABMiller board’s recommendation on a revised $100-billion-plus bid proposed on Tuesday. AB InBev added a pound per share to its cash offer to quash investor dissent over an offer made less attractive by a fall in the sterling following Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union. It has also hiked its share-and-cash alternative by 88 pence. “This offer is final and cannot be increased or otherwise changed,” Chief Executive Carlos Brito told a conference call after the company’s second-quarter results. “We believe the revised and final offer represents a compelling opportunity for all SABMiller shareholders.” SABMiller, with prized Latin American and African markets, has told employees to pause the integration of its operations with those of AB InBev as the board weighs the sweetened offer. Nevertheless, Brito said the two companies had made significant progress together since November on regulatory issues, bond financing and asset disposals in the United States, China and Europe, as well as general integration planning. “It remains our objective to close the transaction in 2016,” he said, declining to give further details on the planned takeover. AB InBev’s shares have yo-yoed according to the market’s perception of the chances of a deal, which AB InBev needs to cement future growth. It would also take a big hit on its pound hedges if the takeover fell through. The shares fell sharply on Thursday after reports of SABMiller’s integration pause, and were up 2.9 percent on Friday after reports that a number of activist shareholders broadly backed the deal. Those include Elliott Capital Advisors, which has built up a stake in recent weeks.  Aberdeen Asset Management ADN.L on Tuesday called the offer unacceptable, but AB InBev already has the backing of the two largest shareholders - Altria (MO.N) and Bevco, the Santo Domingo family investment vehicle - hold almost 41 percent. Marshall Wace LLP, controlling just over 1 percent of SABMiller stock, said on Friday it supported the offer. “We are at a natural point for this business to move on and become part of a bigger company, so to reject this now, you just wonder what things would be like,” said one of SABMiller’s 20 largest investors who declined to be named Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland said if the offer failed then SABMiller shares would fall back to 40 pounds or below and it would be a hard task for the company to recover that value. “If you bought in a long time ago at 10 pounds, you might be happy with 38, but more recent arrivals, of which there are a number, will see their value destroyed,” he said. SABMiller shares were just below 44 pounds on Friday.   Brito was speaking after the company published its second-quarter results, exposing problems in Brazil and highlighting the attraction of the less-developed and high-growth African markets that a SABMiller takeover would offer. AB InBev’s core profit in the second quarter rose 4.3 percent on a like-for-like basis to $4.01 billion, below the average Reuters poll forecast of $4.13 billion. The company saw earnings growth in the United States and China, but margin decline in Mexico and lower beer sales in its second-largest market, Brazil, due to a downturn that has dragged on for more than a year. The company sold 4.5 percent less beer in Brazil than a year earlier in April to June, an improvement from the 10 percent drop in the first quarter but below AB InBev’s own forecasts. It said it expected Brazil revenue this year to be similar to the level of 2015, down from previous guidance of growth by a mid to high single-digit percentage.  But it also cut its guidance for cost of sales per hectoliter to a low single-digit percentage increase, from a mid-single digit rise seen before, due to savings on procurement and efficiency and greater use of returnable bottles in Brazil.  The company has forecast that its revenue per hectoliter overall will grow ahead of inflation, partly as it pushes drinkers over to more expensive beers, but with challenging conditions in Brazil and China.

88,MO,UPDATE 1-AB InBev and SABMiller expect megabrew merger to complete Oct. 10,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) and SABMiller SAB.L, the world’s two largest brewers, set out a timetable on Monday for the final stages of their $100 billion-plus merger, with completion of the deal expected in a little more than two months. SABMiller’s board agreed last week to an improved 79 billion pound ($104.3 billion) offer from AB InBev, which said it would now publish the takeover terms on Tuesday. A key step in the process is an Aug. 22 British court hearing to assess SABMiller’s proposal that its shareholders should be divided into two classes, with each needing to approve the terms. AB InBev has put forward two variations of its offer: a straight 45 pounds per share intended for the majority of investors and a cash-and-shares offer aimed at SABMiller’s two largest shareholders, Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. The two own 41 percent of SABMiller. The combination is contentious because the cash-and-share offer is now worth more than the cash bid, though the new shares would have to be held for five years. By splitting the vote, the deal would need backing from up to 85 percent of the shares rather than the 75 percent needed in a unified vote. Altria and Bevco, the Santo Domingo investment vehicle, have already signaled their support. AB InBev and SABMiller shareholder meetings are scheduled for Sept. 28, with completion of the deal expected on Oct. 10 and trading of the yet to be named combined group slated for Oct. 11. The timetable comes after a hectic Friday in which China first gave conditional approval for the merger. The SABMiller  board also recommended acceptance, though it did say the deal was at the lower end of an acceptable range. The deal, the largest ever in the consumer industry, would combine AB InBev’s Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona with SABMiller’s Castle Lager and take it into fast-growing African and new Latin American markets.

93,MO,Fitch Rates Altria's Senior Notes Offering 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  Altria Group, Inc.'s (Altria) senior notes offering. Fitch expects that the  proceeds of the issue will be used to pay down a portion of Altria's currently  outstanding $682 million of 9.95% notes due 2038 and $718 million of 10.20%  notes due 2039, through an ""any and all"" tender offer that is set to expire on  Sept. 16, unless extended. Any remaining proceeds from the offering are expected  to be used for other general corporate purposes, including voluntary  contributions to Altria's pension plans. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $13 billion of debt at June 30, 2016. A full  list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The secular cigarette decline in the U.S., typically in the range of 3% to 4%  per year, decelerated to less than 1% during 2015, but will likely return closer  to historical levels by 2017. --Altria should continue to generate strong EBITDA margins in the high 40%'s,  even as volume declines resume and pricing improvement moderates due to fewer  macroeconomic tailwinds. --Altria's shareholder-friendly posture is expected to continue through the  ratings horizon, including dividend payouts around 80% (of adjusted EPS)  supplemented with active share repurchasing. Fitch sees the strategy as  manageable at current cash flows and with leverage (total debt to EBITDA)  consistently sustained below 2.0 times (x). --Positive action to current credit ratings is restrained by key factors in the  mature industry, specifically secular volume declines, high litigation exposure,  rising regulatory risks and an accommodative shareholder stance. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Altria include: --Consolidated revenue increases by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of  between 1%-2% from fiscal year (FY) 2015 to FY2018 as cigarette volume declines  revert closer to historical levels of 3%-4% after moderating in 2015 and 2016. --Consolidated EBITDA and EBITDA margin approximates $8.5 billion and 49.5%,  respectively in 2016. --Total debt to EBITDA increases from 1.4x in 2015 to around 1.5x in 2016, from  a modestly higher debt load partially offset by incremental EBITDA growth. --Modest free cash flow (FCF; operating cash flow, less CAPEX and dividends) in  2016 assuming that Altria makes voluntary pension contributions, followed by a  return to levels between $700 million-$800 million (approximate 4% margin)  annually over the remainder of the forecast period, reflecting annual increases  to dividends and capital intensity maintained around 1%. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future development that may individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action: --Mitigation of negative industry factors with an emphasis on the slowing or  reversal of secular volume declines;  --Altria fully offsetting cigarette volume pressures with meaningful portfolio  diversification, such as alternative smoking products including E-cigarettes; --Significantly reducing litigation risk, most notably the Engle progeny  exposure; --A commitment to a conservative financial strategy demonstrated by lower  dividend payouts and less-aggressive share repurchasing.  Future development that may individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action: --Altria has flexibility to accommodate a more aggressive shareholder-friendly  stance or acquisition activity, but gross debt leverage exceeding 2.5x would  warrant a one-notch downgrade;     --EBITDA pressures arising from greater-than-expected market contraction or a  heightened competitive environment, such that gross debt leverage rises and  stays above 2.5x; --Regulatory decisions immediately banning sale of mentholated cigarettes or  meaningfully increasing state or federal excise taxes on smoking products that  significantly accelerates volume declines; --Substantial changes in the litigation process, whereby legal cases may reach  verdict quicker and/or material adverse judgments significantly increase in  number and amount. CIGARETTE VOLUMES IN DECLINE The secular cigarette decline in the U.S., typically in the range of 3% to 4%  per year, decelerated to less than 1% during 2015, benefitting from more  disposable income remains in the hands of the smoking population, mainly driven  by falling gas prices. As a result, cigarette consumers smoked more often and  have up-trended to premium cigarettes. While there will be some benefit during  2016 as oil prices remain subdued, Fitch estimates a return to the historical  annual rate of cigarette decline by 2017.  OPERATIONAL LEVERAGE/PRICING DRIVE EARNINGS  Operating leverage, pricing improvement, and moderating cigarette volume  declines drove an increase of 6.2% in operating income in 2015 from a 5.1%  increase in sales, net of excise taxes. This trend has reversed in the first six  months of 2016, partially due to lower volume and higher promotional  investments, offset by higher pricing. Fitch sees EBITDA margins of 49.5% in  2016, but then modestly easing annually as cigarette volume declines revert to  historical levels. HEAVY SHAREHOLDER RETURNS MANAGEABLE Fitch expects Altria to maintain its shareholder-friendly posture through the  ratings horizon, which includes dividend payouts around 80% (of adjusted EPS)  supplemented with active share repurchasing. The company gains flexibility for  heavy shareholder returns from limited acquisition opportunities and light  capital spending Altria increases its dividend yearly by 8% to 9% (currently  topping $4 billion) and spends around $1 billion for share repurchases that is  determined annually. Fitch sees the strategy as manageable at current cash flows  and with leverage (total debt to EBITDA) consistently sustained below 2.0x. Capital Structure Well Managed: Altria has worked down $8.3 billion of high  coupon notes (due in 2018, 2019, 2038, and 2039) issued for the U.S. Tobacco  (UST) acquisition in 2009. Since 2012, the company re-financed and tendered for  nearly $4.9 billion of the expensive debt, leaving a balance of approximately  $3.4 billion as of June 30, 2016. This total could be reduced by $1 billion or  more once the company's current tender offer is completed. As such, Altria's  weighted average interest rate on its debt, all fixed rate, decreased to 5.5% in  2015 from 8.3% in 2011, and will likely decrease further once the company's  current refinancing transactions are completed. The company also chose to pay  off $1 billion maturing debt in 2015 as opposed to refinancing the notes,  yielding total debt of $12.9 billion on June 30, 2016 (from $14.7 billion at the  end of 2014) and gross debt leverage of 1.4x for the latest 12 months (LTM)  ending June 30, 2016. Fitch expects that leverage will continue to approximate  1.5x over the next few years, as the company maintains financial discipline  while benefiting from strong operational performance. Altria's next significant  long-term debt maturity is the balance of 9.7% unsecured notes ($863.6 million)  due in November 2018. SABMiller Investment Change: Altria's liquidity has been supported by an  approximately 27% ownership in SABMiller plc (SABMiller), valued around $23  billion, that provides annual dividends in the range of $400 million to $500  million. The proposed agreement whereby Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) will  acquire SABMiller in a cash and stock transaction valued at $107 billion will  effectively reduce Altria's ownership to approximately 10.5% of the economic and  voting interest in the combined entity. In addition, Altria will receive $3  billion in cash before taxes from partial share alternative, with the final  ownership stake and cash proceeds subject to proration.  Fitch sees Altria continuing to account for its investment in the merged entity  through the equity method of accounting given board representation and continued  ability to exercise significant influence in the combined company. Fitch sees a  credit neutral impact from the transaction as cash dividends from the new entity  are forecasted to remain relatively steady with present levels despite the  likelihood that the AB InBev-SABMiller firm will reduce dividends to focus on  debt reduction over the intermediate term. INDUSTRY FACTORS LIMIT MOMENTUM Positive action to current credit ratings is restrained by key factors in the  mature industry, specifically secular volume declines, high litigation exposure,  rising regulatory risks and an accommodative shareholder stance. Reversal of  positive price realization for tobacco products such that secular volume  declines are not offset leading to compression in profitability and cash flow  generation would have negative consequences for Altria's ratings. LIQUIDITY Liquidity remains solid at June 30, 2016, with cash of $819 million (near the  annual low point following Philip Morris USA Inc.'s (PM USA) yearly payment to  the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) of approximately $4 billion in April) and  full availability under a $3 billion five-year revolver due August 2020.  Internal liquidity is provided by strong operating cash flows that have  historically increased annually and were $5.6 billion for the LTM period ending  June 30, 2016, versus $5.8 billion in 2015 and $4.66 billion in 2014. Altria's  liquidity is also supported by the company's approximate 27% share of SABMiller,  worth around $23 billion, which provides annual dividends in the range of $400  million to $500 million. The current holding may convert to a 10.5% ownership in  an AB InBev-SABMiller merged entity, potentially the world's largest brewer, in  the near term. Excess liquidity is important given PM USA's annual payment to  the MSA. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Altria as follows: Altria Group Inc.

96,MO,UPDATE 2-SABMiller investors cheer $100 bln-plus AB InBev takeover,"LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - SABMiller SAB.L shareholders overwhelmingly backed the brewer’s $100 billion-plus takeover by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) on Wednesday, clearing the last big hurdle for one of the largest corporate mergers in history.  The combined group will sell more than a quarter of all beers sold worldwide and be the fifth largest consumer goods company. For the maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois it provides entry into Africa and large fast-growing Latin American markets such as Colombia and Peru.  It will also cut its revenue from mature markets North America and Europe to 37 from 47 percent. AB InBev’s 79 billion pound  ($102.85 billion) bid passed in a meeting at a London Park Lane hotel lasting less than half an hour, overseen by Chairman Jan du Plessis, who fielded only two questions from shareholders.  It secured support representing 95.5 percent of SABMiller share value, having needed at least 75 percent to succeed. In an earlier meeting in Brussels, AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito said the new entity would continue to be called Anheuser-Busch InBev, eschewing any corporate reference to SABMiller, founded 120 years ago in South Africa. The brewer had changed its name after transformative deals in the past, such as InBev’s 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch.  “They can call it what they wish. That’s the way life works and that’s fine,” du Plessis told reporters after the meeting. “It’s what it is.”  He added that AB InBev were paying “a full price”.     The approval of SAB shareholders was widely expected, but not a given. Criticism of the takeover offer grew after a steep fall in sterling following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union made AB InBev’s cash offer less appealing.  Activist shareholders pressured SAB to seek a higher offer, prompting AB InBev to sweeten its bid in July. SAB backed the higher offer, and its two largest shareholders, cigarette maker Altria Group (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia, who together control about 40 percent of the shares, gave their support and did not vote on Wednesday. However, some prominent shareholders, including Aberdeen Asset Management, continued to oppose it. “We are obviously disappointed with, but not surprised by, the result,” Aberdeen said in a statement, adding it felt the final price still “significantly undervalued” SABMiller.  Despite hedge funds piling into the stock over the summer in the hope of a higher offer, Thomson Reuters data showed just six hedge funds with a collective investment of $211 million remained shareholders as the deal crossed the line.  The lion’s share of that, $199 million, was held by New York-based Soroban Capital, with smaller positions held by HBK Investments, Platinum Capital Management, Elliott Management, Farallon Capital Management and Davidson Kempner Capital. Cost-conscious AB InBev expects to extract at least $1.4 billion in annual cost savings after four years, it said, in addition to the $1.05 billion already announced by SABMiller. Given the company’s history of easily beating such targets, broker Jefferies sees it achieving $3 billion in savings. The new company will sell off joint venture stakes in the United States and China, to satisfy antitrust regulators, divest Peroni and Grolsch and kick off a sale process for SAB’s central and eastern European brands, estimated to be worth up to 7 billion euros. Still, competition in individual markets will not change radically as the two companies have little geographic overlap.

100,MO,BAT offers to buy U.S. tobacco firm Reynolds in $47 billion deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - British American Tobacco (BATS.L) has offered to buy out U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc RAI.N in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world’s biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. The cash-and-stock deal would mark the return of BAT to the lucrative and highly regulated U.S. market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in American and international markets.  It would also give the British company - which has been bolstered by a strong share price since the country voted to leave the European Union - more premium brands such as Camel which it can sell in countries like Russia and Turkey where demand for Western cigarettes is still growing. The marriage would also unite each company’s efforts in the fast-developing world of e-cigarettes, which the companies say are less dangerous than smoking - a habit that kills about six million people worldwide each year.  BAT shares closed down almost 2.9 percent, while Reynolds was up almost 7 percent in afternoon trading in New York. Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said the BAT decline could be because “the price looks rich to us.”   “Our take is that it is a little bit over valued,” he said.   Moody’s also said Friday it is reviewing BAT’s A3 ratings for a possible downgrade. “Our decision to place BAT’s ratings on review for downgrade recognizes that, while the acquisition will enhance BAT’s business profile, it could lead to a significant deterioration in BAT’s credit metrics,” says Ernesto Bisagno a Moody’s Vice President and lead analyst for BAT. A Reynolds takeover by BAT, which already owns 42 percent of the U.S. group, has long been seen as part of an inevitable wave of global consolidation in a mature industry. Yet the timing, less than three weeks before a U.S. presidential election, was unexpected. “This proposed deal manages to be both entirely expected and a surprise,” Euromonitor analyst Shane MacGuill said.  The completion of last year’s purchase by Reynolds of Lorillard, which gave it the popular Newport brand, and the current relative valuations of the two companies’ shares were the main reasons the deal was resurrected in recent weeks, said three sources close to the situation.  “It moved very quickly on the back of the falling pound,” said one of the sources, who all declined to be named in discussing private matters. A final decision was made this week, they said. A 12 percent rise in BAT’s shares since Britons opted for Brexit in June, and a 7 percent fall for Reynolds, brought the companies’ trading multiples closer together, making a deal more affordable, the sources said.  The move increased the value of the share element of the offer for the U.S. shareholders of Reynolds, even as it made the cash portion more costly for the UK company. But one source likened the deal to simplifying Reynolds’s structure by removing the stake it does not own. “It’s always been on the cards,” he said. After the Brexit vote, shares in BAT soared to all-time highs as investors bet the falling pound would lift the value of overseas revenue. BAT, whose share appreciation is less pronounced in dollar terms, does the vast majority of its  business outside the country. It has over 200 brands in over 200 markets. The pound has lost about a fifth of its value against the dollar since the EU referendum on June 23. With little geographic overlap and therefore limited antitrust issues, this deal is also a lot simpler than another oft-speculated deal - that BAT would take over British rival Imperial Brands (IMB.L), the source added. Imperial shares were up 2 percent on Friday, with one analyst saying a general reignition of consolidation in the industry may be outweighing the fact that BAT is now unlikely to bid for its rival in the near term. Altria Group (MO.N) shares were up 4 percent in New York, boosted by hopes that an enlarged BAT would push Swiss-based market leader Philip Morris International (PM.N) to reunite with the U.S. company. The Marlboro maker split into two in 2008, when the risk of litigation in the United States was seen as a deterrent to foreign companies. Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, acknowledged receipt of the unsolicited offer. This was made public immediately after BAT’s approach to the Reynolds board, as required by U.S. securities regulators in cases where the buyer is a big shareholder.  Reynolds said it would review the offer and respond in due course. The British group said its offer valued Reynolds’s shares at $56.50, of which $24.13 would be in cash and $32.37 would be in BAT shares, representing a premium of 20 percent over the closing price of Reynolds stock on Thursday. On Friday afternoon Reynolds shares, at $53.73, were below the offer price.   Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she expected Reynolds to push for a higher price than the $47 billion BAT is offering for the remaining 57.8 percent of the company. Under the offer, $20 billion would be in cash and $27 billion in BAT shares. One source estimated that BAT valued Reynolds’s shares at 16.3 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), higher than what Reynolds paid for Lorillard. BAT Chief Executive Nicandro Durante, a long-distance runner who hails from Sao Paolo, Brazil, said the deal would create a U.S. market leader and the world’s largest listed tobacco company by net turnover and operating profit. “The strategic rationale makes perfect sense,” Guy Ellison, an analyst at Investec Wealth & Investment, said. He cited a BAT  pivot toward the large U.S. market - whose profit pool is protected by high barriers to entry - and improved scale in vapor products like e-cigarettes, which all big tobacco companies are investing in to offset declines in smoking. BAT said the deal would add to earnings in the first year after closure and estimated cost savings of about $400 million. It is contingent on approval from independent members of the Reynolds board who were not nominated by BAT. The recent strength of BAT’s share price is also due to geopolitical uncertainty leading investors to seek out stable, dividend-yielding stocks like tobacco and other consumer staples.  Shares in Reynolds fell to a 12-month low on Wednesday of $43.38 after its third quarter earnings were 6 percent short of market forecasts, Jefferies analysts said, on the back of a 1.5 percent fall in domestic cigarette volumes.   If successful, the takeover would be one of the biggest this year globally. Including debt, this would be the largest UK outbound M&A; deal this year and the fourth largest of all-time, according to Reuters data. BAT stopped operating in the United States in 2004, when it merged its U.S. subsidiary Brown & Williamson with R.J. Reynolds to form Reynolds American.  Due to a series of high-profile U.S. lawsuits against tobacco firms, the big four have all limited their exposure to the market. Yet several cases have now been settled, which has led analysts to speculate that international players could return. Imperial Brands waded into the U.S. market last year with its $7 billion purchase of certain brands from Reynolds to ease the $25 billion purchase of Lorillard.   Smoking rates in the United States and other western markets are declining due to increasing health consciousness, and greater regulation and taxes. Yet their addictive nature and high profit margins make them a profitable business. BAT is being advised by Centerview, Deutsche Bank and UBS. BAT also said on Friday it had performed well in the first nine months of the year, raising both revenue at constant rates of exchange and cigarette volumes.  Year-to-date revenue grew 8.1 percent at constant rates of exchange, it said, as its biggest brands sold 9.8 percent more cigarettes.

102,MO,Vape companies try to galvanize Trump administration to ease FDA rules,"(Reuters) - As tobacco and vaping companies focus on new smoking products that are potentially less harmful, the industry sees an opening for rolling back rules on these products under the Trump administration. Donald Trump’s surprise election victory in November, and his pledges to reduce federal regulations on business, led tobacco lobby groups to draft a new plan of action, according to company executives, lobbyists and consultants interviewed by Reuters.  The immediate goal is to delay implementation of new regulations on the latest generation of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, which produce a vapor from liquid nicotine rather than burning tobacco.  Longer-term, they are setting their sights on repealing the 2016 law that treats these devices like cigarettes.   Lobbyists describe a cautious optimism as they approach lawmakers with their plans for products that they say can help traditional smokers quit and avoid the known dangers of tobacco. With U.S. sales of conventional cigarettes shrinking, Big Tobacco has made a major bet in recent years to dominate the e-cigarette industry.  On Tuesday, British American Tobacco Plc announced a $49-billion deal to take over rival Reynolds American Inc, uniting two major e-cigarette players in the United States and United Kingdom and becoming a bigger competitor to Philip Morris International Inc and U.S. partner Altria Group. “Suddenly things that were not conceivable became something we thought we could do,” said Cynthia Cabrera, former president and executive director for the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association (SFATA). Cabrera now has her own industry consulting firm, the Cating Group.   In 2009, Congress allowed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to extend its oversight to all tobacco products. New regulations took effect last August that brought e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco in line with existing rules for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. They require companies to submit e-cigarettes and other newer tobacco products for government approval, list their ingredients and place health warnings on packages and in advertisements. Health advocacy groups hailed the regulations as the potential health risks and benefits of e-cigarettes are still being studied.  Industry officials said they would hurt small companies and cripple development. Opponents said the rule was especially unfair because it would apply to any products introduced after Feb. 2007, meaning that most e-cigarettes now on the market would require regulatory review.  On Tuesday, a coalition of 13 organizations, including libertarian-oriented tech groups, asked Congress to grandfather all products introduced by August 2016, when the rules took effect.  “The FDA’s regulations threaten to kill an industry that has created tens of thousands of jobs by producing safer products that help many Americans quit smoking,” the letter to Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma wrote to incoming Vice President Mike Pence this month asking that all FDA deadlines on new tobacco products be delayed by a year as their fate is determined.  Public health advocates say they plan to fight any changes to the Tobacco Control Act, warning that fewer restrictions on e-cigarettes could hook a new generation on nicotine after years of efforts to prevent kids from smoking.   “We know e-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product among kids,” said Erika Sward, assistant vice president, National Advocacy for the American Lung Association, noting the appeal of flavored nicotine liquids used in the devices. BAT makes the popular Vype brand in Europe, while Reynolds owns Vuse, the top selling brand in the United States. They have already collaborated on technology and licensing, but their merger is expected to speed up and simply innovation. “Consumers are looking for alternatives that have the potential to reduce harm,” said Susan M. Cameron, executive chairman of Reynolds American’s board of directors. Philip Morris and Altria aim to launch a promising, new technology called iQOS that heats tobacco but does not burn it, potentially preserving the qualities that smokers want with fewer health risks. The company submitted the product for FDA review in December. “There is a much higher level of hope and a general belief that a new administration would be willing to take a new look and consider a harm reduction rather than abstinence only approach to nicotine,” said Michael Hogan, a lobbyist who represents the vaping industry at the Alpine Group.

110,MO,Fitch Upgrades Altria's Ratings to 'A-' Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Altria Group, Inc.'s (Altria) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and long-term debt ratings to 'A-' from 'BBB+'. Altria's short-term ratings have been affirmed. Altria had approximately $14 billion of total outstanding debt as of Dec. 31, 2016. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The ratings upgrade reflects the fundamental change in the litigation environment, and Fitch's belief the risk for large pay-outs by U.S. tobacco companies has significantly decreased. Altria's ratings are supported by a strong competitive position anchored by its Marlboro brand, good pricing power, expanding margins and large dividends from ABI InBev that results in robust cash flows. These strengths are balanced against secular volume declines, regulatory pressures, litigation risk and large shareholder remuneration. KEY RATING DRIVERS Litigation Risk Has Moderated Fitch believes a fundamental change to litigation risk has occurred due to the settlement and/or dismissal of lawsuits including several class actions during 2016. As a result, Altria does not have a certified class action lawsuit outstanding. Thus, Fitch believes the risk of tobacco litigation court cases leading to major pay-outs by tobacco companies has significantly abated in the US market. Since October 2004, Altria has paid in aggregate judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately $656 million (including interest) as of December 31, 2016. Engle progeny cases have also been materially reduced over time with roughly 2,600 state and federal cases remaining. In nine years of trial for 105 federal and state Engle progeny cases with 58 verdicts returned in favor of plaintiffs, Altria has paid $146 million (including interest). The company, like its competitors, has an experienced legal team that has stretched the resolution period of litigation by effectively using the appellate process. While continuing litigation risk remains above-average, uncertain and challenging, Fitch believes Altria's exposure to litigation is a manageable liability that should continue to diminish over time. Any judgements and settlement payments are expected to be relatively modest in relation to the company's substantial operating cash flows. Leading Market Positions Altria remains the industry leader in the U.S. cigarette market with its Marlboro franchise, and leading positions in moist smokeless tobacco (MST) with its Copenhagen brand and tipped cigars with Black & Mild. PM USA, the company's smokeable tobacco subsidiary, captures slightly more than one-half of the U.S. marketplace given Marlboro's strong brand equity with an approximate 44% share. The company's MST offerings, Copenhagen and Skoal, also hold slightly more than one-half of the domestic MST market on a combined basis and Black & Mild has an approximate 26% share. Altria's business profile is constrained by limited geographic diversification given their reliance on the U.S. market which heightens the company's exposure to a potential shock that could simultaneously affect all of the company's sales. Secular Volume Decline Altria, with approximately one-half of the U.S. cigarette marketplace, has significant exposure to the long-term secular volume declines. Fitch expects cigarette declines will increase to the mid 4% range during 2017 due to regulatory pressures despite a supportive macroeconomic environment. This is due in part to state excise tax increases in large population areas including California, which raised its tax by $2 to $2.87 at the beginning of April 2017, and Pennsylvania, which had increased its tax by $1 to $2.60 during 2016. Additional headwinds come from minimum age increases to 21 during 2016 in several areas including California. Increasing Profitability Driving Earnings Growth Altria's strong profitability benefits from consistent pricing power, reduced variable costs, improving operating efficiency related to productivity initiatives and growth in higher margin MST products that is driving improved operational leverage. Consequently, the strong operating performance has resulted in material margin expansion and earnings growth with EBITDA margins increasing by 360 basis points during the past two years to 47.5%. Fitch expects continued margin expansion to the 50% range by 2018. Altria's product portfolio is somewhat diversified with leading MST brands, various smoking alternatives and premium wine offerings. However, the smokeable tobacco business still generates around 86 to 87% of revenues and operating income respectively despite the broader offering. Within the smokeable segment, Altria has achieved at least modest sales growth in most years through strong digital capabilities, biannual price increases on key brands and innovation to brand architecture. RRPs Growth Potential Fitch sees Altria as well-positioned through its licensing agreement with Philip Morris International (PMI) in reduced risk products (RRPs) like iQOS. These products can deliver nicotine with reduced health risks compared to cigarettes and represent a smoking experience similar to that of traditional cigarettes. PMI filed its Premarket Tobacco Product Application with the FDA at the end of the first quarter that could enable commercialization of iQOS in the U.S. by late 2017 or early 2018. Fitch believe RRPs like iQOS could give Altria a material competitive advantage to win further market share and represents a powerful tool with protecting itself in the event of an accelerated rate of decline with demand for traditional tobacco products. Heavy Shareholder Returns Manageable Fitch expects Altria to maintain its shareholder-friendly posture through the ratings horizon, which includes dividend pay-outs around 80% (of adjusted EPS) supplemented with active share repurchasing. The company gains flexibility for heavy shareholder returns from limited acquisition opportunities and light capital spending. Altria increases its dividend yearly by 8% to 9% (currently topping $4 billion) and generally spends around $1 billion for share repurchases that is determined annually. Fitch sees the strategy as manageable at current cash flows and with leverage (total debt to EBITDA) consistently sustained well below 2x. Capital Structure Well Managed Altria has worked down $8.3 billion of high coupon notes (due in 2018, 2019, 2038, and 2039) issued for the U.S. Tobacco (UST) acquisition in 2009. Since 2012, the company re-financed and tendered for nearly $6 billion of the expensive debt, leaving a balance of approximately $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. As such, Altria's weighted average interest rate on its debt, all fixed rate, decreased to 4.9% in 2016 from 8.3% in 2011. Total debt was $14 billion at the end of 2016 with gross debt leverage of 1.4x. Fitch expects leverage will remain relatively consistent in the mid-1x range over the next few years, as the company maintains financial discipline while benefiting from strong operational performance. Altria's next significant long-term debt maturity is the balance of 9.7% unsecured notes ($863.6 million) due in November 2018. Variation in Criteria Fitch's special report titled Tobacco Companies - Ratings Navigator Companion, dated February 6, 2015, indicates that ratings for U.S. domestic-only companies are capped at 'BBB+'. This criteria variation recognizes that Fitch no longer believes a cap is appropriate given the fundamental change in litigation risk as discussed in the above commentary. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer in 2017 and 2018 include: --Consolidated revenue increases by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of between 1%-2% as cigarette volume declines revert closer to historical levels in the 4% range after moderating in 2015 and 2016. --Consolidated EBITDA and EBITDA margin approximately of $9.6 billion and 49%, respectively in 2017, growing to $10 billion and 50% in 2018; --Total debt to EBITDA of approximately 1.4x; --Free cash flow (FCF; operating cash flow, less CAPEX and dividends) in the range of $600 million to $700 million (approximate 3.5% margin) annually reflecting annual increases to dividends and capital intensity maintained around 1%; --Share repurchases of at least $2 billion in 2017; declining to the $1 billion range in 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: -- A further lessening of litigation risk; -- Mitigation of negative industry factors with an emphasis on the slowing or reversal of secular volume declines due to successful commercialization of reduced risk products; -- Leverage sustained below 1.5x; -- FCF margin sustained above 4%, reflecting a stable operating environment and relatively consistent shareholder remuneration policies; -- FFO fixed charge coverage above 6.0x. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating include: -- A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, share repurchases and M&A; causing leverage to be sustained above 2x (2017E: 1.4x); -- Substantial reversal in litigation environment, leading to expectations for an excessively large judgement; -- An unexpected adverse change in regulatory environment that significantly accelerates volume declines; -- A deterioration of operating profile due to pressure on organic profit, resulting from weak pricing power, volume declines and lack of cost realization, leading to FCF margin falling below 3% on a sustained basis; (2017E: 3.5% to 4%); -- FFO fixed charge cover sustained less than 5.0x (2017E: 8.8x). LIQUIDITY Liquidity remains solid at Dec. 31, 2016, with cash of $4.6 billion and full availability under a $3 billion five-year revolver due August 2020. Fitch expects cash balances will decrease as Altria returns a significant amount of cash to shareholders in 2017. Internal liquidity is provided by strong operating cash flows that have historically increased annually and were $3.8 billion in 2016, versus $5.8 billion in 2015 and $4.7 billion in 2014. Lower operating cash flows were due to the exceptionally high cash taxes associated with the cash received following the merger of SAB Miller with AB InBev and a $500 million pension contribution. Fitch expects operating cash flows will return to previous levels in 2017. Excess liquidity is important given Altria's annual payment to the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) of approximately $4 billion each April. Altria's liquidity is further supported by the company's 10.2% share of AB InBev, which has a total market capitalization of approximately EUR175 billion and expected to provide annual dividends to Altria in the range of $700 million to $800 million. In October 2016, Altria expanded its share repurchase program to $3 billion from $1 billion authorized. During 2016, Altria repurchased $1 billion in shares and had $1.9 billion remaining under the program. Altria has indicated publicly that the company expects to complete the share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Given the excess cash, current leverage and depending on market conditions, Fitch anticipates that Altria could complete the program during 2017.

115,MO,Altria August dividend trade alive despite U.S. nicotine proposal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. proposal to slash nicotine levels in cigarettes may have smoked some investors out of Altria Group Inc (MO.N), whose Marlboro line is the top-selling U.S. brand, but long-term stockholders are staying put after decades of dividend hikes in August. Altria, informally known as “Big Mo” before its split from Phillip Morris International Inc (PM.N) in 2008, fell as much as 12 percent after the Federal Drug Administration on July 28 proposed cutting nicotine in cigarettes to “non-addictive” levels to encourage a shift to potentially less harmful e-cigarettes.  Fund managers have said that might cut into cigarette sales, but tobacco companies have enough pricing power to weather declines and keep paying well-above market dividends. That means Altria's dividend, which has been raised every August since at least 1981, continues to look safe. Its shares are up 1.6 percent since the start of August, compared with a 0.4 percent gain in the benchmark S&P; 500 index .SPX. “When you project out earnings in the future, even with a hit from the FDA policy, you can see that the dividend is well covered for years to come,” said Gary Bradshaw, a fund manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, which holds Phillip Morris shares. The dividend increases have helped Altria shares rise an average of 3.3 percent every August since 1981, according to Reuters data, compared with a 0.8 percent gain for the S&P; 500. Overall, gains in that month have accounted for roughly one-quarter of the stock’s 14.3 percent annualized price return since August 1981. Altria pays a dividend yield of 3.7 percent, compared with Phillip Morris’ 3.6 percent and the S&P; 500’s 2.3 percent.  “It seems clear that uncertainty is back and, with that, some level of overhang on valuations in the near term,” Bonnie Herzog, a Wells Fargo analyst, wrote in an analyst note. That could boost the chances of Philip Morris acquiring Altria, she added. Altria trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.7, near its 52-week low. But Philip Morris, a leader in e-cigarette technology, has a multiple of 25.6, near its 52-week high. While tobacco stock prices are expected to hit a ceiling over the next few years, their dividends are unlikely to be cut because any FDA proposals could take years to implement, Herzog said. “In our minds, the biggest risk is that the stock could be range bound near-term but long-term investors can get paid to wait,” she said.

117,MO,Altria ups dividend despite U.S. nicotine proposal hit to shares,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tobacco company Altria Group Inc (MO.N) raised its dividend by 8.2 percent on Thursday, signaling the company did not expect a U.S. government proposal to reduce nicotine in cigarettes to threaten its ability to make the payment to shareholders. The increase, which was widely anticipated by investors, came as tobacco stocks remained well below where they stood on July 28 before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed cutting nicotine in cigarettes to “non-addictive” levels to encourage a shift to potentially less harmful e-cigarettes. Shares of Altria are down 13.8 percent since then, while those of Phillip Morris International Inc (PM.N), which has a larger e-cigarette business, have lost roughly 4 percent over the same time.  Altria stock was flat in afternoon trading Thursday, while the broad S&P; 500 fell 0.1 percent.  The dividend increase pushes its yield up to approximately 4 percent, a level nearly double the S&P; 500’s yield of 2.3 percent.  Analysts have pointed to Altria’s history of raising its dividend in August as a reason to buy its shares.  “We believe the recent dramatic pullback in Altria’s stock makes a compelling argument for the board to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders,” noted Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo.  Herzog expected the company to raise its dividend by 9 percent in 2018 and has a price target of $80 on its shares, a roughly 25 percent increase from its current trading price of $63.69.  Annual dividend increases have helped Altria shares rise an average of 3.3 percent every August since 1981, according to Reuters data, compared with a 0.8 percent gain for the S&P; 500. Overall, gains in that month have accounted for roughly one-quarter of the stock’s 14.3 percent annualized price return since August 1981.

122,MO,UPDATE 1-Japan Tobacco's new CEO lights up Imperial with M&A; talk,"TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) sparked takeover speculation on Tuesday by naming a new chief executive who wants the world’s third-largest international tobacco maker to do more overseas acquisitions to offset falling cigarette sales at home. Shares in British tobacco company Imperial Brands (IMB.L), long seen as a likely target, rose as much as 4 percent after Masamichi Terabatake, the CEO-designate, told reporters: “If there are good deals, we would like to actively pursue them”. Terabatake, who has a background in deal-making, said after his promotion was announced that he was willing to take risks, adding that the scale of acquisitions “does not matter”. Two big issues facing Japan Tobacco are a geographic footprint too concentrated in low-growth markets Japan and Europe and competitive weakness in vaping. Buying Imperial would help both issues, analysts at Jefferies have long argued.   Terabatake, who will replace Mitsuomi Koizumi in January, is currently deputy CEO at JT International, the Geneva-based headquarters of the company’s overseas operations, where he has spent more than a decade. The 51-year-old, who worked on Japan Tobacco’s $7.8 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco’s non-US tobacco business in 1999, did not give any details of possible targets but said: “There are still many regions we have not entered. There are many markets left for cigarette business to grow.”  Consolidation is widely expected in a global tobacco market that is shrinking as more people quit. British American Tobacco’s (BATS.L) July purchase of Reynolds American ignited expectations that a takeover of Imperial or Altria (MO.N) could follow, as Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris International (PM.N) seek to bolster their position against a newly enlarged rival.  Imperial’s shares had fallen 23 percent since April on concerns about its competitive position and lack of a vaping device that heats tobacco without burning it. It was trading at less than 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), whereas BAT, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco are at between 15 and 20 times EBITDA. That discount, and Japan Tobacco’s troubles, have some sources seeing a deal as more likely, though huge market overlap, such as in Britain, makes a takeover complicated.  Sources have suggested that Japan Tobacco and British American could split up Imperial, but warn that BAT may still be digesting its $49 billion purchase of Reynolds. A spokesman for Imperial, the maker of the Davidoff and Golden Virginia brands, declined to comment  Japan Tobacco’s domestic cigarette sales have been hurt by more smokers quitting than expected and the popularity of heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco vaping devices.  It has forecast 92 billion cigarette sales in Japan for 2017, down 13.4 percent from a year ago. That would be 1 billion less than what it had projected in August and 4 billion below an estimate given at the start of year.  Despite commanding more than 60 percent of Japan’s cigarette market, the former state monopoly has ceded some of its home turf to Philip Morris, which launched its IQOS HNB product in Japan in 2014 and expanded nationwide in April last year. Japan Tobacco rolled out its Ploom Tech smokeless tobacco product in central Tokyo in July after production delays.  Terabatake said it was still too early for any company to solidify its lead in this category.  “(The) tobacco vapour war has just begun,” he said.

The U.S. House of Representatives approved the tax legislation in an afternoon vote. The Senate was expected to vote on the tax bill this evening. Republicans were confident of the bill being signed into law by the end of the week. Stocks added to losses after the vote, which followed weeks of market gains on optimism that tax cuts would boost U.S. earnings and the economy. Some investors also said that much of those benefits were already reflected in stock prices. The S&P; 500 has climbed about 5 percent since mid-November when the House passed its tax overhaul bill. “The tax rate we’ve certainly priced in (in stocks),” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. Investors may also be “celebrating the tax package but recognizing that what central banks have given us in the last years they could begin to take away.” The bill, among other things, proposes lowering corporate tax rates to 21 percent from 35 percent, which investors are betting will boost profits as well as trigger share buybacks and higher dividend payouts. The S&P; 500 technology sector fell 0.5 percent, with tech stocks weighing the most on the major indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.45 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,754.75, the S&P; 500 lost 8.69 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,681.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.91 points, or 0.44 percent, to 6,963.85.

126,MO,Philip Morris' search for a cigarette no more harmful than a cup of coffee,"NEUCHATEL, Switzerland, Dec 20 (Reuters) - When Hans-Joerg Urban joined Philip Morris International Inc’s research headquarters as a scientist in 2005, he said a senior executive laid out the tobacco giant’s vision for the future: to create cigarettes no more harmful than a simple cup of coffee. About a decade later that quest culminated in the iQOS, a device that heats tobacco but does not burn it. Philip Morris says the lack of combustion means smokers are exposed to far lower levels of toxic emissions than with regular cigarettes. “The ultimate result of this is reduced tobacco related harm and diseases,” the company said in a statement. The world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market iQOS as less harmful than cigarettes. But four scientists and researchers who worked for the company on the iQOS program told Reuters that while Philip Morris was able to prove the lower amounts of exposure to harmful substances, that doesn’t necessarily mean that using the device is less likely to result in disease than regular cigarettes. “Exposure is not directly linked to the risk of having a disease,” said Urban, a scientist who worked at Philip Morris until 2010 analyzing data from clinical and laboratory experiments. “The diseases are much too complicated.” Dorothy Hatsukami, a former member of the FDA’s tobacco products scientific advisory committee, agrees. “At this point, research is still too nascent to say with certainty that reduced exposure translates into reduced risk,” she said. Philip Morris is seeking FDA approval to market iQOS under two different standards. It has applied for approval as a device that reduces exposure to harmful substances. It has also applied on a second track with a higher bar – to get approval to market it as carrying reduced risk of tobacco-related disease. The first option, a special provision for companies that are unable to meet the threshold of reduced risk, comes with a restriction. Consumers cannot be “misled into believing” the product is less harmful than other tobacco products, FDA regulations say. If the FDA approves the application, that would raise the possibility of Philip Morris International’s former parent company and U.S. partner, Altria Group Inc, capturing market share in a nation where overall cigarette sales plummeted more than 30 percent between 2005 and 2016. Kishor Lad, a clinical data manager at the company between 2012 and 2015, said to prove the product presents less risk of tobacco-related disease, the company would need to conduct large clinical trials over several years to show that people who used iQOS lived longer than people who smoked cigarettes. Philip Morris said it disagrees. Under U.S. regulations, the company said, the FDA “does not require premarket epidemiological data as a condition of marketing authorization.” Lad added that it’s not correct to say that “if you’re less exposed to these harmful substances then, sort of, it’s less harmful for you.” ",12202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/tobacco-iqos-science-risk/philip-morris-search-for-a-cigarette-no-more-harmful-than-a-cup-of-coffee-idUSL1N1OK0C0
127,MO,FDA's tobacco stance faces test with Philip Morris iQOS device,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a decision expected to test the Trump administration’s approach to tobacco regulation, U.S. health advisers will vote this week on whether to allow Philip Morris International Inc to claim its novel iQOS tobacco device is less harmful than cigarettes. IQOS is designed to heat tobacco but not burn it, and comes in a sleek package that would not look out of place in an Apple store. Most of the harmful chemicals in tobacco are released when tobacco is burned, forming the basis of Philip Morris’s claim of a less-risky product.  If cleared, iQOS would become the first product to carry a modified-risk claim and could advance the Food and Drug Administration’s proposed new approach to reduce the dangers of smoking by creating a market for less harmful products than cigarettes. On Monday, the FDA said its review of iQOS found that the product contains lower levels of toxic chemicals than cigarettes, but could not say whether that translates into lower rates of tobacco-related disease.    Medical and other expert advisors to the FDA will discuss the product on Wednesday and Thursday and recommend whether it should be cleared as a so-called “modified risk” tobacco product. The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its outside advisers but typically does. Tobacco experts said the FDA documents do not show a clear point of view by the agency reviewers. “It’s a complex document with lots of data and findings that could be used by proponents on either side,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. Philip Morris’s shares fell 0.1 percent to $108.80 in afternoon trading in New York. Last month, a Reuters investigation described irregularities in the clinical trials that supported Philip Morris's iQOS application to the FDA. here here (For a graphic on market share of novel tobacco and vapor products, see: (tmsnrt.rs/2DQ7cIH) For decades, U.S. health agencies have worked to help Americans quit cigarettes to avoid the risks of lung cancer and other disease. National smoking rates have declined to near historic lows of around 15 percent.      But in July, newly appointed FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb proposed reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes to “non-addictive” levels while increasing development of lower-risk alternatives. The policy assumes that some percentage of the population will be unable or unwilling to give up nicotine.     To make the new strategy succeed, the agency needs a stable of vetted, reduced-risk alternatives to cigarettes. Philip Morris is one of the few companies that can finance such a long  development process, spending close to $3 billion on reduced-risk products.     “If this application fails, it will be clear that this is an expensive, wasteful, regulatory dead end,” said Clive Bates, a tobacco expert who runs the consulting firm Counterfactual and advocates for alternative nicotine products.  Bates and others argue that if Philip Morris cannot win FDA clearance for a modified-risk product, no one will be able to.     Other companies have submitted modified-risk products for FDA review. 22nd Century Group Inc, which genetically engineers tobacco plants to have lower nicotine levels, seeks clearance for its “Brand A” very low nicotine cigarettes.  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, owned by British American Tobacco Plc, seeks clearance for six snus products - a moist smokeless tobacco pouch placed under the lip - under the Camel brand.  IQOS is already used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the United States.  It consists of a small pen-like holder containing a heated tobacco stick, and a charger. It looks similar to an e-cigarette, but uses real tobacco rather than nicotine-laced liquid.  Philip Morris says that iQOS contains up to 95 percent fewer harmful or potentially harmful chemicals than the cigarette smoke produced from burning tobacco. If approved, the product would be marketed by U.S. partner Altria Group Inc.     The hurdles for success are high.     To sell a new tobacco product, a company must demonstrate that it significantly reduces the risk of disease and does not encourage more smoking or delay quitting.  To date, the FDA has determined that only eight products meet that standard, all of them snus smokeless tobacco pouches made by Swedish Match AB. The agency has granted no company the right to specifically claim that their product is less risky than cigarettes.     Tobacco control activists say companies like Philip Morris cannot be trusted to make reduced-risk claims. They point to the industry’s previous promotion of “light” and “low-tar” cigarettes as safer alternatives despite evidence showing they were not.     Others argue that things have changed. Since 2009, the tobacco industry has had to answer to the FDA under federal law. New technology, including e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products, may help smokers quit or shift those who cannot quit onto a less harmful substitute, they say.     “Many of my friends in the tobacco control movement are still fighting the tobacco wars of the 1980s,” said Scott Ballin, an independent health policy consultant and long-time anti-tobacco activist. “We are beyond that now.”     The FDA’s Gottlieb favors an approach to treating addiction that makes available less harmful versions of addictive substances, including nicotine and opioids. These products, he argues, can help minimize damage to those unable to quit. Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA’s tobacco division, refers frequently to a “continuum of risk” for nicotine products, with nicotine gums and lozenges on one end and cigarettes on the other. The FDA would like to shift smokers unable to quit nicotine from high-risk to low-risk products.     “What we have developed is an offering on the continuum of risk,” said Ruth Dempsey, Philip Morris’ director of scientific engagement. “We believe it is better than cigarettes.” ",1222018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-tobacco-pmi/fdas-tobacco-stance-faces-test-with-philip-morris-iqos-device-idUSKBN1FB0J2

129,MO,UPDATE 2-U.S. FDA releases initial review of Philip Morris' iQOS device,"(Adds analyst comment, background) By Toni Clarke Jan 22 (Reuters) - An electronic product made by Philip Morris International Inc that heats rather than burns tobacco contains lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than cigarettes, a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded on Monday. Laboratory data showed that the aerosol produced by the product, iQOS, can damage cells and affect human tissue, but that the effects “are generally less severe and observed at much higher concentrations,” compared to cigarette smoke. The reviewers said full results from a pending study would provide more information about the carcinogenic potential of iQOS, but the results are not expected to become available until later this year. The review comes two days before a meeting of outside advisors to the FDA who will discuss the product and recommend whether it should be allowed on the market. The panel will also decide whether the company should be allowed to claim iQOS is less harmful than cigarettes. The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisors, but typically does. Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said the hurdle is high, but she believes the company’s application “has a decent chance of prevailing.” That is in part because the FDA under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has committed to a tobacco policy that relies on the availability of reduced-risk products to help smokers obtain nicotine in a less damaging form. The FDA’s plan, announced last year, “signals its seriousness with regard to supporting the development of a viable market of FDA-approved reduced-risk product alternatives to combustible cigarettes,” Herzog said in a research note In order to be authorized at all, Switzerland-based Philip Morris and its partner Altria Group Inc must show that the iQOS is “appropriate for the protection of public health,” meaning any benefit to an individual smoker cannot come at the expense of added danger to the population as a whole. In theory, the agency could allow the product on the market, but not permit the company to specifically market it as less dangerous. Philip Morris hopes to claim iQOS is less risky or less harmful than cigarettes. Failing that the company would like to claim that the product reduces a smoker’s exposure to harmful compounds compared with cigarettes, a potentially easier hurdle to clear. The FDA found in its review that by some respiratory and cardiovascular measures, iQOS aerosol exposure produced less damage than cigarette smoke. The reviewers also noted there was little difference seen in the development of certain potentially pre-cancerous lesions in the respiratory tract. Overall, data from the nonclinical studies suggest that iQOS aerosol has lower toxic potential than cigarette smoke under the conditions used in the tests and for the non-cancer conditions measured. But they said it is “unclear how the effects observed in treatment groups exposed to iQOS aerosols translate to a potential risk reduction for noncancer-related effects when chronically used by humans.” ",1222018,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-tobacco-pmi/update-2-u-s-fda-releases-initial-review-of-philip-morris-iqos-device-idUSL2N1PH0SR
130,MO,U.S. health advisers weigh risks of novel Philip Morris tobacco device,"WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. health advisers on Wednesday began to consider whether Philip Morris International Inc should be allowed to claim its novel electronic tobacco product is less harmful than cigarettes, potentially making it the first such device to carry a reduced risk claim. The panel of tobacco and public health experts, convened by the Food and Drug Administration, will vote on Thursday on whether data provided by the company supports one of three potential claims that would be used on the product’s label and in marketing. The vote is not binding but will influence the FDA’s decision. Its iQOS device heats actual tobacco rather than burns it. Most toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke are produced when tobacco combusts. Other electronic devices usual a nicotine-laced liquid. A positive vote from the panel could move more U.S. smokers away from cigarettes to electronic alternatives. The panel discussion comes amid an intense debate over whether electronic cigarettes can help reduce smoking-related disease and death. FDA staff this week said that iQOS contains fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes but that it was unclear whether reduced exposure translates into reduced risk of disease. Results from an 18-month toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice is expected by the end of June. Some of the data is included in the company’s application. Full results of the study could shed additional light on any potential cancer risk, the FDA said. (For a Reuters investigation on Philip Morris's clinical trials of iQOS, see here here) The advisory panel will decide whether the company can say iQOS “can reduce the risks of tobacco-related diseases” or it “presents less risk of harm than continuing to smoke cigarettes.” These would be the hardest-to-prove claims. A third option would state that iQOS “significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.” Manuel Peitsch, the company’s chief scientific officer, told the committee on Wednesday that “iQOS emits toxicants and is not risk free,” he said. “Nevertheless, iQOS emits significantly lower levels of toxicants than cigarettes.” Taken together, he said, “these results show that switching to iQOS can reduce the risk of tobacco-related disease.” On Tuesday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, summarizing data from hundreds of scientific studies, said e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes and help smokers quit. But the report also found “substantial evidence” that youths who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try traditional cigarettes. The National Academies’ report said the overall long-term public health impact of e-cigarettes remained unclear. The FDA is expected to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. It will decide separately whether to authorize the modified risk claims. If cleared, iQOS would be sold in the United States by Philip Morris’ partner Altria Group Inc.

134,MO,Altria could grow earnings at double-digit pace through 2020: Barron's,"(Reuters) - Altria Group Inc (MO.N), best known as the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, could grow earnings at a double-digit yearly pace through 2020, according to an analyst in a Barron’s article on Sunday. Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo Securities predicts the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve Philip Morris’ IQOS (I-Quit-Ordinary Smoking), a system that heats tobacco cigarettes rather than burns them, as soon as this year. Like vaping, IQOS is said to offer reduced risks compared to smoking, while better matching the cigarette experience, according to the article. Herzog has a price target of $85 on Altria, which would be up about 30 percent from recent levels. The stock closed at $65.65 on Friday.
