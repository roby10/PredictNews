In recent days, Moody’s Investors Service gave OneMain a lower preliminary credit rating than what the U.S. bank had been expecting, making it more expensive to finance a deal, according to a source familiar with the situation on Wednesday.   Citigroup redid the capital and deal structure it had been working on for months following the unexpected blow, and decided to retain $3 billion of OneMain loans, the source said.   Citigroup is now in exclusive negotiations with Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC and Leucadia National Corp, three sources said.   Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has also joined that group, according to the Wall Street Journal.   Citigroup has been insisting on getting book value for the unit, the sources said, but the prospective buyer could resist that demand.   “I just find it hard to believe that they will ultimately wind up getting the price they expect because the funding has gotten so much more expensive,” one of the sources said.   The setback from Moody’s comes on top of concessions to potential buyers that Citigroup had made earlier and highlights how hard the third-largest U.S. bank will have to work to shed the $337 billion of problem assets on its balance sheet.   Some investors fear that as Citigroup sells what it can from Citi Holdings — the unit that holds those assets — it could be left holding many of the toxic loans that it’s trying to shed.   OneMain, which was previously known as CitiFinancial, has a book value of about $2 billion and initially came with roughly $13 billion of assets.   The $3 billion in loans that Citigroup is retaining now add to billions of dollars of OneMain assets it had decided to keep before starting the auction.   Any buyer would have to find ways to fund OneMain’s assets through various types of debt and equity.   Now the presence of Buffett, one of the world’s richest men, could prove to be key in the bidding group’s ability to do the deal.   “Financing is the most complex part of it,” the source said. “If you got Warren Buffett, there is only one guy who has to make a decision about putting money into the company.”   Still, the source added that any buyer would likely want Citigroup to provide some credit support for an extended period of time.   In March, sources said Citigroup was offering partial financing and was open to also retaining a stake in the consumer finance business. [ID:nN08101968]   Citigroup and Centerbridge declined to comment. Berkshire Hathaway, Leucadia and Moody’s did not respond immediately to a request for comment.   Citigroup considers its target retail customers to be wealthy people globally, while OneMain focuses on lower-income borrowers through its network of 1,300 branches in the United States.   But buyout shops have been eyeing U.S. consumer finance assets, looking to take advantage of a shrinking supply of consumer loans to people with credit problems as firms like Citigroup exit the market.   OneMain’s auction initially attracted a Who’s Who of private equity firms, but the field narrowed as Citigroup’s insistence on being paid book and the huge financing hurdle proved to be too much for many firms to overcome, sources have said previously.

3,AIG,DEALTALK-China financials pressured as lock-ups expire on $35bln in stock," HONG KONG, July 8 (Reuters) - Chinese financials face mounting pressure in the coming weeks as lock-up periods on an estimated $35 billion worth of stock expire, potentially unleashing a flood of shares into a market wary of swelling bad debts and slowing growth.    	   The success of such large block sales from cornerstone investors will hinge largely on timing of the sale, especially given the volume of stock coming out of expiry from just one sector.      	   Among the big block of shares that could potentially hit the market include $6 billion worth of Agricultural Bank of China  , about $7.7 billion of insurer AIA Group Ltd  and some $2.6 billion in China Pacific Insurance Group Ltd  from Carlyle Group .	    “It will be a hard sell given the negative sentiment for Chinese bank stocks,” said Mike Werner, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. 	   The sales overhang are putting further pressure on financial stocks which have already been underperforming the broader market this year, partly on concerns of slowing loan growth and mounting worries about bad debts. 	   The Hang Seng Composite Index of 13 financial companies  is down 5 percent on the year, underperforming 1.1 percent fall in the broader market , pushing valuations close to the troughs last seen during the financial crisis of 2008.    	   On average, Chinese bank shares have underperformed 8.5 percent their peers in the four weeks leading up to the lock-up expiry, according to Werner’s calculations.	   For cornerstone investors, the dilemma is whether to take some money off the table or hang in there to see if the underperforming bank stocks will rebound. Inevitably, a potential hangover will keep the pressure on stocks.    	  Cornerstone investors commit to investing in an initial public offering before its price determined but they get firm allotment and in exchange they agree to a lockup - usually six to 12 months. The dominance of mutual funds in the U.S. and European IPO markets precludes the need for cornerstones there, so this kind of early investor is unique to Asia.    	   Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings this week underscored the importance of moving quick and first by selling $3.6 billion of shares in China Construction Bank (CCB)  and Bank of China , outmaneuvering other large investors in the process. 	   Its move may have stymied plans by Bank of America Corp  , which is widely expected to sell at least part of its $22 billion holding in CCB and might have been looking at the Singapore state fund as a possible buyer of the stake.    	   BofA’s lock-up in CCB shares expire in August end, while some cornerstone investors in AgBank will be free to sell their holdings on July 15. A BofA spokeswoman declined to comment on its shareholding in CCB.	   Other foreign banks have sold their IPO and pre-IPO stakes in Chinese lenders over the past two-and-half years. Goldman Sachs has partly exited from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , while UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland sold their holdings in Bank of China.	   The prospects of massive block deals have spurred the  equity capital market desks of investment banks into action, as they scramble to win the next big deal.	   “Now is a great opportunity,” said a banker whose firm participated in several large block sales in Hong Kong in recent months. “There will be a large supply of IPO paper and other selldowns in the second half, so the ability to get the best pricing may not be that good.”	  The question is whether big sovereign wealth funds, such as Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, hang in the for stocks to rebound. 	   “The expiration of the lock-ups will create a lot of uncertainty in many of those shares,” said Adrian Lim, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management’s Asia Pacific ex-Japan. “The natural reaction is that the share prices will fall, but that’s more of a short term thing,” he added.	   But bankers pitching for such block deals are confident that the market can absorb more sales. They cite the sector’s cheap valuation as a strong reason to buy the stocks. To top it, most block deals are offered at 4-5 percent discount to the market price, making the purchase more attractive, they argue.	    BofA’s potential sale of CCB stake is of particular concern for investors as reflected by a 10 percent fall in the stock this year. That makes it the worst performing bank stock this year among China’s top four lenders.	   CCB now trades at 7.1 times forward earnings, a 43 percent discount to its historical levels. 	   Even at such depressed levels, any sale would represent a healthy return for BofA, which paid just $3 billion for its entire holding in 2005.	   Investors are betting that BofA will sell part of its holding to boost its core capital. Cornerstone investors in banks and insurers have no such compulsions, though the worry for them is the deteriorating macro economic environment in China. Moody’s last week threatened to cut Chinese banks’ ratings amid worries about their exposure to local government debt. 	   Given all that, a 23 percent rise in AgBank’s Hong Kong shares since listing and a 43 percent surge in insurer AIA could tempt some investors to book profits. But institutions deciding to pare exposure will have to make a quick decision.

5,AIG,Greenberg's Starr buys into Chinese insurer Dazhong," SHANGHAI, July 11 (Reuters) - Starr International Company Inc, an insurance holding company run by former AIG  chief Maurice Greenberg has formed a strategic partnership with a Chinese insurer backed by the city government of Shanghai, the companies said on Monday.	   The partnership, under which Starr has bought a 20 percent stake in state-controlled Dazhong Insurance, brought New York-based Starr back to its roots in China nearly a century after its creation.	   Starr was invited by the Shanghai government to invest in the Chinese property and casualty insurer, Greenberg said at a signing ceremony in Shanghai on Monday.	   “It was Mayor Han’s idea that Starr should invest in Dazhong. It was two years ago,” said Greenberg, referring to Han Zheng, Shanghai’s mayor who was also at the signing ceremony.	   “I am confident about the future of Dazhong, we have good management,” Greenberg, 85, said.	   Shanghai wants to develop its insurance industry as part of efforts to transform itself to become a global financial centre in the next decade.	   The insurance sector is also key to the Chinese city’s ambition of becoming an international shipping hub.	   Insurance entrepreneur Cornelius Vander Starr founded C.V. Starr & Co, the global investment holding company, in 1919 in Shanghai.	   Greenberg, who joined C.V. Starr & Co in 1960, is Chairman and CEO of the investment firm.	   Greenberg retired as Chairman and CEO of AIG in 2005, after serving as CEO since 1967.	   In May, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) approved Starr’s acquisition of a 20 percent stake in Dazhong Insurance.	   Dazhong Insurance was selling 286.5 million shares to Starr International, the CIRC said in a May 17 statement on its website. The transaction value was not revealed.	   Dazhong Insurance, whose major shareholders are mainly state-owned enterprises, operates primarily in the Yangtze River Delta and has eight branches in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Suzhou, Ningbo, Qingdao and Fujian, the Chinese company said.	   The Dazhong Insurance deal came just months after an earlier investment in a U.S.-listed Chinese company by Starr turned sour.	   Starr Investments sued China MediaExpress Holdings  , a television advertising operator on inter-city and airport express buses in China, saying it was fraudulently induced to invest about $13.5 million in the firm, according to court documents.

7,AIG,"S&P; says Dodd-Frank doesn't end ""too big to fail"""," * Dodd-Frank includes power to dismantle financial firms   * Power designed to remove idea some firms too big to fail   * S&P says extraordinary government support still possible   WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - The Dodd-Frank financial oversight law has not ended “too big to fail,” and the U.S. government still may step in to save a toppling financial giant during the next crisis, Standard & Poor’s said in a report on Tuesday.   The rating agency’s report acknowledges policymakers’ desire to make clear that the government in the future will not step in to bail out big financial firms.   But S&P says the government’s long track record of finding ways to prop up critical financial firms trumps the intentions of the legislative framework.   “We believe that under certain circumstances and with selected systemically important financial institutions, future extraordinary government support is still possible,” the report says.   Last year’s Dodd-Frank law gives regulators the power to seize a large financial firm that is headed for disaster and dismantle it in a way that is less disruptive than either taxpayer bailouts or bankruptcy.   The crisis that peaked in the fall of 2008 pushed some of the most storied financial firms to the brink of collapse. Some, such as AIG (AIG.N), were bailed out by the government; others, such as Lehman Brothers, were not and went bankrupt.   So far, markets have been skeptical that this new so-called Orderly Liquidation Authority will ever be invoked, and even if it is, its detractors say that it will not work as intended.   Proponents led by recently departed Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair got a boost last month from Moody’s Investors Service.   In a June 2 report, Moody’s said it may downgrade the debt ratings of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), citing concerns about waning U.S. political willingness to offer support for the largest banks.   S&P, however, said on Tuesday that in the face of an unpredictable financial crisis, the liquidation authority may not work, and government may step in with support.   “Ultimately, in our views of new legislation and regulation, we need to consider the long track-record of extraordinary support that may be essential for a handful of institutions despite government reluctance to offer such support,” S&P said.

8,AIG,"UPDATE 3-Hartford warns after disasters, asbestos losses"," * Expects to break even excluding items   * Hurt like other insurers by natural disasters   * Shares fall 2 pct after-hours  (Adds bailout details)   NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG.N) on Wednesday warned it will badly miss second-quarter expectations after severe losses on natural disasters and a charge to increase its asbestos reserves.   Hartford, one of three insurers to receive a government bailout during the financial crisis, also said it would take a charge in the quarter for the previously disclosed sale of the bank it had to buy in order to get that rescue.   The Hartford, one of the oldest companies in America, said it expects net earnings of 3 cents per share, or break-even per share excluding realized gains and discontinued operations.   Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected the company to earn 72 cents per share in the quarter. The company will report full second-quarter results on Aug. 3.   The Hartford, like other property insurers hit badly by severe U.S. tornadoes in April and May, said it would take $447 million in pretax catastrophe losses. In addition, it will take another $290 million charge pretax to increase its reserves for asbestos-related losses.   The company said it saw more and larger claims for mesothelioma, an asbestos-linked cancer, than it had expected. Earlier this year AIG (AIG.N), another bailed-out insurer, also increased its asbestos reserves.   Besides the disaster and asbestos costs, The Hartford said it would take a $73 million write-off on a canceled software project and a $74 million charge for the sale of Federal Trust Corp, the bank holding company it bought in 2009 in order to qualify for TARP funding.   The insurer received $3.4 billion in aid during the financial crisis, which it subsequently repaid.   Shares of the Hartford, Connecticut-based insurer fell 2 percent in trading after the bell. They closed at $25.60 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

9,AIG,UPDATE 2-Validus tops Allied World's bid for Transatlantic," * Validus offers $3.50 billion in cash and stock   * Offer is a 14 pct premium   * Validus CEO says willing to go hostile if needed  (Adds background, details from Validus letter to Transatlantic)   BANGALORE, July 12 (Reuters) - Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) offered to buy reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings Inc TRH.N for about $3.5 billion in cash and stock, trumping an all-stock bid by Allied World Assurance Co Holdings’s AWH.N.   Validus offered 1.5564 in shares and a special dividend of $8 in cash for every Transatlantic share. The total per share value of $55.95 is a 14 percent premium to Transatlantic’s last closing price.   Allied World’s offer is currently worth $3.12 billion, or $49.91 a share, based on its Tuesday closing price.   Transatlantic, which was once controlled by American International Group Inc (AIG.N), had agreed to be bought by Allied World in June, creating a specialty insurer and reinsurer with broader reach and product offering. [ID:nL3E7HD00X]   Experts have been anticipating reinsurer deals, especially in Bermuda, for a while now, predicting that a soft pricing environment would prompt well-capitalized companies to merge.   In a letter to Transatlantic’s board, Validus CEO Edward Noonan said he has been interested in exploring a “mutually beneficial business combination” with Transatlantic for some time.   Validus had reached out to New York-based Transatlantic twice in June, the letter shows.   The company is prepared to take the offer directly to shareholders if needed, Noonan wrote in the letter.   Noonan said the company was willing to enter into merger agreement with Transatlantic substantially similar to the one with Allied World.   “The combination of Validus’ strong positions in Bermuda and London with Transatlantic’s profile in the United States, continental Europe and Asia will produce a rare example of a complementary business fit with minimal overlap,” Noonan said in a statement.   Bermuda-based Validus has made two big acquisitions in the last few years. In 2009, it bough property catastrophe reinsurer IPC Holdings for over $1.5 billion. Before that it bought specialty insurance group Talbot.   Greenhill & Co LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as financial advisers to Validus.  (Reporting by A.

13,AIG,"UPDATE 1-IFR-Merrill, Citi, RBS bought most Maiden Lane II bonds"," (Adds detail, context)   by Adam Tempkin   NEW YORK, July 15 (IFR) - Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and RBS Securities were the Wall Street dealers who bought the most Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) auctioned by the New York Federal Reserve off its Maiden Lane II portfolio in nine sales that took place between April 1 and June 30.   That’s the result of a quarterly review of the total cash proceeds from the auctions posted by the Fed on Friday.   Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, the broker-dealer subsidiary of Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), bid on the most securities from the auctions with cash proceeds of US$1.14bn.  Citigroup (C.N) came in second, successfully purchasing US$699.4m, and RBS Securities (RBS.L) came in third, with cash proceeds of US541m.   The mortgage bonds come from the portfolio of legacy AIG (AIG.N) assets which the Fed took over during the height of the financial crisis.   The Fed’s quarterly review of Maiden Lane II sales only lists the dealers who successfully bid on the securities, and gives no insight into the investor accounts/clients who the dealers were representing.  Therefore, it is impossible to tell who actually ended up with the bonds.   The review also does not divulge which specific securities were bought by each dealer.   According to the Fed’s data, the central bank received an aggregate market-value amount of US$4.68bn in proceeds for a notional amount of US$9.4bn sold in the auctions.   The total notional value of the Maiden Lane II portfolio is more than US$30bn.   The central bank announced on June 30 the discontinuation of Maiden Lane II auctions in the near term due to the recent depressed bid for all risky spread fixed-income products, particularly legacy subprime RMBS.   That announcement did not come as a complete surprise to the market.   The Fed had indicated that it never committed to any timetable or schedule for winding down the portfolio of former AIG assets, and was only looking to achieve the best execution possible. There is no target date for disposing of the assets.   The Fed had offered about one-third of portfolio but interest started to wane as the increased supply drove bond prices down and global macroeconomic volatility led to a vast de-risking event as investors dumped spread product.   Wall Street researchers have already pointed out that given current market conditions, the Fed was not on track to match the US$15.7bn that AIG offered for the Maiden Lane II portfolio back in March. The central bank turned that offer down outright at the time in favor of piecemeal offerings to the broader market.   The data offered in today’s quarterly review may support that mathematical assessment, securitization specialists say, since some simple back-of-the-envelope calculations show that the central bank was not headed for that US$15.7bn target in the current environment.   But the Fed has long pointed out that AIG’s offer was an aggregate bid for the entire Maiden Lane II portfolio, and there is no strict or precise way of comparing proceeds to date (for individual bonds from the portfolio) to AIG’s offer for the whole lot.   One market participant also noted that the portfolio is not homogeneous, and certain subordinate bonds sold at lower dollar prices would skew the Fed’s proceeds down.  Moreover, it’s not clear at what price the Fed marked the bonds back in March versus what it got for them over the course of the auctions.   But one thing is clear:  The central bank is not a distressed seller and does not have to sell at firesale prices. Therefore, the bank can wait as long as it likes until the trading environment improves.   Market observers say that while it was probably logical for the Fed to slow down or halt the Maiden Lane II sales, the bank needs to be mindful of other issuers beating it to market with their own RMBS bid lists and perhaps stoking demand if bond prices start to heal.   For instance, Franco-Belgian bank Dexia SA (DEXI.BR) is slated to sell about US$8.4bn of U.S. RMBS in order to clean out its lowest quality US assets.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, the broker-dealer subsidiary of Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), bid on the most securities from the auctions with cash proceeds of US$1.14bn.  Citigroup (C.N) came in second, successfully purchasing US$699.4m, and RBS Securities (RBS.L) came in third, with cash proceeds of US541m.   The mortgage bonds come from the portfolio of legacy AIG (AIG.N) assets which the Fed took over during the height of the financial crisis.   The Fed’s quarterly review of Maiden Lane II sales only lists the dealers who successfully bid on the securities, and gives no insight into the investor accounts/clients who the dealers were representing.  Therefore, it is impossible to tell who actually ended up with the bonds.   The review also does not divulge which specific securities were bought by each dealer.   According to the Fed’s data, an aggregate amount of US$4.68bn was sold to the counterparties. The entire portfolio is worth more than US$30bn.   The central bank announced on June 30 the discontinuation of Maiden Lane II auctions in the near term due to the recent depressed bid for all risky spread fixed-income products, particularly legacy subprime RMBS.   That announcement did not come as a complete surprise to the market.   The Fed had indicated that it never committed to any timetable or schedule for winding down the portfolio of former AIG assets, and was only looking to achieve the best execution possible. There is no target date for disposing of the assets.   The Fed had offered about one-third of portfolio but interest started to wane as the increased supply drove bond prices down and global macroeconomic volatility led to a vast de-risking event as investors dumped spread product.   Wall Street researchers have already pointed out that given current market conditions, the Fed was not on track to match the US$15.7bn that AIG offered for the Maiden Lane II portfolio back in March. The central bank turned that offer down outright at the time in favor of piecemeal offerings to the broader market.   The data offered in today’s quarterly review may support that mathematical assessment, securitization specialists say, since some simple back-of-the-envelope calculations show that the central bank was not headed for that US$15.7bn target in the current environment.   But the Fed has long pointed out that AIG’s offer was an aggregate bid for the entire Maiden Lane II portfolio, and there is no strict or precise way of comparing proceeds to date (for individual bonds from the portfolio) to AIG’s offer for the whole lot.   One market participant also noted that the portfolio is not homogeneous, and certain subordinate bonds sold at lower dollar prices would skew the Fed’s proceeds down.  Moreover, it’s not clear at what price the Fed marked the bonds back in March versus what it got for them over the course of the auctions.   But one thing is clear:  The central bank is not a distressed seller and does not have to sell at firesale prices. Therefore, the bank can wait as long as it likes until the trading environment improves.   Market observers say that while it was probably logical for the Fed to slow down or halt the Maiden Lane II sales, the bank needs to be mindful of other issuers beating it to market with their own RMBS bid lists and perhaps stoking demand if bond prices start to heal.   For instance, Franco-Belgian bank Dexia SA (DEXI.BR) is slated to sell about US$8.4bn of U.S. RMBS in order to clean out its lowest quality US assets.

15,AIG,Tornadoes and interest rates to hit insurers' results,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - It’s a rough time to be an insurer, and investors looking at quarterly earnings will be focusing mostly on a single question: How long will the pain last.  The second quarter is likely to go down as one of the worst for the U.S. insurance industry in years, mostly for property insurers, which will report billions of dollars in catastrophe losses due to powerful tornadoes that struck in April and May.  Life insurers fared somewhat better from a performance standpoint, though persistently low interest rates continue to batter their shares and create medium-term uncertainty.  Among the winners in the industry: insurance brokers that could benefit from property insurers’ difficulties.  Property insurers have already disclosed more than $6 billion in losses from the tornadoes that ravaged parts of the country in April and May, so losses will not be a surprise.  Dow industrials component Travelers Companies (TRV.N) has said it expects an operating loss, and others would not surprise if they reported the same. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expect operating losses of 64 cents a share for Travelers and $1.53 for Allstate.  “Major losses from tornadoes, other bad weather and earthquakes have eliminated earnings for many. Meanwhile, top-lines remain weak and investment yields low. In addition, the economy is hardly robust,” KBW analysts said in a July 12 research note.  Share buybacks are off the table after years of multibillion-dollar programs, but KBW said share weakness was an opportunity for investors to buy companies like ACE ACE.N and Chubb (CB.N).  To the extent there is any good news in the quarter, some say, it may come from the Bermudan reinsurers. Langen McAlenney insurance analysts, in a July 11 note, said investors may be pleasantly surprised by premiums in Bermuda, as pricing has started to firm following years of declines.  On the life insurance side of the industry, all signs suggest business has remained somewhat steady.  The problem for life insurers, as it has been of late, is persistently low interest rates. As long-term investments mature, the insurers have to put that capital in new long-term instruments at much lower rates. That could create problems meeting obligations in future years and force insurers to tap their surplus.  Even as low rates weigh on insurance product and annuity sales, Barclays Capital forecast double-digit growth in operating earnings per share on the effect of share buybacks and growth from acquisitions. The country’s two largest life insurers, MetLife (MET.N) and Prudential (PRU.N), are both digesting substantial acquisitions from AIG (AIG.N).  “The life insurance sector could be revalued upward as these companies generate increasingly consistent results,” Barclays said in a note, given the contributions they gain from their expansion of late. Analysts on average expect earnings of $1.13 per share from MetLife and $1.55 for Prudential.  Given the series of catastrophes and rise in business volumes, most brokerages are optimistic about reinsurance brokers like Aon (AON.N), Willis WSH.N and Marsh & McLennan (MMC.N), as they stand to benefit from rising premiums.  Insurance brokers with international exposure like Arthur J Gallagher (AJG.N), Aon and Marsh should also benefit from a weak U.S. dollar, Raymond James analyst Gregory Peters said in a note.  For title insurers, analysts expect home sales to remain sluggish with the depressed real estate markets. The industry has been unable to generate meaningful earnings or premium growth in the last couple of years as business volumes continue to remain low.  “As far as industry growth is concerned I’m not expecting any surprises in the second-quarter. Things are pretty much going to remain the same,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Dwelle said.

17,AIG,Transatlantic open to talks on Validus bid,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N said on Tuesday it would open talks with Validus Holdings (VR.N) over a $3.2 billion unsolicited takeover bid, while sticking by an existing deal with Allied World AWH.N.  The move sets the stage for the next round of a brewing bidding war over the New York-based reinsurer, stepping up pressure on both suitors to offer better bids.  Transatlantic said it found that the Validus bid was not superior to its $3.06 billion takeover deal with Allied World, but that Validus offer was “reasonably likely” to lead to a better deal.  Allied World made its all-stock offer on June 12, though major Transatlantic shareholders were quick to oppose the deal as too cheap. Validus came in July 12 with a higher cash-and-stock offer and a promise to take the bid directly to shareholders if Transatlantic did not accept.  Under their agreement, Transatlantic must give Allied World three days notice — which expires on July 22 — before engaging with Validus.  Allied World has pitched its deal as the best fit for Transatlantic, given their complementary books of business and shared history.  Allied was started by a group of companies, including American International Group Inc (AIG.N), and Transatlantic used to be an AIG division.  Validus has argued it would provide better synergies and scale. Were Validus successful, the new company would be the sixth-largest reinsurer in the world.  Validus also has a proven history with unsolicited takeovers.

19,AIG,ILFC has a distance to fly before a potential IPO," * AIG talking to bankers about possible offering -sources   * Write-downs, late payments have plagued ILFC recently   * Few buyers seen in the market   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - AIG is looking at selling its airplane leasing business to the public, but it has to contend with two crucial problems ahead of the sale - an aging fleet and a recent rise in customers’ inability to pay their bills.   These difficulties could make it just as hard for AIG to sell the business to retail investors, analysts say, as it was to sell to a private buyer.   Bailed-out insurer American International Group (AIG.N) is pursuing plans for an initial public offering of International Lease Finance Corp [AIGIL.UL], talking to banks and keeping an eye on markets for a fall offering, two people familiar with the matter said Tuesday. AIG declined to  comment.   The IPO could be in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range for roughly a 25 percent stake in the business, one of the sources said. That would imply ILFC is worth up to $8 billion.   AIG has made no secret of its intention to dispose of ILFC, the world’s largest company in the market for buying and leasing planes to airlines. AIG Chief Executive Bob Benmosche is quick to say ILFC is not core to AIG’s future and that someday someone else will own it.   All along, though, price has been a problem. AIG Chairman Steve Miller said late last year that no one was willing to pay what the company thought ILFC was worth.   “They’re going to face exactly the same headwinds as they have in the past — this is an industry that favors younger planes and they have a relatively older portfolio,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with The Teal Group.   Another problem, he said, is financing — airplane leasing companies need solid balance sheets and top-shelf credit ratings to do business, neither of which is assured in a tough fiscal environment.   “Things are still good (in plane financing) but no one’s really sure where the economy is headed,” he said.   Standard & Poor’s said on Tuesday its “BBB-“ credit rating on ILFC is not affected by the IPO reports. The rating factors in one notch of potential support from AIG if needed.   ILFC’s founder, Air Lease (AL.N) CEO Steve Hazy, has said publicly that he would be happy to buy the company back from AIG, though people around AIG doubt Hazy has the financial firepower to actually pull off the deal.   A spokeswoman for Air Lease declined comment. Air Lease has a market capitalization of about $2.5 billion, which would suggest a takeover could be difficult.   ILFC has made a sharp turnaround from the darkest days of the financial crisis, when Hazy left, its funding was a serious question and the business looked shaky at best.   Former Airbus executive Henri Courpron took over the business in early 2010 and turned it around, to the point that ILFC is now back in the market selling debt and buying airplanes in substantial quantities.   But even as it buys new planes, older planes are an ongoing problem. Benmosche said in May he assumed ILFC would record about $300 million in impairments this year on plane sales.   ILFC took no impairments on planes in 2006-2008, impaired $87.7 million in 2009 and then suddenly took $1.5 billion in impairments last year.   The problem is older jets are worth less for leasing and have a lower resale value as the plane manufacturers begin developing newer and more fuel-efficient models.   At the same time that many of ILFC’s 933 planes are less valuable than they were before, more of its customers are also having problems paying for their leases.   The number of delinquent customers more than doubled in the first quarter, and the amount they were in arrears on more than tripled in the same period.   It is also possible that ILFC will not be the only aircraft leasing business coming to market. Sources said last month that part-nationalized British lender RBS (RBS.L) was considering another attempt to sell RBS Aviation Capital, which it has also been trying to dispose of as a non-core asset. [ID:nLDE75117E]   Selling ILFC to the public would help AIG buy back the U.S. Treasury’s interest in its remaining assets, including AIG’s one-third stake in Asian insurer AIA (1299.HK).   It may also be that AIG is better off getting the business sold sooner than later, one analyst said.   “Waiting a year or two, if you look at the macro risks that are on the horizon, it seems prudent from my perspective, assuming the markets are roughly where they are today, to look at going ahead and floating something,” said Aite Group analyst Clark Troy.   AIG shares rose 0.8 percent to $27.87. The stock has lost roughly half its value this year, and in recent weeks has mostly traded below the $29 price of the secondary share offering AIG conducted in late May.

22,AIG,Geithner gave Fed official waiver on AIG holdings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, while head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, granted a waiver that allowed his eventual successor William Dudley to hold on to investments in firms getting emergency help.  Dudley, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who at the time ran the New York Fed’s powerful markets desk, was allowed to maintain his financial stake in insurance giant AIG, whose government bailout helped prop up investment firms like Goldman Sachs.  Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent and a critic of the Fed’s financial bailouts, called the finding from a Government Accountability Office audit released on Thursday “disturbing.”  The GAO recommended the Fed strengthen policies to prevent conflicts of interest, in particular in instances of emergency lending to non-bank institutions. Current policy focuses more narrowly on banks and bank holding companies.  “(Three) days after the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBNY (the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) to assist AIG — the then-FRBNY President granted ... a waiver to a senior management official with financial interests in AIG and GE (General Electric) who was involved in decision making related to these two companies,” the investigative agency said.  The New York Fed justified the waiver to Dudley on the grounds that he was critical to emergency operations, that the value of his investment in AIG was worth less than $15,000, and that divesting might violate laws on insider trading, according to the report.  “William Dudley, who was then head of the Markets Group at the New York Fed, held shares in these companies as part of his personal portfolio that predated his service at the New York Fed,” a New York Fed spokesperson said in reaction to the report.  The spokesperson said divestiture might have created the appearance of a conflict of interest. Dudley has since disposed of the shares.  The GAO said that of 12 staffers who volunteered potential conflicts of interest, the New York Fed ethics office required four to sell their stakes. The New York Fed declined a request to identify other staffers who received waivers.  The Treasury declined to comment on Geithner’s role in granting the waivers.  The Fed’s aggressive rescue efforts during the 2007-2009 financial crisis are viewed by many as having prevented an even deeper economic downturn. Officials were confronted with a fast-moving crisis that required quick responses.  The extraordinary efforts threw a spotlight on the central bank’s power and raised questions about the close connections between the Fed and the financial institutions it oversees.  The GAO in its report also said the Fed should bolster policies for awarding contracts to carry out emergency activities.  The Fed awarded contracts worth $660 billion to private firms to carry out emergency efforts during the crisis, and eight out of the 10 highest-value contracts were awarded without a bidding process, the report said.  Many of the firms picked to run emergency programs were themselves getting Fed loans at rock bottom interest rates, Sanders said. Firms included JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.  The disclosure comes as the GAO prepares another study on the governance of the regional Fed banks that, together with the Fed’s Board of Governors in Washington, form the U.S. central bank system. That study is due out this fall.  Among the 12 regional Fed banks, the New York institution is first among peers because of its location on the doorstep of financial markets. Its president has a permanent vote on the Fed’s interest rate-setting panel and it manages the Fed’s all-important market operations.  The Fed was embarrassed in early 2009 when it became public that New York Fed Board Chairman Stephen Friedman, a member of the Goldman Sachs board, held a substantial amount of stock in that company when it was allowed to come under the Fed’s protection during the crisis.  Friedman defended the holding, for which he received a waiver, but resigned from his position to spare the Fed the controversy.  Last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, which mandated the GAO study, made some changes to the powers of regional Fed board members, including taking away the right of some of them to vote for the regional presidents. The presidents participate in meetings of the Fed’s influential policy committee and get to vote on interest rate decisions.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at that time was the president of the New York Fed.  Senator Bernie Sanders’ office identified the official as Dudley and called the GAO’s finding “disturbing.” Dudley, who at the time was the head of the New York Fed’s markets group, was among a number of officials and contractors granted waivers allowing them to keep investments at firms receiving emergency assistance.  The agency said the Fed could strengthen policies to prevent conflicts of interest, in particular in instances of emergency lending.  Current restrictions tend to focus on banks and financial firms the Fed normally does business with, but should be expanded to include other financial firms that could at some point get emergency help, the congressional watchdog group said.  The Fed directly rescued insurer AIG, while General Electric received assistance through Fed emergency programs.  GAO said the Fed justified the waiver on the grounds that Dudley was critical to emergency operations, that the value of his investment in AIG was worth less than $15,000, and that divesting might violate laws relating to insider trading.  Further, the New York Fed said divestiture might have created the appearance of a conflict of interest.  The New York Fed declined to comment on the report.",7212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-1/top-fed-official-got-waiver-on-aig-holdings-gao-idUSTRE76K4VZ20110721

The dispute comes as demand soars for “cyberinsurance,” with companies seeking to protect themselves against customer claims and associated costs for data and identity theft.   How to write such policies has become a huge subject of debate in the insurance industry.

Bortnick, who is not involved in the case, said that while Sony may be able to claim there was property damage as a result of the data breach, Zurich is likely to argue that the sort of general liability insurance it wrote for Sony was never intended to cover digital attacks.   Sony could not immediately be reached for comment. AIG declined to comment, and Mitsui Sumitomo could not immediately be reached.   In April, hackers accessed personal data for more than 100 million users of Sony’s online video games.

The insurer also said Sony has been subject to investigations by state and federal regulators since the breach.   Zurich American has subsequently received claims for coverage from Sony under its policy, a commercial general liability policy written for Sony Computer Entertainment of America as of April 1.

AIA’s December-May net profit was $1.31 billion, up from $1.06 billion a year ago, exceeding the $1.09 billion expected by a poll of three analysts surveyed by Reuters.	   “AIA’s strong performance across all of our key financial performance measures demonstrates the excellent progress we have made in executing our growth strategy,” AIA Chief Executive Mark Tucker said in a statement posted on the Hong Kong stock exchange.	   With its relatively young population, Asia has increasingly become the next battleground for insurance companies such as AIA and rivals Prudential and China’s Ping An .	   AIA is the spun-off Asian life insurance arm of American International Group Inc , which still owns a third of the company. It raised more than $20 billion in a Hong Kong offering last year, helping its parent repay the U.S. government.	   The insurer’s embedded value operating profit grew 25 percent to $1.51 billion, AIA said. Embedded value refers to the present value of a life insurance company’s future profits, and is calculated by adding its current future profits to its past profit.	   Value of new business (VONB), which measures the profitability of its new business, rose 32 percent to $399 million. This was faster than a 22 percent rise in 2010 and a 21 percent increase in the first quarter of this year.	   It was also better than a 19 percent rise forecast by Barclays Capital analyst Mark Kellock in a note on July 22.	   About 6 percentage points of that growth in VONB is likely due to the U.S. dollar’s depreciation against Asian currencies, HSBC said in a June report.	   The Asian currencies’ appreciation also helped boost AIA’s investment returns, which rose 22 percent to $2.4 billion in the first half of the year. AIA reports its earnings in U.S. dollars, but receives much of its premiums in Asian currencies, which have broadly appreciated in the past two years.	   AIA also said it would pay out a dividend of HK$0.11, which it said would represent about one-third of its full-year payout. This is the first time it is returning cash to shareholders since its IPO last year.	   Some $170 million was set aside for dividends, representing a dividend payout ratio of about 7.7 percent, based on Reuters calculations of company figures.	   By comparison, the world’s most valuable insurer China Life  had a dividend payout ratio of 33.6 percent in 2010, while No.2 Ping An paid out 17.7 percent.

40,AIG,Analysis: New asbestos charges point to reserve woes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asbestos-related diseases have been falling for a decade, but warnings from a pair of U.S. insurance giants about new claims raise questions about the industry’s ability to put the scourge behind it.  While medical evidence suggests fewer new cases of asbestosis and the lung cancer mesothelioma, insurers say they are getting sued more frequently and aggressively by people with claims against “peripheral insureds,” such as contractors that worked on projects where asbestos was used.  As some of these lawsuits succeed in courts across the country, it fuels new suits by aggressive plaintiffs’ lawyers and compounds the problem for insurers trying to understand their exposure.  The disconnect between a waning disease and flourishing claims also exposes a flaw endemic to insurers. When they set aside reserves for indistinct risks, they are making guesses — even if educated ones — on how long a particular risk will endure and what it will cost them to be done with it.  No law says any particular company’s guess has to match anyone else’s, but investors raise alarms about companies where reserves are not in line with peers.  That’s why Hartford Financial’s announcement this month of a $290 million pretax earnings hit from increasing reserves for asbestos cases fostered concerns beyond the insurer’s citation of rising claims for mesothelioma.  “Although these items are one-time events, the result raises questions about ... reserve adequacy,” Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said in a note to investors. He was referring to both the asbestos charge and Hartford’s sharp rise in second-quarter catastrophe losses.  American International Group Inc similarly riled investors in early February with a $4.1 billion addition to its reserves, including more than $1 billion related to its asbestos exposure.  Fitch Ratings responded by cutting the credit rating on AIG’s domestic property unit insurance units, calling the charges “a significant outlier” compared to competitors and the whole property insurance market.  According to insurance ratings agency AM Best, the Hartford had the fourth-highest level of asbestos and environmental reserves of all large property insurers at the end of 2009 while AIG ranked seventh. They also ranked in the top seven in terms of average annual asbestos losses in 2005-2009.  AIG and The Hartford are in particularly sensitive positions since they were two of the three insurers who took government bailouts during the financial crisis. Their reserve accounting has not been questioned by any of their regulators.  For decades asbestos was a favorite material in building products, naval applications and other industrial settings because of its fire-retardant properties. Over time, though, exposure to its microscopic fibers causes health problems.  More recently, many of the rescue workers at the Ground Zero site in New York after the 9/11 attacks were exposed to high concentrations of asbestos - in some cases, reports have said, nearly a million times the normal background level.  To be sure, some of the new claims stem from plaintiffs’ lawyers becoming more effective at suing people who are only peripherally connected to asbestos victims. Late-night cable television is flooded with ads from asbestos lawyers, and “mesothelioma” is among the most valuable of advertising keywords on Google. Since there is still plenty of asbestos in buildings across the country, it is also possible that new cases are adding to insurers’ burdens.  Best warned in February that the insurance industry is generally underfunded in its asbestos reserves. It cited a growing number of legal claims reflecting a weakening of tort reform in some states and the “ongoing filing of mesothelioma claims for years to come.”  Asbestos claims have been a bane of insurers for at least a decade. They nearly brought down the Lloyd’s of London market in the 1990s and have cost some of the industry’s largest players billions of dollars. Insurers like MetLife were accused for decades of helping to conceal the deadly side effects of the fire retardant.  In recent years, insurance investors have been celebrating the steady decline of asbestos-related claims and reserves. According to the Insurance Information Institute, reserves grew every year from 2001 to 2005, then shrank every year since through 2009.  The trend appeared to be tracking the medical evidence. New cases of malignant mesothelioma, a lung cancer caused only by asbestos exposure that one oncologist called a “tremendously lousy disease,” declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from 1999 to 2008, according to the American Cancer Society.  “I am surprised myself to hear insurers are (seeing) more claims, because we think with the reduction of asbestos years back we’re starting to see a reduction in incidence of the disease,” said Kevin Becker, an oncologist at Maimonides Medical Center in New York.  Annual reports from MetLife, the country’s largest life insurer, show new claims and total outstanding claims dropping at a steady pace from 2003 through 2010, declining around 40 percent over the period.  The sums paid annually by the industry as settlements also have generally been shrinking. A.M. Best’s forecast that the insurance industry may ultimately end up paying $75 billion in asbestos claims over time seems inflated to some regulators.  “I can’t speak for everyone out there but (claims) may be a little less than that,” said Joseph Torti, Rhode Island’s superintendent of insurance and the designated spokesman on asbestos issues for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  LONG-TERM CHALLENGE  But deciding to build or draw down reserves remains a crapshoot for insurers.  Mesothelioma has an incredibly long latency period, meaning 30 years or more can pass between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the cancer. That is why companies such as Travelers and Berkshire Hathaway continue to build reserves.  “Trends were kind of favorable, but you still see the companies with exposure kind of trickling up their reserves from time to time,” said Jim Auden, head of the property and casualty insurance unit at Fitch Ratings.  Another concern for insurers are new and expensive therapies being developed to treat mesothelioma.  The upshot? Asbestos claims and payments are not going away, and no one knows when the bend will turn.  “You wish that this would be completed,” Auden said. “These claims are tied to activities in the ‘70s mostly (and) you still can’t get your arms around it.”  ",7282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-asbestos/analysis-new-asbestos-charges-point-to-reserve-woes-idUSTRE76R4CW20110728
41,AIG,UPDATE 2-India's PNB to buy 30 pct stake in Metlife India," * Deal value not disclosed   * Metlife India to issue fresh equity   * PNB April-June profit in-line   (Adds details on Metlife deal, quotes, background)	   By Anurag Kotoky	   NEW DELHI, Jul 28 (Reuters) - Punjab National Bank (PNB)  , India’s No. 2 state-run lender, on Thursday said it plans to buy a 30 percent stake in the Indian venture of Metlife  , the biggest U.S. life insurer, for an undisclosed amount.	  PNB also agreed to enter into a 10-year distribution tie-up with Metlife India, in which Jammu and Kashmir Bank  and M.Pallonji & co also hold stakes.	   PNB will pick up the stake via a fresh share issue which will dilute the stake of all existing shareholders in Metlife India, but the U.S. company plans to bring back its  stake to the original 26 percent within 120 days after the deal closes, said William Toppeta, president of MetLife`s international business.	   The deal is expected to be closed by end-2011.	   “India is a very important market for Metlife. We have identified 10 strategic markets around the world, and at the top of that list, its India,” Toppeta told reporters.	   PNB, which bought out the stakes of its insurance joint venture partners Principal Financial Group of Mauritius  and 25 percent of Berger Paints last year, had invited expressions of interest (EoIs) from insurers for a fresh strategic tie-up.	   It had short-listed 10 companies in March and narrowed the list to three firms: Aviva Life , MetLife and Bharti Axa Life, a joint venture between  Bharati Enterprises, that controls India’s top telecoms firm Bharti Airtel  and AXA , Europe’s second biggest insurer.	   Last month, Reliance Industries , India’s biggest listed firm said it would buy Bharti Enterprises’s stakes in two insurance joint ventures with AXA to build on moves beyond its core energy business. 	    India’s life insurance sector, once in the complete grip of state-run Life Insurance Corporation, is today teeming with about two dozen private players, mostly operating in joint ventures with leading foreign players such as AIG , Allianz , Standard Life and Axa.	   Indian laws limit foreign insurer’s equity participation to 26 percent. Unlisted Life Insurance Corporation of India is still the most dominant player in India.	   If foreign direct investment limits are relaxed, Metlife will be open to increase its stake further in the Indian venture, Metlife’s Toppeta said.  	   APRIL-JUNE RESULTS MUTED	   Earlier on Thursday, PNB posted a 3.5 percent rise in April-June profit to 11.05 billion rupees.	   Higher interest rates inflated deposit costs, bad loans and shrank treasury income and investment portfolio kept profit growth muted, though it was in line with analyst expectations.	   A Reuters poll of brokerages showed analysts expected PNB to post a profit of 11.2 billion rupees for the period.	  A series of interest rate hikes to tame stubborn inflation is slowing loan growth and hurting asset quality, especially at state banks with heavy exposure to smaller commercial borrowers.  	   PNB shares, valued at about $8.1 billion, ended down 2 percent at 1103 rupees in a weak Mumbai market. In comparison, the BSE Banking index was down about 1.33 percent.	    The Reserve Bank of India, seen as one of the most aggressive central banks globally in its efforts to tame inflation, on Tuesday raised key policy rate by a surprise 50 basis points. It also cut credit growth forecast for banks to 18 percent from 19 percent projected earlier. 	   Last week, India’s No. 3 lender HDFC Bank said it expects its loan book to grow more than the sector’s  this fiscal year, though credit demand from corporates for new projects  may not see a sharp spike amid rising interest rates.  	   PNB’s interest income rose by a fifth on the year to 83.16 billion rupees, while interest expended rose more than 50 percent to 52 billion rupees in the June quarter.	   The quality of asset at the bank deteriorated in the June quarter with net non-performing asset rising to 0.86 percent from 0.66 percent.	   “I do acknowledge that incremental slippages have been there but we have put across a mechanism to handle the rise in NPAs,” chairman K. R. Kamath said.	   The bank recorded a net interest margin (NIM), the key barometer of bank’s core operation, of 3.84 percent for the quarter. 	   It expects to maintain NIM at 3.5 percent in FY12 as it hopes to maintain low-cost CASA (current account, saving account) deposits at a high proportion of 38 percent in the overall deposits, Rakesh Sethi, executive director, said.

AIA’s December-May net profit was $1.31 billion, up from $1.06 billion a year ago, exceeding the $1.09 billion forecast by a poll of three analysts surveyed by Reuters.	   “It was a strong set of numbers from all fronts,” said Jennifer Law, an analyst at Daiwa Securities in Hong Kong. “Margins are improving, which is particularly encouraging because it comes at a time when they are trying to grow their business.”	   AIA shares opened up 4.7 percent on Friday to a record high of HK$29, outpacing a largely flat Hang Seng Index .	   With its relatively young population, Asia has increasingly become the next battleground for insurance companies such as AIA and rivals Prudential and China’s Ping An .	   AIA is the Asian life insurance unit that was spun off by American International Group Inc , which still owns a third of the company. It raised more than $20 billion in a Hong Kong offering last year, helping its largest shareholder repay the U.S. government.	   “The growth in new business was driven both by a sales increase and a margin increase,” AIA’s chief executive, Mark Tucker, said in a call after the earnings release. “Taken together, it’s a pretty powerful indicator of our focus on profitability.”	   The insurer’s embedded value operating profit grew 25 percent to $1.51 billion, AIA said. Embedded value refers to the present value of a life insurance company’s future profits and is calculated by adding its current future profits to its past profit.	   Value of new business (VONB), which measures the profitability of its new business, rose 32 percent to $399 million. This was faster than a 22 percent rise in 2010 and a 21 percent increase in the first quarter of this year.	   It was also better than a 19 percent rise forecast by Barclays Capital analyst Mark Kellock in a note on July 22.	   About 6 percentage points of that growth in VONB is likely due to the U.S. dollar’s depreciation against Asian currencies, HSBC said in a June report.	   “Clearly, (foreign exchange) is a positive side effect, but the growth has come about from the business, not from the market, and I see that continuing,” Tucker said.	   The appreciation of Asian currencies also helped boost AIA’s investment returns, which rose 22 percent to $2.4 billion in the first half of the year. AIA reports its earnings in U.S. dollars, but receives much of its premiums in Asian currencies, which have broadly appreciated in the past two years.	   AIA also said it would pay a dividend of HK$0.11, which it said would represent about one-third of its full-year payout. This is the first time it is returning cash to shareholders since its IPO last year.	   Some $170 million was set aside for dividends, the company said. Daiwa  Securities estimates that AIA’s dividend payout ratio for the full year is likely to be about 30 percent.	   By comparison, the world’s most valuable insurer, China Life  , had a dividend payout ratio of 33.6 percent in 2010, while No.2 Ping An paid out 17.7 percent.	   AIA’s cornerstone investors, which includes the Kuwait Investment Authority and Hong Kong tycoon Cheng Yu-tung’s Chow Tai Fook group, are also “loyal and committed” to their holding to the insurer, Tucker said.	   He declined to comment further on talks between the insurer and its investors.	   The six-month lock-up period for AIA’s so-called “cornerstone investors” expired in April this year and they are now free to sell their shares, which have risen about 47 percent since it listed.	   AIA shares have risen 27 percent so far this year, outstripping the benchmark Hang Seng Index’s 2 percent decline.

45,AIG,"UPDATE 4-Ex-General Re, AIG execs' convictions thrown out","   * Ex-Gen Re CEO, others win reversal of convictions   * Appeals court cites errors by trial judge   * Transaction said to inflate AIG’s loss reserves  (Adds comment by lawyer, paragraph 17)   By Jonathan Stempel and Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Four former executives at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s General Re Corp unit and one at American International Group Inc won the reversal of their convictions over a reinsurance transaction that prosecutors said fraudulently boosted AIG’s loss reserves.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ordered on Monday a new trial for all five defendants, including former General Re Chief Executive Ronald Ferguson, citing errors by the presiding judge at their closely watched 2008 trial.   Prosecutors had accused the defendants of engineering a sham transaction in 2000 that let AIG inflate its loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk.   The transaction helped lead to the 2005 ouster of AIG’s longtime chief executive, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg.   Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) chief executive, was questioned by investigators about the transaction but was not implicated or accused of wrongdoing.   The other defendants whose convictions were thrown out are former General Re Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Monrad, former Senior Vice President Christopher Garand and former Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham, as well as former AIG (AIG.N) Vice President Christian Milton. They have been free on bail pending their appeals.   It is unclear whether prosecutors will retry the case. The office of U.S. Attorney David Fein in Connecticut did not return calls seeking a comment.   The reinsurance arrangement took place well before AIG in 2008 and 2009 accepted $182.3 billion of taxpayer-funded bailouts amid the global financial crisis. The government still owns a majority of AIG.   In its decision, the 2nd Circuit said the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney in Hartford, Connecticut, erred in admitting data suggesting that the transaction caused a 12 percent decline in AIG’s stock price in early 2005, when details about it became known.   The court said the data were prejudicial because there were other problems, including bid-rigging and earnings manipulation allegations, that could have also hurt the insurer’s stock price.   “The defendants’ substantial rights were affected,” Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote for the appeals court.   Jacobs also said Droney did not properly instruct jurors on how to decide whether the defendants had committed fraud.   Droney sentenced Milton to four years in prison, Ferguson to two years, Monrad to 1-1/2 years, and Garand and Graham to one year each, following a six-week trial.   Two other former General Re executives, John Houldsworth and Richard Napier, pleaded guilty in the case and were sentenced to probation.   In May, President Barack Obama nominated Droney to serve on the 2nd Circuit.   Frederick Hafetz, a lawyer for Milton, said: “We are very gratified by the decision, and look forward to a new trial.”   Alan Vinegrad, a lawyer for Graham, also said he was gratified by the decision.   Lawyers for the remaining defendants did not return calls seeking comment.   Greenberg is still dealing with fallout from General Re, including a 2005 civil fraud lawsuit in which then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer accused him of structuring transactions to hide AIG losses.   That case has yet to go to trial, and Greenberg in March lost a bid to remove the presiding judge on bias grounds after that judge called the government’s case “devastating.”   In 2006, AIG agreed to pay $1.64 billion to settle state and federal probes into its business practices.   General Re, meanwhile, agreed in January 2010 to pay $92.2 million to end a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe over alleged sham transactions with AIG and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N).   The case is U.S. v. Ferguson et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 08-6211.  (Editing by Gerald E.

48,AIG,U.S. SEC pushes AIG on credit rating disclosures," * SEC seeks more disclosure on how ratings are formed   * AIG says its procedure tracks the rating agencies   * Company proposes new disclosure language   * AIG shares up 1.5 percent   NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has asked insurer AIG (AIG.N) to provide more disclosure about how and why it assigns credit ratings to investments in its portfolio, according to letters between the regulator and the company disclosed on Monday.   The two SEC inquiries, from May 20 and June 10, related to the company’s first-quarter financial report, which was filed in early May.   Page 142 of that report details the company’s bond investments, both by credit ratings and by type. In a comment prior to the table, AIG notes that its investment decisions are based on internally generated ratings and that it uses outside agencies’ ratings as “one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.”   That explanation prompted questioning from the SEC, which asked in the May 20 letter for more details of the investments that received the internal review, the review procedures and the reasons for any difference between AIG’s and the external agencies’ ratings.   In a letter dated June 3, American International Group Deputy General Counsel Kathleen Shannon said the company used an internal numerical system that tracks the ratings agencies’ formulas, and that it usually based the rating on the issuer and not the bond.   “Those ratings may differ on occasion from the ratings of the principal rating agencies, not unlike the rating agencies differing among themselves as to the same issuer or security rating,” Shannon said in the letter.   She said AIG had assigned ratings lower than the ones given by the ratings agencies for just over $20 billion, or 8 percent, of its rated securities. It has given a higher rating than the agencies for about $9.5 billion worth of bonds, or about 4 percent of its portfolio.   On June 10, the SEC asked AIG to come up with disclosure language for future filings on the source of its credit ratings.   AIG responded by letter on June 17 with language that it intends to use starting in the second quarter, indicating that the ratings in the table come from either the ratings agencies or, if no outside rating exists, its own evaluation.   AIG, which is in the later stages of repaying its $182 billion bailout by the U.S. government, reports second-quarter results later this week.   Shares of AIG were up 1.5 percent at $29.13 in trading before the market opened.

52,AIG,UPDATE 4-Ally Financial profit falls as mortgages sting," * Net income $113 mln vs $565 mln a year earlier   * Mortgage operations loss $127 mln vs profit $230 mln  (Adds analyst comment, details on subprime auto lending)   By Joe Rauch   CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 2 (Reuters) - Ally Financial Inc, an auto and mortgage lender majority-owned by the U.S. government, said second-quarter profit fell 80 percent as its home loan operations lost money.   The Detroit-based bank said it made fewer home loans during the quarter and bought back more bad mortgages from investors.   The company also dialed down its expected earnings from collecting customers’ mortgage payments. The results underscore how many U.S. lenders are still suffering in the aftermath of the U.S. housing crisis.   The weaker results and a shaky stock market could delay Ally’s proposed initial public offering until later this year, analysts said.   “It’s the confluence of a couple of events,” said Jason Ware, an equity analyst with Albion Financial Group. “A choppy market isn’t a prime time for an IPO for a company that’s trying to reorient its business.”   Ally, formerly known as GMAC Financial Services, reported it sixth straight quarterly profit after the credit crisis, with second-quarter net income of $113 million, down from $565 million a year earlier.   But in its mortgage operations, it posted a loss of $127 million, compared with a profit of $230 million in the same 2010 quarter.   During second quarter, Ally’s used car loans spiked 74 percent from a year ago, to $2.3 billion.   Lease financing increased to $2.1 billion from $800 million.   The increase in used car lending fits with Ally’s strategy to make more used car loans — which often come with higher interest rates than new car loans.   On May 3, Ally executives told analysts the company wanted to raise its percentage of used car loans to 50 percent from 20 percent, including making more loans to subprime borrowers.   Ally President William Muir said at the time that subprime auto lending is “a very attractive business today.” [ID:nN30251782]   Ally is the preferred lender for General Motors and Chrysler dealers, but those agreements are set to expire in 2013. GM has bought its own lender, AmeriCredit, which some investors fear could cut into Ally’s business.   The U.S. Treasury holds a 73.8 percent stake in Ally after rescuing the company multiple times during the financial crisis.   Ally filed in March for an IPO. At the time, sources said the deal could raise $5 billion, including convertible securities.     Ally officials said last year they hoped an IPO would come in 2011. On Tuesday, Ally Chief Executive Michael Carpenter said the company is “working through the process” with regulators.   The lender would join several other U.S. companies that have gone public after being owned primarily by the U.S. Treasury, including Ally’s former parent company, General Motors Co (GM.N), and American International Group Inc (AIG.N).

53,AIG,DEALTALK-Insurers covet Eurasia units ING wants to float," (For more Reuters DEALTALK stories click )	   By Douwe Miedema	   LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - ING could get a far bigger pay-out if it ditched a plan to spin-off its Asian and European insurance units as a single stock market-listed business and instead chose buyers from a long list of interested parties.	   A trade sale would enable the Dutch bank to unlock the high value in its Eastern European and the Asian operations, and avoid tainting them with the business in the Netherlands, where insurance portfolios trade below book value.	   “A lot of people are interested in it. A lot of external parties have talked to them to register interest. They know there is interest, it’s a matter of price,” said one investment banker who asked not to be identified.	   Two other investment bankers said that a long queue of insurers had held discussions with ING from about the beginning of the year. The talks were entirely informal.	   The European Union has ordered ING to split its bank and insurance operations, and to sell a swathe of assets as payback for a 10 billion euro ($14.2 billion) capital injection from the Dutch state during the credit crisis.	   Chief Executive Jan Hommen — a 68-year old who was formerly finance chief at aluminium producer Alcoa and then at Philips Electronics — has been in charge of the effort ever since taking ING’s helm in 2009.	   He proved to be a savvy dealmaker when he sold ING’s Latin American operation to Colombia’s relatively unknown GrupoSura  for 2.6 billion euros ($3.7 billion) last month. ING had first said it would float the business. 	   He is now readying ING’s Eurasian and its U.S. business for two Initial Public Offerings (IPO) to take place in the course of 2012. But this is ING’s “base case” scenario, a wording suggesting it does not rule out a trade sale.	   Properly valuing the European and Asian operations is hard, because ING has yet to allocate debt to the units. It is a job that bankers expect ING to take on in the second half of the year.	   ING will publish mid-year results on Aug 4.	   Hommen can count on the support of Ivo Lurvink, a former Credit Suisse banker, who also headed mergers and acquisitions at Philips. Lurvink has been in charge of ING’s divestment programme since 2009.	   Germany’s Allianz was one of the many European insurers that had looked into the business at this early stage, according to a person familiar with the situation. But Europe’s largest insurer had now lost interest.	   Other European insurers, such as Zurich Financial , Generali , AXA , Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Germany’s Talanx all declined to comment.	   The Eurasian business has a value on ING’s books of 15 billion euros, though that number will get lower once the group allocates debt to the units. At 8.5 billion euros, the Benelux arm is the biggest part.	   It is also the least attractive, with virtually no growth, and posing an immense burden on capital for any unlikely prospective buyer. Dutch insurance businesses trade at some 0.5 to 0.6 times book value, analysts and bankers said.	   By contrast there is huge interest in Eastern European and Asian insurance, which may may trade up to 2 times book value. The sale of Polish peer insurer Warta by Belgium’s KBC  for instance, is closely watched. 	   And Prudential’s bold bid last year to grab the life insurance business of AIG for $35.5 billion — which nearly wrecked CEO Tidjane Thiam’s career — was a sign of the temptations of the Asian life insurance market.	   Lumping the three regions together in an IPO would value the business at a level that will be heavily dragged down by the Benelux operations. Rabobank analyst Cor Kluis puts the number at 1.1 times book value.	   That would value ING’s Eurasian business at 10.1 billion euros, according to Rabobank.	   On the other hand, sorting the business in three different regions will allow ING to attract a takeover premium — which can be as high as 30 percent. In that case, the blended multiple could amount to 1.5 times book value.	   The risk ING has to weigh is that it gets stuck with just the less attractive Benelux business. And any sale needs to be timed well, to avoid being upstaged by others.	   “ING is not the only bank trying to unload insurance assets. The fear is that too many assets wil come onto the market at the same time in 2012/2013,” a senior manager at a major European insurance group said, asking not to be named.

54,AIG,UPDATE 2-ILFC to buy Aeroturbine for $228 million," * AeroTurbine buy enables ILFC to part out old planes   * Aercap to use proceeds to pursue transactions  (Rewrites with comment from ILFC CEO, adds further background)   CHICAGO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - International Lease Finance Corp, which leases planes to airlines, said on Wednesday it would buy parts seller AeroTurbine from its Dutch rival Aercap Holdings NV (AER.N) for $228 million.   With AeroTurbine in the fold, ILFC has the means to part out its aging planes and resell them in the aftermarket. Prior to this purchase, recycling older planes was beyond the means of the leasing company.   “We didn’t have the skills. We didn’t have the infrastructure, and there was some value leakage there, because people in the market knew we could not do that,” ILFC Chief Executive Henri Courpron told Reuters.   “We were not in a good marketing position to explore ways to extract all the value we can out of our aging aircraft,” he said.   ILFC, which has a fleet of nearly 1000 planes, is the aircraft leasing unit of insurer American International Group (AIG.N). Miami-based AeroTurbine leases and trades airplane engines and buys and sells used parts.   Aercap said it will continue to guarantee until December AeroTurbine’s obligations under its $425 million revolving credit facility, of which about $298.6 million was drawn as of July 31, 2011.   AeroTurbine may seek to amend and restate the credit facility in its entirety prior to Dec. 14, 2011, the company said.   Aercap will use the proceeds of the sale to pursue transactions, Chief Executive Aengus Kelly, said in a statement.   AIG, which has consistently said it would eventually dispose of ILFC somehow, has now picked banks to lead an initial public offering of the business later this year.   Sources have said that deal could value ILFC at up to $10 billion.

55,AIG,AIG posts $1.8 billion profit on AIA stake,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group (AIG.N) reported a profit for the second quarter on Thursday, as tax benefits and its one-third stake in Asian insurer AIA offset a decline in operating income at its main businesses.  The company’s chief executive also confirmed it is working on taking its aircraft leasing business public, though that may not happen this year. Sources had previously said that the company was working on hiring bankers to pursue an IPO.  While the underlying results at all of AIG’s units were lower than a year earlier, its core insurance performance improved. Most of the decline was attributed to investment results and catastrophe losses.  Shares were flat in after-hours trading following a sharp decline in regular trading, on what was the market’s worst day in nearly three years.  The company received a $182 billion bailout during the financial crisis, and the U.S. Treasury still owns three-quarters of the company, a position it is expected to sell down in stages by mid-2012.  AIG reported a net profit of $1.84 billion, or $1 per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $2.66 billion, or $19.57 per share.  On an operating basis, AIG earned 69 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected earnings of 92 cents per share.  Two items bolstered the quarter: a $570 million tax benefit, and $1.52 billion in fair value income from AIA (1299.HK), the Asian insurer it took public last year.  AIG has said it would like to keep its roughly 33 percent AIA stake, which would require selling assets to pay off a preferred interest held by the U.S. Treasury in the entity that holds the AIA shares.  SunAmerica, AIG’s U.S. life insurance business, reported a 13 percent decline in operating income, as lower investment income offset slight growth in new business.  After stagnating during the crisis, the company has recently improved its distribution for annuities and other products and started to show improved results. The company has now returned to all of the distribution channels it had before the credit crisis and AIG’s near-bankruptcy.

60,AIG,"Berkshire profit rises on rails, manufacturing","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) reported a larger second-quarter profit on Friday, as favorable investment results and strength in the rail and manufacturing businesses offset another underwriting loss in insurance.  The 80-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” warned in April the insurance business was probably going to post an underwriting loss for the year because of the severe earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand in the first quarter.  Analysts and investors said the quarter was much as they expected, although the long-term questions about Buffett’s succession plans remain. Buffett has said Berkshire will separate his CEO and investment chief roles when he is gone, but has given no clarity on who will fill them.  Berkshire reported a net profit of $3.42 billion, or $2,072 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.97 billion, or $1,195 per share.  Revenues at the insurance business rose by roughly $2 billion from a year earlier, driven by an asbestos reinsurance contract with AIG (AIG.N). On a net basis, though, the unit had an underwriting loss of $7 million due to natural disasters.  “You can’t look at insurance in a vacuum over one quarter,” said Tom Lewandowski, financial services analyst at Edward Jones. “I’m not overly disappointed.”  Revenue also was up sharply at the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and earnings rose nearly 15 percent year-on-year. Berkshire said it managed to handle more rail cars and to get higher revenue per car.  Profits were sharply higher in the manufacturing, service and retailing segment, reflecting a wide array of stronger results in lines including engineered products, metalworking and building products.  One of the downsides in the quarter was manufactured housing business Clayton Homes, where revenue from home sales declined 30 percent and the average price per home sold also fell.  Besides the operating results, the company also benefited from better investment results than in prior periods.  Berkshire recorded smaller losses on a derivative position linked to stock markets, $184 million versus a loss of $2.18 billion a year earlier. Though he has condemned derivatives generally, Buffett has said this particular investment could be lucrative for the company over time.  The company also had no writedowns in the second quarter for other-than-temporary losses on stocks. Berkshire has been under pressure from securities regulators to more quickly recognize losses on shareholdings when those stocks have been in a loss position for more than a year.  Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of the conglomerate’s worth, rose 3.4 percent to $98,716 per Class A-equivalent share. One investor said the company’s shares are at the second-lowest multiple to book value he has seen in the last 30 years.  “The stock is crazy undervalued,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California, whose largest shareholding is Berkshire Class B stock. “In plain daylight you have a very large, stable company about 35 percent underpriced.”  But despite that attractive valuation, Lewandowski had a “hold” rating on the stock because of questions about what Berkshire will do with its cash — $47.89 billion at the end of the quarter, nearly $20 billion more than a year ago and $6.7 billion more than at the end of the first quarter.  That and the unanswered question of who will run Berkshire after Buffett steps aside are key parts of the investment story, he said.  “You have these concerns, you generate all this cash, you’ve got to put all that cash to work,” he said. “There’s a reason why we’ve seen the multiples contract.”  ",8052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire/berkshire-profit-rises-on-rails-manufacturing-idUSTRE7746S120110805

On a net basis, though, the unit had an underwriting loss of $7 million due to natural disasters.   “You can’t look at insurance in a vacuum over one quarter,” said Tom Lewandowski, financial services analyst at Edward Jones. “I’m not overly disappointed.”   Revenue also was up sharply at the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and earnings rose nearly 15 percent year-on-year. Berkshire said it managed to handle more rail cars and to get higher revenue per car.   Profits were sharply higher in the manufacturing, service and retailing segment, reflecting a wide array of stronger results in lines including engineered products, metalworking and building products.   One of the downsides in the quarter was manufactured housing business Clayton Homes, where revenue from home sales declined 30 percent and the average price per home sold also fell.   Besides the operating results, the company also benefited from better investment results than in prior periods.   Berkshire recorded smaller losses on a derivative position linked to stock markets, $184 million versus a loss of $2.18 billion a year earlier. Though he has condemned derivatives generally, Buffett has said this particular investment could be lucrative for the company over time.   The company also had no writedowns in the second quarter for other-than-temporary losses on stocks. Berkshire has been under pressure from securities regulators to more quickly recognize losses on shareholdings when those stocks have been in a loss position for more than a year.   Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of the conglomerate’s worth, rose 3.4 percent to $98,716 per Class A-equivalent share. One investor said the company’s shares are at the second-lowest multiple to book value he has seen in the last 30 years.   “The stock is crazy undervalued,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California, whose largest shareholding is Berkshire Class B stock. “In plain daylight you have a very large, stable company about 35 percent underpriced.”   But despite that attractive valuation, Lewandowski had a “hold” rating on the stock because of questions about what Berkshire will do with its cash — $47.89 billion at the end of the quarter, nearly $20 billion more than a year ago and $6.7 billion more than at the end of the first quarter.   That and the unanswered question of who will run Berkshire after Buffett steps aside are key parts of the investment story, he said.   “You have these concerns, you generate all this cash, you’ve got to put all that cash to work,” he said. “There’s a reason why we’ve seen the multiples contract.”   (Reporting by Ben Berkowitz; editing by Matthew Lewis, Carol Bishopric and Andre Grenon)   ",8052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire/update-3-berkshire-profit-rises-on-rails-manufacturing-idUSN1E7730V620110805
62,AIG,AIG plans to hold mortgage insurance unit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group (AIG.N) plans to hold on to its mortgage insurance business even as the rest of that industry struggles with rising claims, AIG’s chief executive said on Friday.  Mortgage insurers have been struggling, with losses mounting and capital ratios breaching crucial levels that could keep them from writing new business.  For example, PMI Group PMI.N shares fell 59 percent on Thursday after the company warned its debt-to-capital ratio was more than twice what most states have as an upper limit.  But AIG said on Friday it was happy to hold on to United Guaranty, also known as UGC, and that newly reported delinquent loans continued to fall.  “It’s enhancing whatever we do here,” CEO Bob Benmosche said on a conference call with analysts. “For now we see it as a keeper.”  Benmosche said AIG liked UGC because it gives the company insight into the mortgage market, which helps it evaluate its investments in mortgage-backed securities.  Though AIG is largely finished with its post-crisis asset sales, the fate of UGC had been something of a question mark, since it is not considered part of the company’s core operations.  One thing AIG does not plan to do, though, is to boost UGC by buying up struggling competitors. Benmosche was asked on the conference call if he would be interested in AIG taking part in a reorganization of the mortgage insurance market.  “We don’t see any need to help anyone else out,” he answered.

63,AIG,China's Everbright delays $6 billion offer; rout hits IPOs,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Everbright Bank (601818.SS) delayed its Hong Kong share offering of up to $6 billion, sources said on Friday, the latest casualty of a rout in global equity markets which casts doubt over billions of dollars worth of other fundraising plans.  World stocks sank for an eighth straight session on Friday, wiping $2.5 trillion off their value on the week, as fears grew that Europe’s debt crisis was spinning out of control and the U.S. economy could face another recession.  “Deals are going to get delayed and are going to be cut in size,” said Philippe Espinasse, a former investment banker with Nomura and UBS in Hong Kong and author of ‘IPO: a Global Guide’. “You’re going to see people revising their expectations.”  U.S. auto and mortgage lender Ally Financial, which is planning a $6 billion initial public offering and was hoping to launch the offering in June, then considered the late summer, has now postponed it until at least September, sources said.  A secondary offering of General Motors (GM.N) shares by the U.S. Treasury also looks likely to be later than anticipated. The Treasury had around $15 billion of remaining shares to sell as of end-July, but GM’s market value is down 10 percent since then, cutting their value to around $13.5 billion.  The U.S. Treasury is also in the process of exiting its investment in insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N). Its $8.7 billion May share sale accounted for only about 15 percent of its stake in the company. It has billions more worth of stock to sell, but shares are now trading about 14 percent below their May offer price.  AIG Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche said on Thursday that he is closely watching the markets as he looks to float the company’s aircraft leasing unit ILFC as an IPO. The IPO could value the company at $8 to $10 billion, a source said previously.  Container leaser China Shipping Nauticgreen was among others shelving IPO plans, said IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.  “It’s not the right time to do it,” said one Hong Kong-based banker. “I would be cautious to rush the deals out now.”  Anglo-South African financial conglomerate Old Mutual (OML.L) (OMLJ.J) said market turmoil may delay a planned listing of its U.S. fund management business next year.  While there were no big European listings slated for August, with most bankers and investors on holiday, the rout has hit secondary sales and clouds hopes for a September IPO revival.  “We had been looking at a couple of bloc sales if there was a big rally post the debt ceiling (agreement) but ... markets are getting worse not better,” said one London-based banker.  Sentiment in the European listings market, which has seen more than 20 deals pulled this year, has been dented by poor post-IPO performance from all but a handful of companies.  Commodities trader Glencore (GLEN.L), whose $10 billion float is the world’s largest so far this year, has dropped 20 percent since its debut.  Several big deals are due after the summer, including the Spanish state lottery’s 7 billion euro ($9.9 billion) IPO. [ID:nL6E7J21IK]  “We have all got a massive pipeline of deals to launch in the first week of September, but the way the markets are at the moment I can only imagine it is going to be 50 percent done, 50 percent failed,” said the banker.  Siemens may delay the listing of its Osram lighting unit after its valuation plunged, while ING ING.AS said it would not launch the IPO of its insurance operations in these markets and may consider a sale instead.  China’s Everbright in June postponed the launch of the offering because of market conditions and was slated to begin a roadshow next week ahead of a planned listing on August 18, sources with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters.  The lender, which has secured $1.2 billion from cornerstone investors, could slash the deal to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and may head back to the market in September, said IFR.  An Everbright spokeswoman was not available for comment.  The slump in markets could also delay big-ticket secondary share sales in India’s leading state-run companies, which were expected to hit the market in the next few months, bankers said.  The government is now unlikely to meet its target of raising nearly $9 billion through share sales in public sector firms, including explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS) and Steel Authority of India (SAIL.NS), the bankers added.  Prolonged market turmoil could make it difficult for Bank of America (BAC.N) to exit its $17.5 billion holding in China Construction Bank (0939.HK) (601939.SS) when its lock-up expires at the end of August, analysts and bankers said. It had been expected to sell at least half its stake to boost its capital.  “You need some stability in the markets before investors look at deals again,” said one equity capital markets banker. “People are in a capital-protection mode now.”  Equity issuance in the Asia region excluding Japan rose 3.5 percent to $109.1 billion in the first half of the year, the second-highest for the six-month period since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data. Companies have unveiled plans for IPOs and follow-on deals of nearly $90 billion, the data showed.  Chinese banks and insurers alone plan to raise up to $35.4 billion in share sales in Hong Kong and China by the end of the year, while large nonfinancial deals include a $2.5 billion IPO by China Sinohydro Group, the builder of the Three Gorges dam.  Chinese firms can tap the domestic market, convertible bonds or private placement as other options, said Simon Yuan, Credit Suisse’s co-head of Financial Institutions Group, Asia Pacific.  “But if the market sentiment is really bearish none of this will work and the companies will have to slow down their pace of growth and preserve capital by cutting dividend payouts, etc.”  China Everbright Capital, China International Capital Corp, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), JP Morgan (JPM.N), UBS UBSN.VX, BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), BOC International, HSBC (HSBA.L) and Shenyin Wanguo were hired to manage the Everbright Bank offering.

65,AIG,AIG shares at 17-month low after earnings,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in bailed-out insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) hit a 17-month low on Friday, as analysts said that the company’s earnings were still complicated and that it warranted a discount to peers.  AIG reported a profit of $1.8 billion for the second quarter on Thursday, driven by its one-third stake in Asian insurer AIA and a tax benefit. Without those items, it would have posted a net loss, as operating income declined across all of its businesses.  AIG shares fell 2.4 percent to $25.76 in early trading. At one point the stock dropped as far as $25.14, its lowest point since early March 2010; it was the largest decliner among Standard & Poor’s insurance shares.  The stock has lost half its value this year, amid challenges including a huge charge to increase reserves for asbestos and other exposures, as well as short-selling pressure. The U.S. government still owns three-quarters of the company after its 2008 bailout.  S&P Equity Research kept a “buy” rating on the stock but said “there is still a lot of ‘noise’ in these results.”  Analyst Cathy Seifert cut her price target to $32, which assumes the stock trades at a discount to other insurers.  AIG shares are now more than $3 below the U.S. government’s break-even point on the stock. The government sold part of its stake in May and is expected to sell more later this year.

68,AIG,MetLife says asbestos claims on the rise," * Claims up 11 pct in first half of 2011   * Claims fell 40 percent from 2003 to 2010   * AIG, Hartford have boosted asbestos reserves this year   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Asbestos-related claims against MetLife Inc (MET.N) rose 11 percent in the first half of the year, the company said on Friday, mirroring recent comments by other large insurers who have experienced more claims than they expected.   MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, received 2,306 asbestos-related claims in the first half, up from 2,076 in the same period of 2010, the company said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   It did not offer details on the potential size of those claims or how that compares to claims from past years. MetLife’s new asbestos claims dropped at a steady pace from 2003 through 2010, falling 40 percent over the period.   MetLife has one of the longest and most complicated histories when it comes to asbestos and the insurance industry. Lawsuits have alleged that MetLife employees knew of the insulating material’s harmful health effects as early as the 1920s, claims the company has rejected.   This year, both American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Hartford Financial Services (HIG.N) have made substantial additions to their asbestos reserves, given an increase in claims and claim severity.   The industry argues that many of the new claims stem from plaintiffs’ lawyers becoming more effective at suing people who are only peripherally connected to asbestos victims. Late-night cable television is flooded with ads from asbestos lawyers, and “mesothelioma” is among the most valuable of advertising keywords on Google.   Yet even as claims rise, doctors say the actual incidence of asbestos-linked diseases like the lung cancer mesothelioma is on the decline. Doctors are being more aggressive in treating the cases that do pop up, though, which also contributes to elevated costs for insurers.   Ratings agency A.M. Best has said it expects the industry to ultimately face $75 billion in exposure to asbestos claims, and it has argued that some companies are still not fully reserved for claims they may experience.

69,AIG,"BofA plunges as AIG sues for $10 billion ""fraud""","NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp shares plunged more than 20 percent on Monday, capping a three-day rout in which the largest U.S. bank lost nearly one-third of its market value.  Monday’s decline was triggered by a $10 billion lawsuit from American International Group Inc alleging a “massive” mortgage fraud.  The action raised new concerns about burgeoning losses related to the bank’s $2.5 billion purchase of Countrywide Financial Corp in 2008 and prompted questions about the stability of the bank’s management team.  “The bank just can’t get its hands around the liabilities it’s facing,” said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.  He said investors fear the bank will have to raise equity to cover potential losses, diluting existing shareholdings.  Bank of America spokesman Jerry Dubrowski countered that the bank has adequate reserves to buy back mortgages if necessary and is comfortable with its strategic plans.  “We don’t think we need to raise capital to run our businesses,” he said. “We have the right strategy and management team in place.”  In a separate court filing on Monday AIG, challenged an $8.5 billion agreement Bank of America reached in late June to end litigation by several large investors who bought securities backed by subprime Countrywide loans.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and other investors have previously tried to block that accord, saying the settlement amount is too small.  Bank of America shares closed down $1.66 at $6.51 after earlier plunging to $6.31, their lowest since March 2009. More than $30 billion of the company’s market value has been wiped out since August 3.  Monday’s drop came amid a broad market selloff, led by financial stocks, on the first trading day after Standard & Poor’s downgraded its rating of U.S. government debt.  The shares of Citigroup Inc, another large bank, fell 16.4 percent to $27.95.  The cost of insuring Bank of America debt against default, an indicator of potential trouble at companies, rose roughly 50 percent on Monday to a level higher than several of the bank’s main rivals, data provider Markit said.  It now costs $310,000 a year to insure the bank’s bonds for five years, compared with $143,000 for the bonds of JP Morgan Chase & Co, the second largest U.S. bank.  AIG’s lawsuit also upped the ante for Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, who is struggling to contain losses from the Countrywide deal engineered by his predecessor, Kenneth Lewis.  “Brian Moynihan and the management team have not gained the confidence and trust of investors,” said Jonathan Finger, whose Finger Interests Number One Ltd in Houston owns BofA stock and was a vocal critic of Lewis.  Moynihan is scheduled to participate in a public conference call on Wednesday hosted by Fairholme Capital Management LLC, one of its largest shareholders.  “Brian will have to give the performance of his life,” said Tony Plath, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where Bank of America is based.  Moynihan’s saving grace might be that the bank’s board has no obvious candidates to replace him, said Miller of FBR Capital Markets.  Some large investors appeared to have avoided some of the debacle.  Hedge fund manager David Tepper, who has made a fortune betting against financial company shares, sold nearly half of his stake in Bank of America during the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing from his company, Appaloosa Management.  “Bank of America’s stock price will remain under duress,” said Michael Mullaney, who helps invest $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston and who said his company has sold nearly all its BofA shares.  Analysts said the market attack will get close scrutiny from U.S. regulators, given the size and importance of Bank of America to the banking system and the economy. The bank took $45 billion of federal bailout money during the financial crisis of 2008, which it later repaid.  “I have no doubt that the Fed and the Treasury Department are watching this closely,” said Bert Ely, an independent banking consultant.  A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a part of the Treasury Department that regulates national banks, declined to comment. The Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In its lawsuit, AIG accused Bank of America and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units of misrepresenting the quality of its mortgage-backed securities, including more than $28 billion bought by AIG. The insurer also said the bank lied to credit rating agencies about the underlying loans.  AIG said it examined 262,322 mortgages underlying 349 offerings bought between 2005 and 2007 and found 40.2 percent of the mortgages were significantly inferior to what had been represented.  “Defendants were engaged in a massive scheme to manipulate and deceive investors,” said the lawsuit, filed in a New York state court in Manhattan.  Bank of America said the insurer has only itself to blame.  “AIG recklessly chased high yields and profits throughout the mortgage and structured finance markets,” spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said. “It is the very definition of an informed, seasoned investor, with losses solely attributable to its own excesses and errors.”  The AIG lawsuit is the latest in a growing number from investors seeking to hold banks responsible for losses on soured mortgage securities that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.  AIG, which received $182.3 billion of government bailouts and is 77 percent owned by U.S. taxpayers, said in a statement it expects to pursue other litigation to recover losses from counterparties that “sought to profit at our expense.”  According to The New York Times, AIG is preparing a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which received $12.9 billion as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government bailouts. Goldman spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to comment.

71,AIG,IFR-Treasuries retain safe-haven status as investors flee risk," by Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Aug 8 (IFR) - Investors fled risk assets en masse on Monday and rushed into US Treasuries, the very securities that were downgraded to AA+ late Friday but still remain the largest, most liquid safe-haven.  The 10-year Treasury note rallied 22bp, sending its yield down to 2.33%, on fears the US and the global economy are headed toward a double-dip recession. Gold, the other key safe-haven asset, soared to $1,710 an ounce by mid-afternoon.  News of the downgrade by Standard & Poor’s hit all risk markets hard, not because it sparked forced selling, but because of expectations it will exacerbate already weak US consumer confidence. For more on the expected impact of the downgrade, see [ID:nN1E76R1IY].  Equities were already in selloff mode last week after a stream of gloomy economic releases. They continued to plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 311.74 points to 11,132.87 at last check.  The IG16 index, a measure of high grade corporate bond secondary levels, gapped out a staggering 7.75bp to 110.5bp, its widest level since mid-September last year. The HY16 index plunged 2.5 points to 94.438, its lowest level in twelve months.  New issue markets almost ground to a halt, with underwriters pulling about six investment grade deals expected to come today.  “The market is falling apart,” said one syndicate head. “Everything is wider in the secondary market. We had as many as four deals ready to go this morning and they all decided to stand down. Bank spreads are out by about 30bp and even the Wal-Marts (WMT.N) and Cokes (KO.N) have widened.”  Bankers and credit strategists view the downgrade of the US AAA rating by just one rating agency as the least of the US’s problems. The weak economy is still the major concern, along with Europe’s ability to deal with its debt crisis without choking off growth. There is also worry that monetary policy and quantitative easing have failed to encourage corporates to expand and create jobs.  “It (the selloff) is a confluence of recent events that has led to an elevated level of volatility and risk aversion,” said Edward Marrinan, chief credit strategist at RBS Securities.  “The downgrade of the US government credit rating, disappointing US economic data and fears that central banks have lost their ability to stimulate economic activity have compounded concerns around Europe’s sovereign debt crisis , prompting a flight to safe haven assets such as Treasuries and gold.”  FINANCIALS SLAMMED  RBS economists, like many on Wall Street, have revised their outlook for US economic growth downward. RBS is now forecasting a 2.4% growth rate for the second half and into 2012, compared with an earlier forecast of 3.2%.  “The problem of low GDP growth is that there is little cushion to absorb unexpected shocks to the economy; this raises the risk of a double dip recession,” said Marrinan.  The highest quality corporate bonds are expected to tighten as investors regain some calm and move back into the best A, AA and AAA names.  But if economic data continues to worsen, investors will have to factor in the possibility that top quality corporates will also be hurt.  Those concerns are behind the widening of yield spreads on top quality bonds today. Coca-Cola’s five- and 10-year bonds, issued last week, were barely wider from new issue spread, but had lost all of their after-market gains. The company’s 2021s, issued at 72 bp, were trading around 73bp at midday today, from as tight as 65bp last week.  The financial institutions group (FIG) space continued to be the hardest hit. The S&P financial stock index lost 8.3% of its value, and spreads of the biggest US banks widened as much as 30bp.  Even bank debt guaranteed by the government’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program widened about 3bp-10bp on news of the downgrade.  Bank of America (BAC.N) was worst hit, after AIG (AIG.N) brought a $10bn lawsuit against the bank, alleging massive fraud on mortgage debt. The bank’s 5% of 2021s were trading at 309bp over Treasuries, out from 260bp last Friday and a May new issue spread of 185bp.  “The market is looking ahead and risk of recession has increased, and a recession with a very low 10-year bond yields is very detrimental to the financials,” said Frederick Cannon, senior bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  Even the top quality FIG names like General Electric (GE.N) were hard hit. GE’s 5.265% 2021s, rated AA+, were trading at 185bp over Treasuries, from 165bp on Friday.  JP Morgan (JPM.N) bonds were also wider. The A+ rated 4.35% of 2021s, issued on August 3 at a yield spread of 175bp over Treasuries, were trading at 206bp today.  Some strategists are not expecting risk aversion to dissipate until there are solid signs of economic improvement in the US.  With the 10-year Treasury yielding 2.37%, however, credit investors aren’t expected to sit in Treasuries for too long.  “I’m still pretty sanguine on the high yield market, “ said a senior portfolio manager at one of the biggest asset management firms.  “High yield has cheapened up quite a bit, while the spread rally in Treasuries has out-weighed the spread widening in high grade corporates, meaning overall yield in that market is lower,” he said.  “That’s resulted in an explosion in the gap between triple-B and double-B yields.”  (Reporting by IFR senior reporter Danielle Robinson; Tel: 1-646-223-6141: Editing by Ciara Linnane)  (danielle.robinson@thomsonreuters.com; Reuters messaging; danielle.robinson.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))  For queries regarding this report, please contact ifrmarkets@thomsonreuters.com)  For other related fixed-income quotations, stories and guides to Reuters pages, please double click on the symbol:  U.S. corporate bond price quotations...NASDBONDS  U.S. credit default swap column........[CDV/]  U.S. credit default swap news..........[CDV]  European corporate bond market report..[EUB/]  European corporate bond market report..[EUB/]  Credit default swap guide..............CDSINDEX  Fixed income guide......BONDS  U.S. swap spreads report...............[SWP/]  U.S. Treasury market report............[US/]  U.S. Treasury outlook...[US/0]  U.S. municipal bond market report......[MUNI/] ",8082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-credit/ifr-treasuries-retain-safe-haven-status-as-investors-flee-risk-idUSN1E7771CW20110808
72,AIG,Top insurers plunge amid market rout,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of the largest U.S. insurers plunged on Monday, with some of the top names losing more than 10 percent, as the Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States’ credit rating rippled through the markets.  The S&P insurance index .GSPINSC fell 6.5 percent to its lowest level in two years. Every stock in the index was down, and only two — conglomerates Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and Loews Corp (L.N) — were down less than 5 percent.  The declines came amid a broad market plunge that saw the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI drop 500 points and the S&P 500 index .SPX lose more than 6 percent at one point.  The largest decliner in both the insurance index and the S&P 500 was mortgage and life insurer Genworth Financial (GNW.N), down 20.9 percent at $5.36 in afternoon trading.  Genworth has been under severe pressure of late as mortgage insurers report deteriorating market conditions that threaten their ability to survive. Genworth, which has said it may split in two, has lost half of its value in the last five weeks.  Other leading decliners included Hartford Financial (HIG.N), down 13 percent; AIG (AIG.N), down 11.1 percent; and MetLife (MET.N), 8.4 percent lower.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said early Monday the U.S. debt downgrade would not have any impact on insurance companies from a regulatory standpoint, easing fears they might be caught short of capital requirements by not having enough AAA-rated investments on their books.  However, analysts say it could matter from a valuation perspective, particularly if the price of U.S. debt falls and hurts the book value of insurance companies, which hold huge piles of U.S. Treasury securities.  “Since most property-casualty insurers trade on book value, the property-casualty stocks would thus also likely fall. Some investors continue to value life insurers on book value, so the life insurance stocks would probably fall as well,” analysts at Sandler O’Neill said in a research note.

73,AIG,"Bank of America shares fall on AIG lawsuit, economy","CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shares fell as much as 9.5 percent to their lowest level since April 2009 on Monday morning over fears of a slowing U.S. economy and challenges to a multi-billion dollar mortgage settlement.  Bank stocks broadly fell after Standard & Poor’s stripped the United States of its top credit rating and the European Central Bank intervened in bond markets, triggering fears that the global economy is destabilizing.  Bank of America’s shares fell more than most of its peers after insurer American International Group (AIG.N) said it would sue the bank to recoup more than $10 billion in mortgage bond losses.  Bank of America shares were down 8.4 percent at $7.48 in morning trading. The KBW Bank Index .BKX fell 2.97 percent.  Analysts said investors were reacting to the latest challenge to Bank of America’s $8.5 billion proposed settlement with mortgage investors over repurchasing toxic home loans.  “It makes investors question whether the bank will need to raise capital,” said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc analyst Jefferson Harralson.  Citigroup Inc (C.N) shares fell 5.4 percent to $31.60, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) fell 2.1 percent to $36.80 and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) shares dipped 1.3 percent to $24.87.

74,AIG,AIG to sue BofA over mortgage bonds: report,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurance giant American International Group (AIG.N) is planning to sue Bank of America (BAC.N) to recover more than $10 billion in losses on $28 billion of investment in mortgage-backed securities, the New York Times said citing three people with knowledge of the complaint.  AIG’s move adds to the surge of investors seeking compensation for the troubled mortgages that led to the financial crisis, the Times said.

76,AIG,BofA CEO Moynihan girds for investor grilling," * Faces most difficult analyst call of his career   * Must address capital, mortgage issues at BofA   * Presentation comes two days after 20 pct stock decline   * Employees get talking points for restive clients   * Shares rise nearly 17 pct on Tuesday   By Joe Rauch   CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 9 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan faces what might be the most important conference call of his career on Wednesday, when investors and analysts grill him about capital levels and profit outlook.   The bank has lost about a third of its market value recently and Moynihan’s repeated reassurances about the bank’s strength will not be enough, investors said. The call, organized by one of the bank’s biggest investors, is set to begin at 1 p.m. EDT. (1700 GMT)   “Moynihan has not done the kind of job that has brought a lot of believers,” said Greg Donaldson, founder of Evansville, Indiana-based Donaldson Capital Management, which has about $500 million under management and recently sold its Bank of America shares.   The bank has said it can raise whatever capital it needs through profit and can return to normal profit levels by 2013. Analysts have estimated the bank needs some $50 billion of additional capital to meet global requirements.   Bank of America also said it set aside $18 billion to buy back bad mortgages from investors, a number that quadrupled between the second quarter of this year and the same quarter last year, to the frustration of investors.   “It’s like a hall of mirrors. Every time you think you’re seeing reality, you’re seeing the image of something else,” Donaldson said.   BofA shares partially recovered on Tuesday after a 20 percent decline the day before. The bank’s shares rose nearly 17 percent, or $1.09, to close at $7.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. But the stock is still about 20 percent below its level on Aug. 3.   The conference call was arranged about a month ago at the request of Bank of America investor Fairholme Capital Management. But after the bank’s recent stock slide, there will be extra scrutiny of Moynihan’s comments.   One group of shareholders playing close attention to the call will be employees.   “Most of the factors driving market volatility are beyond our control,” wrote Moynihan in an internal message to staff obtained by Reuters.   “We continue to build our fortress balance sheet,” Moynihan said in the memo, adding the bank is continuing to execute its strategy and clients are doing more business with the bank.   The pressure on Moynihan is intense. He took over the bank in early 2010 from Ken Lewis, whose disastrous acquisitions forced Bank of America to receive multiple government bailouts. Moynihan has had some success, returning the bank to profitability as loan losses eased.   But the bank is still struggling to boost revenue and still making massive payouts to mortgage bond investors burned by investing in home loans made by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender Bank of America bought in 2008.   A Reuters poll of economists said the United States faces a one-in-four chance of slipping back into recession [ID:nL9E7I401E]. Slowing economic growth can only hurt Bank of America and the bank will likely face questions about the economy on Wednesday, analysts said.   WHACK-A-MOLE   The extent of the bank’s mortgage liabilities is difficult to forecast, as are Moynihan’s chances of survival. Every time the CEO succeeds in placating one group of investors, it seems that another one crops up.   In late June, Bank of America agreed to a $8.5 billion settlement with a group of mortgage bond investors. On Monday, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said it was the latest investor to challenge the settlement, which is subject to court approval. AIG also sued the bank for $10 billion, alleging a “massive” mortgage fraud. AIG also said in a separate filing on Monday that it is challenging the bank’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors over subprime mortgages.   “I don’t think anyone can put an estimate on how much Bank of America’s legal liability will be,” said Blake Howells, director of equity research, Becker Capital Management in Portland Oregon.   Becker Capital might look at buying Bank of America shares, but only if it has more confidence about the bank’s potential litigation payouts, Howells said. Court approval of the $8.5 billion settlement would help, he added.   Moynihan said the bank’s “customer-focused strategy is working,” but some employees disagree.   One Merrill Lynch broker in New York state said many of his clients are asking about the stability of the firm and the bank is offering talking points to its employees to answer questions.   “The bank says we’re building a fortress balance sheet and maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not. What’s irrefutable is that losses and lawsuits are coming out of the woodwork,” the broker said.   The adviser, who is among the top third revenue producers in the Merrill system, said one client with $50 million in a Bank of America account and $30 million in his brokerage account is on the verge of moving money from the bank to competitors.

77,AIG,UPDATE 1-Moynihan tells staff that BofA on right path," * Moynihan says unsettling times for clients and staff   * CEO says bank taking aggressive action on legacy issues   * Reassures staff the bank will weather latest crisis  (Adds comments from Merrill brokers, Krawcheck video)   By Joseph A. Giannone   NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - With Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) stock in freefall, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan moved to reassure employees the beleaguered bank was on the right path and could weather the current storm.   “We are aggressively taking action to put the legacy mortgage issues behind the company — even at great short-term cost — and to help get the U.S. housing market going again,” he said in a letter to nearly 288,000 employees late on Monday. “We have weathered challenging times before and we will now.”   The largest commercial bank’s stock price sank 20 percent on Monday to its lowest level since the end of March 2009, a period when many investors were worried the U.S. government might nationalize BofA and other banks saddled under unwanted mortgage and credit assets.   Now Moynihan, his bank besieged by a weak economy choppy markets and an unending stream of litigation and regulatory probes, is under the gun to restore market confidence.   “This is an unsettling time — not just for our shareholders, but also for all of our teammates,” he wrote.   Moynihan’s letter is part of a full-court press by Bank of America management to soothe customers and employees.   Bank of America wealth and investment management president, Sallie Krawcheck early on Monday taped a message of reassurance for the bank’s Merrill Lynch, U.S. Trust and retirement services advisers and employees.   Underscoring the importance of calming the troops: Krawcheck and other Merrill executives on Friday canceled a teleconference with the press scheduled for Monday morning to discuss a quarterly survey of the views of affluent investors.   Moynihan in his letter said the bank has built a “fortress balance sheet” with capital ratios much stronger than they were during the financial crisis of 2008. Uncle Sam was forced to inject $45 billion into a BofA hobbled by its Countrywide takeover and the pending rescue of Merrill Lynch.   With the exception of the mortgage business, slammed by weak home prices and ongoing fallout from the 2008 crisis, Bank of America’s businesses are all in the black, he said.   Stocks broadly have plunged in the past week, capped off by frenzied selling on Monday after Standard & Poor’s cut its rating on U.S. government debt to AA-plus.   “Without a doubt, these are challenging, perhaps unprecedented times,” Krawcheck said, moderating a video with the firm’s investment strategists posted on a Merrill client website Tuesday.   Bank of America itself has been clobbered by a barrage of negative news. On Monday insurance giant American International Group (AIG.N) sued BofA seeking $10 billion for losses on mortgage-backed securities.   Amid a broad rally in U.S. stocks Tuesday, Bank of America shares rose 3.7 percent to $6.75 a share in afternoon trade, however, that is still just one third its June 30 reported book value of $20.29 a share.   One Merrill broker in New York said many clients are asking questions about the stability of Bank of America. The firm has distributed “talking points” to help advisers address fears.   “The bank says we’re building a fortress balance sheet and maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not. What’s irrefutable is that losses and lawsuits are coming out of the woodwork,” said the broker, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly about internal matters.   Another broker, a member of Merrill’s “Chairman’s Club” of top producers, said BofA “can’t stay out of the news,” but added he has not received calls from worried clients.   “Maybe they’re jaded. There’s been so much negativity surrounding stocks and the bank,” said the second broker. Also, Merrill’s brokerage business is performing well.   BofA’s wealth management division generated $506 million of profit in the second quarter, when the company as a whole posted a $7.4 billion loss on mortgage-related losses.   Moynihan said capital and cash levels were higher than a year ago and that most legacy mortgage issues were resolved.   “Most of the factors driving market volatility are beyond our control,” he said, “but for matters within our control, we are taking action.”   The outreach continues Wednesday, when Moynihan will submit to a public grilling from Fairholme Capital founder Bruce Berkowitz, whose hedge fund is among BofA’s top shareholders.

78,AIG,"COLUMN-On a dark day, BofA's dim ray of hope: Alison Frankel","   -- Alison Frankel writes the On the Case blog for Thomson Reuters News & Insight (newsandinsight.com). The views expressed are her own. --   By Alison Frankel   NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Monday was (another) dreadful day for Bank of America (BAC.N). The bank’s shares closed at a two-year low, thanks in part to AIG’s (AIG.N) double whammy: a $10 billion fraud suit against BofA and the insurer’s simultaneous motion to intervene in opposition to BofA’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with Countrywide mortgage-backed securities noteholders. Bank of America and Countrywide’s securitization trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, thought the $8.5 billion deal would put their MBS woes behind them. Instead the proposed settlement seems to have made the two banks into bigger targets than they were before reaching an agreement with 22 big MBS investors.   There’s plenty of reason for BofA to worry about the AIG fraud suit. First off, the New York state court complaint was filed by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a familiar opponent for Bank of America. Quinn is counsel to the bond insurer MBIA in its MBS litigation against Countrywide, in which Judge Eileen Bransten has consistently sided with MBIA and Quinn Emanuel. (Among other crucial rulings, Bransten rejected Bank of America’s preliminary argument that it’s not liable for Countrywide’s missteps.) Quinn also represents Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which forced Bank of America into a $2.8 billion dollar settlement of MBS claims in January, and Allstate, which filed a $700 million MBS case against Countrywide in December. Different Quinn Emanuel lawyers are involved in the various BofA and Countrywide cases, but the firm isn’t starting from scratch.   The AIG fraud complaint is also a canny document. The suit lumps together allegations against Countrywide, Merrill Lynch, and BofA, painting all of them with the same tarry brush even though Countrywide and Merrill Lynch committed a good chunk of the alleged wrongdoing before they became part of BofA. Quinn includes public record information about their manifestly deficient underwriting practices, but has brought the case as a fraud suit-not a contract case accusing BofA, Countrywide, and Merrill of breaching the representations and warranties on the mortgage loans underlying the securitizations AIG invested in. That way, AIG doesn’t have to show that it controls 25 percent of the voting rights, the threshold for standing in a securitization contract case. But under the causes of action the complaint asserts — state-law claims and federal claims under the Securities Act of 1933 — Quinn Emanuel doesn’t have to show that BofA, Countrywide, and Merrill acted with fraudulent intent.   Quinn partners Michael Carlinsky and Philippe Selendy, who signed the AIG complaint, also undoubtedly know that even if Bank of America’s $8.5 billion settlement is approved by Manhattan state supreme court judge Barbara Kapnick, their fraud case won’t be wiped out. BofA’s deal with the 22 MBS noteholders who negotiated the proposed settlement is expressly limited to investors’ breach-of-warranty claims. It doesn’t resolve securities fraud claims; in fact, three of the investors backing the proposed settlement have since sued Countrywide for fraud.   That’s why it’s so interesting that AIG filed its motion to intervene in the proposed settlement on the same day that it filed the fraud suit. The intervention petition, filed not by Quinn Emanuel but by Reilly Pozner, raises the now-familiar assertions that investors aren’t getting a big enough cash payout and that Bank of New York Mellon had a conflict in negotiating the deal because BofA agreed to indemnify BNY Mellon in a side-letter. But AIG is the first objector also to take aim at Gibbs & Bruns, the law firm that’s counsel to the 22 institutional investors that negotiated the proposed settlement.   “The genesis of the proposed settlement agreement appears to be an exclusive group of investors and their outside counsel, who without the participation of the other beneficiaries and with the blessing and cooperation of [BNY Mellon] as trustee, engaged in clandestine settlement negotiations with [BofA],” the petition said. “These discussions culminated in a settlement proposal that, if approved, would result in thousands of affected beneficiaries receiving a small fraction of their losses, while the inside institutional investors’ outside counsel would be paid $85 million — not from her clients but from [BofA].” That fee arrangement, AIG argues, means Gibbs & Bruns had an $85 million conflict in reaching a deal with Bank of America. (Gibbs partner Kathy Patrick told me the fee deal is “very typical in bondholder cases.” She said her clients, all experienced litigants, insisted that Bank of America pay Gibbs & Bruns fees rather than take money out of the settlement pool to pay the lawyers. “It’s in the best interests of investors,” Patrick said.)   So where, you may be wondering, is that ray of hope I mentioned in the headline? It’s in a two-page order Kapnick entered in the MBS settlement docket Monday, after presiding over a mobbed hearing Friday. The judge agreed that her original order calling for investors to register objections by Aug. 30 had to be modified because noteholders may not know by then whether they like the proposed deal. She ruled that any investor who wants a say in the case need only file a written notice of intervention, not a formal objection. But she rejected all of the intervenors’ demands for expedited discovery and left in place the August 30 deadline for investors to file intervention notices. Settlement proponents claimed that as a win.   “The court acted swiftly to address an issue that needed to be addressed,” said Patrick of Gibbs & Bruns. “We’re pleased that she indicated the case is going to move rapidly and that she left the existing deadline in place.”   Patrick said that deal supporters were encouraged by Friday’s hearing, at which Judge Kapnick seemed to be well-versed in the filings and eager to move things along. A transcript suggests that Gibbs & Bruns; BofA counsel from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; and BNY Mellon lawyers from Mayer Brown took a smart course when they filed the case as an Article 77 trust proceeding, under which the court is supposed to pay deference to the trustee unless objectors can show the trustee acted unreasonably or breached its duty.   “That’s the proceeding they brought,” Kapnick said, after noting that she had to look up the obscure Article 77 in the New York code. “It’s not, it’s not a class action. There aren’t provisions in there to opt out that you are talking about.  That’s not what this is. If you started it, maybe that’s what you would have done, but they started it and that’s what they did. I have to work, at least now, within the confines of the proceeding that is before me.” (A lawyer from the New York Attorney General’s office was at the hearing, according to the transcript, but didn’t remind Judge Kapnick that the case now has additional fraud and Martin Act implications, thanks to the AG’s counterclaims against BNY Mellon.)   Patrick told me she believes the judge will look hard at AIG’s objection, given that it was filed on the same day as the insurers’ fraud suit against BofA. “There’s a serious question about whether AIG is acting to serve other litigation goals,” Patrick said.   And on a day when all else is bleak in BofA land, one judge offering a bit of scrutiny to allegations that harm the bank looks like sunshine.

79,AIG,IPO view: Bankers grumble as United States bargains on fees,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Treasury Department may be playing undertaker to the underwriter.  Talk to any investment banker and they will tell you how banks are barely making any money selling Treasury’s shares in bailed-out companies like General Motors Co (GM.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N).  Underwriting fees on recent deals as the U.S. government sells out of companies it rescued during the financial crisis have  reached an all-time low.  As the Treasury thinks about selling the billions worth of shares that remain, Wall Street bankers worry that they make even less on those deals than they did before.  “It gets to the point for some of these Wall Street firms where the equities divisions may say, ‘Do I really care about this business? Because I’m not going to make any money,” one banker said.  The standard formula for fees in a secondary offering is about half of what’s paid in an initial public offering. But the base is already low in government deals.  AIG set the fees at 0.5 percent for its $8.7 billion offering in May. GM paid 0.75 percent for the common stock portion of its record-setting $23.1 billion IPO in November — far below a typical fee of 2 percent to 3 percent for an offering of that size, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The fee on the planned IPO of Ally Financial, another bailed out firm, is 0.875 percent.  At 0.75 percent, underwriters earned $136 million in fees from the common stock portion of GM’s IPO. Out of these proceeds, banks pay attorneys and internal staff, as well as roughly half of investor roadshow expenses such as hotels, meals and jets. That would likely still leave money on the table but not as much as bankers are used to.  “Government fees were going to be lower no matter what; the question was how much lower,” said another investment banker who asked not to be identified.  “The GM IPO at 75 basis points was essentially uneconomic for the firms that spent all the time doing it, given how many man-hours went into it,” the banker said. “But you do it because it’s the government, and it’s high-profile.”  Deals of such magnitude don’t come by often, the average size of U.S. IPOs is just over $310 million this year, so being on them also means a bump up in league tables, the adviser rankings that give banks marketing ammunition to court clients.  It’s a reality not lost on the Treasury Department.  “As much as they hate to do deals for 50 basis points, they need league tables,” said a person familiar with the Treasury’s thinking.  There are no signs that large private issuers have taken the cue from the government in seeking lower fees.  U.S. IPO fees have remained stable at 5 percent to 7 percent in the last 10 years, compared to 2.5 percent to 4 percent in Europe and 2.5 percent to 6 percent in China, according to Freeman & Co. Jumbo equity deals pay a lower fee than average.  When Treasury interviewed bankers to lead GM’s IPO in May of last year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), offered to do the deal for 0.75 percent, while others suggested 2 percent to 2.5 percent.  Treasury officials, who picked Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) as lead underwriters, used the Goldman bid to get the bank’s rival to offer lower fees for the work.  “There have been lots of big deals throughout history and no one has pulled the low fee card,” the second banker said. “Yes, Goldman Sachs pushed fee down (in GM’s IPO), but they didn’t get the lead role for doing that.”  One factor that may go in the favor of banks this time could be the challenges facing GM and AIG, which makes both companies a harder sell to investors.  GM’s shares, which have mostly traded below the IPO price of $33, are trading at less than $25 amid global market upheaval. AIG has fared no better, with the stock around $23 after being stuck in the $29 per share range for months.  Before the IPO, GM was touted as a restructured company, but nine months later, the automaker faces various problems.  AIG has had a tough year too, boosting its reserves for asbestos and environmental claims. Its property-casualty insurance unit Chartis has been stung by natural disasters around the world.  “Treasury will use all of the pressure to bring the fee down, but you know it depends on how difficult the offering is,” a third investment banker said.

80,AIG,IPO VIEW-Bankers grumble as United States bargains on fees," * GM, AIG follow-on deals to see lower underwriting fees   * Big govt deals offer prestige, leg up in league tables   * No ripple effect so far on large corporate deals   By Soyoung Kim and Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department may be playing undertaker to the underwriter.   Talk to any investment banker and they will tell you how banks are barely making any money selling Treasury’s shares in bailed-out companies like General Motors Co (GM.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N).   Underwriting fees on recent deals as the U.S. government sells out of companies it rescued during the financial crisis have have reached an all-time low.   As the Treasury thinks about selling the billions worth of shares that remain, Wall Street bankers worry that they make even less on those deals than they did before.   “It gets to the point for some of these Wall Street firms where the equities divisions may say, ‘Do I really care about this business? Because I’m not going to make any money,” one banker said.   The standard formula for fees in a secondary offering is about half of what’s paid in an initial public offering. But the base is already low in government deals.   AIG set the fees at 0.5 percent for its $8.7 billion offering in May. GM paid 0.75 percent for the common stock portion of its record-setting $23.1 billion IPO in November — far below a typical fee of 2 percent to 3 percent for an offering of that size, according to Thomson Reuters data.   The fee on the planned IPO of Ally Financial, another bailed out firm, is 0.875 percent.   At 0.75 percent, underwriters earned $136 million in fees from the common stock portion of GM’s IPO.

81,AIG,Banks pushing for legal shield on mortgages,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks still wrestling with legal troubles springing from the subprime mortgage crisis are lobbying the new consumer agency for strong legal protection for future home loans.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is finalizing a proposal to entice banks to offer straightforward loans — without interest-only payments and excessive fees — by providing a legal shield. The question is whether to give banks full protection, known as a “safe harbor,” or a more limited legal shelter.  “It is critically important that the final rule provide a safe harbor,” Bank of America Corp wrote in a July 22 letter. “If the final requirements instead increase the liability exposure of creditors ... the result will be increased costs and further reduction in credit availability to the very consumers that the reforms were designed to protect.”  The Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule on the matter earlier this year, but then punted it to the consumer agency, which now has jurisdiction. The agency, which was created by the Dodd-Frank oversight law, opened its doors on July 21.  This rule will be one of the first big tests of how tough the consumer agency will be on mortgage markets.  The proposal has already launched a flurry of letters from large banks such as Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp.  Those banks and others are hobbled by stalled foreclosures nationwide due to legal questions and multibillion-dollar lawsuits from investors such as American International Group Inc that claim the quality of securities backing the mortgages was misrepresented.  The banks argue the safe harbor for future high-quality loans would promote lending and assure investors who buy mortgage-backed securities that legal battles are not on the horizon.  On the other side of the issue, consumer advocates charge banks want to take away one of the few legal tools available to borrowers who believe a lender pulled a fast one on them.  “The bureau’s position on this rule will be an indicator of its ability to work independently of the bank lobby,” said Alys Cohen, a staff attorney for consumer advocacy group the National Consumer Law Center.  The consumer agency is expected to issue a final regulation by early next year.  An agency spokeswoman declined to comment.  The rule is required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law passed after lenders in the lead up to the financial crisis extended billions of dollars of high-risk mortgages to high-risk borrowers.  On its face, the purpose of this specific rule is forehead-smacking simple: lenders should take steps to make sure a borrower can repay a loan by verifying a range of employment and personal financial data. It also says banks should be given incentives to extend loans free of risky traits such as negative amortization or balloon payments.  When it issued the proposed rule earlier this year, the Fed said the law was unclear about what legal protection should be given to these loans and asked for for comment on two suggestions. The first is a legal safe harbor, while the second would give a borrower more latitude to challenge whether a bank did all it should to comply with the law.  The consumer bureau does not have to take an either-or approach on the proposals offered by the Fed. It could, for instance, choose a compromise solution such as beefing up the underwriting standards a loan would have to meet if it goes for the safe harbor option.  Banks warn that, when making a final decision, the agency should keep in mind the last thing the fragile housing market needs is less certainty about loans.  “Any further contraction caused by undue litigation risk will exacerbate these problems,” JPMorgan Chase wrote last month.  Consumer groups say banks overstate the risks and fall back on their warning that credit could be restricted.  “They always say this will dry up the market,” Kathleen Keest of the Center for Responsible Lending said. “As I like to remind them, the first time it dried up was when they were free to do what they want.”  ",8112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-regulation-mortgages/banks-pushing-for-legal-shield-on-mortgages-idUSTRE77A52W20110811

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is finalizing a proposal to entice banks to offer straightforward loans — without interest-only payments and excessive fees — by providing a legal shield.

84,AIG,Berkowitz's Fairholme slashes U.S. stock holdings," NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme Capital Group roughly halved its U.S. stock holdings in the second quarter by moving some of its money into more concentrated bets like insurer American International Group (AIG.N), according to a regulatory filing.   The Miami-based money-management firm’s equity stake in AIG nearly doubled to about 103 million shares in the quarter ended June 30, Fairholme’s most recent 13-F filing shows.   However, Fairholme no longer held about 23 million in warrants in AIG, at the end of the second quarter. It is possible some of those warrants were converted into common stock in the period.   Berkowitz’s firm also added shares of Assured Guaranty (AGO.N), a new position in the second quarter.   Overall, Fairholme now has stakes in 20 U.S. listed companies, down from 28 companies at the end of the first quarter.   Some of the stocks Berkowitz’s firm eliminated from its portfolio include Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), Astrazeneca (ASTR.NS) and Bristol-Meyers Squibb, according to the filing.   The filing shows that Berkowitz, in the second quarter, had remained as bullish as ever on troubled lender Bank of America (BAC.N). As of June 30, the number of Bank of America shares owned by Fairholme stood at 99 million, up slightly from the end of the first quarter.   His position in Florida real estate concern St. Joe Co also was largely unchanged at 26.6 million.

85,AIG,Chubb sues insurers over Deutsche building cleanup," * Claims it has paid more than its share of costs   * More than 300 workers have sued over exposure   NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Insurance company Chubb Corp (CB.N) has filed suit against more than 20 companies over the cleanup of the Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) buildings in lower Manhattan, claiming it had to pay more than its fair share of Deutsche’s defense costs.   The lawsuit, filed Monday in New York state court, alleges that Chubb has had to pay out about $5 million so far, representing roughly one-third of Deutsche’s defense tab, which it argued “is significantly more than its proportionate or fair share of the underlying defense costs.”   The lead defendant in the suit is Commerce and Industry Insurance Co, a unit of the global insurer AIG (AIG.N). An AIG spokesman was not immediately available to comment.   The two Deutsche buildings were damaged in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Deutsche Bank subsequently decided to demolish the buildings and hired contractors to perform the work.   According to the Chubb suit, 327 workers who took part in the demolition work later sued Deutsche Bank over their exposure to contaminants.   Chubb said its Federal Insurance Co unit received its first notification of a lawsuit in November 2004 and has continued to receive them since. It is asking the court to order that the other insurers who wrote policies for Deutsche Bank share in the defense bill proportionately.   The case is Federal Insurance Co. vs. Commerce and Industry Insurance Co. et al, Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, No. 652275/2011.

86,AIG,UPDATE 4-Company auditors may need term limits -US watchdog," * PCAOB considers limiting years for U.S. audit firms   * PCAOB head says auditors are under pressure   * Study could affect the way Big Four firms do business (Adds comment from audit industry group)   By Dena Aubin   NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Accounting firms are doing a less-than-adequate job auditing corporations, and term limits should be considered to ensure more independence, the head of the main U.S. audit industry watchdog group said on Tuesday.   “The very size, complexity and systemic risk found in today’s issuer population supports the need for reconsideration of audit firm rotation,” James Doty, chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, said at a meeting of the board.   The PCAOB, which inspects audit firms across the United States, has found hundreds of audit failures and “it’s hard not to question” whether lack of a properly skeptical attitude among auditors contributed to the problems, Doty said.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX on auditing terms in the news [ID:nN1E77B0IM]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  The PCAOB is considering whether to limit the number of years an audit firm can work for the same client — an action that could break up some business relationships more than a century old. About 175 companies in the S&P 500 index have had the same auditor for 25 years or more, according to data from Audit Analytics.   Many large companies that failed or required government support during the 2008 credit crisis, including Lehman Brothers, AIG and Merrill Lynch, had long-running relationships with their auditors, a PCAOB subcommittee reported in March.   Auditor rotation could mean the loss of some of the highest-fee clients for the Big Four auditors — Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC — which check the books of most public companies.   Some PCAOB board members questioned how effective auditor rotation would be and whether the mandatory switch every so many years would justify the disruptions and costs of auditor changes.   “I have serious doubts that mandatory rotation is a practical or cost-effective way of strengthening independence,” board member Daniel Goelzer said.   Firm rotation would not be cheap, Goelzer said, citing a 2003 U.S. General Accounting Office survey of auditors, who estimated that getting up to speed on new clients could increase first-year audit costs by 20 percent.   A cost-benefit analysis should be central to any study of auditor rotation, Cindy Fornelli, executive director of the accounting industry’s Center for Audit Quality, said in a statement.   “It is important that any new requirements in this area, including mandatory firm rotation, meet the objective of improving audit quality,” Fornelli said.   The board voted to seek public comment through Dec. 14 on a “concept release,” or initial report on auditor rotation and other ways of assuring auditor independence. A concept release is the first step in drafting changes in auditor standards.   Considered as early as the 1970s, auditor rotation has drawn strong opposition from auditors, who say it would be disruptive because of the time needed to become familiar with new clients. The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley act, which created the PCAOB, mandated that lead audit partners be switched after five years but put no term limits on the audit firms. For details click on [ID:nN1E7700DY].   Doty pledged the PCAOB would take care to “first do no harm,” but added, “If not mandatory rotation, then what?”   One alternative might be to selectively require rotation when audit failures occur and long auditor tenures seem to have played a role, Goelzer said.   If auditors knew they might lose a client when they were not skeptical enough, “we might stimulate a change in mental attitude” without imposing auditor rotation across the board, he said.   Though there may be a learning curve when a new auditor starts a job, Doty said companies have changed auditors in large numbers in the past.   Between 2003 and 2006, more than 6,500 public companies, or nearly 52 percent of public companies, changed auditors, Doty said, citing data from research firm Glass Lewis.   “The learning curve and cost-based issues involved in changing audit firms cannot be fairly described as uncharted waters,” he said.   One way of easing the transition might be to require more communication between incoming and outgoing audit firms, PCAOB staff members said.

88,AIG,Fairholme AIG stake will not trigger rights plan," * Held 103.2 million shares at June 30   * 5.4 pct stake spread among various entities   * Fairholme remains second-largest holder   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Fairholme Capital Management increased its stake in bailed-out insurer AIG (AIG.N) past the 5 percent threshold in the second quarter, though the position will not trigger a shareholder rights plan that AIG established to preserve valuable tax assets.   Fairholme, which was already AIG’s largest shareholder after the U.S. government, held 103.2 million shares as of June 30, according to a quarterly holdings statement filed on Monday.   Based on American International Group’s July 29 share count, that would represent a stake of 5.44 percent. In theory, someone crossing a 5 percent stake could trigger a rights plan, established in March, designed to prevent any shareholder from acquiring control of the company.   If any one shareholder did cross that line, AIG said at the time, it could conflict with certain change-of-control provisions under U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules. That could in turn restrict AIG’s ability to use its accumulated tax losses to offset future profits.   Those tens of billions of dollars in deferred tax assets are highly valuable — in the second quarter alone, AIG booked more than $500 million in net profit from releasing some of the assets. Because of them, the company will effectively not pay tax for years.   But Fairholme said the plan was not triggered by its holdings.   “No legal entity owns more than five percent,” Fairholme head Bruce Berkowitz said Tuesday by e-mail via a spokeswoman.   Even if a single Fairholme entity had crossed the line, the rights plan would not be automatically triggered. AIG’s board would have to decide to activate the plan, a move it would not be expected to take until a shareholder was closer to actually achieving control of the company.   An AIG spokesman declined comment.

89,AIG,Insurers may escape capital surcharges from global regulators,"TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - New rules to ensure no insurance company is too big to fail are set to be drawn up in time for the 2012 meeting of G20 leaders, although unlike banks they may not include capital surcharges, according to industry supervisors.  The proposed new rules, which the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is helping to draw up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB), are aimed at preventing a repeat of the problems seen at insurer AIG, which required a rescue by the U.S. government during the 2008 financial crisis.  The FSB and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision set out their plans in July to boost the loss absorbency capacity of the world’s largest banks through capital surcharges, but said work on other financial firms, including insurers, was ongoing.  Yoshihiro Kawai, secretary general of the IAIS, told Reuters that it would be likely that the measures for determining if any insurers are global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) and how they should be regulated would be finalized in time for the G20 meeting in Mexico next year.  “We’ve had discussions with the FSB and they have agreed we can develop our policy measures as well as indicators and methodologies to assess which insurers are G-SIFIs, if any, by sometime next year,” he said via a telephone interview.  Insurers judged to be systemically important may not be subject to the type of capital surcharges imposed on banks.  A source at a national regulator told Reuters that supervisors are not yet clear whether the capital surcharge is necessary to try to curb the risks to the financial system posed by large insurers.  The source said that since insurers do not pay out money until there has been some kind of accident, disaster, injury, or death, regulators recognize that they cannot be subject to a run on their money in the same way as banks.  The IAIS’s Kawai said no decision has yet been made, but that there are other criteria likely to be more important than capital surcharges to bolster the regulation of systematically important insurers.  “There are three important policy measures for G-SIFIs. One is higher loss absorbency (capital surcharges), another is intensity of supervision and the third one is the resolution regime. There should not be any institution which is too big to fail,” he said.  “I think the last two measures, resolution regimes and intensity of supervision, may apply to insurance G-SIFIS, if any, in particular.”  Kawai said the differing business model of insurance compared to banking means criteria used to determine which insurers are systemically important would be different to that used for banks.  The source at the national regulator said that after the restructuring of AIG there might be no insurers which at present meet the criteria of being globally systemic. As a result, the new rule might be just preventative.  Kawai said the criteria are yet to be decided, but added that the focus is likely to be on the extent to which an insurer is engaged in non-traditional forms of the business such as credit default swaps and other credit-related insurance activities.  “Generally speaking if insurance companies operate a traditional business, we are convinced that they do not create systemic risk,” he said.  “The key issue is how much non-traditional business they are carrying on and that is an important factor to assess the systemic relevance of insurance,” he said.

90,AIG,Big insurers may escape capital surcharges from global regulators," * Rules likely to be drawn up next year   * Focus on insurers engaged in “non-traditional” activities   * Possible that no insurers classed as risk to finance system    By Noriyuki Hirata and Rachel Armstrong	   TOKYO/SINGAPORE Aug 16 (Reuters) - New rules to ensure no insurance company is too big to fail are set to be drawn up in time for the 2012 meeting of G20 leaders, although unlike banks they may not include capital surcharges, according to industry supervisors. 	   The proposed new rules, which the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is helping to draw up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB), are aimed at preventing a repeat of the problems seen at insurer AIG , which required a rescue by the U.S. government during the 2008 financial crisis. 	   The FSB and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision set out their plans in July to boost the loss absorbency capacity of the world’s largest banks through capital surcharges, but said work on other financial firms, including insurers, was ongoing.  	   Yoshihiro Kawai, secretary general of the IAIS, told Reuters that it would be likely that the measures for determining if any insurers are global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) and how they should be regulated would be finalised in time for the G20 meeting in Mexico next year. 	   “We’ve had discussions with the FSB and they have agreed we can develop our policy measures as well as indicators and methodologies to assess which insurers are G-SIFIs, if any, by sometime next year,” he said via a telephone interview.	   Insurers judged to be systemically important may not be subject to the type of capital surcharges imposed on banks. 	   A source at a national regulator told Reuters that  supervisors are not yet clear whether the capital surcharge is necessary to try to curb the risks to the financial system posed by large insurers.	   The source said that since insurers do not pay out money until there has been some kind of accident, disaster, injury, or death, regulators recognize that they cannot be subject to a run on their money in the same way as banks.

91,AIG,Senator Grassley probes document destruction at SEC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator is asking securities regulators for answers after an internal whistleblower alleged the Securities and Exchange Commission has destroyed over 9,000 investigation-related records.  Senator Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter on Wednesday asking SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro about the alleged destruction of so-called “matters under inquiry.” MUIs are preliminary documents the SEC compiles when it receives evidence of possible securities violations.  In his letter, Grassley says that Darcy Flynn, a 13-year veteran of the SEC, had alerted him to the problem.  Flynn told Grassley the SEC has destroyed files on important, high-profile cases including Bernard Madoff, Goldman Sachs trading in AIG credit-default swaps, alleged frauds at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and insider-trading probes at Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers and the hedge fund SAC Capital.  “From what I’ve seen, it looks as if the SEC might have sanctioned some level of case-related document destruction,” Grassley said in a statement.  “It doesn’t make sense that an agency responsible for investigations would want to get rid of potential evidence. If these charges are true, the agency needs to explain why it destroyed documents, how many documents it destroyed over what timeframe, and to what extent its actions were consistent with the law.”  SEC spokesman John Nester said that the agency does retain records of its matters under inquiry, but noted that “not every document that comes into an agency’s possession in the course of its work must be retained.” He declined to comment further in advance of the SEC’s response to Grassley.  In his letter, Grassley asks the SEC to discuss whether it routinely destroys documents and what its legal obligations are to retain certain records.  He asked to receive the information by the end of the month.  ",8172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-grassley/senator-grassley-probes-document-destruction-at-sec-idUSTRE77G66120110817

Lynch   WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission violated federal rules when it destroyed investigative records over a 17-year period, the agency that safeguards federal documents said on Thursday.   “The SEC did not have the authority to dispose of them per the Federal Records Act,” the National Archives said in a statement to the press.   The National Archives added that the SEC has since mended its ways, although it still has lingering concerns that “the SEC has been slow” in creating record schedules to determine how long the data must be retained on file.   The findings by the National Archives come after Darcy Flynn, a 13-year-veteran of the SEC, decided to blow the whistle after learning the SEC had destroyed over 9,000 “matters under inquiry,” or MUIs. MUIs are preliminary documents the SEC compiles when it receives evidence of possible securities violations.   In a letter Flynn sent to Senator Charles Grassley, he claimed the SEC destroyed files on important, high-profile cases, including Bernard Madoff, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), trading in American International Group Inc (AIG.N) credit-default swaps, alleged frauds at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and insider-trading probes at Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Lehman Brothers and hedge fund SAC Capital.   Grassley sent a letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro on Wednesday asking questions about the document destruction.   Separately, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz said his office has also been probing the document destruction and plans to issue the findings of his investigation by the end of September.   “We maintain records of our inquiries and they are available to investigators across the agency,” SEC spokesman John Nester said in a statement. “As NARA notes, it works with federal agencies on a regular basis to resolve allegations and we are committed to that process.”   (Reporting by Sarah N.

95,AIG,AIG repays government another $2.15 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group said on Thursday it closed the sale of its Taiwanese life insurance business and used the proceeds to repay the government another $2.15 billion.  The money went toward paying down the government’s preferred interest in the entity that controls AIG’s one-third stake in Asian insurer AIA Group, which AIG spun off in an initial public offering last year.  AIG’s bailout at one point totaled $182.3 billion. The government’s investment now stands at $51 billion — the 77 percent of AIG’s common stock held by the U.S. Treasury, and the remaining $9.3 billion in preferred interests in the AIA entity.  AIG said it closed the sale of Nan Shan to Ruen Chen Investment Holding for $2.16 billion cash. The Nan Shan sale was prolonged by the Taiwanese government’s rejection of AIG’s first-choice buyer.  With Nan Shan closed, AIG’s last major disposal will be International Lease Finance Corp, or ILFC, which buys airplanes and leases them to airlines. The company is looking at an IPO for ILFC later this year.  The proceeds of the ILFC sale may be used to pay off the remaining Treasury interest in the AIA vehicle, which would let AIG keep that one-third interest in the company instead of selling it. The AIA stake was responsible for most of AIG’s net profit in the second quarter.  AIG shares closed down 8.7 percent at $22.70, more than 20 percent below the government’s break-even point on the stock.

97,AIG,"AIG, banks say class-action group too large","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group (AIG.N) and dozens of banks have filed motions in federal court to block a proposed nationwide class-action suit against them over AIG’s 2008 near-collapse.  Their argument is that the proposed class is ultimately too large and too diverse to have anything in common, particularly citing the recent Supreme Court decision throwing out a class-action suit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on similar grounds.  AIG came within minutes of bankruptcy before the government rescued it in September 2008 with a bailout that ultimately totaled $182 billion. Even after a share sale last May, the government still owns 77 percent of the company.  The State of Michigan Retirement System, as lead plaintiff, has asked the federal court in lower Manhattan to certify a class consisting of anyone who bought AIG common stock from mid-March 2006 to the date of the bailout, plus anyone who took part in 101 different securities offerings over that time period.  But AIG, in its filing Wednesday, argued that the proposed class covered so many different time periods, so many different sets of circumstances prior to its bailout and so many different kinds of financial interests that it was impossible to say such a broad class had anything in common.  “(Given) the varied market conditions and disclosures, the diverse characteristics of the securities and the disparate interests of investors, Lead Plaintiff has not come close to carrying its heavy burden” to provide such proof, AIG said.  In a separate memorandum of law, the banks — all underwriters on various AIG offerings over the period in question — also argued that they do not have a sufficient amount in common to be sued as a class.  “These issues and defenses must be addressed offering by offering, underwriter by underwriter,” they said.  Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers PWC.UL, which was AIG’s independent auditor, also filed a memo opposing class claims against it, saying the plaintiffs had no claim because various disclosures by PwC about AIG’s finances were not material to bond investors.

100,AIG,Spitzer sued for libel over his Slate column,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was hit with two libel lawsuits seeking $90 million by former Marsh & McLennan Cos executives over a column posted on Slate.com about an insurance bid-rigging scandal.  The lawsuits arose from Spitzer’s August 22, 2010, column, “They Still Don’t Get It,” advocating prosecution of corporate wrongdoers and defending his own enforcement activity against Marsh and insurer American International Group Inc.  William Gilman, a former Marsh executive marketing director, and Edward McNenney, a former Marsh global placement director, contended that they were defamed by the column, which appeared thee months after a judge threw out their convictions on felony antitrust charges. Neither is named in the column.  Slate.com is owned by Washington Post Co, and its parent Slate Group LLC is a defendant in both cases.  Gilman filed his $60 million lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, while McNenney filed papers seeking $30 million with the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Both cases were filed on Friday and made public on Monday.  Spitzer, in a phone interview, declined to comment after the first of the lawsuits, Gilman’s, became public. Rima Calderon, a Washington Post spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Gilman had worked at Marsh for 28 years and McNenney for 14 years when Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general, in 2004 opened a probe into the company’s practices — including alleged kickbacks for steering of clients to favored insurers.  Marsh, then the largest U.S. insurance broker, agreed in January 2005 to pay $850 million in a civil settlement with Spitzer, and eight insurance executives including Gilman and McNenney were indicted eight months later in the probe.  Both men were found guilty in February 2008, but the presiding judge threw out that conviction in July 2010, citing new evidence. That case was dismissed in January. The other indicted executives either were acquitted or had their cases dismissed. Twenty-one others pleaded guilty.  In his complaint, Gilman said Spitzer defamed him in writing, stating that “Marsh’s behavior was a blatant abuse of law and market power: price-fixing, bid-rigging and kickbacks all designed to harm their customers and the market while Marsh and its employees pocketed the increased fees and kickbacks.”  Gilman also said Spitzer defamed him in writing by stating that “many employees of Marsh” have been “convicted and sentenced to jail terms,” when none had.  Spitzer had written the column shortly after an editorial critical of him in The Wall Street Journal.  “While Mr. Spitzer’s statements do not refer to Mr. Gilman by name,” Gilman’s complaint said, “Mr. Gilman is readily identifiable as the subject of the defamatory comments.”  “Mr. Spitzer was well aware of his own allegations as attorney general and the resolution of those allegations in favor of Mr. Gilman and yet, recklessly disregarded these facts,” the complaint said.  Punitive damages account for half the amounts sought in each lawsuit. “I don’t know what possessed him to make the statements that he made,” Jeffrey Liddle, a lawyer for Gilman and McNenney, said in an interview, referring to Spitzer.  In June, Gilman and McNenney accused Marsh in a separate lawsuit of colluding with Spitzer to make them “scapegoats” and avert potential criminal charges against the company. That case seeks to recover unpaid compensation and other damages.  Last month, Time Warner Inc’s CNN canceled Spitzer’s low-rated television talk show “In the Arena,” after less than one year on the air.

102,AIG,CORRECTED - COLUMN-Decoding Lloyd Blankfein's new hire: Alison Frankel," (Corrects fourth paragraph to say Allen Stanford instead of David Stanford)   -- Alison Frankel writes the On the Case blog for Thomson Reuters News & Insight (newsandinsight.com). The views expressed are her own. --   By Alison Frankel   NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The market assumed the worst on Monday after Reuters’ great scoop on Goldman Sachs (GS.N) CEO Lloyd Blankfein bringing in Reid Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson to represent him in the Justice Department’s investigation of the bank. Goldman’s share price fell almost 5 percent on the fear that Weingarten’s entrance signals that DOJ is getting serious about its follow-up to the April 2011 Senate subcommittee report on the financial crisis.   In one sense, that’s reading way too much into the mere fact that Blankfein has brought in his own lawyer. It’s standard operating procedure for corporate executives at companies under investigation to have separate counsel. Consider the example of other alleged villains of the financial meltdown. Richard Fuld of Lehman (LEHKQ.PK), Joseph Cassano of AIG (AIG.N), Angelo Mozilo and David Sambol of Countrywide, John Thain of Merrill Lynch, Kenneth Lewis of Bank of America (BAC.N): They all have their own lawyers, and none of them have faced any criminal charges. Only Mozilo and Sambol even had to answer to the SEC.   Lawyers who represent corporations — Sullivan & Cromwell, in Goldman’s case — have a duty to the company. And though CEOs and other high-ranking executives often think their interests are exactly the same as the corporation’s, lawyers have to anticipate a divergence between what’s good for the company and what’s good for its leaders. A company under investigation might be best served by cooperating with prosecutors and turning over (for instance) its lawyers’ interview notes; execs may have conflicting interests. Even if they don’t, lawyers are supposed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict, so as soon as it’s clear that investigators are interested even in just interviewing an individual executive, white-collar defense lawyers will typically advise bringing in separate counsel.   A couple of cases from the last few years drove home that lesson. Proskauer Rose represented Allen Stanford’s Stanford Financial as the Ponzi scheme collapsed. Proskauer partner Thomas Sjoblom was in the room with Stanford Financial’s chief investment officer, Laura Pendergest-Holt, when she was interviewed by the SEC in 2009. Sjoblom told the SEC that he was representing the company, not Pendergest-Holt. But she ended up indicted for lying to investigators and obstructing justice — based on that SEC interview. Pendergest-Holt turned around and sued Sjoblom and Proskauer, asserting that she was never told the firm wasn’t representing her. Sjoblom subsequently resigned from Proskauer. (Proskauer’s spokesman didn’t return my call.)   In another case, Irell & Manella represented Broadcom in an internal investigation of its stock options backdating practices. As part of that investigation, Irell lawyers interviewed Broadcom CFO William  Ruehle. Irell was simultaneously representing Ruehle in two securities suits, and, he later said that he believed Irell was his counsel. But it wasn’t: When Broadcom decided to cooperate with prosecutors, Irell turned over its notes of the Ruehle interview. Ruehle was indicted and (among other things) blamed Irell for misleading him. The trial judge in Ruehle’s case, Cormac Carney, blasted Irell for breaching its duty to Ruehle, though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit later cleared the firm of wrongdoing. (Judge Carney eventually tossed charges against Ruehle for other reasons.)   So Sullivan & Cromwell and Blankfein are both better off now that the CEO’s interests are protected by another lawyer, even if Blankfein only brought in counsel for an interview with DOJ investigators. In that regard, we shouldn’t assume that Weingarten’s entrance necessarily bodes ill for Goldman or Blankfein. Goldman told Reuters Monday that this is entirely routine: “As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,” the bank said.   Nevertheless, Blankfein’s choice of Weingarten is very intriguing. Weingarten is a great lawyer with close ties to the Justice Department, where he once worked in the Public Integrity section, and to Attorney General Eric Holder, whom he actually represented when Congress grilled Holder about President Bill Clinton’s eleven-hour pardon of financier Marc Rich. Weingarten is not, however, part of the club of white-collar defense counsel who typically get referrals from New York firms like S&C. (That group includes Andrew Levander of Dechert; Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton; Patricia Hynes of Allen & Overy; and Gary Naftalis of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, all of whom represent high-profile Wall Streeters in financial crisis cases.)   One white-collar defense lawyer who gets referrals from Wall Street firms told me it could be significant that Blankfein went outside the usual circle, turning to a lawyer best known for his trial work. “For many people, the choice of Reid Weingarten would be unusual to represent someone in a simple interview,” he said. “He’s often retained when an investigation is going to lead to a case that would go to trial.”   That unseen hand that guides the market, in other words, may turn out to be pretty smart.

103,AIG,UPDATE 1-Marsh: Insurance rate declines have stopped,"   * Turn in property rates follows 18 months of declines   * Rate up 1.1 pct in average renewal so far in Q3   * Hurricane Irene could push rates much higher  (Adds A.M. Best loss figures)   NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Property insurance rates have stopped falling after 18 months of steady declines, as natural disasters begin to give insurers more pricing power, insurance brokerage Marsh said on Tuesday.   So far in the third quarter, the average property insurance renewal has been done at a 1.1 percent rate increase, Marsh said. In the worst of the downturn, renewal rates were averaging declines of more than 5 percent a quarter.   Pricing power has been a problem for the insurance industry in recent years as excess capacity and heavy competition have kept rates falling, in some cases to lows last seen a decade ago or more.   But natural disasters over the last year — including three earthquakes in New Zealand, the March quake and nuclear disaster in Japan, and tornadoes in the United States — appear to have turned the tide.   Insurance ratings agency A.M. Best said on Tuesday that U.S. property and casualty insurers suffered $27 billion in insured losses in the first half of 2011, nearly 50 percent greater than the losses for all of 2010.   The primary catalyst was tornadoes, particularly the record-breaking ones that struck in April and May.   Industry executives and analysts are now closely watching Hurricane Irene, which is expected to make landfall in the United States this weekend. Depending on where it hits, some say it will be damaging enough to drive rates higher across the industry.

105,AIG,Threat of Irene exposes New York's vulnerability," * Latest track models suggest Long Island hit on Sunday   * 1821, 1938 storms show potential for severe loss   * Some already warning of $10 billion-plus disaster   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - In the annals of natural disasters, it doesn’t get much worse than a major hurricane directly striking New York City and Long Island.   Hurricane Irene is on a course that will take it up the East Coast from the weekend. While there is still uncertainty about where it will hit and when, the forecast models increasingly suggest some parts of the greater New York area will face some type of storm or hurricane impact. [ID:nN1E77N00M]   According to New York City’s Office of Emergency Management, the last hurricane to pass directly over the city was in 1821 — and it caused tides to rise 13 feet in one hour, flooding all of lower Manhattan to Canal St.   But for Long Island, the threat is much worse. People still talk about the Long Island Express of 1938, a Category 3 storm that the U.S. government has said would cause $40 billion in damage if it hit today.   Meteorologists say the risk appears most acute for areas like the Hamptons, an eastern Long Island playground for New York’s rich.   “If the storm followed the exact track of it, there could be considerable wind damage and tidal flooding out in those areas,” said James Aman, senior meteorologist with WeatherBug. “There potentially could be some storm surge problems out around the eastern tip of Long Island, Rhode Island, Cape Cod, some of the areas around Boston that face Massachusetts Bay.”   Estimating the damage such an impact would cause is difficult without knowing the storm’s parameters, like wind speed, rainfall totals, direction and the like. Some are already taking a ballpark guess, though.   “If Irene hits Long Island or southeast Massachusetts, the storm has the potential to be a $10 billion disaster,” Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters said in a blog post Wednesday.   If Masters is right, that would make the insured losses from Irene some of the worst in history, at a time that insurers are already stretched by record-breaking natural disasters around the world.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Reuters Hurricane Tracker    r.reuters.com/san78n  National Hurricane Center        www.nhc.noaa.gov  Florida State map (external link)   bit.ly/odn5OY  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   High net worth insurers like AIG (AIG.N) and Chubb (CB.N) are big players in those kinds of upper-class regions, where insured losses can total up quickly due to high property values as well as extensive collections of art and jewelry.   They are scrambling now to warn their customers to be prepared, to take the kinds of precautions that people in places like Florida take for granted.   “Without the repetition of events like the folks in Florida benefit from, that preparedness is not front and center,” said Michael Taylor, executive vice president for claims in the consumer unit at Chartis, the property insurance arm of AIG.   Taylor said Chartis has been in touch with its brokers, asking them to contact customers and remind them of hurricane preparedness tips that they already receive yearly but might otherwise disregard.   There is only so much preparedness can do, though. Taylor said even the homes of the wealthy sometimes don’t feature things like hurricane-strength glass and wind shutters, which are standard in parts of Florida but less common in the northeast.   “These are things that will make homes a little more susceptible here, if we do have high winds,” he added.   Those winds could be a problem for New York City in particular, a number of experts say.   Florida State University has created an online map that shows the track of 14 different models, two of which show the Irene plowing straight through New Jersey and putting New York City, Newark and other areas on the wrong side of the storm.   Given how compact Manhattan is, even tropical storm-force conditions could do serious damage.   “The water’s got to go somewhere and the wind is going to hit something,” said Lou Gritzo, research manager at insurer FM Global. “New York City becomes a wind tunnel when the wind whips between the buildings, so that’s going to be a force that intensifies how projectiles are moving.”   In fact, ask any scientist who models catastrophes for a living what it would take to create a $100 billion natural disaster, and their list will almost always include a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) hitting New York City.   “We haven’t had a storm in this area for quite some time and it’s difficult to say how tested some of these buildings are against hurricane force winds,” said Matt Nielsen, product manager for the U.S. hurricane model at catastrophe modeling company RMS.   The city’s emergency management office featured Irene front and center on its website Wednesday, urging people to know whether they were in a designated hurricane risk zone and to know the proper evacuation routes out of the city.   Even if Irene passes far enough away from the city and the New York region to spare a full-force impact, flooding can still be a significant problem, especially with tides expected to be high anyway over the weekend due to a new moon.   Four of the six most significant flood events of the last 30 years, based on the amount paid out by the National Flood Insurance Program in claims, included the New York region — Hurricane Ivan in 2004, Hurricane Isabel in 2003, Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 and Hurricane Floyd in 1999.   Paid claims from those four storms, just for flooding, topped $3.5 billion, according to data compiled by the Insurance Information Institute.

106,AIG,Irene losses start to mount as storm aims at NYC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene is likely to cause more insured losses in the Bahamas than 1999’s devastating Hurricane Floyd, catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide said on Thursday, even as the storm increasingly tracks toward a weekend landfall in the greater New York City area.  Floyd was one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record when it hit the Bahamas more than a decade ago, and it later prompted one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history as well. AIR said Irene’s path through the Bahamas made greater damage than Floyd more likely.  More detailed estimates are expected on Friday, as the storm passes over the islands and begins to take aim at the Eastern United States.  While Irene has a long way to travel, and a great deal of uncertainty still remains, more and more computer models on Thursday suggested the storm would come very close to New York City or perhaps even pass directly over it.  The last hurricane known to have made landfall in the city proper was in 1821, causing a 13 feet storm surge that inundated the entirety of lower Manhattan. City officials said they are considering evacuations.  Beyond New York City and Long Island, the storm looks set to hit large swaths of New England with heavy rains and wind, potentially including Boston.  “If it follows its exact tracking you may not see exact hurricane-force winds in the Manhattan area, it may be more strong tropical storm-type stuff,” said James Aman, senior meteorologist at Earth Networks. “Certainly the south shore of Long Island seems to be the area that’s most under the gun right now. A lot of (Northeast U.S.) areas will see high-end tropical storm conditions here by the end of the weekend.”  Aman said there is a chance, based on the current tracks, that a Category 1 hurricane could make landfall Sunday afternoon right around the area of JFK Airport, one of the country’s most important.  One expert in disaster modeling said it would be hard for New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts to escape significant damage.  “I would be surprised if New England completely gets by without any damage on this one,” said Peter Dailey, director of atmospheric science for AIR, one of the three companies insurance companies rely on to model their exposure to disasters.  Dailey said storm surge was a particularly important issue for the Northeast, with low-lying areas susceptible to flooding if the hurricane pushes the waters up substantially.  Much will depend, he said, on timing — tides are expected to be especially high on Sunday night, so if the storm hits then, flooding could be exacerbated.  Shares in property insurers were about 3 percent lower on Thursday, a sharper decline than the broader markets, as the storm moved closer. Among those most exposed are AIG, Chubb Allstate and Travelers.

107,AIG,Warren Buffett to invest $5 billion in Bank of America,"NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Warren Buffett will invest $5 billion in Bank of America Corp, stepping in to shore up the largest U.S. bank in the same way he helped prop up Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis.  Bank of America shares rose nearly 26 percent at one point, but gave up most of those gains by early afternoon, closing 9.4 percent higher at $7.65. Trading was so heavy that, at one point midday Bank of America shares made up nearly 13 percent of the composite volume for the entire stock market.  Buffett and Bank of America said he made an unsolicited call to the bank on Wednesday morning offering to make an investment. Buffett told CNBC the idea came to him while taking a bath and the deal was done in 24 hours.  The deal entails Buffett’s insurance company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc buying $5 billion of preferred shares and receiving warrants to buy 700 million shares. The warrants helped lift Berkshire Hathaway’s paper profits on the deal to more than $3 billion, although the transaction has not yet closed.  The deal is expected to close on September 1 and includes provisions barring Buffett from raising his total BofA stake past 14.9 percent. Fully exercised, at the most recent share count the warrants represent a 6.5 percent stake.  Even though the bank has said it did not need to raise capital, investors widely believed it needed more money and to show it could raise funds easily. Employees were also relieved by the news. On at least one BofA trading floor, traders cheered when the news crossed the wires.  Bank of America has been plagued by fears that bad mortgage loans and legal liabilities from loans packaged into bonds by its Countrywide unit could drag it into tens of billions of dollars in fresh losses that would stretch its capital.  The deal proved again that Berkshire Hathaway has become something of a lender of last resort to the financial system, as when it invested in Goldman Sachs Group Inc and General Electric Co. Buffett’s role in aiding the economy and the financial system has become symbolically important, given the lack of policy options left for the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve to stimulate demand.  “This proves to the market that, if the bank needs additional capital, which we don’t believe they do, but if they needed to calm the market by raising capital, they could do it within 30 minutes with a quick call to Uncle Warren,” said Sean Egan, managing principal of Egan-Jones Ratings.  The deal comes at a cost for Bank of America. The $300 million of annual dividend payments it makes will cut into earnings per share and the deal will influence its outstanding share count.  Putting together these factors, analyst John MacDonald of Sanford C. Bernstein estimated the company’s earnings per share will fall by roughly 5 percent for 2012 and 2013.  For Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway, it is a better deal.  Berkshire gets warrants to buy 700 million shares of common stock at just over $7.14 per share, with an unusually long 10-year exercise period. One Berkshire holder said the warrants were by far the best part of the deal.  “He could well make a 100 percent return on his investment in a few years,” said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. “It’s amazing how much a little hug from Buffett is worth these days.”  Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, who has studied the pricing of warrants for large bank stocks, said warrants were worth $3.17 billion before the deal was announced, while the $5 billion of preferred shares were worth $4.46 billion, giving Buffett a total paper profit of $2.63 billion at the outset of the deal.  As the bank’s shares soared, the profit on the position jumped.  Bank of America is selling to Berkshire 50,000 shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a 6 percent annual dividend. The bank can buy back the investment at any time by paying Buffett 5 percent more than the face value of the securities.  It is virtually a mirror of the deal Berkshire did with Goldman in the depths of the financial crisis in fall 2008, except Goldman paid a 10 percent dividend and had a 10 percent redemption premium. The Goldman deal paid Berkshire $15 a second in dividends until Goldman bought out Buffett earlier this year.  “It’s a reasonably priced deal for Buffett. It’s opportunistic,” said Tom Russo, a portfolio manager at Gardner, Russo & Gardner who holds Berkshire shares.  As of June 30, Berkshire had 39 percent of its equity investments in the financial sector, according to Standard & Poor’s.  Earlier this month, a $10 billion lawsuit over soured mortgage securities by American International Group Inc helped spur fears about Charlotte-based Bank of America’s liabilities, as well as questions about how it would pay for more losses.  In recent weeks, investors have sold the bank’s shares, worrying that Bank of America might need more capital — as much as $50 billion by some estimates — to cope with losses and meet capital rules.  For shareholders who watched the bank take two government bailouts and saw the government step in earlier this year to block a planned dividend raise, further dilution would have been a bitter pill to swallow.  There is no expectation regulatory approval will be needed in this case, a regulatory official said.  CEO Brian Moynihan said on August 10 that the bank could add to its capital through earnings and asset sales. His remarks came two days after the bank’s shares plunged 20 percent.  But many were not convinced. On Tuesday, blogger Henry Blodget said the bank could face $100 billion to $200 billion in write-offs and balance sheet issues, a claim the bank denied, but one that pushed its shares to early-2009 lows.  “This helps with the credibility gap that I think has existed in the minds of some shareholders,” said Jon Finger, managing partner of Finger Interests in Houston. Finger’s family sold its bank to Bank of America years ago.  Moynihan has said the bank is targeting a 6.75 to 7 percent tier 1 common capital ratio by the end of 2013 under the new Basel III rules, which are designed to ensure big banks have enough capital to withstand crises large and small.  The cost of insuring Bank of America debt against default has risen, but it fell on Thursday after the Buffett deal, down 68 basis points to 305 basis points. That means it would cost $305,000 a year for five years to insure $10 million of debt.

112,AIG,TEXT-Fitch Affirms Bank of Ayudhya at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable," (The following statement was released by the ratings agency)	   Aug 26 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bank of Ayudhya 	 Public Company Limited’s (BAY) ratings, including its Long-Term Foreign Currency 	 Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘BBB’ and National Long-Term Rating at 	 ‘AA-(tha)’. The Outlook is Stable. The full list of rating actions is included 	 at the end of this release.	   The ratings and Stable Outlook are based on BAY’s robust performance, 	 sufficiently strong capital position for its risk profile and, as expected, 	 continued improvement of asset quality. The ratings also consider BAY’s greater 	 use of wholesale funding, including bills of exchange (BE), relative to 	 similarly rated peers. In light of BAY’s 8% share of system assets, loans and 	 deposits, Fitch believes there is a moderate probability of government support, 	 in case of need.	   BAY’s net profit in H111 grew a strong 38% to THB5.8bn, driven by a high net 	 interest margin stemming from its large exposure to higher-yielding retail 	 lending, well-managed funding costs and lower provisioning costs. Return on 	 average assets increased to 1.32% in H111 (2010: 1.07%) and should continue to 	 improve with lower and more stable provisioning. BAY’s retail lending increased 	 significantly to over 40% of total loans from 30%, after acquiring assets from 	 the Thai operating units of General Electric Capital Corporation Inc. and 	 American International Group in 2008-2009.	   The bank’s asset quality has improved over the past two to three years despite a 	 volatile operating environment. Non-performing loans (NPLs) fell to THB36bn 	 (5.35% of total loans) at end-June 2011 (end-2007: THB72bn; 15.87%), aided by 	 active loan restructuring, sales and write-offs of NPLs, and tighter credit 	 standards. The bank has plans to sell further NPLs in H211. Loan loss coverage 	 also strengthened to 92.6% at end-June 2011 from 88.7% at end-2010, in line with 	 the industry average.	   Funding and liquidity profile remains a risk. BAY’s deposits are lower than 	 those of the major banks, accounting for 72% of total funding at end-June 2011 	 due to higher long-term wholesale funding to better match its asset profile. Its 	 loan/deposit ratio (including BE) of 102% at end-June 2011, although lower than 	 108% at end-2010, remains high compared with an average of 91% for the country’s 	 top four banks. Liquid assets have declined to about 16% of deposits, money 	 market and short-term funding at end-June 2011, which is lower than an average 	 of about 20% for major Thai banks.	   A large recapitalisation in 2007 and continuous internal capital accretion due 	 to profitable operations have helped BAY report one of the highest capital 	 positions among Thai banks, which Fitch views as appropriate for its risk 	 profile. Its Tier 1 capital and equity/assets ratios of 12.16% and 11% 	 respectively at end-June 2011 have remained stable despite ongoing acquisitions 	 and organic growth in the past three years. Moreover, Fitch would expect its 	 capital position to hold up even should the operating environment deteriorate 	 moderately.	   Positive rating action may result from significant improvement in BAY’s deposit 	 franchise to a level closer to its major domestic peers, as measured by the 	 share of retail deposits of total funding. Maintaining its strong capital 	 position and sustainable profitability may also benefit the ratings. Any sharp 	 increase in liquidity risk, including heavy reliance on wholesale funding, risk 	 of significant deterioration in asset quality due to aggressive asset growth 	 and/or material weakening of capital position may lead to negative rating 	 action.	   The debt ratings are consistent with Fitch’s relevant criteria for rating such 	 instruments which are performing.	   BAY was established in 1945 and is Thailand’s fifth-largest commercial bank.

113,AIG,PRESS DIGEST - Wall Street Journal - Aug 26," Aug 26 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in The Wall Street Journal on Friday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * BofA said it will get a $5 billion infusion from Warren Buffett, giving the nation’s biggest bank a desperately needed jolt of confidence at a time when investors are questioning its health.	   * Steve Jobs has arguably disrupted more industries than any other chief executive of his generation. The big question is whether Apple can continue to transform the landscape while making an impact on pop culture in the way that Mr. Jobs has for the past two decades. 	   * Steve Jobs has stepped down from his pulpit. Now, followers of the “Cult of Mac” are contemplating a world without their charismatic leader.	   * Steve Jobs has his name on more than 300 patents, a sign that he did more to create Apple Inc.’s landmark products than simply supervise engineers. But the company’s originality, and handling of intellectual property, have frequently been controversial topics.	   * Switch off a car’s engine on a slope and it will accelerate down the hill for a good long while. The same kind of momentum can carry a company quite a long way, unless it hits a wall. That’s what Apple bulls need to remember as they contemplate the tech giant without Steve Jobs as chief executive.	   * AIG chief Benmosche has complained to senior bank executives about unfavorable stock research, suggesting some analysts don’t fully understand AIG’s value.	   * Goldman Sachs officials have been reminding some of its U.K. workers that higher salaries granted in 2010 would revert back after two years, and that time is coming. 	   * Former Lehman Brothers Chief Executive Dick Fuld and other directors and officers are seeking the release of $90 million in insurance funds to settle a potential multibillion-dollar lawsuit brought by shareholders of the failed investment bank.	   * Euro-zone policy makers appeared no nearer to settling a dispute over Finland’s collateral demands in exchange for participating in a bailout for Greece.	   * Asian shares and currencies stuck to tight ranges, amid choppy trade and after Wall Street’s decline provided little incentive to buy stocks. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent.	   * Blogging service Tumblr has a funny name and scant revenue. It has also convinced investors it is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.	   * Several European governments extended a ban on short selling of financial shares Thursday, seeking to keep a lid on volatility in European banking stocks amid deep bearishness.	   * Harrisburg, the financially strapped capital of Pennsylvania, will likely miss a bond payment next month if a deal to obtain $7.5 million in borrowed cash falls through, a spokesman for the mayor said Thursday.	   * The initial public offering of Toys “R” Us Inc. was supposed to be a crowning moment for the owners of America’s largest chain of toy stores. But it has now been 15 months since the company filed the initial paperwork, and people close to the transaction say it won’t happen until at least early 2012.	   * Chief Executive Myron “Mike” Ullman will carry a big exit package when he checks out of J.C. Penney Co. early next year. The package currently is valued at about $30.7 million, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal.	   * A 15-day strike at Verizon Communications Inc.  fueled a surge in new jobless benefit claims last week, but the job market still looks weak after stripping out those effects.	   * NewPage Corp., the struggling Ohio-based papermaker owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP, is in discussions over financing that would keep the company afloat during possible bankruptcy proceedings, said people familiar with the matter.

114,AIG,AIG chief unhappy with stock analysts' view: report,"(Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N) Chief Executive Robert Benmosche has complained to senior executives at investment banks about the “unfavorable research” of the insurer’s stock, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.  Benmosche’s complaint suggested that some analysts do not fully understand the company and its value, the Journal said.  AIG is considering which four banks should lead another large offering of the U.S. government’s shares later this year, the paper said.  Benmosche told the Wall Street Journal that he intends to change at least one of the four lead underwriters following his dissatisfaction with how the last deal went.  In May, AIG raised $8.7 billion in a stock offering, which included 200 million shares sold by the Treasury and 100 million sold by AIG, far smaller than the $10 billion to $20 billion deal some banking sources had suggested earlier this year, hinting at a potential lack of investor interest.  The offering was led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM.N).  An AIG spokesman declined to comment to the Journal. The company could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.  Of the 15 analysts covering AIG stock, four have a “buy” rating, while 11 recommend their clients to hold the stock, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  U.S. government bailout of AIG at one point totaled $182.3 billion. The government’s investment now stands at $51 billion — the 77 percent of AIG’s common stock held by the U.S. Treasury, and the remaining $9.3 billion in preferred interests in the AIA entity.

115,AIG,Early estimates suggest Irene losses tame,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused between $200 million and $400 million in insured losses in the Carolinas, catastrophe modeling company EQECAT said on Sunday, suggesting the storm may have been far less severe than the insurance industry feared.  The bigger question, though, is how much coverage people have for the severe flooding that struck New York and New Jersey, and whether the federal government’s flood program can handle all of the claims.  EQECAT said the bulk of the losses it has seen so far come particularly from storm surge and flooding.  Combined with its estimate of $300 million to $600 million in insured losses from a direct hit on parts of the Caribbean, EQECAT now puts Irene’s total damage so far in a range of $500 million to $1 billion.  That is far less than its competitor, AIR Worldwide, which estimated Irene’s damages in the Caribbean at $1.1 billion.  It is not unusual for catastrophe modeling companies, whose software is used by insurers to model their exposure to natural disasters, to differ widely in their initial loss estimates.  The figures tend to be revised as the days go by and the companies send more teams to the disaster sites to survey losses first-hand.  Still, the early figures compare with some projections by meteorologists and statisticians that Irene could be a $10 billion or more event. Much will depend on how much damage the storm did in the greater New York area.  Loss estimates on the rest of the U.S. East Coast are expected on Monday.  Nationwide Mutual, one of the country’s largest property insurers, said it received 6,000 claims calls on Sunday, which is twice what it would usually expect on the Sunday after a major storm.  A spokeswoman for the company said that presents a mystery that could take days to clarify.  They can not tell yet whether they are getting an unusually high volume of claims, which would imply a lot of storm damage, or whether more people are calling than usual because they have already gotten home after the storm, which would imply it was somewhat mild.  “Generally what we’re seeing as you move east is a lot of trees on houses, widespread power outages and as you get closer and closer to the coast, we’ve got coastal flooding, the power outages are even more widespread,” said Brian Maness, a claims manager for the company in North Carolina.  In New Jersey, the state is expecting damage in “the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars,” Gov. Chris Christie told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  By all accounts, in cities like Jersey City, Montclair, Nutley and Hoboken, that damage will come in large part from flooding that put in some cases multiple feet of water into homes.  New Jersey is the fourth-most insured state by the National Flood Insurance Program, which writes almost all of the flood insurance in the United States.  The state has $51.88 billion of insurance in force from the NFIP, and Jersey City and Hoboken are two of the most insured cities in the state. On the other hand, for example, Montclair and Nutley are two of the least.  Congress is working on a reform package for the NFIP, which has been surviving on a series of one-year extensions amid a debate about the cost of the program and its role in keeping the private sector largely out of the flood insurance business.

118,AIG,Fannie/Freddie regulator challenges BofA MBS pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as dozens of investors, on Tuesday lodged objections to Bank of America Corp’s proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-backed securities settlement.  Separately, a group of homeowners sued to block the accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong abuses in how mortgage loans are serviced. They are seeking a court order to force Bank of America to adopt and follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”  The settlement covers 530 mortgage pools from the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which was the nation’s largest mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it in 2008.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee handling the 530 trusts with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, had negotiated the settlement with 22 institutional investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  But some other investors say the payout is too low, or they lack enough information to know whether the accord is fair.  Lawrence Grayson, a bank spokesman, declined to comment, as did Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine.  In a court filing, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, called it a “positive” that the settlement calls for improving loan servicing and fixing deficient documentation, and said the support of many large market participants is “encouraging.”  Still, the FHFA said it lacks enough information about the accord, and wants to be ready to voice a “substantive” objection “should a now unforeseen issue arise” that hurts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  “The FHFA sounds like it wants to preserve its right to contest refinements that could expose Fannie and Freddie to greater losses,” said Kathleen Engel, associate dean at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and co-author of “The Subprime Virus.”  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010 guaranteed 70 percent of single-family mortgage-backed securities that were issued, and provided $1.03 trillion of market liquidity, an FHFA report to Congress in June shows.  Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for the FHFA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Meanwhile, the homeowners, who say they have received default notices, seek class-action status for Countrywide borrowers from 2004 to 2008 whose loans are in the trusts and are serviced by Bank of America.”  “The settlement agreement will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system, and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market,” the complaint said.  Bank of America is among large U.S. banks negotiating with regulators nationwide on a potential multi-billion dollar settlement to improve foreclosure practices.  “It is not clear the borrowers have standing,” Engel said. “They certainly may be aggrieved by servicing problems, but they have to show the settlement itself causes them harm, either new injury or the loss of legal rights.”  A lawyer for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Several dozen objections to the $8.5 billion settlement were filed ahead of a Tuesday deadline to intervene in the case, which is overseen by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  Some of the challenges were filed simultaneously in federal court, where some of the objectors hope to move the case.  American International Group Inc, the insurer suing Bank of America for $10 billion in a separate MBS case, and the National Credit Union Administration were among those to object on Tuesday to the accord.  Others that have objected include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, attorneys general of New York and Delaware, and various banks, insurers, investment funds and pension funds.  Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.  US Bancorp, trustee for a $1.75 billion Countrywide mortgage pool, this week separately sued Bank of America to force it to buy back the underlying loans.

120,AIG,Exclusive: Bank of America kept AIG legal threat under wraps,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top Bank of America Corp lawyers knew as early as January that American International Group Inc was prepared to sue the bank for more than $10 billion, seven months before the lawsuit was filed, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Bank of America shares fell more than 20 percent on August 8, the day the lawsuit was filed, adding to worries about the stability of the largest U.S. bank. It wasn’t until Warren Buffett stepped up with a $5 billion investment that those fears were eased, though hardly eliminated.  The bank made no mention of the lawsuit threat in a quarterly regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just four days earlier. Nor did management discuss it on conference calls about quarterly results and other pending legal claims.  The SEC’s rules for litigation disclosure are murky, and some lawyers said Bank of America may have been justified in not revealing AIG’s lawsuit before it was filed. The bank’s litigation disclosures are in line with those of many rivals.  But other lawyers said banks have an obligation to disclose legal threats that could have major consequences.  “Publicly owned companies are supposed to disclose material threatened litigation under generally accepted accounting principles,” said Richard Rowe, a former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, who was commenting generally and not specifically about Bank of America.  Rowe, now a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of law firm Proskauer Rose, said bank executives must make a “judgment call” as to what is material, but “the general rule is, if it’s threatened litigation and it’s material, and you can put a number on it, you should disclose it.”  AIG’s lawsuit shows why investors are so fearful: they have no idea how much litigation lurks behind closed doors.  “Management surely has a credibility problem with investors,” said Jonathan Finger, whose Finger Interests Number One Ltd in Houston owns Bank of America shares. “They continue to under-address or under-disclose on the mortgage issue.”  Finger in 2009 sued the bank over its disclosures related to the takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co.  Bank of America and AIG declined to comment for this article.  SEC staff have this year advised banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, and Morgan Stanley to disclose more information about lawsuits that have been filed, as well as legal proceedings that they know the government is considering.  Banks have responded by providing additional information, including legal loss estimates in some cases.  But the agency has given banks more leeway in disclosing the expected cost of early-stage litigation, or threats of litigation whose outcome is more difficult to predict, according to securities lawyers and current and former regulatory officials.  There are two standards for disclosing legal liabilities. One under banks’ legal proceedings relies on whether losses are “reasonably probable” and “reasonably estimable.” Another, under management’s discussion and analysis, is based on whether losses are “reasonably possible.” Disclosure relies heavily on management’s assessment of the merits of a case.  Companies might need to disclose large potential lawsuits, even if they believe a loss is improbable, as well as less consequential cases if a loss appears certain, said Meredith Cross, director of the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance, in an interview with Reuters about the SEC’s disclosure requirements.  “The goal has been to have better disclosures, which should result in fewer surprises,” said Cross, who was speaking generally and not commenting on any specific institution.  Legal experts say it is difficult for top bank executives to decide exactly what they have to disclose in relation to pending and potential legal matters. That is particularly true in the current environment, they said, in which confidence in large banks is so easily shaken by legal threats that may or may not have merit.  “This is a classic problem in the disclosure regime with litigation,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “You’re required to disclose anything material. The question is, ‘is it material?’ You have to gauge the size and the probability of success, which is very hard to evaluate.”  Before suing Bank of America, AIG spent months analyzing publicly available data on a sample of 262,322 loans behind mortgage-backed securities it bought from Bank of America and its Merrill Lynch and Countrywide units between 2005 and 2007.  In its court filing, AIG said marketing materials touted the loans as being much safer than they were.  For instance, AIG said that in almost every bond offering, it was told that none of the mortgages were worth more than the value of the underlying property, when in fact one in six loans were underwater from the day they were born.  AIG raised such issues with Bank of America in January and said it planned to sue unless a settlement could be reached, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sources either had direct knowledge of the legal proceedings or were briefed on them, but were not authorized to discuss the case publicly.  Both sides entered a “tolling agreement” to stop any legal statutes of limitation from running out while settlement talks were underway, but by March it became clear that AIG was prepared to sue for more than $10 billion, the people said.  Bank of America disputed AIG’s claims, saying losses stemmed from the insurer’s flawed decision making, as well as broader declines in home values and capital markets, the people said. The parties agreed to enter mediation proceedings during the second quarter, and also floated other proposals to no avail, the people said.  “There were lots of efforts made to avoid the filing over a period of months, but ultimately the discussions were not fruitful,” said one of the people.  A key stumbling block was Bank of America’s refusal to provide data for all of the loans, to show whether AIG’s sample — the heart of its case — was representative.  Bank of America “ignored” AIG’s requests for such information, while trustees and mortgage-servicers that also had access to the information “flat-out refused to cooperate,” according to AIG’s complaint.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has yet to respond in court to AIG’s lawsuit, but has said the insurer should have been smart enough to understand what it was buying.  “AIG recklessly chased high yields and profits throughout the mortgage and structured finance markets,” spokesman Larry DiRita said. “It is the very definition of an informed, seasoned investor, with losses solely attributable to its own excesses and errors.”  Bank of America devotes plenty of space in its regulatory filings to mortgage litigation.  The bank suffered after buying Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. subprime lender, in 2008 for $2.5 billion. Litigation and loan losses linked to that deal have cost the bank more than $30 billion.  In its August 4 quarterly filing, Bank of America spent nearly 4,000 words on a footnote describing litigation and regulatory matters. The bank said it spent $2.3 billion on legal costs, not including external fees, during the period, and could be short on reserves for future legal liabilities by as much as $2.3 billion.  On June 29, Bank of America said it agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve what it said would be much of the litigation it faced over mortgage-backed securities, and set aside another $5.5 billion for future possible claims.  The agreement with 22 investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Blackrock Inc, Allianz SE’s Pimco and others, covered mortgages with $174 billion in unpaid principal balance. Still, many investors have challenged the planned payout and disclosures as inadequate.  On a conference call to discuss the agreement, Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch asked for further explanation of securities litigation not covered by the deal.  “That will be an ongoing process,” Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson replied. “And I think if you look at the disclosure and what we have out there, it is pretty fulsome.”  Many large U.S. banks offer limited disclosure about their potential future legal bills.  None of the six biggest U.S. banks have volunteered definitive estimates of future legal costs, exact numbers of lawsuits or the potential damages that plaintiffs seek.  In its most recent quarterly filing, for example, JPMorgan said it is facing more than 10,000 legal proceedings, and that it may have to pay about $5.1 billion more to resolve these claims than the sum it has set aside. What that sum is, it does not say. Citigroup and Wells Fargo have made similar disclosures.  Morgan Stanley has offered legal-loss estimates for a handful of cases, totaling $1.7 billion, while Goldman Sachs lowered its legal-loss estimate by $700 million last quarter to $2 billion, even though it also detailed a slew of new legal and regulatory matters.  Barclays analyst Roger Freeman describes such legal-loss estimates as little more than holding a finger to the wind.  “We do not believe that this represents the realistic expected value of legal liabilities,” he said of Goldman Sachs’ estimate.  Bank of America’s shares dropped 20.3 percent on August 8 when the AIG lawsuit was filed, though many other factors influenced bank stocks that day, including Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States.  Since that time, its stock recovered only after Buffett — whose Berkshire Hathaway has made several investments in financial firms since 2008 — expressed support with a $5 billion preferred stock investment.  On Monday, the bank said it sold about half its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion, which also boosted Bank of America’s shares.  But even with the extra capital, Bank of America is sure to face huge legal hurdles over the long term.  “I’m concerned about the litigation, obviously,” said University of Delaware’s Elson, who is also a Bank of America shareholder. “Until it happens, you just don’t know.” (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel, Joe Rauch and Ben Berkowitz.

121,AIG,BofA sued over $1.75 billion Countrywide mortgage pool,"NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp was sued by the trustee of a $1.75 billion mortgage pool, which seeks to force the bank to buy back the underlying loans because of alleged misrepresentations in how they were made.  The lawsuit by the banking unit of US Bancorp is the latest of a slew of litigation to recover investor losses tied to risky mortgage loans issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.  In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, U.S. Bank said Countrywide, which issued the 4,484 loans in the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10, materially breached its obligations by systemically misrepresenting the quality of its underwriting and loan documentation.  Soon after the loans were sold to the trust, they “began to become delinquent and default at a startling rate,” the complaint said. Out of a sample of 786 of the loans, 520, or 66 percent, breached one or more representations, it said.  U.S. Bank said it demanded that Bank of America fix the breaches or buy back the loans as it had agreed to do, but that it has refused and offered no reason for this refusal.  The lawsuit demands that the bank repurchase all the loans in the pool, or at least those it knows have problems and are hurting investors in the trust.  Bank of America was not immediately available for comment.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.  Last fall, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the bank would fight repurchase claims by investors, calling the process “hand-to-hand combat.”  In 2011, however, he has agreed to large settlements with mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as billionaire Wilbur Ross’ bond insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. Then in June, he agreed to pay $8.5 billion to settle a wide range of Countrywide claims.

123,AIG,UPDATE 1-India may allow foreign investment in pension funds," * India panel favours up to 26 pct foreign investment in pension funds   * Foreign holding rule proposed for pension legislation   (Adds details, background)	   By Manoj Kumar	   NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India may allow foreign investment of up to 26 percent in the pension sector, giving global players access to a roughly $2 billion pool of assets that is expected to grow quickly as more people join the organised workforce.	   The recommendation by a parliamentary panel on a pending pension bill is the latest fillip to economic reforms that have stalled as the government was paralysed by a spate of scandals.	   New Delhi has been taking steps of late to make the country more investment friendly, backing in principle foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, a reform that has been delayed for years.	   Some of the reform measures, including a proposal to lift the cap on foreign holdings in insurance companies to 49 percent from 26 percent, require parliamentary approval.	   Now, pension funds of over a million employees in India are managed by IDFC , State Bank of India , ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Bank , Reliance Capital and Life Insurance Corp of India.  	   Foreign firms have been lobbying for liberalising access to the pension and insurance sectors in a fast-growing country where most of the 1.2 billion population lack such investments.	   Most of the 23 life insurance players in India, nearly all of which have a foreign partner holding a 26 percent stake, are eager to enter the pension fund market, analysts said.	   Global players holding stakes in Indian operators include Aviva , AIG , and AXA .	   The pension and the insurance bills are currently being examined by a parliamentary panel, headed by Yashwant Sinha, former finance minister and a leader of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.	   The panel has also recommended that the returns from a new government pension scheme — subscribed by employees of the federal and state governments — should fetch a minimum return at par with the state-run social security fund, the Employee Provident Fund (EPF). 	   The EPF, covered by separate law, manages more than $50 billion worth of assets for around 40 million employees and paid a 9.5 percent return in the fiscal year that ended in March 2011.

124,AIG,SEC examining mutual funds' use of derivatives,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators voted to seek public comment on whether to write new rules to better address the risks posed by mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment companies that use derivatives.  The unanimous decision on Wednesday to solicit input marks an initial step by the Securities and Exchange Commission as it examines the effectiveness of current disclosure and leverage rules as they relate to derivatives.  The fear is that funds can use derivatives to potentially exceed borrowing rules and risk limits, while technically complying with the letter of the law.  The SEC’s interest in derivatives use by investment companies predates the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which laid bare the potential risks of over-the-counter derivatives.  Credit default swaps played a central role in crises at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and American International Group Inc.  SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said that taking a closer look at derivatives use by funds is important because a lot has changed since the 1940 Investment Company Act was written.  “The Act imposes important leverage, valuation, diversification, and industry concentration requirements to help protect fund investors. However, those limitations were written with stocks and bonds in mind, not complex financial derivatives,” she said.  “As a result, fund investments in derivatives are not always wholly captured by the statutory limitations and requirements.”  The initial reform push began with former SEC Investment Management Director Andrew “Buddy” Donohue, who several years ago began questioning whether federal laws governing mutual funds and exchange-traded funds needed to be modernized. He asked the American Bar Association to study the issue.  In March 2010, the SEC announced it was conducting its own broad review of derivatives use by investment companies. The agency at that time also suspended exemptive requests from exchange-traded funds seeking to let them invest heavily in derivatives. That suspension is still in effect as the agency continues to study the issue.  The 1940 act places various restrictions on mutual funds, including the amount of money a fund can borrow.  But derivatives can be used as another means to achieve leverage, allowing funds potentially to exceed borrowing rules while still complying with the law.  Derivatives also allow funds to seek exposure to various things like bonds or stocks, without purchasing them directly.  Existing law primarily addresses direct investments by funds, raising questions about how swaps and other derivatives should be accounted for and valued on their books.  Jay Baris, a partner at Morrison and Foerster who helped lead the ABA task force that studied the derivatives issue, said the SEC has a difficult task ahead to come up with a uniform approach for derivatives use by investment companies.  “We want to make sure any potential fix doesn’t change the fundamental character of these funds and their ability to be innovative,” he said in an interview after Wednesday’s meeting.  ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS  Also on Wednesday, the SEC voted unanimously to seek comment on two companion documents that will help the agency determine how it should modernize regulations for asset-backed securities issuers and real estate investment trusts, or REITS, which are in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments.  Both issuers of ABS and REITs generally rely on exemptions from most investment company regulations to be able to operate.  Recent changes in financial law and investment practice, however, are forcing the SEC to take another look at how it should apply these exemptions.  In the past, asset-backed issuers making public offerings could be exempt from investment company regulations if the securities were rated by a credit-rating agency registered with the SEC. But last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law requires the SEC to remove the reliance on credit ratings from its rules, forcing the SEC to take another look at how to replace them.  The SEC plans to ask questions about how it should go about removing the rating reference and how it should be replaced.  REITS and other mortgage-backed securities issuers, meanwhile, have also typically relied on various conditions to qualify for an exemption as well.  As the mortgage market has evolved, however, the SEC said it is concerned that certain pooled investment vehicles have relied on the exemption without sufficient SEC guidance, even as their activities have shifted in some cases away from a direct interest in the real estate business to more indirect interests through mortgage-related securities investments.

127,AIG,Exclusive: Bank of America kept AIG legal threat under wraps,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top Bank of America Corp lawyers knew as early as January that American International Group Inc was prepared to sue the bank for more than $10 billion, seven months before the lawsuit was filed, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Bank of America shares fell more than 20 percent on August 8, the day the lawsuit was filed, adding to worries about the stability of the largest U.S. bank. It wasn’t until Warren Buffett stepped up with a $5 billion investment that those fears were eased, though hardly eliminated.  The bank made no mention of the lawsuit threat in a quarterly regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just four days earlier. Nor did management discuss it on conference calls about quarterly results and other pending legal claims.  The SEC’s rules for litigation disclosure are murky, and some lawyers said Bank of America may have been justified in not revealing AIG’s lawsuit before it was filed. The bank’s litigation disclosures are in line with those of many rivals.  But other lawyers said banks have an obligation to disclose legal threats that could have major consequences.  “Publicly owned companies are supposed to disclose material threatened litigation under generally accepted accounting principles,” said Richard Rowe, a former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, who was commenting generally and not specifically about Bank of America.  Rowe, now a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of law firm Proskauer Rose, said bank executives must make a “judgment call” as to what is material, but “the general rule is, if it’s threatened litigation and it’s material, and you can put a number on it, you should disclose it.”  AIG’s lawsuit shows why investors are so fearful: they have no idea how much litigation lurks behind closed doors.  “Management surely has a credibility problem with investors,” said Jonathan Finger, whose Finger Interests Number One Ltd in Houston owns Bank of America shares. “They continue to under-address or under-disclose on the mortgage issue.”  Finger in 2009 sued the bank over its disclosures related to the takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co.  Bank of America and AIG declined to comment for this article.  SEC staff have this year advised banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, and Morgan Stanley to disclose more information about lawsuits that have been filed, as well as legal proceedings that they know the government is considering.  Banks have responded by providing additional information, including legal loss estimates in some cases.  But the agency has given banks more leeway in disclosing the expected cost of early-stage litigation, or threats of litigation whose outcome is more difficult to predict, according to securities lawyers and current and former regulatory officials.  There are two standards for disclosing legal liabilities. One under banks’ legal proceedings relies on whether losses are “reasonably probable” and “reasonably estimable.” Another, under management’s discussion and analysis, is based on whether losses are “reasonably possible.” Disclosure relies heavily on management’s assessment of the merits of a case.  Companies might need to disclose large potential lawsuits, even if they believe a loss is improbable, as well as less consequential cases if a loss appears certain, said Meredith Cross, director of the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance, in an interview with Reuters about the SEC’s disclosure requirements.  “The goal has been to have better disclosures, which should result in fewer surprises,” said Cross, who was speaking generally and not commenting on any specific institution.  Legal experts say it is difficult for top bank executives to decide exactly what they have to disclose in relation to pending and potential legal matters. That is particularly true in the current environment, they said, in which confidence in large banks is so easily shaken by legal threats that may or may not have merit.  “This is a classic problem in the disclosure regime with litigation,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “You’re required to disclose anything material. The question is, ‘is it material?’ You have to gauge the size and the probability of success, which is very hard to evaluate.”  Before suing Bank of America, AIG spent months analyzing publicly available data on a sample of 262,322 loans behind mortgage-backed securities it bought from Bank of America and its Merrill Lynch and Countrywide units between 2005 and 2007.  In its court filing, AIG said marketing materials touted the loans as being much safer than they were.  For instance, AIG said that in almost every bond offering, it was told that none of the mortgages were worth more than the value of the underlying property, when in fact one in six loans were underwater from the day they were born.  AIG raised such issues with Bank of America in January and said it planned to sue unless a settlement could be reached, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sources either had direct knowledge of the legal proceedings or were briefed on them, but were not authorized to discuss the case publicly.  Both sides entered a “tolling agreement” to stop any legal statutes of limitation from running out while settlement talks were underway, but by March it became clear that AIG was prepared to sue for more than $10 billion, the people said.  Bank of America disputed AIG’s claims, saying losses stemmed from the insurer’s flawed decision making, as well as broader declines in home values and capital markets, the people said. The parties agreed to enter mediation proceedings during the second quarter, and also floated other proposals to no avail, the people said.  “There were lots of efforts made to avoid the filing over a period of months, but ultimately the discussions were not fruitful,” said one of the people.  A key stumbling block was Bank of America’s refusal to provide data for all of the loans, to show whether AIG’s sample — the heart of its case — was representative.  Bank of America “ignored” AIG’s requests for such information, while trustees and mortgage-servicers that also had access to the information “flat-out refused to cooperate,” according to AIG’s complaint.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has yet to respond in court to AIG’s lawsuit, but has said the insurer should have been smart enough to understand what it was buying.  “AIG recklessly chased high yields and profits throughout the mortgage and structured finance markets,” spokesman Larry DiRita said. “It is the very definition of an informed, seasoned investor, with losses solely attributable to its own excesses and errors.”  Bank of America devotes plenty of space in its regulatory filings to mortgage litigation.  The bank suffered after buying Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. subprime lender, in 2008 for $2.5 billion. Litigation and loan losses linked to that deal have cost the bank more than $30 billion.  In its August 4 quarterly filing, Bank of America spent nearly 4,000 words on a footnote describing litigation and regulatory matters. The bank said it spent $2.3 billion on legal costs, not including external fees, during the period, and could be short on reserves for future legal liabilities by as much as $2.3 billion.  On June 29, Bank of America said it agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve what it said would be much of the litigation it faced over mortgage-backed securities, and set aside another $5.5 billion for future possible claims.  The agreement with 22 investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Blackrock Inc, Allianz SE’s Pimco and others, covered mortgages with $174 billion in unpaid principal balance. Still, many investors have challenged the planned payout and disclosures as inadequate.  On a conference call to discuss the agreement, Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch asked for further explanation of securities litigation not covered by the deal.  “That will be an ongoing process,” Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson replied. “And I think if you look at the disclosure and what we have out there, it is pretty fulsome.”  Many large U.S. banks offer limited disclosure about their potential future legal bills.  None of the six biggest U.S. banks have volunteered definitive estimates of future legal costs, exact numbers of lawsuits or the potential damages that plaintiffs seek.  In its most recent quarterly filing, for example, JPMorgan said it is facing more than 10,000 legal proceedings, and that it may have to pay about $5.1 billion more to resolve these claims than the sum it has set aside. What that sum is, it does not say. Citigroup and Wells Fargo have made similar disclosures.  Morgan Stanley has offered legal-loss estimates for a handful of cases, totaling $1.7 billion, while Goldman Sachs lowered its legal-loss estimate by $700 million last quarter to $2 billion, even though it also detailed a slew of new legal and regulatory matters.  Barclays analyst Roger Freeman describes such legal-loss estimates as little more than holding a finger to the wind.  “We do not believe that this represents the realistic expected value of legal liabilities,” he said of Goldman Sachs’ estimate.  Bank of America’s shares dropped 20.3 percent on August 8 when the AIG lawsuit was filed, though many other factors influenced bank stocks that day, including Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States.  Since that time, its stock recovered only after Buffett — whose Berkshire Hathaway has made several investments in financial firms since 2008 — expressed support with a $5 billion preferred stock investment.  On Monday, the bank said it sold about half its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion, which also boosted Bank of America’s shares.  But even with the extra capital, Bank of America is sure to face huge legal hurdles over the long term.  “I’m concerned about the litigation, obviously,” said University of Delaware’s Elson, who is also a Bank of America shareholder. “Until it happens, you just don’t know.” (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel, Joe Rauch and Ben Berkowitz.

128,AIG,"Nevada, U.S. regulator challenge BofA on mortgages","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s mortgage practices came under fresh fire as state and federal regulators questioned whether the largest U.S. bank is doing what it must to address perceived harm to homeowners and investors.  Nevada’s attorney general on Tuesday accused the bank of repeatedly violating its $8.4 billion agreement with that state and others to address fraudulent lending charges involving its Countrywide unit, which it bought in 2008.  Catherine Cortez Masto, the state attorney general, asked a federal judge in Reno, Nevada, to let her back out of that accord and sue Bank of America on behalf of homeowners in Nevada, which has one of the nation’s highest foreclosure rates and percentages of borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth.  Separately on Tuesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as dozens of investors lodged objections to Bank of America’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, an agreement negotiated by the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  Among the other objectors was Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which said it lacks enough information to know whether the accord treats all “similarly situated” investors equally.  And in a third proceeding, a group of homeowners sued to block that $8.5 billion accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong mortgage abuses. That group asked for a court order requiring the bank to follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”  In her proposed complaint, the Nevada attorney general said Bank of America still engages in “a pattern and practice” of misleading consumers about such matters as why it denies mortgage modifications, or begins foreclosures while modification requests are pending.  Bank of America was to help 400,000 borrowers modify their home loans under the 2008 accord.  But Masto called the process “chaotic,” even accusing the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank of reprimanding workers for spending “too much time” on the phone — an average of seven to 10 minutes — with individual customers.  “Defendants’ deceptive practices have resulted in an explosion of delinquencies and unauthorized and unnecessary foreclosures” in Nevada, Masto said in court papers. “The state no longer can get the benefit of its original settlement.”  It is unclear how the allegations might affect long-running negotiations on a potential multibillion-dollar settlement with regulators nationwide to improve foreclosure practices at several big banks, including Bank of America.  “We disagree that there has been any material breach of the consent decree and will continue to vigorously defend this action.” Bank of America spokeswoman Jumana Bauwens said in response to the Nevada filings.  Lawrence Grayson, another bank spokesman, declined to comment on the other litigation matters, as did Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine.  The settlement with mortgage-backed securities covers 530 mortgage pools from the former Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it.  Bank of New York Mellon had negotiated the accord, covering $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, with 22 big investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  But some other investors say the payout is too low, or they lack enough information to know whether the accord is fair.  In a court filing, the FHFA called it a “positive” that the settlement calls for improving loan servicing and fixing deficient documentation, and said the support of many large market participants is “encouraging.”  Still, the FHFA said it lacks enough information about the accord, and wants to be ready to voice a “substantive” objection “should a now unforeseen issue arise.”  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010 guaranteed 70 percent of single-family mortgage-backed securities that were issued, and provided $1.03 trillion of market liquidity, an FHFA report to Congress in June shows.  “The FHFA sounds like it wants to preserve its right to contest refinements that could expose Fannie and Freddie to greater losses,” said Kathleen Engel, associate dean at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and co-author of “The Subprime Virus.”  Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for the FHFA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Meanwhile, the homeowners, who say they have received default notices, seek class-action status for Countrywide borrowers from 2004 to 2008 whose loans are in the trusts and are serviced by Bank of America.”  “The settlement agreement will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system, and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market,” the complaint said.  “It is not clear the borrowers have standing,” Engel said. “They certainly may be aggrieved by servicing problems, but they have to show the settlement itself causes them harm, either new injury or the loss of legal rights.”  A lawyer for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.  Several dozen objections to the $8.5 billion settlement were filed ahead of a Tuesday deadline to intervene in the case, which is overseen by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  Some of the challenges were filed simultaneously in federal court, where some of the objectors hope to move the case.  American International Group Inc, the insurer suing Bank of America for $10 billion in a separate MBS case, is among the objectors. Others include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, attorneys general of New York and Delaware, and various banks, insurers, investment funds and pension funds.  US Bancorp, trustee for a $1.75 billion Countrywide mortgage pool, this week separately sued Bank of America to force it to buy back the underlying loans.  The Nevada case is Nevada v.

129,AIG,BofA sued over $1.75 billion Countrywide mortgage pool,"NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) was sued by the trustee of a $1.75 billion mortgage pool, which seeks to force the bank to buy back the underlying loans because of alleged misrepresentations in how they were made.  The lawsuit by the banking unit of US Bancorp (USB.N) is the latest of a number of suits seeking to recover investor losses tied to risky mortgage loans issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.  In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, U.S. Bank said Countrywide, which issued the 4,484 loans in the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10, materially breached its obligations by systemically misrepresenting the quality of its underwriting and loan documentation.  Soon after the loans were sold to the trust, they “began to become delinquent and default at a startling rate,” the complaint said. Out of a sample of 786 of the loans, 520, or 66 percent, breached one or more representations, it said.  U.S. Bank said it demanded that Bank of America fix the breaches or buy back the loans as it had agreed to do, but that it has refused and offered no reason for this refusal.  The lawsuit demands that the bank repurchase all the loans in the pool, or at least those it knows have problems and are hurting investors in the trust.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the bank is still reviewing the complaint, but the bank does not believe U.S. Bank has the right to demand repurchases under the mortgage pool agreements, or can demand repurchase for loans that are not delinquent or have been paid off.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.  Last fall, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the bank would fight repurchase claims by investors, calling the process “hand-to-hand combat.”  In 2011, however, he has agreed to large settlements with mortgage financiers Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, as well as billionaire Wilbur Ross’ bond insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd (AGO.N). Then in June, he agreed to pay $8.5 billion to settle a wide range of Countrywide claims.  The $8.5 billion pact requires court approval but has drawn objections from several dozen investors, as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the New York and Delaware attorneys general. Bank of America also faces a $10 billion lawsuit by bailed-out insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N).  Bank of America shares closed down 27 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $8.12 on the New York Stock Exchange.  The case is U.S. Bank NA v.

130,AIG,"UPDATE 5-Nevada, US regulator challenge BofA on mortgages"," * Nevada says seeks to exit 2008 accord that bank violated   * Fannie/Freddie regulator challenge $8.5 bln accord   * Borrowers sue to block $8.5 bln accord  (Updates and recasts with Nevada lawsuit, Bank of America comment, paragraphs 1-13)   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) mortgage practices came under fresh fire as state and federal regulators questioned whether the largest U.S. bank is doing what it must to address perceived harm to homeowners and investors.   Nevada’s attorney general on Tuesday accused the bank of repeatedly violating its $8.4 billion agreement with that state and others to address fraudulent lending charges involving its Countrywide unit, which it bought in 2008.   Catherine Cortez Masto, the state attorney general, asked a federal judge in Reno, Nevada, to let her back out of that accord and sue Bank of America on behalf of homeowners in Nevada, which has one of the nation’s highest foreclosure rates and percentages of borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth.   Separately on Tuesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, as well as dozens of investors lodged objections to Bank of America’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, an agreement negotiated by the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N).   Among the other objectors was Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which said it lacks enough information to know whether the accord treats all “similarly situated” investors equally.   And in a third proceeding, a group of homeowners sued to block that $8.5 billion accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong mortgage abuses. That group asked for a court order requiring the bank to follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”   In her proposed complaint, the Nevada attorney general said Bank of America still engages in “a pattern and practice” of misleading consumers about such matters as why it denies mortgage modifications, or begins foreclosures while modification requests are pending.

132,AIG,U.S. judge pans rush in BofA $8.5 billion mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge questioned why Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with mortgage securities investors was being rushed for approval and whether the trustee that negotiated it treated investors fairly.  U.S. District Judge William Pauley set a September 21 hearing to consider requests from some investors to move the case to Manhattan federal court from a New York state court, where the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp wants it handled.  That timetable is slower than Bank of New York Mellon wanted and could imperil a scheduled November 17 hearing before New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick to consider approving the settlement.  “It strikes me there are some novel and complex issues,” Pauley said at a hearing on Thursday. “The court would benefit from some fulsome briefing.”  A delay could help unhappy investors learn more through additional litigation, which could lead to higher payouts.  “There’s nothing special about the dates,” said Owen Cyrulnik, a lawyer for 11 investment entities sharing the Walnut Place name that have challenged the accord. “None of these dates are set in stone.”  The settlement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances from Countrywide Financial Corp, which was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America bought it in 2008.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment. Bank of America were down 14 cents at $8.03 in afternoon trading.  The settlement was negotiated by the trustee with 22 institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco and also requires Bank of America to improve its mortgage servicing practices.  But 44 groups of investors, including banks, hedge funds, insurers and pension funds, complained they do not have enough information to know whether the accord is fair. Some say the 5 cents on the dollar payout is too low. Others suggested Bank of New York Mellon has conflicts of interest.  Among those investors seeking to intervene were Walnut Place, American International Group Inc, the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  At Thursday’s hearing, Pauley asked Matthew Ingber, a lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon, why the bank seemed to push for a quick settlement and failed to notify all of the trust beneficiaries.  “What is the extreme exigency here?” Pauley said. “You did unilaterally just fix those dates, and the state court judge went along with it ... in a vacuum.”  Ingber said quick approval would assure the return of money to investors and improve Bank of America’s mortgage servicing.  NO OPT-OUT  But Pauley questioned Bank of New York Mellon’s decision to seek approval of the accord through a so-called Article 77 proceeding, which under New York law lets a trustee seek a judicial endorsement of trust-related decisions.  It is usually invoked in smaller disputes rather than large commercial cases and the judge said its “main benefit appears to limit the right of the trust beneficiaries to opt out.”  That makes a resolution to an Article 77 case unlike a typical class-action settlement, which the Bank of America accord resembles in other respects.  Ingber said Bank of New York Mellon in fact was “open and transparent,” adding: “I disagree with the premise that we’re not giving others opportunities to be heard.”  Pauley also challenged the bank’s reliance on opinions from professors and mortgage specialists to help it settle the $8.5 billion payout.  “How can any expert opine on the amount a certificate holder could recover through litigation?” he said.  Prior to setting the September 21 hearing date, Pauley gave Walnut Place until September 14 to file papers. He then chided Ingber’s request for a week to respond.  “Now it’s not so expedited,” the judge said.  He gave two days.

134,AIG,Few insurers planning for climate change - report," * One in eight insurers have formal climate policy   * Study based on reports to state insurance bodies   * Ceres says insurers overly focused on hurricanes   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Only one in eight insurers has a formal policy in place to manage climate risk, despite rising evidence that environmental changes are exacerbating insurers’ disaster losses, according to a coalition of public interest groups.   The coalition, Ceres, looked at 88 filings from six states by insurance companies, using a form developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Ceres said it was the first-ever effort to quantify how U.S. insurers manage climate risk in their day-to-day operations.   Despite the broad lack of a formal policy, Ceres said insurers generally acknowledge the problem of climate change and the effect it can have on their business.   “Even those insurers with no formal climate policy, no climate risk management structure and a stated belief that the company is not vulnerable to the effects of climate change still name perils that may be affected by climate change 20 percent of the time,” Ceres said in its report.   Of the 11 companies with formal climate policies, two — Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and Genworth Financial (GNW.N) — are life insurers. The rest are mostly multi-line insurers or reinsurers. Among them are ACE Ltd ACE.N, AIG’s (AIG.N) Chartis unit.   (For an Insider interview with the author of the Ceres report, click here: link.reuters.com/myk53s)   The Ceres report comes as insurers start paying claims for last week’s Hurricane Irene, which broke flood records across the U.S. Northeast, and as they look to the Atlantic for the approach of what may become Hurricane Katia.   Because of the potential for hurricanes to cause sudden and huge losses in the United States, Ceres said the insurance industry is especially focused on how climate change will affect hurricane exposure, potentially at the expense of studying the impact on other common perils.   Some insurance companies have taken a public stand on climate issues, particularly home and auto insurer Allstate (ALL.N), which has warned that recent severe weather is part of a permanent change in the environment, and German reinsurance heavyweight Munich Re (MUVGn.DE).   Ceres recommended that all states make the National Association of Insurance Commissioners disclosure form mandatory and public, and that they adopt the model of California insurance regulators, who put together detailed guidelines on how to fill out the form.   Ceres describes itself is a national coalition of investors, environmental organizations and public interest groups.

135,AIG,U.S. regulator to sue major banks over mortgages,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator plans to sue major banks in coming days over subprime mortgage bonds, two sources said, in a lawsuit that may hamper a broader government mortgage settlement with banks.  Word of the lawsuits by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, came as a surprise to the market and weighed on bank shares. The lawsuits could add billions of dollars to the banks’ potential legal costs at perhaps the worst possible time for the industry.  The FHFA plans to accuse major banks, including Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co, of selling bonds backed by mortgages that should have never been packaged into securities, said the sources, who are familiar with the matter. Neither source was authorized to speak on the record. A spokeswoman for the FHFA declined to comment.  The biggest banks are already negotiating with the attorneys general of all 50 states to address mortgage abuses. They are looking for a comprehensive settlement that will protect them from future litigation and limit their potential mortgage litigation losses.  “This new litigation could disrupt the AG settlement,” said Anthony Sanders, finance professor at George Mason University and a former mortgage bond strategist. Banks may be more reluctant to agree to a settlement if they know litigation from other government players could still wallop their capital, he said.  Before the FHFA lawsuits had even hit a court docket, financial experts offered blunt expectations for the outcome.  “The lawsuits will be settled. The end result will be a further outflow of cash from the banks, and more importantly an additional black eye,” said Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Co.  The FHFA is set to file the lawsuits by Tuesday, before the three-year statute of limitations expires, one of the two sources said. The FHFA’s plans were first reported by the New York Times.  FHFA director Edward DeMarco is looking to minimize future losses for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are owned by the government after failing in 2008. The firms are pillars of U.S. mortgage finance.  The KBW Bank Index was down 4.7 percent, nearly doubling the losses of the broader market. Bank of America led the index lower, dropping 9 percent.  Bank shares also came under pressure from signs that the Federal Reserve could start selling shorter-term debt on its books and buying long-dated bonds to push longer-term yields lower as a stimulus measure.  Such a move, known as “operation twist,” would hurt banks whose profit margin is tied to the short-term rates at which they fund and the longer-term rates at which they invest.  Major banks already face potential payouts of tens of billions of dollars to settle regulatory charges of abusive mortgage lending and foreclosure practices, and other investor lawsuits over mortgage debt losses.  Such payouts would reduce earnings and weaken capital levels, perhaps harming the ability of banks to lend money and provide much-needed life to a stalled housing market and weakened economy.  The sources declined to name the banks to be sued by the FHFA, but The New York Times reported that they include Bank of America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and others. Representatives of those banks declined to comment.  Banks have been walloped by mortgage losses, but so have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which failed after trying to finance too many bad mortgages with too little equity. The two entities guarantee bonds backed by mortgages.  The question of whether to take action for problems related to the mortgage bonds has been under discussion since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship in 2008, a third person familiar with the matter said.  While the ultimate amount FHFA will seek is still unclear, the third source said it could top the $20 billion being discussed by the banks and the state attorneys general.  The blizzard of litigation against banks is hurting share prices in the sector because investors feel unable to estimate the ultimate scope of a given bank’s legal liabilities.  Bank of America, for example, had intended its proposed $8.5 billion settlement in June with investors in Countrywide mortgage securities to resolve most litigation tied to its disastrous 2008 takeover of that home loan provider.  But many parties are objecting to that settlement, and the deal didn’t stop the insurer American International Group Inc from suing Bank of America for $10 billion over its own alleged mortgage securities losses.  Nor did it stop Nevada’s attorney general from threatening to withdraw from an $8.4 billion nationwide settlement with the bank. The AG now wants to sue the bank, accusing it of reneging on promises to modify mortgages.  Other banks also face mortgage lawsuits. In May, for example, the U.S. Justice Department sued Deutsche Bank, accusing it of misleading a U.S. housing agency into believing loans it made qualified for federal insurance.  The FHFA’s lawsuits would follow an initial lawsuit in July against UBS AG seeking to recover $900 million of losses incurred on $4.5 billion of debt.  One legislator praised the expected FHFA lawsuits. Brad Miller, a Democratic congressman from North Carolina, said, “Not pursuing those claims would be an indirect subsidy for an industry that has gotten too many subsidies already.”  FHFA and various investors have alleged that banks, while packaging residential home loans into securities sold to investors, failed to conduct adequate due diligence, and hid or misstated the quality of the underlying loans and underwriting as well as borrowers’ ability to make payments.  As more borrowers fell behind or went into foreclosure, the value of securities backed by their loans fell, causing losses for investors.  Losses stemming from the precipitous deterioration in subprime and other mortgages pushed the government to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on September 7, 2008. Since then, taxpayers have spent more than $140 billion to keep the firms afloat.

137,AIG,COLUMN-Quinn Emanuel rides an MBS tsunami: Alison Frankel," -- Alison Frankel writes the On the Case blog for Thomson Reuters News & Insight (newsandinsight.com). The views expressed are her own. --   By Alison Frankel   NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Housing Finance Agency’s reported mortgage-backed securities suits against a slew of major banks haven’t yet been filed. But if you want to know what they’re likely to look like, check out Mass Mutual’s 168-page MBS complaint against Bank of America (BAC.N), Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, and JPMorgan (JPM.N), filed Thursday. (It’s so big the Massachusetts federal court docket splits it into four parts.) Or you could look at AIG’s (AIG.N) $10 billion megasuit against BofA, Countrywide, and Merrill, filed on Aug. 8, or Allstate’s (ALL.N) 114-page complaint against Goldman Sachs [GSGSC.UL] on Aug. 15, or U.S. Bank’s MBS breach-of-contract suit against BofA, which came at the beginning of this week.   All of those complaints — and many, many more raising allegations that big banks misrepresented the quality of the mortgages underlying the asset-backed securities they packaged and sold — were filed by the law firm representing FHFA in its MBS investigation: Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. And that’s no accident. Quinn Emanuel, a 450-lawyer firm whose partners take home an average of more than $3 million a year, made a conscious decision more than three years ago to push into structured finance litigation against money-center banks, at a time when most litigators didn’t know the first thing about these instruments. In a way, the anticipated FHFA suits are the culmination of Quinn Emanuel’s four-year investment in MBS litigation.   Before 2007, Quinn Emanuel was usually competing for a seat on the banks’ side of the table. Then name partner John Quinn, a onetime Cravath, Swaine & Moore lawyer, had a revolutionary thought. Quinn Emanuel doesn’t have a big corporate practice, he reasoned, so there were no conflicts to keep the firm from suing financial institutions. Rather than vie with a pack of premier law firms for bank business, he decided the firm should give up its relationships with banks and accounting firms and start representing corporate clients with claims against big banks. “We deduced there weren’t very many prestigious law firms willing to be adverse to financial institutions,” name partner William Urquhart told me Friday.    The firm’s New York office was perfectly positioned for the new practice area. Quinn Emanuel New York lawyers represented the trustee in the Parmalat bankruptcy, so they’d already had some experience litigating against banks. And litigators Peter Calamari and Philippe Selendy had at least a glancing knowledge of structured finance from cases they’d handled against UBS (UBS.N) and Bear Stearns. So when the housing bubble burst and mortgage-backed securities began to crater, Calamari, Selendy, and structured finance partner Jonathan Pickhardt hunkered down to learn all they could about the instruments — before Quinn Emanuel even had a single MBS client. “We invested an enormous amount of lawyer time to gain a deep, deep understanding of mortgage-backed securities,” Urquhart said.   “We had the expertise, and we had the horsepower,” added Calamari. “By the spring of 2008, it was apparent residential mortgage-backed securities were a disaster.”    The firm’s first MBS client was MBIA, the bond insurer. In October 2008, as the economic crisis worsened, Quinn Emanuel filed MBIA’s suit against Countrywide in New York state supreme court. That litigation produced some landmark MBS decisions from Judge Eileen Bransten, who refused to dismiss MBIA’s contract and fraud claims, ruled that MBIA can use statistical sampling to determine the percentage of deficient underlying mortgage loans, and granted the insurer access to discovery on the relationship between credit rating agencies and MBS issuers. Other businesses with MBS investments — including Mass Mutual, Allstate, and Assured Guaranty (AGO.N) — saw how the MBIA case was going and came to Quinn with their own claims. In October 2010 the FHFA disclosed that it had hired Quinn to analyze its potential MBS claims.   The work has already paid off big for Quinn Emanuel, even though MBS settlements are so far a rarity. (Two Quinn clients, Assured and the FHFA, have reached multibillion MBS settlements with BofA; the previous FHFA settlement involved mortgage loans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought directly from Countrywide for their own securitizations; the expected new FHFA suit will center on mortgage-backed securities Fannie and Freddie invested in.) Unlike traditional plaintiffs firms, Quinn bills about 90 percent of its MBS cases at hourly rates, rather than on contingency. The volume of MBS litigation, in combination with the firm’s booming IP practice, has made Quinn Emanuel one of the three or four most profitable firms in the country.   Calamari told me that the MBS wave won’t last forever. New York has a six-year statute of limitations on fraud and contract claims; other states have narrower windows. The FHFA cases are reportedly being filed now to beat a three-year statute. “It’s clear that deadlines are coming,” Calamari said.   But the end is near only for new filings. When it comes to results of the MBS litigation, we’re just at the beginning.

138,AIG,Springleaf proves AAA subprime RMBS can make perfect sense,"NEW YORK, Sept 2 (IFR) - Nobody versed in the basics of securitization was shocked that the staggering 51.15 percent layer of credit protection guarding the senior notes of the first visible post-crisis subprime RMBS helped it achieve a AAA rating from S&P and price this past week with a 4 percent coupon.  The fact that S&P now rates the U.S. sovereign comparatively lower at AA+, may be somewhat ironic and makes for catchy headlines. But it is irrelevant given that the U.S. downgrade impacted less than 5 percent of the total structured-transaction universe rated by S&P.  A subprime AAA rating may be completely appropriate if a deal is properly structured and sensibly underwritten.  “The AAA rating <on a securitization> is based on the structure and the level of credit enhancement in the deal,” said Ralph Mazzeo, a partner at Dechert LLP. “The fact that the U.S. government has been downgraded is not relevant to the analysis in a private deal with no government-guaranteed loans or bonds.”  Indeed, the whole concept of structured finance is that the rating is designed to be based on the credit quality of the assets, not the issuer.  What was more striking, however, was that a deal executed with such thick subordination was not only profitable for issuer Springleaf Financial, but may highlight a growing opportunity for other well-capitalized consumer lenders to reignite the U.S. subprime mortgage sector with properly and responsibly underwritten collateral.  “There is a gigantic cohort of people who need credit, but the capital markets — banks and balance sheets — are on full-out retreat,” said Wesley Edens, co-founder, principal and co-chairman of the board of directors of Fortress Investment Group, which owns 80 percent of Springleaf Financial. “This presents a tremendous market opportunity.”  Edens says Springleaf is committed to filling that much-needed subprime mortgage niche, just as banks such as Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and HSBC are leaving the sector.  Springleaf announced IPO plans in a May SEC filing for a new REIT to invest in subprime mortgages.  “There is a lot of demand for the product, no competition, and funding rates are at historic lows,” Edens said. “The missing link is, can you get financing at modest leverage and at a reasonable cost?”  Apparently, the answer is yes.  Although Springleaf had to boost credit enhancement above the S&P requirement during the marketing phase for Springleaf Mortgage Trust 2011-1 — and retain a US$49.7m slice of the US$292m Triple A Tranche sold in 144a format (in addition to about US$143m of bonds below this tranche) — the company was still able to achieve leveraged returns of about 14 percent on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch and RBS-led issue, Edens said.  This takes into consideration that the deal was executed at 50 percent leverage, with a 4 percent all-in cost, and backed by a US$497m portfolio of mortgages originated with an average interest rate of 9 percent.  The underlying pool comprises more than 5,600 loans that are almost 100 percent fully documented. With an average FICO score of 651 and a current LTV of roughly 96 percent, the offering raised some eyebrows, but the assets are all performing, according to a transaction term sheet, which is nothing short of miraculous for a sub-prime portfolio.  “Any leverage is a good leverage,” said Ron D’Vari, CEO of NewOak Capital Advisors. “If an issuer believes in the collateral and cash flows, retains some of the risk, and uses the proceeds as a funding trade, securitization of subprime-mortgage collateral can make economic sense, without a doubt.”  “There’s a level and a price for everything,” added Scott Simon, a managing director at PIMCO who oversees securitized products.  In fact, Springleaf weathered the financial crisis better than its peers, with just 6 percent of serious delinquencies in its subprime book, compared with roughly 42 percent for the broader subprime market.  “There is the potential for a ton of capital formation over the next few years, and heavily capitalized credit providers will have terrific businesses,” Edens said.  While the transaction was backed by seasoned loans, Springleaf has about US$11bn of new loans on its balance sheet since it started lending as a Fortress-owned entity nine months ago, and plans to return to the subprime RMBS market in the near future, Edens said.  The company, formerly known as American General Finance, was spun off from a unit of AIG (AIG.N) last November when Fortress took its stake in it. An AIG unit still owns 20 percent.  Springleaf, which has been around for 90 years, is historically a “balance-sheet” lender that believes in an old-fashioned “bricks and mortar” model - in which “the lender sits across the table from the borrower” and has a vested interest in the loans, Edens said.  Securitization allows for cheaper financing and is more flexible and predictable than getting a bank loan, which often contains covenants and terms that are more dynamic.  In fact, Springleaf completed a secured term loan in May that had lower leverage than the current securitization, but a higher cost of funds.  Edens says that Springleaf can still turn a profit despite hugely expensive credit enhancement, and that a subprime mortgage securitization can return “as long as it’s done in a responsible way.”  But while well-capitalized issuers may see a window of opportunity over the next couple of years, the real question facing the industry is whether other lenders will be willing or able to follow suit.  S&P, Bank of America and RBS declined to comment.

139,AIG,AIG's plane leasing unit ILFC files for IPO,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - AIG’s aircraft leasing unit, International Lease Finance Corp, filed for an initial public offering on Friday despite deep uncertainty in equity markets that could delay an offering until next year.  ILFC Holdings Inc, as the company will be called, is the world No. 1 in the business of buying planes and leasing them to airlines. It controls more than 1,000 aircraft and is one of the most important customers of both Boeing Co (BA.N) and EADS’s EAD.PA Airbus unit.  American International Group Inc (AIG.N) bought the business in 1990 and has made no secret of its desire to sell it. Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said last month that the business was worth at least $8 billion and that no one could afford to buy it.  AIG plans to sell more than 20 percent of its stake in the company through the IPO and dispose of at least 80 percent of its interest within three years of the offering.  ILFC earned $143.1 million on revenue of $2.29 billion in the six months ended June 30. Analysts said that although ILFC was a good opportunity for investors, the AIG connection might dampen some interest.  “It is a wonderful opportunity for buyers except those that are very sour with anything that has to do with AIG,” said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com. “It’ll have an effect of giving more power to the buyers. It will be their chance to take a pound of flesh out of AIG in retaliation.”  AIG itself encountered a similar issue in May when the company and the U.S. Treasury conducted a share offering designed to reduce the government’s stake in AIG. Though AIG management told investors the stock’s true value was in the mid-$30s range, the offering was ultimately done at $29, just pennies above the government’s break-even point.  AIG shares fell 3.5 percent to $23.93 in early trading Friday, a deeper decline than the broadly lower markets. At that price, AIG is almost $6 below the government’s break-even point.  The ILFC filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lists an offering size of $100 million, though that is typically a placeholder. Sources said in July the offering could be as large as $1.5 billion and value the company at $8 billion to $10 billion.  But the U.S. IPO market has struggled as concerns about Europe’s debt crisis and a weak economic recovery in the United States have made markets extremely volatile. This has made it difficult to price IPOs, and a number of deals were withdrawn last month ahead of the traditional U.S. IPO market August holiday.  Bankers and fund managers should return next week, but there is skepticism about how quickly the IPO market will come back.  “This (ILFC) deal will need to be very attractively priced to get done,” said Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPO research and investment house IPOX Schuster. “If it doesn’t come at an attractive price, they might not be able to bring it out, at least not in the United States.”  The IPO could happen this year, potentially in November, but that is unlikely, Schuster said.  ILFC is most likely just filing to start the IPO process, which can stretch out for months, he said.  AIG is expected to use the IPO proceeds to pay off some of the government’s preferred interests in an entity that controls AIG’s one-third stake in Asian insurer AIA (1299.HK).  If the company is able to pay off those preferred interests, it will be able to keep its stake in AIA, which it took public in Asia last year. In the second quarter, AIG’s interest in AIA accounted for almost all of AIG’s net profit.  AIG has been offloading assets after its September 2008 government bailout, which at one point totaled $182.3 billion.  Earlier this year, ILFC rival Air Lease Corp (AL.N) raised $802.5 million in an IPO. Its founder, Steven Udvar-Hazy, who also founded ILFC before selling it to AIG, has expressed interest in buying ILFC. AIG sources have cast doubt on his ability to do so.  Los Angeles-based ILFC said Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley would underwrite the IPO.  Citi and JPMorgan were expected, but sources said in July that Bank of America, not Morgan Stanley, would be the third bank. In the interim, though, AIG sued Bank of America for $10 billion over bad mortgage securities.  The IPO filing did not reveal how ILFC shares would be offered or their expected price. The company intends to list its common stock on the NYSE under the symbol “ILFC.”  ",9022011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ilfc/aigs-plane-leasing-unit-ilfc-files-for-ipo-idUSTRE78129420110902

142,AIG,Regulator defends suit against financial firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday it decided to file lawsuits against 17 financial institutions last week because the firms misrepresented the mortgages in securities filings.  “At the heart of the suits is FHFA’s conclusion that the actual mortgages backing many of the securities had characteristics that differed in a material way from what had been represented in securities filings,” the agency, which regulates mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said in a statement.  The lawsuits filed by FHFA on Friday accused lenders, including Bank of America Corp and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units, of misrepresenting the checks they had done on mortgages before bundling them into securities. The claims rely on provisions of federal securities law.  The regulator is seeking unspecified damages against the banks on about $200 billion in mortgage investments that were bought by Fannie and Freddie, mostly between 2005 and 2008.  FHFA said in its statement on Tuesday that the amount that might be recovered would be determined by the courts, and that it was “premature” to estimate recoverable damages.  However, it said the amount would be below $200 billion, since that figure represents the original amount of securities purchased, not the actual losses incurred.  The agency said the seller of the mortgage bonds has a “legal responsibility to accurately represent the characteristics of the loans backing the securities being sold.”  Nearly all the banks that were sued last week declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment on Friday. Others called the charges unfounded.  “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated investor, having issued trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and purchased hundreds of billions of dollars more,” said Mayura Hooper, a spokeswoman for defendant Deutsche Bank AG, in a statement.  FHFA said on Tuesday that the sophistication of Fannie and Freddie were not the issue.  “Under the securities laws at issue here, it does not matter how ‘big’ or ‘sophisticated’ a security purchaser is, the seller has a legal responsibility to accurately represent the characteristics of the loans backing the securities being sold,” it said.  According to the lawsuits, the securities should have never been sold because the underlying mortgages did not meet investors’ criteria.

143,AIG,Banks face huge losses from FHFA lawsuits: analysts,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - U.S. banks could face as much as $39 billion in losses if a series of lawsuits by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over soured mortgage bonds is successful, according to an analyst estimate.  The early estimates highlight potentially billions in additional losses U.S. banks might incur from soured mortgages, which helped drive a broad industry sell-off on Tuesday.  On Friday, FHFA sued 17 banks, alleging misrepresentations involving about $196 billion of mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the U.S. government-run mortgage investors which it oversees.  In the lawsuits, FHFA did not disclose what it was seeking in recoveries.  On Tuesday, the FHFA said in a statement it would be “premature and potentially misleading” to estimate any recoveries from the banks, but noted any amounts would be determined through the legal process.  John McDonald, bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note on Tuesday the largest banks could face billions in additional costs in his worst case estimate.  McDonald said that in a similar case filed against UBS earlier this year, the FHFA claimed $900 million in damages from $4.5 billion in mortgage bonds.  Using that ratio, McDonald concludes the banks could face $39 billion in losses, including $11.5 billion at Bank of America Corp, $6.5 billion at JPMorgan Chase & Co and $700 million at Citigroup Inc.  McDonald was not immediately available for comment.  But early opinions on the lawsuit’s potential impact vary widely, and analysts said the ultimate amount will depend on an unpredictable court process.  For instance, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc analyst Bose George estimated in a research note that banks could face as much as $60 billion in losses from the FHFA lawsuits.  George projected a 30 percent loss rate on FHFA’s claims.  Others increased their total estimates on Tuesday for what the industry faces in repurchase claims beyond the FHFA suit.  FBR Capital Markets boosted its worst case estimate, saying that banks will record total mortgage repurchase losses of $121 billion, up from $104 billion.  The four largest banks will also face a larger share of those claims, FBR Capital Markets projected, with those banks recording 60 percent of the losses, up from 40 percent.

On Tuesday, the FHFA said in a statement it would be “premature and potentially misleading” to estimate any recoveries from the banks, but noted any amounts would be determined through the legal process.   John McDonald, bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note on Tuesday the largest banks could face billions in additional costs in his worst case estimate.   McDonald said that in a similar case filed against UBS earlier this year, the FHFA claimed $900 million in damages from $4.5 billion in mortgage bonds.   Using that ratio, McDonald concludes the banks could face $39 billion in losses, including $11.5 billion at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), $6.5 billion at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and $700 million at Citigroup Inc (C.N).   McDonald was not immediately available for comment.   But early opinions on the lawsuit’s potential impact vary widely, and analysts said the ultimate amount will depend on an unpredictable court process.   For instance, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc analyst Bose George estimated in a research note that banks could face as much as $60 billion in losses from the FHFA lawsuits.   George projected a 30 percent loss rate on FHFA’s claims.   Others increased their total estimates on Tuesday for what the industry faces in repurchase claims beyond the FHFA suit.   FBR Capital Markets boosted its worst case estimate, saying that banks will record total mortgage repurchase losses of $121 billion, up from $104 billion.   The four largest banks will also face a larger share of those claims, FBR Capital Markets projected, with those banks recording 60 percent of the losses, up from 40 percent.

145,AIG,U.S. regulator defends suit against financial firms," WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday it decided to file lawsuits against 17 financial institutions last week because the firms misrepresented the mortgages in securities filings.   “At the heart of the suits is FHFA’s conclusion that the actual mortgages backing many of the securities had characteristics that differed in a material way from what had been represented in securities filings,” the agency, which regulates mortgage firms Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, said in a statement.   The lawsuits filed by FHFA on Friday accused lenders, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units, of misrepresenting the checks they had done on mortgages before bundling them into securities. The claims rely on provisions of federal securities law.   The regulator is seeking unspecified damages against the banks on about $200 billion in mortgage investments that were bought by Fannie and Freddie, mostly between 2005 and 2008.   FHFA said in its statement on Tuesday that the amount that might be recovered would be determined by the courts, and that it was “premature” to estimate recoverable damages.   However, it said the amount would be below $200 billion, since that figure represents the original amount of securities purchased, not the actual losses incurred.   The agency said the seller of the mortgage bonds has a “legal responsibility to accurately represent the characteristics of the loans backing the securities being sold.”   Nearly all the banks that were sued last week declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment on Friday. Others called the charges unfounded.   “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated investor, having issued trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and purchased hundreds of billions of dollars more,” said Mayura Hooper, a spokeswoman for defendant Deutsche Bank AG, in a statement.   FHFA said on Tuesday that the sophistication of Fannie and Freddie were not the issue.   “Under the securities laws at issue here, it does not matter how ‘big’ or ‘sophisticated’ a security purchaser is, the seller has a legal responsibility to accurately represent the characteristics of the loans backing the securities being sold,” it said.   According to the lawsuits, the securities should have never been sold because the underlying mortgages did not meet investors’ criteria.

146,AIG,U.S. bank stocks slide on mortgage worries,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America led bank stocks lower on Tuesday after mortgage lawsuits filed late on Friday aggravated investor fears that the biggest banks could face massive legal liabilities.  Late on Friday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency sued 17 large U.S. banks and financial institutions over $200 billion in subprime mortgage-backed bonds, now owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  JPMorgan shares declined 3.4 percent to close at $33.44 and Bank of America Corp dropped 3.6 percent to $6.99, outpacing a 2.5 percent fall for Citigroup Inc shares.  The drop in the share prices of JPMorgan and Bank of America — the two biggest U.S. banks — exceeded the 1.7 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index and 0.7 percent decline in the broader S&P 500 Index.  Analysts said investors are becoming concerned the industry faces a long slog of litigation due to toxic mortgages. The suit by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s regulator is just the latest addition to those worries.  “People are realizing there are no easy solutions and this could drag on for years,” said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager with Cincinatti-based Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel.  In August, investors pounded the shares of Bank of America — the largest U.S. bank — on fears it would need to raise as much as $50 billion in capital to absorb mortgage losses and fight related litigation.  U.S. banks have recently faced more lawsuits from investors who purchased mortgage-backed securities during the housing boom that are now comprised of toxic home loans.  Investors allege the loans were improperly made and failed to meet guarantees made by the banks at the time they were sold.  Those guarantees — known as representations and warranties — are now at the heart of billions of dollars of repurchase claims.  But until Friday, regulators had not sued over the issue.  “When you have a regulator suing on behalf of the parties it regulates, that’s bad news,” said Jefferson Harralson, a bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.  The legal worries have been particularly acute at Bank of America, which bought Countrywide Financial Corp — the country’s largest subprime mortgage lender — in July 2008.  The shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank have lost half their value this year and plunged by more than 20 percent in early August after insurer American International Group Inc filed a $10 billion suit over mortgages.  The plunge was temporarily arrested by a $5 billion investment in the bank by billionaire Warren Buffett, announced on August 25. The news sent Bank of America shares up by as much as 26 percent.  But on Tuesday, Bank of America shares dipped back to the closing price on the day before the Buffett investment was announced.

148,AIG,Macquarie eyes $6 billion RBS aircraft leasing unit: sources,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Macquarie Group is nearing a bid for the aircraft leasing business being sold by the Royal Bank of Scotland, a more than $6 billion unit that could help Australia’s top investment bank become the world’s No. 3 aviation lease operator.  The first round bids are due this week and the sale is attracting interest from other Asian players, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, with Macquarie expected to team up with another bidder.  RBS may break-up the business into two if they fail to find a single buyer for the whole business, one of the sources said.  The aircraft leasing unit is among the assets that RBS has had to sell as part of its government bailout after the 2008 financial crisis nearly toppled the bank. To repay its debt, RBS, still 83 percent owned by the UK government, has moved to sell a range of assets, including its insurance business and various parts of its bank.  RBS Aviation is one of the world’s top five commercial airline leasing firms — it owns, manages or has orders for 466 aircraft — and could fetch between $6 billion and $8 billion, industry sources and analysts have said.  Though a far cry from standard security underwriting, advisory work and lending, financial institutions like Macquarie have tacked on aircraft-leasing to their business operations, attracted by steady cash flows and returns.  Macquarie (MQG.AX) became a serious player in the industry only last year when it bought 53 passenger jets from AIG for close to $2 billion.  Investors cautioned that Macquarie should be disciplined in the bid to sustain the healthy returns the division is currently earning.  “Macquarie went and bought aircraft-leasing assets on the cheap just after the global financial crisis and that is why that business had done really well,” said Angus Gluskie, chief investment officer at White Funds Management in Sydney.  “The key question is what is the pricing going to be and will that pricing allow satisfactory returns? And remember credit conditions are tightening and the price of the asset a month or two later may be well below what it is now.”  Despite the market uncertainty, U.S. insurer AIG Inc (AIG.N) filed for an IPO of its aircraft leasing ILFC, the world’s biggest this week. Earlier this year, ILFC rival Air Lease Corp (AL.N) raised $802.5 million in an IPO.  Reuters reported in July that RBS excluded the former boss of its aircraft leasing business from the auction, raising concerns the part-nationalized bank is barring a credible bidder and could short-change the UK taxpayer.  Sources at the time said Dublin-based aircraft leasing firm Avolon, which is run by Domhnal Slattery, the founder and former CEO of RBS Aviation, has been barred from the process.  The July Reuters report said private equity firm Terra Firma, owner of rival leasing firm AWAS, and GE Capital Aviation Services were among the possible suitors.  Bank of China’s name has been connected to the sale as well. Bank of China (601988.SS) owns aviation leasing and financing unit BOC Aviation, which it bought for $3.2 billion in 2006 and owns about 40 aircraft.  Other interested Asian firms may include Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp. (8058.T), Marubeni Trading Co. To read that story, click on <ID: nL6E7IP115>.  The Australian Financial Review said on Tuesday that Macquarie was considering a bid that could be worth at least $6 billion and was eyeing a number of options including making a direct offer for the whole of the business, parts of the business or putting together a consortium to bid for the assets.  The paper added that a successful bid for the plane portfolio would hoist it to the third position in aircraft leasing globally, behind GE (GE.N) and AIG’s (AIG.N) International Leasing Finance Corp.

151,AIG,Analysis: BofA shake-up a crucial test for CEO Moynihan,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan is running out of time to fix the largest U.S. bank.  After reorganizing senior management and creating chief operating officers — a move straight out of the playbook of former Citigroup Inc (C.N) Chief Executive Charles “Chuck” Prince — Moynihan has few excuses if the bank fails to reverse course.  “This is a make-or-break type move,” said Andrew Ward, associate professor and corporate governance chair at Lehigh University.  Investors are pressing Bank of America to improve its performance after it lost money in four of the last six quarters and its stock has fallen by half this year.  “Any CEO whose stock is down where Bank of America’s is will be under some pressure,” said Jason Goldberg, bank analyst with Barclays Capital. “But you can’t turn an oil tanker around over night.”  And that’s the problem. It has 280,000 employees and more than $2.25 trillion of assets, making it tough to maneuver.  Investors have been spooked by worries the bank could need to raise as much as $50 billion in capital, by some estimates, to meet new global capital requirements. Bank of America has said it can raise the money it needs through selling assets and generating earnings, but tepid U.S. economic growth and mounting mortgage lawsuits may cut into earnings.  On August 8, Bank of America shares plunged more than 20 percent after insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) alleged a “massive” mortgage fraud.  The stock price drop was temporarily arrested by a $5 billion investment — and public vote of confidence — by billionaire investor Warren Buffett in late August. But shares fell on Tuesday below the $6.99 closing price on August 24 before the Buffett investment was announced, erasing the boost from his purchase.  Bank of America shares closed up 7 percent at $7.48 on Wednesday amid a broader rise in bank stock prices.  “(Moynihan is) in charge of a big castle that’s under siege from this army of lawyers and he has to protect the throne,” said James Ellman, president of Seacliff Capital, a San Francisco-based investment manager.  A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment.  Bank of America announced a far-reaching reorganization of its senior management team on Tuesday, which included the departure of consumer bank chief Joe Price and wealth management head Sallie Krawcheck.  Commercial banking head David Darnell and Thomas Montag, global banking and markets head, were promoted to become co-COOs.  The move was similar to when Prince — then CEO of Citigroup — named Robert Druskin chief operating officer in December 2006 and charged him with cutting costs. In October 2007, Prince shook up the leadership of Citigroup’s investment banking division and announced that sales and trading head Tom Maheras would be departing.  Moynihan and Prince have a lot in common. Both are lawyers charged with cleaning up the messes of acquisitive predecessors.  Both had some initial success as chief executives, followed by a period of failure. When times got tough, both added chief operating officers and shuffled senior management.  For Prince, the story did not end well — he resigned in November 2007.  Analysts said Moynihan may be under less immediate pressure because Bank of America has more capital than Citi had entering the 2008 global financial crisis and its operations outside its home loan business are profitable.  Bank of America has worked to resolve large portions of its mortgage and litigation exposure, but progress has been slow for some investors.  The restructuring is the third management change under Moynihan since he replaced Kenneth Lewis in January 2010. It has included four chief financial officers and creating a new division to cope with a $1 trillion portfolio of troubled loans the bank holds and services for other investors.  In October, the bank is expected to outline its cost-cutting program, known as New BAC, a play on its ticker symbol.  The expense control program will include job cuts.  Bank of America has entered into an $8.5 billion settlement with large institutional investors who purchased Countrywide bonds, although that deal is facing mounting opposition from investors and others.  Bank of America has also settled with Assured Guaranty Corp and Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB over similar repurchase issues earlier this year.  But if the bank is unable to rein in its mortgage and litigation costs, analysts said Moynihan’s job could be in jeopardy and either Montag or Darnell could be potential successors from the co-COO post.  “If this doesn’t work and he can’t make progress, the board has two natural replacements,” said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst with Guggenheim Securities LLC.

154,AIG,Insight: Extreme makeover BofA: An asbestos solution,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It worked for asbestos so why not for toxic mortgages?  When some look at all of the litigation arising from Bank of America’s big role in the U.S. mortgage mess, they start thinking of asbestos and how thousands of lawsuits arising from that cancer-causing product brought down many manufacturers more than a decade ago.  The solution back then to dealing with claims filed by more than 750,000 workers exposed to asbestos was the creation of dozens of “asbestos settlement trusts,” which have paid out tens of billions dollars in damages. Some of them are still going strong today.  The asbestos trusts were seen as an innovative approach to deal with seemingly endless litigation and provide a measure of compensation to sick workers and their families. The system for dealing with claims also allowed some of the hobbled manufacturers to emerge from bankruptcy largely free of the crushing weight of lawsuits.  Now some investors in soured mortgage-backed bonds sold by Bank of America and advocates for struggling homeowners are wondering whether a similar strategy can be used to deal with litigation claims that Wall Street analysts estimate could cost the nation’s biggest bank more than $50 billion.  “We’ve suggested an asbestos-style settlement as a solution. It makes the most sense,” says Vincent Fiorillo, a portfolio manager with DoubleLine Capital, a $15 billion bond shop that has its own pending claims against the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender. “It is better than where we are right now.”  The idea of using the asbestos litigation wars as a model for dealing with the fallout from the financial crisis is more talk than anything else. There’s no indication an asbestos-style litigation trust is something Bank of America is actively considering at the moment.  But efforts to find a creative solution to Bank of America’s multi-pronged exposure to Countrywide’s ailing mortgage portfolio become more urgent with each downward tick in the bank’s already depressed share price.  On Wall Street, once extreme ideas - such as spinning off the bank’s Merrill Lynch investment arm to raise additional capital or placing all of its rotting mortgages into a so-called bad bank managed by federal regulators - are being bandied about quite freely. Calls to break up Bank of America are no longer just idle chatter of hedge fund traders selling short its shares.  Just this week, Chris Whalen, a bank analyst and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics, was out calling for a Chapter 11 restructuring of Bank of America.  “You need to do something radical, which changes the framework so people can start thinking with their brains again,” says William Black, an associate professor of law and economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law and former litigation director of the old Federal Home Loan Bank Board during the run-up to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.  So far, Bank of America’s management has shied away from drastic measures and instead has begun taking a variety of incremental steps to assure Wall Street it has adequate capital to deal with the onslaught of mortgage-related lawsuits from bond investors, the American International Group, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and others. In August, the bank got a badly needed $5 billion cash infusion from Warren Buffett that helped stop the stock’s 49 percent slide this year. It quickly followed-up that deal by selling half of its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion.  Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan is also mulling a plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs over the next several years. On Tuesday, he began a management shuffle by ousting two top executives, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price. Analysts expect even more structural changes in the coming weeks, as Moynihan seeks to give a jolt to the bank’s beaten down stock, currently trading around $7.  The bank has set aside more than $15 billion in litigation reserves and contends it is well-positioned to defend itself against the wave of mortgage-related lawsuits. It is bracing itself for a war of attrition with mortgage bond investors, who claim the bank and its Countrywide subsidiary sometimes knowingly stuffed those securities with shoddy home loans. A bank spokesman declined to comment on whether it would consider an asbestos-style trust to deal with mortgage-related claims.  A Federal Reserve spokesman also declined to comment.  This is not the first time that some have talked about a litigation trust as a mechanism to deal with some of Wall Street’s liability arising from the collapse of the U.S. housing market. In the early days of the financial crisis, regulators discussed the merits of using an asbestos-style trust to resolve potential litigation claims against the biggest U.S. banks. But regulators ultimately rejected the trust concept along with other novel ideas that were deemed either unworkable or politically untenable.  One appeal to a trust solution, according to proponents, is that it would be a way for a bank to essentially hive off its litigation liability and establish a mechanism for dealing with claims and litigation. The advocates suggest it would be a way for Bank of America to get a “fresh start” without involving a bankruptcy or a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-imposed receivership.  But an asbestos trust is no magic bullet either. The insurance industry continues to be plagued with new asbestos-related claims years after the trusts were created. Credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service recently said after asbestos being a “back burner” issues for years, the U.S. insurance industry is recently seeing an uptick in new asbestos claims.  And the problem with any trust is that it must be adequately capitalized. The amount of money the bank would have to commit would no doubt be contentious and costly to shareholders and potentially bondholders as well.  The easiest way to fund a litigation trust would be for Bank of America to issue new shares, something that would severely reduce the value of its existing stock. That’s not the kind of plan that will sit well with stockholders, whose shares are already trading well below the bank’s stated book value of $20 a share.  “You’d have to go to the market and raise capital for this and that would dilute shares,” says Australian hedge fund manager John Hempton, whose Bronte Capital owns a sizable stake in the bank. “That is the last thing BofA wants to do right now.”  Frank Partnoy, a former Wall Street derivatives trader and now a law professor at the University of San Diego, said a litigation trust also could be partially funded by the issuance of a specialized security called a litigation tracking warrant. He said these warrants could be sold to public investors and offered to current Bank of America shareholders allowing them to share in any of the trust’s proceeds that remain after all the litigation has been resolved.  “There are precedents for having publicly traded securities to track how litigation will turn out,” said Partnoy.  He explained that a number of banks issued litigation tracking securities in the wake of the savings and loans crisis, when they tried to sue the federal government for wiping out billions of dollars in goodwill on those institutions’ balance sheets. The tracking stocks were a way for the institutions to raise cash to finance the litigation.  But if some momentum was building for a radical solution, Buffett’s $5 billion investment changed that. Now even some early advocates of an asbestos-style litigation trust are having second thoughts.  “The dynamics have changed dramatically since Buffett entered the picture,” says Sean Egan, a principal of Egan-Jones Ratings Company, an independent rating shop which has eased up on its once bearish view of Bank of America. “It’s a kiss of approval,” he added, even though the bank is paying a rich 6 percent dividend on the preferred stock it sold to Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.  Egan says an asbestos-style trust seemed like a plausible solution during the summer when Bank of America seemed to have few friends in the equity markets. But now, Egan says, to set up a litigation trust would “create a total mess” and “be patently unfair to existing shareholders.”  Just a few months ago, Egan discussed the merits of such a trust with several mortgage-backed securities investors now sparring with Bank of America. Those investors claim the bank is obligated to buy back the underlying home loans in those now soured bonds because the mortgages were issued to homebuyers who either obviously lacked the income to keep making monthly payments, or were duped into taking out greater loans than they could afford.  But Egan says now that the share price hemorrhaging has stopped, Bank of America can focus on taking steps to earn its way out of the litigation crisis.  Much of the search for a radical solution stems from an ongoing debate on Wall Street about whether the bank can earn enough money over time to pay out claims and add money to its legal reserves if necessary.  Most of the bulls who believe Bank of America can earn its way out of its legal quagmire freely admit that the bank’s stock is not likely to do much the next several years. Says Hempton of Bronte Capital: “I own a zombie bank.”  Under a relatively conservative long-term banking industry growth rate of 3.3 percent, Bank of America could earn about $50 billion in pre-tax profits from 2012 through 2016. That’s about equal to the amount most analysts peg the bank’s long-term mortgage legal liability at, if it fares poorly in litigation.  Banking analyst Charles Peabody, a partner with Portales Partners, says the strategy at Bank of America is to shed assets and reduce expenses, and he thinks it can work. “I understand the game plan, and if time is given, they can get through this without raising equity.”  The more bearish investors, by contrast, point out that another recession could throw a big monkey wrench into those profit projections. And predicting legal liability is notoriously difficult. In fact, analysts like Whalen say Bank of America could find itself having to pay as much as $100 billion in damages to mortgage bond investors and homeowners.  Skeptics also point out that in the coming years, Bank of America will need to boost capital by $50 billion in order to comply with new international banking regulations designed to make sure banks are not taking on too much risk.  And next year, Bank of America will need to refinance at least $40 billion in corporate debt that is coming due. In a worst case scenario, the bank has more than $400 billion in liquid assets to pay off any maturing debt.  It’s a lot of capital raising and skeptics worry that could hamper Bank of America’s ability to generate new commercial and residential loans for the next several years. That’s one reason people like Black, who want to break Bank of America apart, say something needs to be done to change the narrative because it’s not healthy for one of the nation’s biggest banks to exist in stasis for years to come.  “If you leave your major banks slowly twisting in the wind in this pathetic zombie condition, they are not going to be effective institutions,” says Black.  In the case of Countrywide, Black says the damage was done to Bank of America the moment that Kenneth Lewis, the bank’s former chief executive officer, pulled the trigger on the deal in early 2008. The Countrywide acquisition was a “pure ego play” for Lewis, who stepped down in December 2009 and was replaced by Moynihan.  In retrospect, if Countrywide had not been acquired and was ultimately taken over by the federal government, it would have been easier for all sides to begin working out deals with financially-strapped borrowers to reduce the principal owed on mortgages and home equity loans. Black says it’s still not too late to do meaningful home loan modifications, but that’s only going to happen in the context of a “bad bank” overseen by an FDIC receiver.  The latest report by the Treasury Department gave low marks to Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co in working to strike deals with struggling homeowners. In a September 1 statement, the Treasury Department said both Bank of America and JPMorgan “remain in need of substantial improvement” when it comes to servicing mortgages and agreeing to permanent loan modifications.  Homeowner advocates say in any kind of overarching settlement - whether it be an asbestos-style trust, a bad bank, or the sale of litigation warrants - borrowers should have a voice as well. A group of them represented by Mississippi attorney Don Barrett has filed an objection to a proposed $8.5 billion settlement that Bank of America reached this summer with some of the nation’s biggest bond investors, including BlackRock, Pacific Investment Management Co. and TCW.  Barrett says homeowners object to the settlement because the terms of the deal would make it even harder to negotiate a loan modification in the future. He cites a recent report prepared by National Consumer Law Center, which concludes that the settlement agreement “will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market.”  The Center, which prepared the report at Barrett’s request, says that in negotiating the deal with big mortgage-backed bond investors, little concern was paid to the interest of the homeowners, who took out the loans that were later bundled into bonds.  “There has got to be a solution where the borrowers’ interests are taken into account. We are the third leg of the stool,” says Barrett. “The current way of doing things is broken. And if it isn’t fixed, it is going to take Bank of America down.” (Additional reporting by Sam Forgione, Ben Berkowitz and Michael Tarsala; editing by Michael Williams and Claudia Parsons)",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-solutions/insight-extreme-makeover-bofa-an-asbestos-solution-idUSTRE78854U20110909

156,AIG,Fidelity replaces Lange at Magellan Fund,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments replaced Harry Lange on Tuesday as portfolio manager of its famed Magellan Fund after years of underperformance at the one-time flagship.  Lange, 59, becomes the latest in a long line of Fidelity managers who failed to repeat the success of Peter Lynch, the star stock picker who became a household name before retiring in 1990.  The fund was once run by Edward “Ned” Johnson, now chairman of the family-controlled company. Going forward, Fidelity named Jeff Feingold, 40, turning to another insider who has proven himself on smaller funds, but now faces a daunting task with the larger vehicle — a description that once fit Lange as well.  Boston-based Fidelity’s stock funds have struggled to evolve beyond the star manager strategy that worked well in the 1980s and 1990s. Last year, equity investors withdrew over $25 billion as its funds posted middle-of-the-pack three and five-year performance.  Lange stumbled repeatedly at Magellan, betting on victims of the 2008 financial crisis such as American International Group Inc and Wachovia, and favoring mobile phone maker Nokia.  Over the past five years, the fund has lost an average of 2.2 percent annually, trailing 96 percent of peer funds. Lange has been contrite in his notes to investors, acknowledging weak picks in technology and consumer stocks. But analysts have increasingly questioned why he was left in place.  The fund, once the largest in the nation with assets of over $100 billion during the 1990s, fell from $52 billion when Lange took over to $17 billion today. Lange’s disastrous financial picks led to an almost 50 percent loss in 2008, prompting widespread customer defections.  To be sure, some of Fidelity’s other stocks funds have posted far better performances.  Under manager Will Danoff, the $73.7 billion Contrafund has beaten 98 percent of peer funds over the past 10 years and continues to do well lately, data from Morningstar show. The $32.3 billion Low-Priced Stock fund beat 95 percent of peers over the past 10 years under Joel Tillinghast, who is due to return from a leave in January.  Fidelity also remains a titan in the fund industry thanks in part to its brokerage and retirement businesses. Both units steer a steady stream of assets into Fidelity accounts. The firm oversaw $1.6 trillion of managed assets and administered another $2 trillion as of the end of June.  Fidelity said Feingold will continue to manage several other Fidelity funds including the $1 billion Trend Fund, as well as Magellan.  Lange will remain with Fidelity in a position to be determined, Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said. The company did not make available for comment Lange, Feingold or Ronald O’Hanley, who heads Fidelity’s asset-management operations.  In a statement, Fidelity Equity Group President Brian Hogan said Lange, “has put in a great deal of time and effort to take on the difficult task of managing Magellan through a very challenging period.”  Feingold “has a broad diversity of experience and his investment style is an excellent fit with Magellan’s capital appreciation investment objective and flexible investment strategy,” Hogan said.  Feingold joined Fidelity as an analyst in 1997 and posted a strong track record at the Trend Fund, which he has run since 2007. The fund gained an average of 5 percent annually over the past three years, outperforming 90 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar.  By appointing Feingold, who graduated from Brown University in 1992 and received an MBA from Harvard University in 1997, Fidelity runs the risk of repeating past failures, analysts said.  “Many of his winners have been small and mid-sized companies,” said Morningstar analyst Christopher Davis. “I’m not sure he’ll be able to invest in the same kind of companies, managing a much larger fund.”  Lange also had a strong record running a much smaller fund before taking over Magellan, Davis noted.  John Bonnanzio, who edits a newsletter for Fidelity investors, said the firm may have kept Lange in the job in the hope he would eventually stage a turnaround, but that seemed increasingly unlikely.  “I think there was an interest in letting him see if the portfolio bets he made would eventually work out, but there was no recovering from 2008,” Bonnanzio added.",9132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fidelity-magellan/fidelity-replaces-lange-at-magellan-fund-idUSTRE78C68Q20110913

158,AIG,SEC says no probes hurt by destroyed records,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A past practice of destroying certain pre-investigative materials has not harmed any current or future investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. agency’s enforcement chief said on Wednesday.  The comments from SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami, which were made in a letter to Senator Charles Grassley, mark the strongest defense by the SEC yet after an internal whistle-blower accused the agency of wrongfully destroying important investigative files, including “matters under inquiry,” or MUIs.  “We do not believe that current or future investigations have been harmed by the division’s old MUI retention policy,” said Khuzami, adding that data the agency did save electronically still lets the SEC “connect the dots” between current and closed matters.  Khuzami’s letter to Grassley is the latest twist in an ongoing saga that first began in July 2010 after Darcy Flynn, an agency lawyer, complained that important early-stage investigative records were being improperly discarded.  Flynn took his concerns to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which last month issued a statement declaring that the SEC had indeed destroyed the records without the proper authority. NARA noted, however, that the SEC had stopped destroying the records and was working with NARA on a new records retention policy.  Khuzami’s letter is a response to Grassley, who last month demanded answers from the SEC after learning of Flynn’s allegations about the MUI document destruction. Grassley had said that Flynn told him the records of major high-profile cases including Bernard Madoff, Goldman Sachs, trading in AIG credit-default swaps, alleged frauds at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and insider-trading probes at Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers and the hedge fund SAC Capital.  More recently, a letter to the SEC from Flynn’s attorney, Gary Aguirre, also raised concerns documents from more formal investigations have also been discarded. The SEC has since ceased destroying all investigative records until further notice.  In Khuzami’s letter to Grassley, he downplayed the importance of some of the kinds of documents that may have been discarded.  An MUI is based on “readily available information” including public data, and the threshold for opening one “is low,” he said.  He added the SEC retained “significant information” concerning all MUIs through an electronic records system that dates back 20 years.  Moreover, the records from MUIs that become more formal investigations were retained. Only records from closed matters under inquiry were not stored as official files and in some cases discarded, he said.  Senator Grassley, in a statement late on Wednesday, sounded skeptical about Khuzami’s claims in the letter.  “Since the documents are gone, we’ll never know how important they might have been. How do you know whether you might have been helped by something you no longer have?” he asked. “Federal records are federal records and have to be preserved, regardless of whether they’re part of an ‘investigation’ or an ‘inquiry.’”  ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-documents/sec-says-no-probes-hurt-by-destroyed-records-idUSTRE78D78L20110914

160,AIG,Big Republican donors wait on Perry-Romney duel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Republican donors are still undecided on Rick Perry or Mitt Romney as their party’s best chance to defeat President Barack Obama in the November 2012 presidential election.  Only about a third of the Republican campaign cash raised four years ago has been committed so far for the upcoming election — a sluggish pace that is unlikely to pick up before next year.  “I haven’t seen any sort of huge swell of traditional Bush supporters going anywhere yet,” said Jan Baran, former general counsel to the Republican National Committee who advised President George H.W. Bush.  The big money remains on the sidelines for a few reasons. There are eight established candidates in the race but the competition between the front-runners — Texas Governor Perry and former Massachusetts Governor Romney — is just too close to call.  While there is no question that the donations will eventually start flowing, party insiders have not finished debating whether Perry or Romney is more electable when facing Obama.  Both Perry and Romney are aggressively courting big donors, who will be vital to mounting a national campaign next year and going up against a president who broke fundraising records in 2008.  Despite a faltering economy and slumping popularity, Obama is off to a strong fundraising start. His campaign has raised $47 million, which dwarfs all Republican contenders.  Romney, who has dropped behind Perry in national polls, took in $18 million during the second quarter of the year.  Perry, who entered the race last month, has yet to report fundraising figures. But finance experts expect he will be a formidable rival to Romney after having raised $39 million in his last race for governor in 2010.  One media report said Perry’s campaign aimed to raise at least $10 million out of the gate. That comes as Romney’s collections are expected to dip to below $10 million in the third quarter, according to a source close to his campaign. The third quarter is a traditionally weak fundraising period.  Still, Perry has ground to make up. Romney’s campaign is much more established after a presidential run in 2008 and, as co-founder of buyout firm Bain Capital, he has ties to deep pockets on Wall Street.  “Perry is largely unknown, certainly here in New York,” said Joe Schmuckler, an investment manager at Medley Capital who was Republican nominee John McCain’s treasurer in 2008 and is now backing Romney. “Perry is working hard to put together a network but Romney is way ahead” in the New York area.  Perry hits New York City this month for his first major Wall Street events. He will be hosted by Hank Greenberg, the former long-time chief executive of AIG, the insurance firm that imploded during the 2008 financial crisis.  Perry could benefit from ties to Rudy Giuliani, who Perry endorsed when the former New York mayor ran in the 2008 Republican race. Giuliani has not made an endorsement yet.  Both candidates trek to Washington later this month, where they will woo established Republican donors.  Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors who was finance chair for Giuliani’s 2008 White House run, is hosting Perry.  “Several have come on board already and I expect the list to grow rapidly between now and Governor Perry’s first Washington event on September 27th,” Van Dongen said.  Romney’s Washington backers include American Bankers Association President Frank Keating, a former governor of Oklahoma, but he has been having fundraisers for months.  Several major Republican donors have not revealed their preferences yet.  Ken Griffin, chief executive of hedge fund giant Citadel is on the sidelines and early Home Depot Inc investor Ken Langone is also uncommitted.  Donors now have more options after the Supreme Court’s ruling involving the conservative activist group Citizens United and other legal decisions. The Citizens United decision lets corporations and individuals make unlimited donations to presidential candidates as long as they go through committees not technically associated with the official campaign.  American Crossroads, the big-spending group conceived by Republican strategist Karl Rove, is seen as the perfect depository for the Republican investor who has not made up his mind about a candidate.  “There is no better political investment than putting money in Karl’s hands,” said a former big fundraiser to President George W. Bush.  Fred Malek, a veteran Republican fundraiser who founded the spending group American Action Network, said donors to some extent have the luxury to wait for a sure thing.  “In the McCain campaign, for example, during the primary we had very difficult time raising money and all of a sudden we became the leader and money flooded in,” Malek said.

Despite a faltering economy and slumping popularity, Obama is off to a strong fundraising start. His campaign has raised $47 million, which dwarfs all Republican contenders.   Romney, who has dropped behind Perry in national polls, took in $18 million during the second quarter of the year.   Perry, who entered the race last month, has yet to report fundraising figures. But finance experts expect he will be a formidable rival to Romney after having raised $39 million in his last race for governor in 2010.   One media report said Perry’s campaign aimed to raise at least $10 million out of the gate. That comes as Romney’s collections are expected to dip to below $10 million in the third quarter, according to a source close to his campaign. The third quarter is a traditionally weak fundraising period.   Still, Perry has ground to make up. Romney’s campaign is much more established after a presidential run in 2008 and, as co-founder of buyout firm Bain Capital, he has ties to deep pockets on Wall Street.   “Perry is largely unknown, certainly here in New York,” said Joe Schmuckler, an investment manager at Medley Capital who was Republican nominee John McCain’s treasurer in 2008 and is now backing Romney. “Perry is working hard to put together a network but Romney is way ahead” in the New York area.   Perry hits New York City this month for his first major Wall Street events. He will be hosted by Hank Greenberg, the former long-time chief executive of AIG (AIG.N), the insurance firm that imploded during the 2008 financial crisis.   Perry could benefit from ties to Rudy Giuliani, who Perry endorsed when the former New York mayor ran in the 2008 Republican race. Giuliani has not made an endorsement yet.   Both candidates trek to Washington later this month, where they will woo established Republican donors.   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors who was finance chair for Giuliani’s 2008 White House run, is hosting Perry.   “Several have come on board already and I expect the list to grow rapidly between now and Governor Perry’s first Washington event on Sept. 27th,” Van Dongen said.   Romney’s Washington backers include American Bankers Association President Frank Keating, a former governor of Oklahoma, but he has been having fundraisers for months.   Several major Republican donors have not revealed their preferences yet.   Ken Griffin, chief executive of hedge fund giant Citadel is on the sidelines and early Home Depot Inc (HD.N) investor Ken Langone is also uncommitted.   Donors now have more options after the Supreme Court’s ruling involving the conservative activist group Citizens United and other legal decisions. The Citizens United decision lets corporations and individuals make unlimited donations to presidential candidates as long as they go through committees not technically associated with the official campaign.   American Crossroads, the big-spending group conceived by Republican strategist Karl Rove, is seen as the perfect depository for the Republican investor who has not made up his mind about a candidate.   “There is no better political investment than putting money in Karl’s hands,” said a former big fundraiser to President George W. Bush.   Fred Malek, a veteran Republican fundraiser who founded the spending group American Action Network, said donors to some extent have the luxury to wait for a sure thing.   “In the McCain campaign, for example, during the primary we had very difficult time raising money and all of a sudden we became the leader and money flooded in,” Malek said.

162,AIG,Morgan Stanley Chairman Mack to retire at year-end,"(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack, whose sharp elbows and aggressive cost-cutting tactics earned him the nickname “Mack The Knife,” will step down at the end of the year, fully handing the reins to Chief Executive James Gorman.  The move solidifies Gorman’s position at the top of the second-largest U.S. investment bank, whose business model he has been overhauling since becoming CEO and taking over day-to-day operations from Mack at the start of 2010.  “Giving the CEO both positions is a vote of confidence,” said Douglas Park, principal of DYP Advisors, a corporate governance advisory firm in Palo Alto, California.  “The board is saying it has confidence in Mr. Gorman’s leadership and the direction that he’s taking the firm.”  Morgan Stanley shares surged on the news, closing 7.2 percent higher at $16.59.  Gorman, 53, has been scaling back much of Morgan Stanley’s risk-taking in trading and relying more heavily on wealth management to generate stable income.  Schooled as a lawyer and trained as a McKinsey & Co financial services consultant, Gorman joined Merrill Lynch & Co in 1999 as chief marketing officer. Within a few years, he moved into the retail brokerage business, which was a central pillar of Merrill’s power on Wall Street.  As head of that business, Gorman, a native of Australia, clashed with Merrill’s “thundering herd” of brokers. He cut costs by laying off thousands of employees and focused on clients with at least $1 million in assets.  In what was then a controversial move, he pushed less-wealthy clients to call centers where they received less-personalized treatment.  Gorman is now overseeing the integration of Citigroup Inc’s Smith Barney unit into Morgan Stanley’s existing brokerage business in a multi-phase acquisition through 2014. He hopes to eventually achieve a return on equity level of 20 percent in that business, double its current level.  Shareholders have been frustrated by the slow progress at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, and Morgan Stanley’s stock has been trading below tangible book value since April, a sign that investors see limited profits and possibly big writedowns for the company.  Sanford Bernstein banking analyst Brad Hintz, who has an “outperform” rating on Morgan Stanley shares, believes that Gorman will boost profitability at Morgan Stanley’s wealth management business. He said Gorman, who recently bought $2 million worth of his company’s stock, has his incentives aligned with shareholders.  “Admittedly Morgan Stanley has been a value trap for investors,” Hintz said. “But for this stock to rebound all we have to believe is that management will work to boost their own net worth and the Merrill model of wealth management can be brought to MSSB.”  Hintz is a former Morgan Stanley treasurer.  Mack, 66, first joined Morgan Stanley in 1972 as a bond salesman and worked his way up through the ranks to become president and chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in 1997.  He left in 2001 after losing to Philip Purcell in a battle for the CEO spot. Over the next few years, Morgan Stanley’s performance lagged that of its Wall Street peers and investors and former executives criticized Purcell’s strategy and management style. A series of high profile executives left, including Citigroup Inc’s current CEO Vikram Pandit, Citi President John Havens and M&A banker Joseph Perella, who launched his own advisory firm, Perella Weinberg Partners.  In 2005, Purcell resigned under board pressure and Mack became CEO.  When Mack returned to the bank, he received a standing ovation on the trading floor. He worked to strengthen Morgan Stanley’s trading department, but also piled on risk, a move that generated a big profit in 2006, but hurt Morgan Stanley leading into the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009.  “Working with the remarkable people of Morgan Stanley has enriched my life for more than three decades and helping to lead this great firm, most recently as chairman, was the greatest honor of my career,” Mack said in a statement.  “However, I made clear back in 2009 that I would serve in the Chairman role for two years and then move on. Now that time has come.”  Mack is retiring from a full-time role, but will remain a senior adviser to Morgan Stanley. Gorman will add the title of chairman on January 1.  Many corporate governance experts argue that splitting the roles of chairman and CEO is beneficial to shareholders, because a CEO who is also chairman can have undue influence over the board, with inadequate checks and balances.  Some large financial firms, including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and American International Group Inc, have split the roles in the wake of the financial crisis, but others have not.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co combine the roles, as does Wells Fargo & Co, which transitioned out former Chairman and CEO Richard Kovacevich in a similar fashion to Morgan Stanley’s Mack.  Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, advocates splitting the role. He said studies by firms such as Bain & Co have shown that stock performance is better under the fragmented structure.  “It’s considered a best practice,” Elson said.

166,AIG,"Allied World, Transatlantic call off deal","(Reuters) - Reinsurers Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd and Transatlantic Holdings Inc called off their merger on Friday in the face of overwhelming opposition, and Transatlantic indicated it might remain independent despite two higher offers on the table.  Five days after telling shareholders to accept Allied World’s all-stock offer of about $47 per share, Transatlantic said it would be a disservice to them to accept a $52-a-share cash offer from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.  A person familiar with the situation said the difference between the two was a potential upside with the Allied deal — shareholders had the chance to benefit from future gains. However, Berkshire would buy them out at a discount and left no potential for returns down the road.  Transatlantic was controlled by insurer AIG until 2009, when AIG reduced its stake in an effort to raise capital following a U.S. government bailout.  The New York-based company has been attractive to competitors because of its depressed valuation. It also offers reinsurers, with heavy exposure to short-term risks like natural disasters, more exposure to longer-term lines of business like medical malpractice and workers’ compensation.  BREAK-UP FEES  The failure of the Allied deal had been expected for days, after three proxy advisory firms said Transatlantic shareholders should reject the offer. Earlier this week, an Allied executive told a Barclays Capital conference the deal was unlikely to succeed.  Allied World said in a statement it would receive a $35 million break-up fee and $13.3 million in expenses from Transatlantic. Transatlantic would owe Allied another $66.7 million if it entered into another deal within a year.  Allied World’s all-stock offer was worth $2.94 billion, or $47.05 a share, at Thursday’s closing prices and represented a roughly 5 percent discount to Transatlantic’s share price. Shareholders were due to vote on the agreement on Tuesday.  Transatlantic sent a letter to stockholders Friday, noting “it will continue to entertain and evaluate any serious proposal or opportunity that offers its stockholders full and fair value.”  But it said the Berkshire offer “would not deliver fair value to stockholders,” and that Berkshire had been unwilling as recently as last Friday to discuss raising its bid.  Transatlantic has also rejected a cash-and-stock offer from Validus Holdings, which took its bid directly to shareholders in late July. Since then, the companies have sued each other and Validus has filed to remove and replace Transatlantic’s board.  In response to the end of the Allied deal, Validus said it welcomed “the opportunity to enter into discussions (with Transatlantic) without any restrictive preconditions.”  On the New York Stock Exchange, Transatlantic fell 3 percent, Allied rose 3.3 percent and Validus fell 2.6 percent early Friday afternoon.  At Thursday’s closing prices, the Validus deal is worth $48.26 a share, or $3.02 billion. The Berkshire offer is worth $3.25 billion.  But both put Transatlantic at a substantial discount to book value — 0.71 times from Validus and 0.77 times from Berkshire. The property and casualty insurance and reinsurance sector has a median value of 0.84 times book, according to Thomson Reuters data.  In the interim, Transatlantic said it will increase its stock buyback program to $600 million, with a commitment to buy back half of that this year.  Davis Selected Advisors, Transatlantic’s largest shareholder, endorsed both moves.  “Davis Advisors applauds Transatlantic’s efforts to create value for shareholders with an intelligent capital management plan while at the same time remaining open to other strategic alternatives,” it said in the company’s statement.  Transatlantic also said Chief Executive Robert Orlich would retire as planned and that chief operating officer Michael Sapnar would become CEO as of January 1, 2012.  Transatlantic also released preliminary results for the third quarter on Friday, saying it expected to report earnings per share of 85 cents to $1.15 for the quarter.

171,AIG,French bank retreat raises aircraft finance fears,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - The global aviation industry faces growing uncertainty over financing due to Europe’s debt crisis and worries surrounding French banks, lenders and airlines were warned on Tuesday.  Despite record numbers of aircraft leaving the production lines at Airbus EAD.PA and Boeing (BA.N) to fuel ever-growing demand from rising economies, doubts are spreading as to how the growth will be financed.  French banks play a key role in the global aircraft financing market and represented about 31 percent of transactions in 2010 followed by Germany, Ryanair finance director Howard Millar said.  “The French banks have scaled back significantly. There will be less finance available and any finance will be more expensive,” he told an ISTAT aircraft financing conference.  French banks Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and BNP (BNPP.PA) announced plans to scale back lending in the aircraft market last week as French banks moved to sell assets and reduce lending.  “In the past few months things have got worse. French banks are effectively closed for new clients,” Millar said. “We are in an ivory tower — we are heading for a little bit of a car crash in terms of financing.”  French banks are fighting to restore confidence after suffering a sharp summer sell-off, driven by fears they are too dependent on wholesale market funding and would be ill equipped to cope with the fallout from a Greek debt default.  Some banks are finding it hard to obtain dollar funding for periods of longer than a few days as U.S. money market funds and other traditional dollar lenders become increasingly nervous about the threat of a Greek debt default, which could destabilize markets throughout the region.  European bank stocks have lost a third of their value since July.  Aircraft are sold in dollars and their second-hand value is tied to the U.S. currency, so participants rely on dollars to grease the wheels of one of the world’s most capital-intensive export industries.  Banks are also grappling with wider problems which have a knock-on effect on the availability of financing for aircraft , Ron Wainshal, Chief Executive Officer of U.S. lessor Aircastle, said.  “I think it will get worse before it gets better. There is a short-term challenge, particularly in Europe,” he said.  Banks are also squeezed by tougher capital adequacy regulations under the Basel III accord.  Boeing, Airbus and smaller manufacturers deliver a total of up to $80 billion in new aircraft a year.  Production is rising to meet demand from emerging markets and most recently a wave of orders to renew aging and inefficient fleets in the United States.  Airlines order aircraft years ahead and pay upfront deposits but nearly all the value is paid on delivery. A great deal of that is financed shortly before the handover.  French bankers have been squeezed by a shortage of dollar deposits from U.S. investors due to fears concerning their exposure to Greece, but they sought to allay concerns about liquidity.  “We’ll be here. We’ll do our share the best we can,” said Christian McCormick, Chief Executive Officer, Natixis Transport Finance, adding German banks were not hampered by the same dollar funding concerns.  Of the $73 billion of aircraft to be delivered next year, about $41 billion need to be financed by banks in dollars, he said.  In the 2008 credit crunch, U.S. and European credit agencies stepped into the breach as funding dried up by providing guarantees to assist aircraft exports at lean financing rates.  But the export/import agencies have significantly hiked their fees and their room for maneuver may be constrained as the debt crisis spreads to sovereign assets and ratings, bankers said.  The shortage of bank financing has created uncertainty over 2012 deliveries but so far there is no serious evidence of a funding gap, several lessors and bankers said.  “It is more difficult from a pricing and availability standpoint. Banks are willing to do business but are reluctant to lock in for the long term,” said Madhu Vijay, senior vice president of U.S. lessor Aviation Capital Group (ACG), part of mutual insurer Pacific Life.  There are fewer doubts over the financing for new aircraft deliveries than over the market for second-hand aircraft, he said. Second-hand values are important to the industry because they influence the appetite of lessors to buy aircraft. Lessors control about a quarter of the world fleet.  The market uncertainty comes at a time when U.S. insurer AIG (AIG.N) is preparing to float its ILFC leasing unit and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) seeks buyers for its RBS Aviation business, but is not expected to scupper the sales, sector bankers said.

In the 2008 credit crunch, U.S. and European credit agencies stepped into the breach as funding dried up by providing guarantees to assist aircraft exports at lean financing rates.	   But the export/import agencies have significantly hiked their fees and their room for manoeuvre may be constrained as the debt crisis spreads to sovereign assets and ratings, bankers said.	   The shortage of bank financing has created uncertainty over 2012 deliveries but so far there is no serious evidence of a funding gap, several lessors and bankers said.	   “It is more difficult from a pricing and availability standpoint. Banks are willing to do business but are reluctant to lock in for the long term,” said Madhu Vijay, senior vice president of U.S. lessor Aviation Capital Group (ACG), part of mutual insurer Pacific Life.	   There are fewer doubts over the financing for new aircraft deliveries than over the market for second-hand aircraft, he said. Second-hand values are important to the industry because they influence the appetite of lessors to buy aircraft. Lessors control about a quarter of the world fleet.	   The market uncertainty comes at a time when U.S. insurer AIG  is preparing to float its ILFC leasing unit and Royal Bank of Scotland seeks buyers for its RBS Aviation business, but is not expected to scupper the sales, sector bankers said.

174,AIG,UPDATE 1-AIG hires top IRS official for tax operations," * Potter had been acting chief counsel of IRS   * Assets keep AIG from having to pay tax   Sept 21 (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group (AIG.N), which holds tens of billions of dollars in valuable tax assets, on Wednesday named a former top Internal Revenue Service official to run its global tax planning.   AIG said Clarissa Potter, a former acting chief counsel at the IRS, would join the company as deputy tax director. She will be responsible for “AIGs global tax planning, including continued protection of AIGs valuable tax assets,” the company said in a statement.   AIG’s tax assets are a legacy of its huge losses during the financial crisis, which led to a $182 billion government bailout. Because of the assets, AIG does not expect to pay income taxes for years to come.   In the second quarter those tax assets were responsible for a significant chunk of the company’s net profits. AIG’s largest non-government shareholder, Fairholme Funds’s Bruce Berkowitz, has also highlighted the tax assets as one of the most valuable parts of the company.

175,AIG,BofA sued by shareholder over $10 billion AIG loss,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shareholder sued the bank on Friday for what he said was a failure to disclose it potentially owes more than $10 billion to American International Group Inc (AIG.N) in connection with mortgage-backed securities.  The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks class action status on behalf of purchasers of Bank of America stock between February 25 and August 5 this year.  AIG, which was bailed out by the government in the 2008 financial crisis, suffered losses of more than $10 billion from the securities, known as RMBS, between 2005 and 2007. The losses occurred after Bank of America and two companies it bought — Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch — and subsidiaries sold AIG more than $28 billion in RMBS.  “Throughout the class period, defendants repeatedly informed investors about the claims of other entities for RMBS losses but not about the massive losses suffered by AIG,” the lawsuit said.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, said he had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment.  The court document said the shareholder losses occurred on August 8 as Bank of America’s stock dropped more than 20 percent to $6.51 per share from $8.17 per share after AIG sued the bank in New York state court seeking to recover the RMBS losses.  “This decrease was a result of the artificial inflation caused by the defendants’ misleading statements coming out of the price,” Friday’s lawsuit said.  In a footnote, the court document adds that the plaintiff, shareholder David Lawrence, “asserts only that BofA should have disclosed AIG’s losses and potential claims to investors and takes no position on whether those claims will ultimately be found to have merit.”  Lawrence asks the court to declare the lawsuit a class action under anti-fraud provisions of federal securities law and seeks unspecified damages for all members of the class.

177,AIG,Goldman wins dismissal of NY lawsuit over bonuses,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s (GS.N) board of directors has won the dismissal of a lawsuit seeking to recover billions of dollars of bonus payouts and other compensation awarded for 2009.  The January 2010 lawsuit said Goldman’s policy of targeting a payout of close to 50 percent of net revenue as compensation reflected a “complete breakdown” of oversight that showed “scant regard” for shareholder interests.  According to its annual report for that year, Goldman ultimately paid out $16.19 billion in compensation and benefits for 2009, or 35.8 percent of its net revenue of $45.17 billion, its lowest percentage payout as a public company.  In his ruling, Justice Bernard Fried dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, saying the allegations “do not provide any basis for the conclusion that the board acted for any purpose other than the advancement of the company’s interests.”  The lawsuit combined cases brought by Illinois’ Central Laborers Pension Fund and an individual plaintiff, Ken Brown.  Deborah Elman, a lawyer for the fund, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Lynda Grant, a lawyer for Brown, said, “We’re disappointed with the decision and don’t agree with it.” Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment.

179,AIG,Transatlantic in talks with new bidder,"(Reuters) - Transatlantic Holdings Inc TRH.N said on Monday it entered into deal talks with an undisclosed bidder, adding a fresh twist in a months-long takeover saga and sending the reinsurer’s shares up sharply.  For nearly four months, Transatlantic has been the subject of a bidding war, as the former arm of American International Group Inc (AIG.N) balanced an agreed deal and at least two unsolicited offers.  Just last Friday, Transatlantic agreed to open talks with Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) after reaching agreement on a confidentiality pact with the Bermuda reinsurer, which has been pursuing a hostile bid.  That followed two other offers falling through in the last two weeks. Transatlantic called off a merger with Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd AWH.N in the face of overwhelming opposition and, last week, it said it would not accept an unsolicited bid from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).  Transatlantic has proven to be an attractive target; it is one of the cheapest companies in the industry and has long-tail insurance lines, such as medical malpractice and workers’ compensation, which are attractive to others more exposed to short-tail risks such as hurricane damage.  Transatlantic is trading at 0.71 times book value, which allows rivals to bid less than book and still offer a premium. Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co, for example, bid 0.77 times book value for Transatlantic.  Transatlantic shares rose 4.2 percent to $48.59 in midday trading. Equity analysts at Standard & Poor’s said the stock remained undervalued and should trade closer to the sector than it does now.  Analyst Cathy Seifert maintained a $58 price target, which would be roughly 0.83 times book, right around the industry median.  Experts have been anticipating deals, especially in Bermuda, where a combination of excess capital and a soft pricing environment make consolidation attractive.  Deals, however, have been relatively rare, in part because the “social question” — who will lead the combined company — is often not resolved.  Transatlantic removes that hurdle. Chief Executive Robert Orlich said in June he would retire after striking the Allied World deal, worth $3.2 billion at the time.  There has also been some hesitancy among Bermudan players to buy or sell because valuations are depressed across the sector. Companies are loathe to use their own depressed stock to buy another depressed stock, with little sign of valuation improving anytime soon.  New York-based Transatlantic did not disclose the identity of the latest bidder and said there was no assurance the discussions will result in a deal.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Moelis & Co are acting as financial advisers for Transatlantic, while Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is acting as legal counsel.

181,AIG,IPO VIEW-Firms feel the chill as equity markets freeze," * Q3 equity fundraising down 48 pct at $99.5 bln vs Q3 2010	   * Goldman Sachs retains equity league table crown in Q3	   * Treasury sales of GM, AIG, Ally could be delayed -sources	   * Euro zone jitters spread, hit share sales in US, Asia	   By Kylie MacLellan and Clare Baldwin	   LONDON/NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A near shutdown in global equity capital markets is forcing issuers to wait, possibly delaying to next year much-anticipated offerings such as the U.S. government’s shares in bailed-out companies.	   With the debt crisis still raging in Europe and the U.S. economy struggling to recover, many issuers are preferring to wait — if they can — for markets to calm down, bankers said.	   “Right now, if you’ve got premier assets and you have the ability to wait, most will,” said Dan Cummings, global head of equity and equity-linked capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch .	   If the markets don’t improve, for example, the U.S. Treasury may not try to sell down its stakes this year in General Motors Co , American International Group Inc , and Ally Financial, several sources familiar with the situation said.	   A delay in selling off these shares, which were acquired through unpopular bailouts during the financial crisis, could create problems for the administration, especially as the U.S. election approaches next year.	   The sources cautioned that no final decisions had been made, and the U.S. Treasury declined comment.	   The tough markets are hurting scores of companies around the world. In fact, equity fundraising worldwide slumped to its slowest since early 2009 in the third quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. Year-to-date, IPOs worldwide are down 7 percent.	   A total of $99.5 billion was raised in global equity capital markets in the third quarter, 48 percent less than was raised in the same period last year, according to data through Sept. 28.	   Mergers and acquisitions activity was also down in the third quarter. 	   Goldman Sachs , which topped equity capital markets league tables at the end of the first half of the year, kept its crown in the third quarter.	   “We are seeing a market which is unnerved by macro uncertainty. It’s not just new issues which are being affected but also secondary market volumes and conviction-buying in general,” said Viswas Raghavan, head of international capital markets at JPMorgan in London.	   “Against this backdrop, investors believe there is nothing which is a must have,” Raghavan said.	   In Europe, which has not seen a big IPO since Spanish savings banks Bankia and Banca Civica raised a combined 3.7 billion euros ($5 billion) in July, several multibillion-euro deals slated for September and the fourth quarter have been pushed back to next year.	   Bankers said offerings by firms such as German chemicals maker Evonik and Siemens’s (SIEGn.DE) lighting unit Osram had been considered bellwether deals, and their decision to postpone made it less likely others would test the waters unless markets improved significantly.  	   Spain’s state lottery, which had been expected to be a rare success story thanks to its strong, defensive profits and high, monthly dividends, pulled its 7 billion euro IPO on Thursday due to tough markets and political opposition. 	   “Things won’t improve until we get some confidence. The market is waiting for governments to deal with the debt and economic crisis,” said Maria Pinelli, Global Strategic Growth Markets Leader at Ernst & Young.	   Asia is feeling the effects, too.	   Hong Kong, the world’s biggest IPO market for the last two years, saw some $4.5 billion worth of deals pulled just last week by companies including Sany Heavy Industry and rival XCMG Construction Machinery Co Ltd .	   Citic Securities , Sinohydro Group and Great Wall Motor , which moved ahead with offerings, have either priced weakly or struggled in the aftermarket.	   Still, bankers are hanging on to some hope.	   “Market windows can both open and close quite quickly,” said  Philip Drury, Citigroup Inc’s co-head of equity capital markets in the Americas. “It would be premature at this point to completely write off the next few months.”	   Jeff Bunzel, Credit Suisse’s Americas head of equity capital markets, said some technology or energy sector deals, or deals with yield such as MLPs or REITs, could come to the market this year.	   The two biggest tech IPOs currently in the U.S. pipeline are daily deals site Groupon and gamemaker Zynga.	   “There are clearly a number of issuers who have opted to just look at 2012,” Bunzel said. “But there are transactions we could see.”   (Reporting by Clare Baldwin in New York and Kylie MacLellan in London; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Will Waterman)   	",9302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-stocks-ipos/ipo-view-firms-feel-the-chill-as-equity-markets-freeze-idUSS1E78Q1DG20110930
182,AIG,Big insurers may not face same capital rules as banks," SEOUL, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Insurance companies judged too big to fail are likely to face different rules to their banking counterparts who were told this week that they will be subject capital surcharges, insurance industry standard setters said on Friday. 	   The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) said they still haven’t completed their study of which insurance companies are global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) and they can not decide whether they should face extra capital rules until that work is complete.   	   “We are discussing the possible measures, one of them could potentially be a capital surcharge, there are many others, and I would not exclude that the outcome is different from banking but we have not made a decision at this point in time,” said Peter Braumueller, chairman of the IAIS executive committee during a press briefing at their annual meeting in Seoul.	   The IAIS is helping to draw up new rules for the Financial Stability Board, aimed at preventing a repeat of the problems seen at insurer AIG , which required a rescue by the U.S. government during the 2008 financial crisis. 	   The rules for insurers are expected to be finalised in time for the G20 meeting in Mexico next year. 	   “A basic draft will come out by the first half of the year. The work on classification criteria of G SIFI is underway,” said Seong In-seok, director general of South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service who was also at the press briefing. 	   Earlier this week the Basel Committee of global regulators said it has finalised plans to force 28 of the world’s top banks to hold up to 2.5 percent in extra capital to bolster their ability to withstand any future global credit crunch. .

184,AIG,Timeline: Bidding race for reinsurer Transatlantic,"(Reuters) - Reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings TRH.N, once controlled by American International Group Inc (AIG.N), continues to look for suitors after calling off a deal late last month with Allied World Assurance Co Holdings AWH.N.  Transatlantic has said a rival offer from a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is too low, and opened talks with Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) and an undisclosed bidder.

Aug 11 - Validus sues Transatlantic, but offers to open its own books for review.  Aug 12 - Transatlantic opens talks with National Indemnity.  Aug 16 - National Indemnity’s offer for Transatlantic expires, but both sides still in talks - say sources.

Sept 13 - Barclays Capital cites an Allied World executive as saying the company doubts if its bid for Transatlantic will succeed, after a proxy advisory firm said Transatlantic investors should reject the deal.  Sept 14 - Validus files with regulators to ultimately replace Transatlantic’s board of directors.

186,AIG,"BUY OR SELL-For Allied World, is no deal a better deal?"," * Allied looks cheap after failed courtship for Transatlantic   * Likely to restart buyback program   * But rivals look better placed if prices firm    By Brenton Cordeiro	   Oct 5 (Reuters) - Allied World Assurance Co Holdings Ltd’s  withdrawal from a bidding race for Transatlantic Holdings may have cost it the chance to beef up its portfolio, but a nimbler Allied may be better able to navigate choppy markets.	   Zurich-based Allied’s stock has fallen about 7 percent since it first bid for Transatlantic in mid-June. Its shares currently trade at a 33 percent discount to their book value.	   Most insurers are battling pricing pressures and sluggish growth in new business, and some analysts reckon Allied’s rivals may be a better investment. 	   Allied World has among the highest return-on-equity and book-value growth among its peers, noted Dean Evans, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “That’s something being overlooked by the market in terms of the valuation of their shares.”	   Allied currently trades 21 percent below its mean price target of $68.38, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.	   “The stock is ridiculously undervalued,” said Jay Kaplan, a fund manager for Royce Total Return Fund. “It would probably buy back a ton of its shares.” 	   Allied had about $201 million left in a buyback program at the end of the second quarter, and is expected to resume buying back its shares this quarter.	   “They definitely have available cash to use, but I expect they’d wait until after the Atlantic hurricane season to really do anything substantial,” said KBW’s Evans, referring to a likely end-November timeframe. 	   Termination fees from the Transatlantic non-deal should add more than $1 per share to Allied’s earnings — another positive for its stock. Allied would receive a $35 million break-up fee and $13.3 million in costs from Transatlantic. 	   Reinsurer Transatlantic, once controlled by American International Group Inc and also recently courted by Validus Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) National Indemnity, would also owe Allied another $66.7 million if it enters another deal within a year. 	   The insurance market has been battling sluggish growth and price weakness since the 2008 financial crisis.	   Allied World, whose reinsurance operations make up around a third of its revenue from gross premiums, would benefit from any price hikes — but analysts see larger players like ACE  and XL Group benefiting more.	   “ACE and XL screen best here because both have flexible and robust property-catastrophe platforms, which can directly benefit from better pricing,” said Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Nannizzi.	   In addition, any gains from new business that Allied may win could be offset by the high losses from catastrophe this year such as the Japan and New Zealand earthquakes, flooding in Australia and blizzards and hurricanes in the United States.	   “The rebound in underwriting and operating margins expected for 2012 is skewed by a high level of catastrophe losses incurred so far in 2011,” said Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Cathy Seifert.

187,AIG,REPEAT-Corporate audit fees up? Beware of trouble ahead,"* Studies find correlation between rising fees, problems * Investors should pay more attention, say researchers By Nanette Byrnes Oct 9 (Reuters) - Elevated audit fees can be a red flag of problems to come for a company, say three recent academic studies that together warn about increased chances of fraud, stock price declines or financial restatements. Companies have been disclosing how much they pay their auditors since 2001, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission instituted the requirement as part of a push to improve corporate auditor independence. The numbers may be underappreciated by investors, however, who seem not to recognize the special insights auditors have. “The auditors have private information about the firm because of their interaction with management. They obviously have a lot of risk associated with any fraud at a firm, and we assume they adjust their fee accordingly,” said Ryan Wilson, who teaches accounting at the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa, in an interview October 5. He co-authored an April 2010 study on the topic. A high or rising audit fee can indicate one of two things, experts say. Either the auditor is charging a risk premium, aiming to cover future legal costs to them of something going awry, or they may just be doing more work on the audit, digging into areas where results are uncertain. The studies’ findings come at a moment when regulators are considering requiring auditors to give out even more information. A proposal under consideration by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board might have auditors disclosing more than the current minimal thumbs up or down. Meantime, their fees seem to be telling a valuable story. Audit fees substantially above those paid by competitors and companies of similar size are strongly associated with a slip in operating performance the following year, and to a lesser degree as many as five years later, according to research by Jonathan Stanley, an accounting professor at Auburn University, published in the current August/October issue of Auditing, a journal of the American Accounting Association. In addition to forecasting operating declines, high audit fees are predictive of fraud and restatements, and rising fees can foreshadow steep stock price drops, credit rating downgrades and class action lawsuits, the research has found. American International Group Inc , the insurance giant bailed out by the government on the brink of bankruptcy in 2008, is one of a number of examples cited in interviews with the authors of the studies. According to SEC filings, AIG paid $66 million for its 2004 audit, a $33 million increase over its 2003 fee. In 2005, the company restated its 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 numbers. Another example is Swedish mobile phone maker Ericsson . Nicole Thorne Jenkins of Vanderbilt University’s Owen Graduate School of Management said the fees climbed significantly faster than peers’ the year before it issued a 36 percent profit decline in 2007 that sent its stock down sharply. A 2004 sales shortfall at technology group Altera Corp was preceded by a rise in its audit fee. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditor of all three companies, declined to comment citing a policy of not discussing client matters. Jenkins said in an October 5 interview that her research published April 2011 found investors as a group do not recognize the importance of audit fees. Auburn’s Stanley said investors should consider audit fees with other metrics like short interest and analysts’ forecasts, in an October 5 interview. “There’s a link between audit price and future performance,” he said. Unusually low fees may be worth keeping an eye on too, argued Donald Whalen, director of research for Audit Analytics, in an October 6 interview. “If audit fees are way down, how can the auditor be performing the necessary work?” he asked. Whalen highlighted the case of government-backed loan purchaser Fannie Mae . Auditor KPMG charged the lender less than $3 million a year in 2001, 2002 and 2003. When the company changed auditors in 2004, hiring Deloitte & Touche, the fees went up sharply to a dramatic $203 million in 2004. Fees have since dropped, but at $37 million for the 2010 audit, they remain well above KPMG’s price. Fannie Mae’s regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, raised questions about the company’s accounting in 2004, after which its stock dropped sharply. The company eventually restated 2001-2004 earnings, erasing $6.3 billion of reported income. KPMG declined to comment.",10102011,http://www.reuters.com/article/accounting-audit-fees/repeat-corporate-audit-fees-up-beware-of-trouble-ahead-idUSN1E79806W20111010
188,AIG,BofA seeks to oust AIG law firm from $10 billion case,"(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) urged a judge to disqualify the law firm representing insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) in its $10 billion mortgage fraud lawsuit against the bank, alleging a conflict of interest by one of the firm’s partners. The bank said Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan should be removed because the partner had defended Merrill Lynch & Co and its First Franklin Financial Corp unit against similar charges that they made and sold defective mortgage loans. Bank of America bought Merrill on January 1, 2009. While the partner, Marc Becker, is no longer working on the case following the bank’s objection, his earlier involvement is a “flouting of the ethical rules” and put him in position to use his former clients’ confidential information, Bank of America said. “Becker’s involvement in this case has already tainted these proceedings,” wrote Marc Dworsky, a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, which represents Bank of America and employed Becker until 2008, in a filing on Monday evening with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. “Quinn cannot be in a position to use defendants’ confidential information against them in the future — particularly in a case of this magnitude,” Dworsky added. The challenge raises the stakes in one of the biggest lawsuits stemming from the global financial and credit crises. AIG obtained $182.3 billion of federal bailout and remains owned largely by taxpayers. It accused Bank of America and its Countrywide and Merrill units of misrepresenting the quality of about $28 billion of mortgage-backed securities it bought, and lying to credit-rating agencies about the underlying loans. Gregory Joseph, a lawyer for Quinn Emanuel, in an email called Bank of America’s motion a tactical effort to remove the firm from the case. The firm is one of the largest specialists in mortgage-securities litigation. “They know perfectly well that he would not share any confidential information, and he never did,” Joseph said, referring to Becker. “Its motion never even addresses the governing standard — whether there is any risk of trial taint — because of course there isn’t.” AIG spokesman Mark Herr called the Bank of America motion “simply an attempt to distract from the merits of the case.” James Cohen, a Fordham University law professor and legal ethics specialist, said Becker’s earlier work likely did not warrant Quinn Emanuel’s disqualification from the AIG case. “I don’t think there is a conflict,” he said. “They are unrelated matters and his representation of Merrill and First Franklin is more than two years in the past. The mere claim that a lawyer developed a strategy for defending this kind of lawsuit does not mean the lawsuits are significantly related.” Cohen said it could prove “problematic” if presiding judge Barbara Jones decided Becker was not screened fast enough, but that an effective screen could address this issue. He added: “It is of high value for a party to have the law firm of choice.” Becker now works in London. He did not immediately return a call seeking a comment. Quinn Emanuel’s other cases include most of the 18 Federal Housing Finance Agency lawsuits against Bank of America, other banks and at least 131 individuals to recover losses on $200 billion of soured mortgage debt held by Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB.

190,AIG,AIG loses bid to move $10 billion fraud case vs BofA,"(Reuters) - A federal judge rejected American International Group Inc’s request to move its $10 billion mortgage fraud lawsuit against Bank of America Corp back to a New York state court, where AIG believed the case belonged. U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan accepted Bank of America’s argument that some home loans underlying the 349 residential mortgage-backed securities that AIG said it bought allowed a federal court to assert jurisdiction. The bank had cited a 1919 federal law governing international banking. AIG had argued that its fraud and other claims under state law predominated, and that the complexity of the case warranted having a New York state court apply New York law. In its August 8 lawsuit, AIG had accused Bank of America of engineering a “massive” fraud. It said the bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units misrepresented the quality of more than $28 billion of securities it bought, and lied to credit rating agencies about the underlying loans. Bank of America hopes to combine the AIG case with Countrywide litigation before U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles, who has issued favorable rulings for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank. Jones has not decided whether to give the AIG case to Pfaelzer, or on Bank of America’s request to oust AIG’s law firm because one partner who worked on the case previously defended Merrill against similar charges. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson and AIG spokesman Mark Herr declined to comment. Based in New York, AIG is an insurer that has received $182.3 billion of federal bailouts and remains largely owned by taxpayers. The lawsuit is separate from Bank of America’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors such as BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco covering Countrywide mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances. Jones’ colleague William Pauley said on Wednesday that this accord should be considered in federal court, as some investors unhappy with the terms had wanted, rather than state court, where it could have won approval as soon as next month. That accord was intended to resolve much litigation over the bank’s disastrous 2008 purchase of Countrywide, and Pauley’s decision adds uncertainty over the timing and scope of any resolution.

Treasury said its remaining investment in AIG now stands at $50 billion, and the Federal Reserve has about $17.5 billion in loans outstanding to the investment vehicles that hold former AIG assets.

Treasury said it now has received overall repayments and other income totaling $317 billion from investments made under TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program funded by taxpayers that was used to bail out distressed financial firms.

195,AIG,"AIG loses $4 billion on planes, weak markets","(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group lost more than $4 billion in the third quarter, as its aircraft leasing unit took an impairment charge on a portion of its fleet and the fair value of the company’s one-third stake in Asian insurer AIA fell. It was the 10th time in the last 15 quarters, dating to 2008, that AIG lost at least $1 billion. Shares fell 3.2 percent in after-hours trading after the company announced its financial results, then rebounded a bit after AIG said it would launch a $1 billion share buyback. AIG’s core insurance businesses were profitable on an operating basis, and its mortgage insurance unit both raised prices and gained market share amid difficulties in that industry. But those results were not enough to overcome the charges, which were partially driven by declining equity and debt markets during the quarter. AIG reported a loss of $4.11 billion, or $2.16 per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $2.52 billion, or $18.53 per share. In the year-earlier period AIG took a number of charges on asset sales; it also had a smaller share count. On an operating basis AIG lost $3.04 billion, or $1.60 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had on average expected a loss of 63 cents per share in the quarter, though the range of estimates was wide, from a loss of 22 cents to a loss of 99 cents. AIG said that ILFC, its plane leasing business, took a $1.5 billion impairment on 95 planes as customers’ appetites shifted toward newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Last February, Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said he did not expect any further large charges for the business this year, after it took roughly $1 billion in write-downs in the last six months of 2010. AIG said it lost $2.3 billion on the declining fair value of its stake in AIA during the third quarter. AIG took AIA public late last year in Hong Kong. It recently became eligible to start selling AIA shares after the IPO lockup expired. AIG has also filed to take ILFC public. Proceeds from the sale of AIA shares and from any ILFC IPO are already earmarked to pay back some of the U.S. Treasury’s remaining $50 billion interest in the company. The government rescued AIG from the brink of bankruptcy in September 2008, at a price tag that exceeded $182 billion. The Treasury still owns a 77 percent stake in what was once the world’s largest insurance company. In the third quarter, AIG also had substantial catastrophe losses totaling $574 million, mostly because of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Beyond the charges, though, AIG said its insurance units had posted nearly $900 million in pretax operating income. Property insurer Chartis saw net premiums written rise nearly 1 percent, though the gain was attributable to foreign exchange benefits.

198,AIG,UPDATE 4-Greenberg sues U.S. for $25 bln over AIG takeover,"* Lawsuit seeks $25 billion for AIG shareholders * Starr International says AIG takeover unconstitutional * Federal Reserve Bank of New York also sued * Treasury Department calls AIG bailout necessary, legal By Jonathan Stempel Nov 21 (Reuters) - A company run by former American International Group Inc Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg sued the U.S. government for $25 billion, calling the 2008 federal takeover of the insurer unconstitutional. The lawsuit marks an unusual effort to force the government to pay shareholders, who have seen AIG’s stock price tumble 98 percent since the middle of 2007, when the insurer’s risky bets on mortgage debt through credit default swaps began to falter. Greenberg’s company, Starr International Co, also filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whose president at the time of the takeover was Timothy Geithner, now U.S. Treasury Secretary. Once AIG’s largest shareholder, Starr said the government took a roughly 80 percent stake in AIG and charged an “punitive” 14.5 percent on federal loans without seeking a shareholder vote, hoping to provide a “backdoor bailout” for AIG trading partners such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc . It said the bailouts that began on Sept. 16, 2008, violated shareholders’ rights to due process and equal protection, and a Fifth Amendment ban against taking private property for public use without just compensation, known as the “takings clause.” Greenberg, 86, had led AIG for nearly four decades prior to his 2005 ouster. Starr once owned 12 percent of AIG. “The government’s actions were ostensibly designed to protect the United States economy and rescue the country’s financial system,” David Boies, a lawyer for Starr, said in the complaint. “Although this might be a laudable goal, as a matter of basic law, the ends could not and did not justify the unlawful means employed,” he continued. “The government is not empowered to trample shareholder and property rights even in the midst of a financial emergency.” Shareholders of other companies, including mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the bank Citigroup Inc , also saw their holdings diluted in the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis. It is unclear whether Starr’s constitutional arguments might apply to them. Starr sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., which handles lawsuits seeking money from the government. It brought that lawsuit on behalf of itself and other AIG shareholders. The case against the New York Fed, which gave AIG an $85 billion credit line, was filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. AIG’s bailouts eventually totaled $182.3 billion. Despite broad public anger at how bailouts were conducted, it is “hard to imagine Hank winning,” Adam Levitin, a professor at Georgetown Law School, said in emailed comments.

199,AIG,UPDATE 3-U.S. sued for $25 billion over AIG takeover,"* Lawsuit seeks $25 bln for AIG shareholders * Starr Int’l says AIG takeover violated Constitution * Federal Reserve Bank of New York also sued * Treasury Department calls AIG bailout necessary, legal By Jonathan Stempel Nov 21 (Reuters) - A company run by former American International Group Inc Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg sued the United States government for $25 billion, calling the 2008 U.S. takeover of the insurer unconstitutional. The lawsuit marks an unusual effort to force the government to pay shareholders, who have seen AIG’s stock price tumble 98 percent since the middle of 2007, when the insurer’s risky bets on mortgage debt through credit default swaps began to falter. Greenberg’s company filed a separate, related lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Starr International Co, which once had a 12 percent stake in AIG and was its largest shareholder, said the government illegally took a nearly 80 percent AIG stake without seeking a shareholder vote, hoping to provide a “backdoor bailout” for AIG trading partners such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc . It said the bailouts that began on Sept. 16, 2008 violated shareholders’ rights to due process and equal protection, and a Fifth Amendment ban against taking private property for public use without just compensation, known as the “takings clause.” Greenberg, 86, runs Starr, and had led AIG for nearly four decades prior to his 2005 ouster. “The government’s actions were ostensibly designed to protect the United States economy and rescue the country’s financial system,” David Boies, a lawyer for Starr, said in the complaint. “Although this might be a laudable goal, as a matter of basic law, the ends could not and did not justify the unlawful means employed,” he continued. “The government is not empowered to trample shareholder and property rights even in the midst of a financial emergency.” Shareholders of other companies, including mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the bank Citigroup Inc , also saw their holdings diluted in the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis. It is unclear whether Starr’s constitutional arguments might apply to them. Starr sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., which handles lawsuits seeking money from the government. It sued the New York Fed, which gave AIG an initial $85 billion credit line, in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The bailouts eventually totaled $182.3 billion. Despite broad public anger at how bailouts were conducted, it is “hard to imagine Hank winning,” Adam Levitin, a professor at Georgetown Law School, said in emailed comments. Levitin noted that the AIG bailout had been approved by the insurer’s board, and that the terms “arguably” were fair.

In a filing to the Hong Kong bourse, PICC said it proposed an issue of 345.6 million H shares in the proportion of one rights share for every 10 existing H shares held at HK$5.50 each, representing a discount of 47.1 percent to the previous close. The H share rights issue will raise about HK$1.9 billion. The plan is conditional upon approval from relevant authorities including the China Insurance Regulatory Commission and China Securities Regulatory Commission, it said. American International Group Inc, which owns about 31.9 percent of PICC’s issued H shares, will subscribe to the portion of rights shares allotted to it, PICC said. PICC also proposed an issue of 768.6 million domestic rights shares on the basis of one domestic rights share for every 10 existing domestic shares held at 4.49 yuan each, raising about 3.5 billion yuan. China International Capital Corporation Hong Kong Securities Ltd (CICC) is the sole global coordinator of the issue. CICC, HSBC and Goldman Sachs are joint lead underwriters and bookrunners. PICC had said earlier that it would maintain a relatively low combined cost ratio in the second half of this year. Shares of PICC have fallen 7.6 percent so far this year, comparing with a 21.7 percent drop in the broader market.",11292011,http://www.reuters.com/article/picc-rights/update-1-picc-says-plans-783-mln-rights-issue-idUSL4E7MT01R20111129
203,AIG,BofA loses bid to oust AIG law firm from case,"*Judge denies BofA request to disqualify AIG law firm *Finds partner unlikely to share confidential information By Terry Baynes NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Bank of America Corp’s request to disqualify the law firm representing insurer American International Group Inc in its $10 billion mortgage fraud lawsuit against the bank, over an alleged conflict of interest by one of the firm’s partners. U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Jones ruled that the partner’s minimal involvement in the case and AIG’s established relationship with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan weighed against removing the law firm from the case. Bank of America asked the judge in October to disqualify the law firm because its partner, Marc Becker, previously defended Merrill Lynch & Co and its First Franklin Financial Corp unit against similar charges of mortgage fraud. Merrill Lynch and First Franklin are now both subsidiaries of Bank of America and defendants in the case. Becker was a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, which represents Bank of America, before he moved to Quinn Emanuel in 2008. Although Quinn Emanuel removed Becker from the case after the bank’s objection, Bank of America’s lawyers argued that Becker’s involvement broke ethical rules by placing Becker in a position to use his former clients’ confidential information. But the judge disagreed. Although Becker performed 5.8 hours of work for AIG on the case after his move, Quinn Emanuel promptly separated him from the case within 24 hours of discovering the conflict, the judge found. “Screens erected immediately upon discovery of the conflict weigh against disqualification,” Jones wrote. Becker’s minimal work on the case and his physical distance from it in firm’s London office made any disclosure of confidential client information unlikely, she added. The size of Quinn Emanuel, with more than 500 attorneys, reduced that risk further, she wrote. “There is no meaningful showing that the trial process here will be tainted,” Jones ruled. Given AIG’s “significant” relationship with Quinn Emanuel and the cost of finding new counsel, she refused to disqualify the firm. Marc Dworsky, a lawyer for Bank of America at Munger, Tolles & Olson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Quinn Emanuel’s other cases include most of the 18 Federal Housing Finance Agency lawsuits against Bank of America, other banks and at least 131 individuals to recover losses on $200 billion of soured mortgage debt held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The case is American International Group Inc v. Bank of America Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06212.

205,AIG,"Insurers rally, defying history of January malaise","BOSTON (Reuters) - Shares in insurance companies rallied on Tuesday, starting the year to the upside after taking a beating in 2011 and defying new research that suggests they could underperform in the short term. The S&P; insurance index .GSPINSC rose 2.2 percent, outperforming a 1.8 percent gain for the broader S&P; 500. All but one of the index’s 22 components were higher, led by Genworth Financial (GNW.N), Lincoln National (LNC.N) and AIG (AIG.N), all more than 4.5 percent higher on the day. Those stocks were three of the four worst performers in the index last year, with Lincoln falling around 30 percent and AIG and Genworth shedding roughly half their value. In total more than two-thirds of the index members closed the year lower. In the last few months, analysts have said insurers have fallen into a “double beta” pattern, meaning that they move in the same direction as the market on many days, but record much sharper gains or losses than the market does. That pattern helped fuel Tuesday’s rally, despite a new report casting doubt on insurers’ performance. Bespoke Investment Group analyzed the 24 industry groups that make up the S&P; 500 going back to 1990 and found that the insurance sector is the worst January performer of the bunch, falling an average of 1.84 percent. Over that period, insurers were only positive in about 41 percent of January months, the firm said, while the broader S&P; 500 was positive in 59 percent of Januaries.

The winner may need to buy all of the debt offered, Bloomberg said, citing one of the sources. The sources also said a list of four or five dealers, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, may be asked to assemble bids, Bloomberg said. The Fed was not available for immediate comment.

207,AIG,Exclusive: AIG debates if it could buy back AIA,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chairman Steve Miller said on Thursday the bailed-out insurance company may eventually want to buy a life insurer outside the United States, including possibly a larger stake in the spun-off Asian unit AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK), as confidence in its turnaround grows. Miller said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that any decision was probably two to three years down the road, but as the company thought about possible alternatives, rebuilding a global life insurance business was logical. Miller’s comments are a remarkable reversal for AIG, which was bailed out by the U.S. government at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and is still majority owned by taxpayers. The thinking at AIG since the crisis has been largely focused on divesting assets and paying back the government. While that continues to be the focus, Miller said the board has been thinking about a longer-term strategy as well. “If you look at the company, you are a global (property and casualty) company and a domestic life company, which begs the question: What about the fourth box on the chart? Do you want to be global in life or you want to not be in life? Those are all valid strategic questions. And one way or the other we will probably rebuild an international presence in life,” Miller said. “It’s an obvious strategic question. It is very premature to be speculating about it right now.” The question of what to do with AIA is an important one because of the outsized impact it has on AIG’s financial results every quarter and because AIA could give the company the international profile it once had. AIG spun off two-thirds of AIA in a blockbuster Hong Kong IPO in the fall of 2010. The sale was seen as a milestone in AIG’s efforts to reorganize and remain a going concern, while also repaying its $182 billion bailout. But the remaining one-third stake has caused wild swings in AIG’s quarterly results, leaving it hostage to the vagaries of the Hong Kong stock market. Miller said that was untenable. “I don’t see us holding a third of the company forever,” Miller said. “One of two things is going to happen - either we will monetize that one-third interest in AIA and use it for some other corporate purpose, or in fact if the stars were aligned in a different way, possibly we would want to re-acquire a portion of it.” AIG’s one-third stake in AIA is housed inside a special purpose vehicle. The U.S. Treasury owns a preferred interest in that vehicle and the assumption has long been that AIG would ultimately sell its remaining AIA interests to pay off that Treasury position. But Chief Executive Bob Benmosche surprised investors last year when he said AIG might like to keep the AIA stake and instead find a way to pay off the Treasury elsewhere. Benmosche’s interest is understandable because AIA is still a huge contributor to AIG in good times. In the second quarter of 2011, with AIA shares rising, AIG booked a gain on the investment of $1.5 billion, making up almost all of the company’s net profit for the period. But with the stock falling alongside global markets in the third quarter, AIG booked a $2.3 billion loss on that stake. Smoothing out the uncertainty may be attractive to AIG, particularly as it ramps up efforts to reintroduce its brand name in the market. Last week, it said sales skyrocketed at a life insurance subsidiary that had tested the AIG brand. This week, it merged a number of employee benefits operations into one business with the AIG brand name. Taking back AIA would also solve another problem for AIG - it is a dominant global player in the property insurance market, but in life insurance it is more or less restricted to the United States through its SunAmerica business. Miller said AIG was “proud” of that business, but was equally quick to point out it was not a global operation. “So the question that looms there is should we take the skillset that we’ve got in life and retirement services and go back to being what AIG used to be, which is a global life player, and the avenues to get there might be through AIA or might not,” Miller said. Miller also said the company is still looking to monetize its aircraft leasing unit, ILFC, which filed for an initial public offering last year, despite uncertainty in equity markets. “We were getting ready for the IPO, waiting for the right market conditions to do that. Possibly some company would want to acquire it or something and we would consider that,” he said. “At some point it would make sense for us to monetize it and use that capital in some other way.” ",1262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-aig/exclusive-aig-debates-if-it-could-buy-back-aia-idUSTRE80P1F720120126
208,AIG,"GM, AIG shares slides to add $23 billion to deficit","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just when Americans have largely forgotten about the Treasury’s controversial bailout program, the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday blamed it for an anticipated $23 billion widening in the government’s deficit. The non-partisan CBO, as part of its annual budget outlook, said that the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, will reverse $37 billion in gains in fiscal year 2011, and instead post a net cost of $23 billion this year. The net $61 billion swing is due to declines in the value of shares the U.S. Treasury owns in General Motors Co (GM.N) and American International Group (AIG.N). The government bailed out the automaker and the insurance giant during the height of the 2008-09 financial crisis, leaving U.S. taxpayers with substantial equity stakes in each. After both firms pulled off successful public stock offerings in 2010 and 2011, their improved valuations made it seem that the government might actually earn an overall profit on TARP. But since then, the stocks have fallen. GM, despite a major comeback that has returned its crown as the world’s top-selling automaker, has seen its share price slide from $37 a year ago to $24.02 on Tuesday - significantly below the $33 IPO price and far below the approximately $53 price needed for taxpayers to break even. AIG shares have declined from about $43 in early February of last year to end at $25.11 on Tuesday. The breakeven price for AIG is about $28.73 per share. The CBO’s estimate of TARP outlays represents only about $3 billion in actual cash out the door, for housing rescue expenses. The remaining $20 billion is a non-cash accounting adjustment. The Treasury’s most recent estimate for TARP’s net cost to taxpayers, made earlier this month, was $68 billion. The program, initially billed as a $700 billion bailout fund, ultimately invested $411 billion in financial firms and automakers. The CBO, however, on Tuesday estimated TARP’s lifetime costs at $34 billion. One major difference is that Treasury assumes that all $49 billion in TARP housing rescue funds will be spent, while CBO estimates that only a portion of these will be used.

209,AIG,AIG reviewing succession as chairman takes new job,"* Miller to become CEO of Hawker Beechcraft * Remains AIG chairman, company says * Miller was poised to back up ailing Benmosche BOSTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group will review its succession plans after its chairman accepted a job as the chief executive of an airplane maker, the company said on Tuesday. AIG CEO Bob Benmosche has been in treatment for cancer since late 2010. Chairman Steve Miller was to become interim CEO if Benmosche were unable to continue with the job. But on Tuesday, business plane maker Hawker Beechcraft named turnaround expert Miller its chief executive, effective immediately. “The board has an active succession planning process and will be assessing its plans in light of Mr. Miller’s announcement,” AIG said in a statement, adding that he will remain chairman of the board. AIG’s succession plan was a hot topic in late 2010 and early 2011 as the company tried to execute a recovery plan following its $182 billion government rescue. Benmosche has been widely acknowledged as key to that plan. But he has remained in good health and has indicated a desire to remain with the company and in the job, making succession less of an issue. Miller is one of the most heralded turnaround experts in the country, having led companies like Delphi Corp, Bethlehem Steel and Waste Management in recent decades. AIG shares fell 8 cents to $26.72 in afternoon trading. The stock lost half its value last year but has rebounded sharply in 2012. Even so, it remains roughly $2 below the U.S. Treasury’s break-even point on its 77 percent stake in the company.",2072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig/aig-reviewing-succession-as-chairman-takes-new-job-idUSL2E8D7FXK20120207

The Fed could sell the residential mortgage bonds from its Maiden Lane II portfolio around Feb. 8 if a favourable offer comes through, the report said citing people familiar with the matter. The Maiden Lane II portfolio was created to absorb risky mortgage securities from AIG and help prevent the collapse of what was then the world’s largest insurer.

The auction-based sale will enable the New York Fed, which handles the U.S. central bank’s market activities, to recoup the remaining outstanding loan balance of $19.5 billion to the portfolio called Maiden Lane II, it said on Wednesday. The Fed bank did not reveal the sales price nor the specific bonds in the auction but said Goldman’s bid “represented good value for the public.” Credit Suisse Group bought a $7.01 billion chunk of the portfolio on Jan. 19 after an auction. In the latest round, the Fed also invited bids from the U.S. securities units of Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley , Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Credit Suisse, whose unsolicited offer for the assets set off the auction. The back-to-back sales chop the portfolio down to about $6.2 billion in face value, and suggest the market for such bonds is warming up. The U.S. housing market was at the heart of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Maiden Lane II was created to absorb risky mortgage securities from AIG, helping prevent the collapse of what was then the world’s largest insurer. In March last year, the New York Fed had rejected a $15.7 billion bid from AIG, saying it would sell off the bonds over time instead. After having trouble offloading the mortgage securities throughout last year, the New York Fed has had better luck this year as prices of the assets improved. The rest of Maiden Lane II assets will be sold “individually and in segments over time as market conditions warrant through a competitive sales process, while taking appropriate care to avoid market disruption,” the Fed bank said. The loan will be repaid in early March. Any proceeds from further sales would go to the U.S. Treasury.",2082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-mbs-maidenlane/update-2-ny-fed-sells-6-2-bln-in-mortgage-bonds-to-goldman-idUSL2E8D89F620120208

214,AIG,"Lower AIG, GM values add $21 billion to deficit: White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. financial bailout program will add $21 billion to the budget deficit next year largely due to lower valuations of the government’s stock in General Motors Co and American International Group, the Obama administration said on Monday. The White House now estimates that the Troubled Asset Relief Program will have a final net cost of $67.8 billion, up from a $46.8 billion estimate made in August 2011. The non-cash accounting difference added $21 billion to its fiscal 2013 deficit estimate of $1.33 trillion. But the estimates use November 30 share prices for bailout recipients GM and AIG, and their shares have rebounded somewhat since then. If this trend continues, an upward valuation adjustment — which would reduce deficits — is likely later this year.

After both companies pulled off successful public stock offerings in 2010 and 2011, their improved valuations made it seem the government might actually earn an overall profit on the $700 billion TARP bailout fund. Downward revisions to TARP cost estimates helped reduce White House deficit forecasts in fiscal 2010 and 2011. But the companies’ shares fell amid turmoil in Europe and Japan last year and worries about another U.S. recession. The White House based its AIG estimate on a November 30 share price of $23.31 per share, well below AIG’s $52.66 peak in January 2011. AIG shares were trading at $27.10 on Monday, closer to the $28.73 price needed for taxpayers to break even on the bailout. For GM’s valuation, the White House used a share price of $21.29, well below the $33 initial public offering price in November 2010 and its January 2011 peak of $38.10. GM was trading at $25.62 on Monday, but it has to go to about $53 a share for taxpayers to break even. The readjustment of TARP costs in the Obama administration’s budget follows a similar $23 billion increase in the program’s cost estimate by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office at the end of January, also largely due to the lower share prices of bailed-out GM and AIG. Offsetting the decline in GM and AIG shares in the White House’s estimate was a $1.4 billion increase in the value of mortgage-backed securities held in the Public Private Investment Program, which was created to invest in so-called “toxic” assets — the original intended purpose for TARP before it was used to directly inject capital into banks and other companies.

AIG on Monday filed copies of letters it exchanged with the SEC in December and January, all relating to its quarterly report for the third quarter of 2011. On Dec. 9, the SEC asked AIG to propose language, to be included in future filings, giving more precise descriptions of the guaranteed rates in its annuity and universal life accounts. The SEC, as it sometimes does in such cases, also asked AIG for a written declaration acknowledging its responsibility to make adequate and accurate disclosures. AIG responded Dec. 22, proposing a table to include in future filings that would show the range of rate guarantees in each business, and how they related to the total account values for each product. It also provided the SEC with the disclosure declaration that had been requested. The head of the SEC’s accounting branch in turn emailed Chief Executive Bob Benmosche on Jan. 10 to say the review had been completed. Last August, AIG disclosed a series of letters between it and the SEC relating to its first-quarter report of spring 2011, in which the SEC asked for more disclosure about how and why the company assigns credit ratings to investments in its portfolio. Such SEC requests to public companies are not unusual, though they offer some insight into what regulators look at when they review quarterly filings. Among others, Berkshire Hathaway  has also received a number of such requests for more disclosure in the recent past.

217,AIG,AIG taking its time on a variety of assets,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) may raise its stake in Asian insurer AIA Group (1299.HK) someday and is open to offers for its airplane leasing business ILFC ILFC.N, but will bide its time on all these things, Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said on Wednesday. Benmosche, speaking at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch insurance conference, made clear that AIG was in no rush to make any decisions on key assets. The company, bailed out by the U.S. government in late 2008, is still 77 percent owned by the Treasury Department. As part of its efforts to repay that bailout, it took AIA public in Hong Kong in 2010 but retained a one-third stake. When AIA shares rise that creates substantial profits for AIG, but when the stock falls it generates major losses. Benmosche said one option might be to someday raise AIG’s stake in AIA to 51 percent. Before that, though, AIG will have to pay off the government’s preferred interest in the entity that holds the AIA shares. Proceeds from a sale of ILFC are expected to go toward that goal. AIG filed for an initial public offering for ILFC last fall but has done little since. Benmosche said the time for an IPO was not right, given “noise” in the aviation market. But he added he would listen to reasonable offers for the unit. He made clear that one asset not going anywhere is United Guaranty, or UGC, the company’s mortgage insurance business. At one time UGC was seen as a non-core asset that might be sold to raise capital. But as competitors have struggled, UGC has become the largest mortgage insurer in the country.

225,AIG,UPDATE 3-AIG posts huge 4th-quarter profit on tax benefit,"* Q4 operating earnings per share $0.82; Street view $0.63 * Unlikely to pay income taxes for years to come * Shares rise about 6 pct after hours By Ben Berkowitz Feb 23 (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group reported a $19.8 billion profit for the fourth quarter, after an accounting change that allowed the company to record an enormous one-time benefit. The move, which sent the company’s shares up by about 6 percent, essentially means AIG will not pay tax on tens of billions of dollars in income in the coming years, thanks to benefits that stem from its financial crisis-era losses. AIG said in the third quarter that its results in the fourth quarter would determine whether it could release a so-called valuation allowance against the tax assets. Having determined it is more likely than not to be consistently profitable in the future, it released most of the allowance, nearly $17.7 billion, in the quarter. Some of the allowance, related to the company’s life insurance business, was not released, a determination that future profits are not as immediately certain there. It may still be released in the future, though, which would again add to the company’s bottom line. The future of the tax assets has been a key question for investors, with some analysts suggesting the value of the assets made up as much as a fifth of AIG’s stock price. Fund manager Bruce Berkowitz, AIG’s largest non-government shareholder, has said the value of the assets was underestimated by the market. AIG shares rose to $29.70 in after-market trading from a $27.99 close in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At that after-hours price the stock is now above the U.S. Treasury’s breakeven point on its 77 percent stake in the company. There is no time table for the government to sell the remainder of that stake, the last vestige of its $182 billion bailout of what had been the world’s largest insurer. Net income was $19.8 billion, or $10.43 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $11.18 billion, or $16.60 per share. AIG’s share count rose year over year, explaining the earnings-per-share discrepancy. In the year-earlier period the company recorded a huge one-time gain on asset sales that inflated results. On an operating basis, the company earned 82 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected 63 cents. AIG’s global property insurance unit, Chartis, returned to profitability in the quarter. It earned $348 million, despite $368 million in catastrophe losses related to the flooding in Thailand. AIG said Chartis experienced stronger pricing, and premiums written increased on growth in its consumer business. SunAmerica, AIG’s U.S. life insurer, reported a smaller profit of $931 million in the quarter, as net investment income declined. SunAmerica also reported a $105 million increase in reserves in the quarter, like other life insurers have of late, for death benefits that may be due to policyholders but have not been claimed yet. Various states have been probing whether insurers were doing enough to ensure that such claims are paid. AIG also benefited in the quarter from a rise in AIA Group’s  share price, booking a $1 billion gain. AIG spun AIA off in a Hong Kong IPO in late 2010 but still owns one-third of the company. When AIA is up AIG profits, though the opposite is also true. To stem that volatility, top AIG executives have recently floated the idea of buying back a majority stake in AIA, though they have also said it would not happen anytime soon. ILFC, the airplane leasing business AIG is planning to take public, returned to profitability in the fourth quarter, even with a $40 million charge related to recent airline bankruptcies.

227,AIG,AIG strikes upbeat tone as shares rise sharply,"(Reuters) - AIG management struck an optimistic tone for analysts on Friday, as a net profit of nearly $20 billion helped push shares in the bailed-out insurance company to their highest level since last summer. While the outsized fourth-quarter profit was a one-time event linked to a tax accounting change, underlying it was a long-term assumption that the company has stopped its multibillion dollar crisis-era losses. “It signifies our view that we have returned to sustainable profitability,” Chief Financial Officer David Herzog said on a conference call with analysts. From the first quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2011, AIG lost a total of just over $106 billion. Over that 15-quarter stretch it lost more than $1 billion in 10 different periods. But management said it no longer expects such losses to be routine. “The important thing to take into account here is, the reason they were able to take the deferred tax asset into the numbers is they believe and have confidence they can actually utilize those tax assets,” said Gloria Vogel, senior insurance analyst at Drexel Hamilton. “It’s not the number ... it’s just the thought that they can actually demonstrate profits,” said Vogel, who started coverage on AIG last week with a “buy” rating. AIG shares rose 4.8 percent to $29.32 in morning trade, their highest level since late July of last year. Over the last three months, the stock has gained more than 46 percent, nearly triple the gains for the broader insurance index. At Friday’s levels, AIG is also back above the U.S. Treasury’s $28.73 breakeven point on its 77 percent stake in the company for the first time in months. The company would not give any sort of forecast Friday on when Treasury might sell shares again, though it has said previously the government was waiting for a window where they could be sold profitably. AIG also admitted for the first time on Friday that it has been buying mortgage-backed securities from the auctions the Federal Reserve has held of its Maiden Lane II portfolio. That portfolio, comprised of bonds the government took off AIG’s hands during the financial crisis, has been sold piecemeal since the Fed rejected an offer for the whole thing from AIG last March. Since the Fed rejected that offer, AIG had steadfastly refused to say whether it was buying any of the bonds, either at the auctions or on the secondary market. The Fed is expected to sell the last of the bonds soon, and AIG said Friday the proceeds from the sales are likely to exceed what the Fed is owed. As a result, AIG will get one-sixth of the excess funds, part of the original deal during the bailout. Those funds will go toward paying down the Treasury’s preferred interest in the entity that controls AIG’s one-third stake in Asian insurer AIA Group.

234,AIG,NY Fed sells last of the AIG rescue bonds,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday sold the remaining portion of mortgage-backed securities acquired in the 2008 rescue of American International Group Inc. The sale to a unit of Credit Suisse Group AG means the U.S. government has recovered the entire $19.5 billion loan made at the height of the financial crisis - with interest. “The completion of the sale of the Maiden Lane II portfolio has resulted in significant gains for the public and marks an important milestone in the wind-down of the extraordinary interventions necessitated by the financial crisis,” New York Fed President William Dudley said in a prepared statement. Taxpayers will enjoy a net gain of about $2.8 billion from the sale of the entire portfolio, according to the New York Fed. The bonds, with a current face value of $6 billion, were purchased by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) amid heavy bidding. Other bidders were Royal Bank of Scotland Group’s RBS Securities, Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch broker and Morgan Stanley & Co.. The transaction, which liquidates bonds held in a portfolio known as Maiden Lane II LLC, was prompted by an unsolicited offer from Morgan Stanley to BlackRock Solutions, the investment manager for the portfolio, according to the New York Fed. Credit Suisse, which in January also bought the first tranche of Maiden Lane bonds with a face value of $7 billion, said “a significant portion” of the securities were already spoken for by clients, adding it plans to distribute the rest in the near future. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which bought $6.2 billion worth of the residential mortgage-backed securities earlier this month, was not involved in the New York Fed’s latest auction, said one source. In the last two auctions, the New York Fed did not reveal sale prices nor the specific bonds, but said on both occasions it represented “good value for the public.” The bank said on Tuesday that it moved ahead with the final leg of the bond sale “only after determining that the winning bid represented good value for the public.” Maiden Lane II was created to absorb risky mortgage securities from AIG, helping to prevent the collapse of what was then the world’s largest insurer. In March last year, the New York Fed rejected AIG’s $15.7 billion bid to buy the portfolio, saying it would sell off the bonds over time instead. Last week, AIG said that it would retain one-sixth of the profit on the sale of the portfolio. The company said it was required to use any such proceeds to help pay down the U.S. Treasury’s preferred interest in a special purpose vehicle that holds some AIG assets. After having trouble selling the mortgage securities last year, the New York Fed has had better luck this year as the market for such bonds warmed up.

They were previously convicted and sentenced to prison, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed their convictions last year and ordered a new trial, citing errors by the presiding judge at the original trial.

239,AIG,U.S. seeks dismissal of lawsuit on AIG takeover,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government has asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit relating to its 2008 takeover of American International Group (AIG.N) that was filed by a company run by former AIG Chief Executive Maurice Greenberg, court documents showed. In November, Greenberg’s company, Starr International Co, sued the U.S. government for $25 billion, calling the 2008 federal takeover of the insurer unconstitutional. Starr sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., which handles lawsuits seeking money from the government. It brought that lawsuit on behalf of itself and other AIG shareholders. The lawsuit marks an unusual effort to force the government to pay shareholders, who have seen AIG’s stock price tumble since the middle of 2007, when the insurer’s risky bets on mortgage debt through credit default swaps began to falter. Greenberg had led AIG for nearly four decades prior to his 2005 ouster. Starr once owned 12 percent of AIG. In a filing with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, the government said although Starr may disagree with the terms to which AIG agreed, any loss resulting from that agreement should be borne by AIG and its shareholders, and not the public. “Starr demands that the court second guess AIG and rewrite the rescue agreement by making American taxpayers pay an additional $25 billion, based upon a market valuation of AIG after the rescue,” the government said in the filing. The U.S. government argued that AIG had asked and agreed to be rescued, “electing to save itself from a failure of its own making.” AIG, which was once the world’s largest insurer by market value, was rescued by the U.S. government from the verge of collapse at the height of financial crisis in 2008. AIG’s bailouts eventually totaled $182.3 billion. The $25 billion estimate reflects what Starr called the value of the government’s stake on January 14, 2011, when it swapped AIG preferred stock for 562.9 million common shares.

241,AIG,AIG to sell $6 billion in AIA stock to repay bailout,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group is selling part of its stake in AIA Group to raise about $6 billion, which will help the insurer repay part of its government bailout. Markets reacted favorably, with AIG shares rising to their highest levels in 10 months on the news. AIG is looking to sell about 1.7 billion AIA shares at HK$27.15 to HK$27.50 each, according to a term sheet Reuters saw on Monday. That would be a discount of up to 7 percent to Friday’s closing price. The shares will go to institutional investors. AIG expects to use the net proceeds to reduce the balance of the U.S. Treasury Department’s preferred interest in a special-purpose vehicle that holds the AIA shares. As of last month, those preferred interests were worth about $8.4 billion. The Treasury also owns 77 percent of AIG’s common stock following a massive $182 billion bailout in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. At Friday’s close, AIG’s one-third stake in AIA was worth $14.9 billion. Following the share sale, the U.S. company will hold about 19 percent of AIA. Institutions are expected to buy into the offering because of AIA’s strong performance since the company’s $20.5 billion Hong Kong IPO in 2010 — Asia’s third-largest public listing. But a big run-up in the stock price may have some feeling that the current offer is expensive. With such a large sale and AIA’s free float increasing, though, the company’s weighting on benchmark indexes should rise, making the stock a target for fund managers tracking the Hang Seng and the Hang Seng Finance Index. “The issue of getting the deal through shouldn’t be a problem, plus there should be some index buying,” said the head of a large U.S.-based asset manager in Hong Kong who was not authorized to speak publicly on the AIA sale. Kenneth Yue, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CCB International Securities, said the sale looked well timed. “If you look at AIA’s new business growth last year, it went up 40 percent,” he said. “I believe they’ve gone to the peak already — it would be very challenging for them to increase their new business value going forward by 40 percent every year.” Pricing of the AIA share sale will occur no later than Tuesday, AIG said. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are the “active” joint global coordinators, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the process. Both requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Deutsche and Goldman were among the four banks that led AIA’s IPO, along with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. The sources said Citi and Morgan Stanley were taking “passive” roles in the current AIG sell-down. The distinction is important, not just for the fees that such a large offering brings, but also in the league table credit that can help a bank’s external marketing. For the AIA sell-down, the banks will get equal league table credit, but Deutsche and Goldman will take home the fatter fees, according to one of the sources. The deal should be “well distributed” among different investors, instead of large chunks going to just a handful, the source noted. Shares of AIA, headed by former Prudential Plc executive Mark Tucker, have risen 47 percent since early October and touched a seven-month high last week. The stock closed at HK$29.20 on Friday. AIG has been on a similar run, gaining 46 percent over the same period. Its shares rose 1.2 percent to $30.16 in afternoon trading, their highest level since last May. Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday that the sale would improve AIG’s focus on its core operations and would help its credit rating profile. AIA was founded in Shanghai in 1919 by U.S. entrepreneur C.V. Starr. Twenty years later, Starr temporarily relocated to the United States to avoid political instability in Asia and, following World War II, decided to run his U.S. businesses from New York. They came to be known as AIG, whose shares began trading in New York in 1984. Now Asia’s third-largest insurer, AIA has built a sprawling and successful business across the region, with an army of hundreds of thousands of agents. AIG was forced to spin off AIA, widely considered its crown jewel, and other assets following the bailout by the U.S. government. AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche has said little about his plans for the AIA stake. As recently as February 24, AIG said it had not decided what to do with the stake and had earlier hinted it may even increase its holding. But the company appears to have opted instead to start paying the government back and focus on other parts of its business.

With such a large sale and AIA’s free float increasing, though, the company’s weighting on benchmark indexes should rise, making the stock a target for fund managers tracking the Hang Seng and the Hang Seng Finance Index. “The issue of getting the deal through shouldn’t be a problem, plus there should be some index buying,” said the head of a large U.S.-based asset manager in Hong Kong who was not authorized to speak publicly on the AIA sale. Kenneth Yue, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CCB International Securities, said the sale looked well timed. “If you look at AIA’s new business growth last year, it went up 40 percent,” he said. “I believe they’ve gone to the peak already — it would be very challenging for them to increase their new business value going forward by 40 percent every year.” Pricing of the AIA share sale will occur no later than Tuesday, AIG said. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are the “active” joint global coordinators, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the process. Both requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Deutsche and Goldman were among the four banks that led AIA’s IPO, along with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. The sources said Citi and Morgan Stanley were taking “passive” roles in the current AIG sell-down. The distinction is important, not just for the fees that such a large offering brings, but also in the league table credit that can help a bank’s external marketing. For the AIA sell-down, the banks will get equal league table credit, but Deutsche and Goldman will take home the fatter fees, according to one of the sources. The deal should be “well distributed” among different investors, instead of large chunks going to just a handful, the source noted. Shares of AIA, headed by former Prudential Plc  executive Mark Tucker, have risen 47 percent since early October and touched a seven-month high last week. The stock closed at HK$29.20 on Friday. AIG has been on a similar run, gaining 46 percent over the same period. Its shares rose 1.2 percent to $30.16 in afternoon trading, their highest level since last May. Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday that the sale would improve AIG’s focus on its core operations and would help its credit rating profile. AIA was founded in Shanghai in 1919 by U.S. entrepreneur C.V. Starr. Twenty years later, Starr temporarily relocated to the United States to avoid political instability in Asia and, following World War II, decided to run his U.S. businesses from New York. They came to be known as AIG, whose shares began trading in New York in 1984. Now Asia’s third-largest insurer, AIA has built a sprawling and successful business across the region, with an army of hundreds of thousands of agents. AIG was forced to spin off AIA, widely considered its crown jewel, and other assets following the bailout by the U.S. government. AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche has said little about his plans for the AIA stake. As recently as Feb. 24, AIG said it had not decided what to do with the stake and had earlier hinted it may even increase its holding. But the company appears to have opted instead to start paying the government back and focus on other parts of its business.",3052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/aia-aig/update-6-aig-to-sell-6-bln-in-aia-stock-to-repay-us-bailout-idUSL4E8E50AQ20120305

AIG’s long-awaited selldown punctured a rally in AIA shares this year, which were driven up on the back of strong earnings and on expectations of a bid for ING’s Asian life insurance business. The U.S. insurer will use the proceeds to repay part of the $182 billion bailout it got in 2008 from the U.S. government at the height of the global financial crisis. AIG said it will not sell any more AIA shares until September 4. Still, analysts said AIG’s remaining stake will be seen as a potential overhang on the stock and any run-up in the price could make investors suspicious about AIG offloading its remaining 18.6 percent stake valued at about $7.7 billion. AIA shares shed 8.4 percent to HK$26.75 as trading resumed on Tuesday, compared with a 2.2 percent drop in Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng share index. Despite the fall, AIA is the best-performing stocks in the Hang Seng index over the past year, having risen about 27 percent.

The shares were initially offered in a range of HK$27.15-$27.50, a discount of up to 7 percent to AIA’s closing stock price on Friday. “The AIA stock is reacting on the back of the huge placement,” said Colin Ng, head of equities at Barings Asset Management. “It was widely known to the market that AIG will unwind its position at some point.

The department said the AIG unit — the New Hampshire Insurance Company — had insured about 370 policyholders whose mobile homes were destroyed in the fire, which spread over more than 11,000 acres in Southern California. It said an investigation by the department showed the AIG unit and its authorized agent for claims processing, York Risk Services Group Inc, were responsible for 125 violations of the California Insurance Code by having failed to diligently handle claims. Civil penalties for each violation can be assessed at up to $5,000, and rise to as much as $10,000 each if the practice was willful, the department said. The insurance department on Tuesday said it had issued an Order to Show Cause, a statement of Charges/Accusation and a notice of monetary penalty against the unit and its claims processor. It said they will have an opportunity to respond to the allegations at an administrative hearing. “The allegations in this case represent a troubling lack of attention to consumer needs by New Hampshire Insurance Company,” the agency said in a release.

259,AIG,U.S. to sell $6 billion in AIG stock,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Treasury Department said on Wednesday it will sell $6 billion worth of American International Group stock and struck another deal for the insurer to pay down $8.5 billion more in obligations, taking a major step forward in an election year to unwind the unpopular crisis-era bailout. AIG said the agreement with the government would allow it to pay down what it owed in a special purpose vehicle, AIA Aurora, and free up the company’s collateral against that, including interests in aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp and Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd. The special purpose vehicle was set up in December 2009 in exchange for a reduction in the debt that AIG owed the New York Federal Reserve at the time. The Treasury’s original interest in the vehicle was $16 billion. The stake sale is expected reduce the U.S. government’s ownership in AIG to about 70 percent from 77 percent, a source with knowledge of the situation said. Once the company repays Treasury for the special vehicle interest, the value of the government’s stake would total about $41.8 billion. The announcements come as President Barack Obama, a Democrat, fights to win a second term in office and withstands attacks from Republicans for wasting taxpayer money. “The bottom line is this: the people of AIG have achieved another significant milestone in our progress toward our goal that American taxpayers recoup their entire investment in AIG at a profit,” AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said in a statement. Earlier this week, AIG sold part of its stake in AIA to raise about $6 billion to repay the government. Following the share sale, AIG holds about 19 percent of AIA. STOCK PRICE RUN-UP AIG had to be rescued during the financial crisis of 2008 through multiple bailouts, under both the Obama and Bush administrations, with the U.S. government at one point pledging some $182 billion to keep the insurer afloat. In the last few years, Benmosche has been trying to steady the ship and selling off non-core assets to pay back the government. Last month the company reported a net profit of nearly $20 billion for the fourth quarter. While the outsized profit was a one-time event linked to a tax accounting change, underlying it was a long-term assumption that the company has stopped its multibillion dollar crisis-era losses. The share sale plan comes as AIG’s stock price has run up some 27 percent this year, possibly giving the government an opportunity to offload some of its stake without having to take a loss. For the government to break-even on its investment in AIG, it needs to sell shares at about $29. The stock closed up 1.4 percent on Wednesday at $29.45, although it fell about 1.9 percent in aftermarket trading following the announcements. The source said the shares have not been priced yet. Treasury declined to comment on the pricing. Under the latest plan, AIG intends to repurchase up to $3 billion of its stock in the Treasury’s offering once it is priced. The Treasury will also grant an option to the underwriters for the offering to purchase an additional $900 million worth of stock. The U.S. government hired Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley to coordinate the offering, choosing a different set of bankers than AIG had when it first sold stock early last year. The choice is a reversal in fortunes for the two U.S. investment banks. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley had played key roles in the insurer’s restructuring but were left out of the coveted lead bookrunner roles in the offering last year. AIG is expected to repay the $8.5 billion owed under the AIA vehicle with proceeds from several sources, the Treasury said. The company expects to pay $5.6 billion from the sale of the AIA stake. It expects to get $1.6 billion in escrowed cash proceeds from an earlier sale of its life insurance unit, American Life Insurance Co, to MetLife Inc. AIG also expects to get $1.6 billion as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sells off the last of the securities held in Maiden Lane II LLC, a vehicle that was created to buy mortgage backed securities from AIG during the financial crisis as part of its bailout.

261,AIG,Bankers bicker over credit for AIA sell-down,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group’s (AIG.N) $6 billion sale of shares in its Asian insurer AIA has ruffled feathers among investment bankers involved in the deal, with some jostling over who gets top credit for the second-largest block trade ever. As the AIA (1299.HK) deal may be among few big Asian stock deals this year, nobody wants to miss out. When AIA listed in a $20.5 billion Hong Kong IPO in 2010, the top four banks involved were Citigroup (C.N), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), but AIG picked just Deutsche and Goldman to lead the AIA stock sale, according to sources involved in the matter, with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley playing a supporting role. In term sheets sent to potential investors in the block trade, Deutsche and Goldman each stated they were the “active” joint global co-ordinator and “active” joint bookrunner, a sign to bankers and investors that other joint co-ordinators and bookrunners, including Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, had only passive roles. The distinction is important, not just for the fees that such a large offering brings, but also in the league table credit that can help a bank’s external marketing. In Asia, the distinction is rare, which is why banks quickly moved to lobby league table organizers such as Thomson Reuters, hoping to make clear their role and ensure they received proper credit, according to sources involved, who could not be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Some believed the active bookrunners should get more of the credit as they did the heavy lifting. The dispute caused such a stir that Thomson Reuters temporarily pulled the deal from its league table database until the credit issue was sorted out. In the end, all 11 joint bookrunners received equal league table credit, or points, according to the sources, while Deutsche and Goldman took home higher fees. “This is unusual in an Asian context,” said an equity capital markets (ECM) banker directly involved in the AIA deal who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. “This basically ensures consistency of message. The vendor is not looking for 11 opinions, right? They basically said, everyone channels through these two banks.” All banks mentioned declined to comment. Goldman last year unseated rival UBS UBSN.VX for the first time in seven years as top Asia Pacific equity underwriter, with Morgan Stanley third and Deutsche in fourth place. Asia Pacific stock issuance slumped 42 percent last year to a three-year low, hit by a dismal second half, and stock sales so far this year are down by more than a third at $25 billion, making banks more nervous about getting the credit for deals they take on. “Whether this year is slow or not, everybody always wants all the league table credit they can get,” said the co-head of ECM at one of the banks involved in the transaction. For AIG, which went through a massive $182 billion government bailout in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, it’s important to keep strong ties with the banks, many of which provide investment banking advice, loans, investor feedback and other financial services. This often results in big companies, and AIG is no exception, rotating responsibilities among its advisers to keep everyone happy. While Citigroup and Morgan Stanley had a less prominent role in the AIA sell-down, they and Credit Suisse CSGN.VX were picked to handle the U.S. government’s $6 billion sale of its AIG stock just a day later. One source said this was a simple case of “banker rotation”. “AIG wanted all the banks included to share the league table credit,” said another ECM banker involved in the AIA sell-down. Fees on ECM deals make up about two-thirds of investment banking revenues at most firms in Asia Pacific, according to Thomson Reuters data. The downturn in stock issuance, after a 21 percent drop in estimated ECM fees last year to $4.9 billion, means banks are fighting even harder for deals and recognition. Block deals in Asia can, on average, pay fees of about 3 percent, but the AIA sell-down was much lower because of its size and the fact that AIG is majority-owned by the U.S. Treasury, sources said. While the league tables don’t translate into revenues, they are key marketing tools for banks to take to future clients. “The reality is that we’re all driven by one main theme, revenue,” said the co-head of ECM at one of the banks involved in the AIA deal. “League table position is very, very important, but at the end of the day, we’re measured by one parameter ... revenue.” ",3092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aia-aig-banks/bankers-bicker-over-credit-for-aia-sell-down-idUSBRE82809I20120309

265,AIG,"AIG $2 bln bond deal buoyed by strong demand, Q4 earnings","NEW YORK, March 21 (IFR) - AIG, the giant US insurer that famously received a mega-government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, had to turn away investors who were clamoring to lend it money this week. Bolstered by a series of multi-billion dollar equity initiatives in recent weeks, AIG attracted more than $3.5 billion of demand for a $2 billion offering of three- and five-year notes — even though it did not offer anything in the way of a pickup over its secondary spreads to entice investors. The price paid also demonstrated how far the insurer has come in the past few months. The 245 basis point spread over Treasuries on its $750 million of 3.00% three-year notes, and a 265 basis point launch spread on its $1.25 billion of 3.8% five-year bonds, are almost half what the issuer’s spread levels were at the beginning of the year. And if that were not enough evidence that things have changed, its new three- and five-year notes tightened in spread the next day in a softer market in which other new bond issues came under pressure. “I am more constructive on AIG following their fourth-quarter results,” said David Knutson, a senior bank analyst at Legal & General Investment Management in the US, who said AIG was among a select group of new issues that looked attractive in recent weeks. The success of the bond deal follows moves earlier this month to sell the majority of its stake in Asian insurer AIA for HK$46.7 billion (US$6bn), and last week’s $6 billion secondary sale of AIG shares by the US government, $3 billion of which AIG bought back. That is good news for bond holders because it demonstrates AIG’s intention to eventually prise itself away from the US government which rescued it with an $182 billion bailout in 2008. The US Treasury still holds 1.25 billion AIG shares or 69.5% of the company, worth about $35.8 billion. Even though the public equity injection doesn’t cost AIG anything more than private equity holders’ stakes, it’s in AIG’s interest to become a fully private-sector firm again “because there are always concerns in an investor’s mind that it’s not as flexible with regard to business initiatives while the government has a large stake,” said Knutson. While some other borrowers, such as Rio Tinto, were barely able to tighten in pricing from announcement to launch on the same day AIG launched its deal, the insurer was able to ratchet in spreads by as much as 20bp from initial price talk. The 245bp pricing on the three-year, for instance, compared with initial price thoughts of 260-265bp, while the five-year was priced 10bp tighter than original unofficial talk of 275bp. Despite the tight pricing, and the fact that AIG five-year spreads have tightened as much as 250bp so far this year, the new three- and five-year bonds continued to be bid up in the aftermarket. A day after pricing, the new five-year was quoted at 262bp bid, 257bp offered from pricing of 265bp, and the three-year was quoted at 235bp/230bp from pricing of 245bp. AIG recorded a solid performance from its core property and casualty business in the fourth quarter of 2011, reporting a US$1.3 billion pre-tax operating income from insurance operations.

271,AIG,AIG CEO: Taxpayers will profit on bailout,"(Reuters) - AIG (AIG.N) expects American taxpayers to end up with a profit of $5 billion to $10 billion on the company’s 2008 rescue when all is said and done, the chief executive of the bailed-out insurer said on Monday.

274,AIG,Analysis: How AIG will - or won't - generate a bailout profit,"BOSTON (Reuters) - CEO Bob Benmosche says U.S. taxpayers will earn up to $10 billion on the $182 billion rescue of American International Group (AIG.N), the insurance company he runs. Of course, that depends on how one defines “profit.” How much AIG actually borrowed after it was saved from bankruptcy in late 2008, how much it still owes and questions about the point at which the U.S. Treasury breaks even on its shares all complicate any calculation about how much the government will make on the insurer’s bailout. It even is possible, under some (disputed) scenarios, that all of the profits go to the Federal Reserve and the losses go to the U.S. Treasury, netting a gain for the government as a whole. Either way, though, even critics of the way the bailout has been handled concede something is better than nothing. “Now is that a great return relative to other investments in the stock market? Not really,” said Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, who has calculated the returns from the bailout. “We’ll take breaking even after a huge holding period, rather than a huge loss.” Benmosche, in an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer Monday night, was adamant AIG would repay its bailout in full and that between all the branches of government that participated, a profit of $5 billion to $10 billion would result. That is a far cry from two years ago, when the Congressional Budget Office estimated the government would lose $36 billion on the rescue. But where the government’s cost ends and the taxpayers’ profit begins is sort of an open question. A chart on AIG’s website walks through the bailout step by step - $182.3 billion in total funds authorized, to be exact, less $20.9 billion that was never used or expired before it could be used. In other words, an actual draw of $161.4 billion. Various sums have been repaid since in a variety of ways, mostly through asset sales. AIG says all of those repayments were on their own profitable, after factoring in interest and the dividends that were paid on the various credit facilities and preferred shares. With those repayments done, some $44.7 billion is left to be recovered, according to AIG — $35.7 billion worth of common stock and about $9 billion in a Federal Reserve vehicle known as Maiden Lane III. This, however, is where it gets even more complicated than usual. The Fed created the legal entity called Maiden Lane III and lent it money, which the entity then used to buy collateralized debt obligations from AIG’s counterparties. That relief let AIG terminate insurance contracts against the CDOs, easing its liquidity burdens. Maiden Lane III is “non-recourse” to AIG, though; AIG is not obliged to make the Fed whole on its loans under any circumstance. As it stands, that is not an issue, as the portfolio’s holdings are worth nearly twice the loan balance. In addition to Maiden Lane III, there was also Maiden Lane II, a Fed vehicle to relieve AIG of $20.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The last of its holdings were sold off recently, for a net gain to the New York Fed of $2.85 billion. Combine that with the paper profit the Fed is looking at on Maiden Lane III as of today and you get a return of $11.3 billion — a tidy sum, particularly since the early 2011 deal to recapitalize AIG was intended, in part, to buy out the central bank’s portion of the rescue. But leaving aside the Maiden Lane entities, there is still a fierce debate about the common stock. The U.S. Treasury still holds a 70 percent stake in AIG, or 1,248,141,410 shares. As of Monday’s close that was worth $36.27 billion, for a profit to the Treasury of $570 million, give or take. That assumes, though, that the Treasury’s break-even point on the stock is $28.73 per share. That is what the Treasury says on its website, factoring in all the money that was disbursed in exchange for shares and the total number of shares the Treasury ended up holding. However, the former inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program disagrees, forcefully. In Neil Barofsky’s view, there are two sets of shares: those the Treasury got in exchange for its TARP bailout funds, and those new shares the Treasury got in early 2011 when AIG was recapitalized. The government says the TARP cost basis was $43.53, and to Barofsky, that means the TARP program is losing money when the Treasury sells AIG stock at $29, as it has done twice in the last 10 months. (Were the Treasury to sell all 1.1 billion of the original TARP shares for $29, it would in theory lose about $16 billion on that investment.) “My complaint with Treasury is when they put out their break-even number for the sale of common shares, instead of using 1.1 billion as the denominator they used 1.6 billion and described that as the Treasury investment,” Barofsky said in an interview. “I’m not critical of the notion that the taxpayer may break even on the AIG bailout, my problem is the transparency issue,” he said, adding: “I hope Benmosche is 100 percent right.” The Treasury, to put it mildly, disagrees with Barofsky’s assessment of the math. To the government, the TARP math is irrelevant, since the new shares from the recapitalization had zero cost, and therefore lowered the Treasury’s cost basis in the stock dramatically to the $28.73 figure. “In the dark days of the financial crisis, when commitments to AIG totaled $182 billion, few would have believed that we’d already be able to reduce that amount by more than 75 percent, or that we may be able to recover every single dollar invested in the company,” Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad said in a statement last week. The ultimate answer, though, may come from the investment banker who led much of AIG’s rescue — Jim Millstein, the former chief restructuring officer of the U.S. Treasury and now chairman of his own firm, Millstein & Co. “He’s just nitpicking and he’s missing the bigger point,” Millstein said of Barofsky. “The bigger point is that the federal government actually did something important and effective and it was controversial and people have a lot of ambivalence about it, but had the government not done it - over two administrations - effectively we’d be in a much worse position than we are today.” ",3282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aig/analysis-how-aig-will-or-wont-generate-a-bailout-profit-idUSBRE82R07Q20120328

278,AIG,Fed mulls Maiden Lane III asset sales,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is considering possible sales of assets from its Maiden Lane III portfolio, which was created during the bailout of insurer American International Group (AIG) (AIG.N), a New York Federal Reserve spokesman said on Wednesday. Maiden Lane III grew out of the purchase of $29.3 billion in collateralized debt obligations from certain counterparties to an AIG unit. Back in February, the Fed completed the sale of all the remaining securities from its Maiden Lane II portfolio, which had $20.5 billion worth of risky mortgage bonds owned by several AIG insurance subsidiaries. “The change in the investment objective for ML III reflects a strategic decision to explore possible sales of some of the assets in the portfolio in light of improving market conditions and the success of the ML II sales. The Fed will only transact if it deems that a particular transaction represents good value, is done competitively and is not market disruptive,” a Fed spokesman said in a statement. It is unclear on the timeline when the sales will occur and the way the securities will be sold. “They are looking carefully to extricate themselves from these assets in an orderly fashion without disrupting the market,” said Richard DeKaser, an economist with The Parthenon Group in Boston. “This has always been a short-term stop-gap, not a long-term solution.” The New York Fed held three auctions to sell the assets from Maiden Lane II earlier this year. Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX bought roughly $13 billion worth of the Maiden II bonds, while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) purchased about $6.2 billion. AIG has $5 billion of equity in the portfolio, which is accruing interest, and the company is also entitled to a third of the profits after the Fed’s loan that funded Maiden Lane III is repaid. As of last week, the fair value of the remaining portfolio was $17.46 billion and the outstanding principal and interest owed to the Fed was about $9 billion. The sharp rise in AIG’s shares will benefit the U.S. Treasury Department, which still holds 70 percent of AIG’s common stock after two share sales in May 2011 and March 2012. AIG shares were up 1.9 percent late Wednesday afternoon at $32.80 after touching $32.99, the highest since mid-April 2011.

It is unclear on the timeline when the sales will occur and the way the securities will be sold. “They are looking carefully to extricate themselves from these assets in an orderly fashion without disrupting the market,” said Richard DeKaser, an economist with The Parthenon Group in Boston. “This has always been a short-term stop-gap, not a long-term solution.” The New York Fed held three auctions to sell the assets from Maiden Lane II earlier this year. Credit Suisse Group AG  bought roughly $13 billion worth of the Maiden II bonds, while Goldman Sachs purchased about $6.2 billion. AIG has $5 billion of equity in the portfolio, which is accruing interest, and the company is also entitled to a third of the profits after the Fed’s loan that funded Maiden Lane III is repaid. As of last week, the fair value of the remaining portfolio was $17.46 billion and the outstanding principal and interest owed to the Fed was about $9 billion. The sharp rise in AIG’s shares will benefit the U.S. Treasury Department, which still holds 70 percent of AIG’s common stock after two share sales in May 2011 and March 2012.

280,AIG,"AIG rallies to fresh high on ILFC report, Fed move","(Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N) shares rose nearly 7 percent to a one-year high on Wednesday on news that it could reap billions of dollars from asset sales in the near future. At $32.99, the highest level since mid-April 2011, the stock was up nearly 42 percent for the year, nearly four times the gains of the sector index .GSPINSC. The rally came even as broader markets fell on Wednesday. CNBC reported early Wednesday that AIG could launch the long-awaited initial public offering of its aircraft leasing business ILFC Holdings ILFC.N in the second quarter. While the stake to be sold was not clear, the offering would value ILFC at up to $8 billion, CNBC said. Both AIG and ILFC declined to comment. On Wednesday afternoon the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it was considering possible asset sales from its Maiden Lane III portfolio, which was created during the bailout of AIG to buy collateralized debt obligations from certain counterparties. AIG has $5 billion of equity in the portfolio, which is accruing interest, and the company is also entitled to one-third of the profits after the Fed’s loan that funded Maiden Lane III is repaid.

281,AIG,U.S. Fed mulls Maiden Lane III asset sales,"NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering possible sales of assets from its Maiden Lane III portfolio, which was created during the bailout of insurer American International Group (AIG), a New York Federal Reserve spokesman said on Wednesday. Maiden Lane III grew out of the purchase of $29.3 billion in collateralized debt obligations from certain counterparties to an AIG unit. Back in February, the Fed completed the sale of all the remaining securities from its Maiden Lane II portfolio, which had $20.5 billion worth of mortgage-backed bonds owned by several AIG insurance subsidiaries. “The change in the investment objective for ML III reflects a strategic decision to explore possible sales of some of the assets in the portfolio in light of improving market conditions and the success of the ML II sales.

282,AIG,Fairholme's Berkowitz has big recovery in first quarter,"BOSTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Many of 2011’s trailing money managers bounced back in the first quarter thanks to the stock market’s big rally. But few came back quite as strongly as Fairholme Fund’s Bruce Berkowitz, who is already within sight of recovering all of last year’s loss. In 2011, just a year after being named Morningstar’s stock fund manager of the decade, Berkowitz turned in a horrible performance, as big bets on financial stocks like American International Group and Bank of America cratered and his fund lost 32 percent, even worse than its 2008 decline of 30 percent. But the Fairholme Fund jumped 31 percent in the first quarter of 2012, outperforming the Standard & Poor’s 500 by almost 19 percentage points and the average return of similar funds by over 20 points, according to Morningstar data. And that gave the fund’s ranking a bizarre twist. After turning in the worst 2011 performance of any large cap value fund tracked by Morningstar, the research firm’s 100th percentile rank, Fairholme ranked first for all such funds in the first quarter, Morningstar’s 1st percentile. Berkowitz’s style of investing large amounts in a few positions or sectors has always made the fund potentially more volatile, Morningstar analyst Kevin McDevitt said. “It’s almost surprising he didn’t have a year like 2011 sooner,” McDevitt said. “But he showed the conviction to stick with his positions and it has really paid off so far this year.” The Fairholme Fund’s net asset value share price, which ended the year at $23.15, hit $30.36 on March 30. Berkowitz still needs to regain another $3.90, or 13 percent, to get back to $34.26, the price where the shares ended 2010 adjusted for dividend payments. The percentage gain represented a lot fewer actual dollars this year. In addition to the big loss, investors yanked $6.6 billion out in 2011, according to data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. That has left Berkowitz with $8 billion instead of the $20 billion he had a year ago. Unlike many of his peers who stumbled, however, Berkowitz went into 2012 not just with many of the same holdings but concentrated even further and doubled down on several. Shares of bailed-out insurance giant AIG made up 26 percent of the entire fund at the end of November, Fairholme’s most recent disclosure, almost three times the allocation of a year earlier. AIG, up more than 30 percent in the first quarter, gained another 2 percent on Wednesday on news it may do a public offering for its International Lease Finance Corp subsidiary. The weighting of Fairholme Fund’s second-largest holding, former AIG Asian subsidiary AIA Group, more than doubled to 11 percent. Aside from 9 percent in cash and 11 percent in retailer Sears Holdings, virtually all of the remainder of the fund is in financial companies of one sort or another, ranging from insurers like AIG to real estate investment trusts like the St. Joe Co. Berkowitz declined to comment for this story but has spoken in public several times in recent months explaining his strategy. The operating performance of financial companies the fund owned improved last year even as their stock prices dropped further, he noted. Investors ignored strong earnings growth potential because of “fixable problems,” he said, according to the transcript of a conference call with investors held on Feb. 8. “I’ve seen this play before. I’ve seen the cycle of financials,” Berkowitz, 53, said. “That’s the one good thing about old age, you’ve seen it before and you know how it plays out.” St. Joe, where Berkowitz stepped in as chairman last March, has been another loser turned winner. Last year, the stock plummeted 33 percent as short sellers, including hedge fund manager David Einhorn, continued to press their critique of the Florida REIT’s asset value and strategy. But the stock got a huge bump last month after Berkowitz said he would bring in new management. The shares are up 22 percent so far in 2012. To be sure, the first quarter was a good one for stock fund managers, as 57 percent of actively managed stock funds beat the Russell 1000 index, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report. Value-oriented managers did even better, as 72 percent beat their benchmark. Berkowitz far outdistanced the average value fund’s outperformance of just under 1 percentage point. Some other well-known managers who stumbled in 2011 have not recovered as much as Berkowitz. Ken Heebner’s CGM Focus Fund , which lost 26 percent last year, was up 16 percent in the first quarter.  And the Janus Overseas Fund  managed by Brent Lynn gained 20 percent after a 33 percent loss last year.",4042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-fairholme/fairholmes-berkowitz-has-big-recovery-in-first-quarter-idUSL2E8F45F920120404
283,AIG,UPDATE 2-AIG may take ILFC public in 2nd qtr - CNBC,"* Potential valuation of $6 bln-$8 bln - CNBC * Company filed to go public last September * Peers’ shares down so far in 2012 April 4 (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer AIG is considering launching the initial public offering of airplane leasing business International Lease Finance in the second quarter, CNBC reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the deal. The IPO would potentially value ILFC Holdings at $6 billion to $8 billion, the network said. An American International Group Inc spokesman declined comment. ILFC was not immediately available to comment. AIG shares were up 1.7 percent in late morning trading, even as broader markets were sharply lower. The stock is up about 35 percent this year, more than tripling the gains of the broader S&P; insurance index. The lower end of that valuation range would be a surprise, though. AIG Chief Executive Bob Benmosche has repeatedly said the business is worth at least $8 billion. The lower end of the range also implies that ILFC is worth less than smaller rival RBS Aviation, which was sold in a $7.3 billion deal in January. ILFC first filed for an IPO last September. As recently as mid-February, AIG said it was biding its time on taking the company public, waiting for market conditions to improve. ILFC had been pledged as collateral for the U.S. Treasury’s preferred interest in other AIG assets, but AIG recently paid off those interests. The unit reported a profit in the fourth quarter, following a $1.5 billion impairment charge in the third quarter for the declining value of older and less fuel-efficient planes. If ILFC does go public, it would join smaller peers Air Lease and AerCap on the market. Air Lease is down about 1.9 percent this year and AerCap is down around 2.4 percent on the year.",4042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-ilfc/update-2-aig-may-take-ilfc-public-in-2nd-qtr-cnbc-idUSL2E8F43AF20120404

285,AIG,"UPDATE 3-US freezes pay for CEOs at Ally Financial, GM, AIG","* Big bailout recipients face pay restrictions * CEO pay a lingering target of taxpayer anger * Treasury still recovering bailout money WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - The chief executives of General Motors, AIG,  and Ally Financial  had their 2012 compensation packages frozen for a second year in a row by the U.S. Treasury Department after they got “exceptional” bailout help during the financial crisis. The Treasury said on Friday that all three were making progress at repaying the taxpayer funds given to them to keep them from collapsing during the 2007-2009 financial crisis but their pay practices remain under scrutiny of a “special master” until they do pay it back. The top executives get a mix of cash, stock and stock options that together make up their overall pay packets. “Although there has been some modification in the mix of stock, salary and long-term restricted stock for the CEO group, the overall amount of CEO compensation is frozen at 2011 levels,” Treasury said. The government pumped $68 billion into AIG from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and invested $50 billion in GM and $17 billion in Ally Financial to save them from collapse during the 2007-2009 crisis. The Treasury also said total direct compensation during 2012 for 69 other senior executives at the three firms was being cut by 10 percent from 2011 levels. The three were part of group of seven firms that got so-called exceptional assistance in the form of taxpayer-financed bailouts during the financial crisis. Four of the original seven — Bank of America, Citigroup, Chrysler Financial and Chrysler — have already repaid their TARP money and left the program. Public anger over high pay and huge bonuses at bailed-out firms was so high that the Obama administration created a “special master’s office” to monitor pay practices. The Treasury report on Friday does not name any of the executives but it is evident the three CEOs still will get pay  that puts them among the elite of American income earners. The top executive at AIG will receive total direct compensation, which includes cash, stock and future stock options worth $10.5 million, while Ally Financial’s leader will get $9.5 million and GM’s chief executive $9 million, according to documents distributed by the Treasury. The chief executive officer of AIG is Robert Benmosche, GM’s CEO is Daniel Akerson and Ally Financial’s is Michael Carpenter, although their names do not appear in any of the documents that Treasury released. A spokesperson for Ally Financial said its executive pay “continues to be in line with the stated guidelines for TARP companies” and said its management team was focused on repaying the remaining TARP funds to Treasury. The other 69 executives are among the three firms’ senior executive officers as well as the most highly compensated employees who work under them. The Treasury said the three firms are making progress in repaying their taxpayer funds. It said AIG has reduced its obligations to the U.S. government by more than 75 percent, while Treasury has recovered nearly half the TARP funds it put into GM and close to one-third of the money that went to Ally Financial.",4062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-treasury-pay/update-3-us-freezes-pay-for-ceos-at-ally-financial-gm-aig-idUSL2E8F62Q120120406
286,AIG,Wells Fargo upgrades AIG on likely bailout exit,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) will likely become independent from the U.S. government over the next year, Wells Fargo Securities said, upgrading the shares of the bailed-out insurer to “outperform.” Since AIG restructured its relationship with the U.S. government over a year ago, the company has made “tremendous progress” in reducing its government ties, Wells Fargo analyst John Hall wrote in a note to clients. AIG had to be rescued during the financial crisis of 2008 through multiple bailouts, with the U.S. government at one point pledging $182 billion to keep the insurer afloat. In the last few years it has been selling off non-core assets to pay back the government. In March alone, the Treasury recovered more than $14.6 billion on its investment in AIG, including $6 billion from its sale of the insurer’s stock. AIG still owes taxpayers an estimated $45 billion for the bailout it received during the financial crisis. The government still holds a 70 percent stake in the company. AIG now has only one remaining tie to the government apart from the 70 percent interest it holds in the company - a $9 billion interest in the SPV Maiden Lane III, analyst Hall said. Wells Fargo expects the Maiden Lane III portfolio, created during AIG’s bailout, to continue to wind down. It also expects the government’s stake to be reduced through a combination of secondary offerings and sales to sovereign investors as well as share repurchase. In March, AIG sold part of its stock in AIA Group (1299.HK) to repay part of its bailout. It is also considering launching the initial public offering of its aircraft leasing business ILFC in the second quarter. Proceeds from the sales of ILFC, its remaining holdings in AIA, and the retained interest in ML III can help AIG buy back $21.3 billion of its shares, Hall said. “(Once independent from the government), we expect AIG to become an increasingly active capital manager, which could be accretive to its earnings per share and return on equity,” Hall said. According to Thomson Reuters’ Starmine data, John Hall is a three-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on AIG. Wells Fargo raised its earnings per share estimate for the insurer for 2012 and 2013 to $3.38 and $3.06 respectively. AIG’s shares, which have gained more than half of their value since they touched a year low in October, closed at $31.99 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

289,AIG,REFILE-UPDATE 1-Fed solicits banks to buy risky securities,"By Karen Brettell and Richard Leong NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it has asked eight investment banks to bid on risky assets from its Maiden Lane III portfolio, which was created during its 2008 bailout of insurer American International Group (AIG). This move would trim the U.S. central bank’s balance sheet which about tripled from the emergency measures it has enacted to help the banking system and the economy since the global credit crunch. It also signals some confidence that collateralized debt obligations, a once-fledgling asset class because of its tie to the U.S. mortgage market, might have finally stabilized after they were battered since the housing meltdown. Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch broker, Morgan Stanley  and Nomura have been invited to submit bids for the assets, “based on the strength of their expressions of interest” in the bonds, the Fed said in a statement on its Web site. The New York Fed said it opened up the bidding for these CDOs “in response to several reverse inquiries.” BlackRock Solutions, the investment manager for the Maiden Lane portfolio, will conduct a bid process for these CDOs, with all bids due on April 26, though there is no fixed timetable for any sales, the Fed said. The value of the MAX CDOs, originally arranged by Deutsche Bank, in the Maiden Lane III portfolio are based on pools of commercial mortgage-backed securities. Their tranches carry junk ratings from Standard & Poor’s. AIG’s has a $5 billion interest in Maiden Lane III The Fed said it will decide whether to sell the assets based on the strength of the best bid, adding that it will proceed with the sales only if this “represents good value for the public.” Maiden Lane III grew out of the purchase of $29.3 billion in collateralized debt obligations from certain counterparties to an AIG unit. It was a key part of the $182 billion rescue of the insurance company. AIG put $5 billion of equity in the portfolio, which is accruing interest, and the company is also entitled to a third of the profits after the Fed’s loan that funded Maiden Lane III is repaid. The insurer expected an increase in the value of its stake in Maiden Lane III by about $685 million if the New York Fed liquidates the portfolio at its estimated fair value, according to AIG’s 2011 10-K filing. The fair value of the remaining portfolio was around $17.59 billion as of last week. The New York Fed added that it will seek to make any sales without disrupting the market, after some analysts blamed the sale of securities from Maiden Lane II last year for a dramatic selloff and widening in spreads across securitized products. It suspended sales from Maiden Lane II when demand started to fall off and they created a glut in the market. Since then, improved market sentiment and a dearth of high yielding assets is likely to aid demand for these riskier bonds, analysts said. “The market sentiment is pretty positive at this point. Given this low interest rate environment, people are chasing yields right now,” said David Yan, head of CDO/CLO research at Credit Suisse in New York. The New York Fed said it will provide details on prices paid for the assets after it sells its last position. The group of dealers invited to bid on the Maiden Lane III assets is larger than those for Maiden Lane II, when five firms were asked to provide bids. These were Barclays, Credit Suisse, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and RBS Securities. The Fed has been criticized for limiting the pool of bidders and requiring large bulk purchases, which critics say limits price competition and benefits dealers to the detriment of the public interest. “It basically guarantees lower proceeds and plays into the hands of the big dealer, because they are the only ones that have the capital to take down a larger trade,” said Adam Murphy, president of Empirasign Strategies in New York, which tracks trading in securitized debt. The New York Fed held three auctions in February to sell the $20.5 billion in risky assets from Maiden Lane II. Credit Suisse Group AG bought roughly $13 billion worth of the Maiden II bonds, while Goldman Sachs purchased about $6.2 billion. Credit Suisse also bought the first tranche of Maiden Lane bonds in January with a face value of $7 billion.",4182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/fed-maidenlane-sale/refile-update-1-fed-solicits-banks-to-buy-risky-securities-idUSL2E8FI96Y20120418

292,AIG,"Barclays, Deutsche Bank eye big payday in Maiden Lane III","April 19 (IFR) - With the New York Fed now soliciting bids for Maiden Lane III, a portion of the assets it acquired when bailing out insurance giant AIG in 2008, many say the likely buyers will be Barclays or Deutsche Bank. The Fed this week invited eight broker-dealers to bid on the risky securities - two collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that are backed by commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). But market participants say Barclays and Deutsche Bank are the two obvious candidates to take on the highly complex bonds, which helped bankrupt AIG during the financial crisis. “We don’t see how anyone other than those two can or should be involved without putting themselves at considerable risk or giving up the ability to call the deal,” said one CMBS trader. “I think it is a really hard trade for anyone but Barclays or Deutsche Bank to trade due to the $7.5bn size,” he said. The Fed said it had invited Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Nomura to bid “based on the strength of their expressions of interest” in the bonds. Bids are due by April 26, though there is no timetable for the sale. Barclays and Deutsche Bank both declined to comment. The deal carries significant risks above and beyond the sheer size of the trade or the creditworthiness of the mortgages underlying the CDOs. Last year, when the Fed sold off similar bonds from AIG that were based on residential mortgages, under Maiden Lane II, the sudden burst of supply wreaked havoc on the market. It is not yet known how the securities will trade — as large swathes of CDO exposure or as smaller and far more numerous CMBS, which hold more value in today’s market. But that determination will have significant implications for trading prices in the secondary bond market. “Unwinding a CDO position is a fairly complex process,” said Darrell Wheeler, the head of CMBS strategy at Amherst Securities. Still, the Fed’s solicitation of bids is encouraging, market participants say. “The fact that eight dealers showed interest is pretty remarkable,” said another trader. “That’s more than any that participated in the Maiden Lane II lists, and says a lot about the interest out there for this product.” But securitization specialists say Barclays and Deutsche already have a vested interest in Maiden Lane III, which grew out of the purchase of $29.3 billion in CDOs from counterparties to a unit of AIG. Deutsche Bank, which underwrote the two CDOs now on offer from the Fed when they were created in 2007 and 2008, already owns the subordinate tranches of debt and the equity behind them — and holds the call option on the bonds. Experts say there are “control rights” on the original CDOs, which require consent from 66% of noteholders in order to liquidate them into their CMBS components. Given that Deutsche Bank holds the subordinate pieces, if it were now to acquire the senior-most portion of the CDOs as well, it would have the power to do just that — for a price. Even if a different bank wins the CDOs, it would have to go through Deutsche Bank in order to dismantle them and access the underlying CMBS. Either way, the German bank would then be able to profit handsomely from the whole trading process, securitization specialists said. If the winner of the CDOs does not pay Deutsche Bank, it might not be able to collapse them into the CMBS, which are the ultimate target of investor interest due to a recent rally in prices. “[There is the risk] that you may end up owning the CDO and not the underlying,” the first trader said. Meanwhile Barclays is counterparty to a specialized type of derivative, known as a balance-guaranteed swap, that is tied to the CDOs. That means Barclays is on one side of the contract and the CDOs themselves — now owned by BlackRock Solutions, in its role as investment advisor for the New York Fed — are on the other. The unwinding of the swap is another prerequisite for collapsing the CDOs into their CMBS parts. The CMBS bonds underpinning the complex structures could fetch higher values on the market than if the CDOs were sold in their current form. Balance-guaranteed swaps are typically added to a fixed-rate transaction to create floating-rate payments. Securitization specialists say that Barclays has been receiving a fixed-rate coupon and paying out a Libor-linked floating-rate amount to the CDO. This has been an attractive arrangement, since interest rates have been so low. Moreover, market sources say, Barclays has already paid a cost to hedge their swap position. Therefore, even if a bank other than Barclays or Deutsche wins the auction, they will have to pay Barclays off to unwind their position. The bottom line: Even if others get their hands on this sliver of Maiden Lane III, dealers interested in buying the underlying CMBS will have to go through the two banks to make it happen, sources said.

American International Group has sued the co-founder and former chief executive of its aircraft-leasing unit, accusing him and other former employees of stealing several thousand electronic files of confidential information. “We are focused on our business serving our customers and working with the airlines and ordering more airplanes,” Udvar-Hazy told Reuters in his first reaction to the suit. “We are focusuing on what we do best and I am not distracted by this.” Udvar-Hazy, widely credited with founding the aircraft leasing industry, co-founded AIG’s International Lease Finance Corp unit in 1973 and resigned to run Air Lease Corp in February 2010. ALC said on Tuesday that AIG’s lawsuit was baseless. Speaking on the sidelines of the AFCA aircraft financing conference in Barcelona on Wednesday, Udvar-Hazy also told Reuters Air Lease was close to finalizing a $4 billion order at list prices to buy aircraft from Europe’s Airbus. Air Lease has a pending provisional order for 36 of the planemaker’s revamped A320neo-family aircraft and has made plans to close an order for a further 16 such jets in January 2013. “We have done all the work with Airbus and it is going to our board on May 10,” Udvar-Hazy told Reuters.

294,AIG,Judge denies AIG motion in BofA $8.5 billion settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge on Tuesday rejected an effort by American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and other objectors to Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) proposed $8.5 billion mortgage bond settlement to convert the case to a proceeding that may have widened its scope. New York state Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick, who must decide whether to approve the settlement, denied the motion by AIG and other groups of investors to turn the limited proceeding known as an Article 77 into a broader inquiry known as a plenary action. Kapnick said at a hearing on Tuesday that she could accomplish what was necessary under Article 77. “I really think I have a lot of discretion,” she said. An Article 77 is a special proceeding, limited in scope, that generally is used in run-of-the-mill trust matters. Objectors to the settlement wanted to transform the case into a plenary action for a full hearing. The settlement would resolve claims from investors in mortgage bonds issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which was purchased in 2008 by Bank of America. BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), MetLife Inc (MET.N) and Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co are among 22 institutional investors who agreed to the accord. Other investors have complained the payout is too low. In a statement, AIG said it intervened “to ensure that it and other investors have adequate information to assess Bank of America’s settlement.” AIG said it looked forward “to the opportunity to examine the facts and to assess whether Bank of New York has endorsed a deal that unreasonably benefits Bank of America or whether it appropriately compensates investors who were harmed by Countrywide.” Kathy Patrick, an attorney for the institutional investors, viewed the judge’s decision as a positive step. “She confirmed the trustee was entitled to proceed under Article 77, which is a summary, expedited form of proceeding,” Patrick said after the hearing. John Moon, an attorney for entities known as Triaxx, which hold unpaid principal of over $2 billion in notes, was not dissuaded by the judge’s decision to reject the motion he joined in bringing. “Whether it’s an Article 77 or a plenary action,” said Moon, “I view it as winning the battle because the judge implied there would be adequate disclosure of the facts surrounding the settlement.” Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), declined comment. The judge asked the parties to work out proposals for providing documents. Objectors to the proposed settlement want wide discovery, while the trustee wants less. “Everybody’s going to get part of what they want,” Kapnick said. Kapnick also heard arguments on whether to allow the attorneys general of New York and Delaware to intervene in the case. She made no decision on that. AIG, which has said Bank of America is “drastically underpaying,” is one of two big objectors to the settlement. Baupost Group, a Boston-based hedge fund run by Seth Klarman, operating under the name Walnut Place LLC, is the other.

296,AIG,AIG says ex-air lease chief Hazy stole trade secrets,"April 24 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc  has sued the co-founder and former chief executive of its aircraft-leasing unit, Steven Udvar-Hazy, accusing him and other former employees of stealing several thousand electronic files containing trade secrets. The civil lawsuit by AIG, the insurer bailed out by the U.S. government in the 2008 financial crisis, was filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles on Tuesday. It says Air Lease Corp ‘s Hazy initiated the “theft of a business.” Hazy, widely credited with founding the aircraft leasing industry, co-founded AIG’s International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) unit in 1973 and resigned to run Air Lease Corp (ALC) in February 2010, which he also started before leaving ILFC. The lawsuit said Hazy and other former ILFC executives downloaded its files and “loaded en masse onto ALC’s servers” confidential information. In a statement, ALC said it would fight the lawsuit. “Unable to compete effectively and perceiving Air Lease as a growing threat, AIG/ILFC has now resorted to a baseless trade	 secrets lawsuit that Air Lease will vigorously contest and defeat,” the statement said. Hazy took Air Lease public last week, raising more than $800 million. AIG has repeatedly signaled it may sell ILFC, but nobody so far has offered to pay what the insurer thinks it is worth. The now-public ALC could help value ILFC. The lawsuit said AIG, which is 70 percent owned by the U.S. government, is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars or more from Air Lease Corp. The complaint described how Hazy tried to buy all or part of the ILFC business, but when he did not succeed he left to start a new aircraft leasing company to compete with ILFC. It said he worked with ILFC executives to divert deals to the new company and then they resigned. The lawsuit also said there were 30 people involved besides Hazy. “Before resigning their employment, these former ILFC executives engaged in massive downloading and theft of ILFC’s confidential trade secret information (several thousand electronic files),” the complaint said. “These files were then loaded onto ALC’s servers. Forensic analysis shows further that many of these files became the blue print for customer communications, contracts, pricing, marketing and other strategies upon which ALC built its business.” In a statement, AIG said it regretted having to file the lawsuit “but the defendants’ misconduct left us no choice but to go to court to protect our rights and the rights of our shareholders, including our largest shareholder, the American taxpayer.” The case is American International Group Inc v Air Lease Corporation in the California State Superior Court, Los Angeles County No. 483370",4252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-airlease-lawsuit/aig-says-ex-air-lease-chief-hazy-stole-trade-secrets-idUSL2E8FP03K20120425
297,AIG,"UPDATE 1-Barclays, Deutsche Bank win auction of toxic AIG assets","By Adam Tempkin and Karen Brettell April 26 (IFR/Reuters) - Barclays and Deutsche Bank on Thursday won a fierce bidding war for a portfolio of toxic assets the US government acquired in the 2008 bailout of insurance giant AIG. The Federal Reserve announced it had selected the two banks to buy two vast collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), consisting of bundles of commercial mortgage bonds, which have a face value of $7.5 billion. The CDOs helped bring down AIG, which needed a massive federal bailout, and were not long ago seen as the kind of toxic re-packaged real-estate assets that spurred the financial crisis. But with interest rates at current lows, even the worst of the mortgage bonds underlying the CDOs are now much more attractive investments — just one reason that nearly every major Wall Street bank entered the auction. Barclays and Deutsche Bank beat out two rival consortia, one comprised of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Nomura, and the other grouping Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. The Fed did not disclose how much the winners would pay, although the assets were widely estimated to fetch around 60 cents on the dollar. The banks likely bid greater than 65.6 cents on the dollar, suggesting that the winner paid full market value for their bonds, according to a research article published on Thursday afternoon by CMBS strategists at Amherst Securities. The analysts also reported that Deutsche Bank and Barclays were able to pre-place all of the underlying CMBS bonds. “I am pleased with the level of interest and the results of this process, especially with the strength of the winning bid,” said William Dudley, president of the New York Fed. All the groups of banks were actively soliciting their own bids from investor-clients before Thursday’s auction, indicating the CDOs are likely to be quickly re-sold - perhaps broken down into their constituent mortgage bonds or even re-packaged as AAA-rated securities. Analysts who track AIG for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co said in a report earlier this month that the winning bidders would be able to realize a profit from breaking apart the CDOs and re-selling the separate pieces “in classic Wall Street fashion”. But not all investors have been impressed by the real value of the assets, however they may be re-sliced and diced, as nearly half those underlying mortgage bonds are junk-rated. “I probably would shed few tears for the type of investors inclined to get involved here,” said Chris Sullivan, chief investment officer of the United Nations Federal Credit Union. “They’re big boys and girls who probably feel quite confident arriving at independent valuations of these structures,” he said. The Fed selected Barclays and Deutsche Bank just hours after bidding closed on the CDOs, part of a vast portfolio of former AIG assets known as Maiden Lane III. Thursday’s sale is the latest move by the US government to unwind holdings it acquired in a slew of bailouts it undertook with taxpayer dollars during the depths of the financial crisis. “This successful sale marks another important milestone in the wind-down of our crisis-era intervention,” the New York Fed’s Dudley said. AIG, then the world’s largest insurer, was just minutes from bankruptcy — it had no money to pay out credit default swaps it owed on these very same CDOs — when the government stepped in to save the company in September 2008. Maiden Lane III eased some of AIG’s obligations by buying CDOs from the insurer’s counterparties. In exchange for being bought out at 100 cents on the dollar, the counterparties agreed to terminate the swaps. That deal was widely criticized as being a back-door bailout of the banks that AIG did business with, some of whom were bidders in Thursday’s auction. The latest auction was limited only to the eight banks that bid on Thursday — all of whom were specifically invited to bid by the Federal Reserve. Market sources familiar with today’s auction said that the bids from each of the partnerships were very close in price, and on the high side compared to what the Fed was expecting. Moreover, Barclays and Deutsche Bank won the bonds by a small margin, not a large gap. Several investors complained that the fees charged by the consortia to investor clients for aggregating their bids for presentation to the Fed were “egregious”. The Citigroup/Goldman Sachs/Credit Suisse group and the Bank of America/Morgan Stanley/Nomura consortium were asking investor clients to compensate them 25 basis points more than the dollar price of each bond. “Implementing the large bid-aggregation fee transformed the consortiums winning bid into a losing bid and kept them from winning the auction,” said one trader. While Barclays and Deutsche Bank did not mention a bid-aggregation fee in its partnership announcement sent to clients, traders said that the banks would ultimately charge a fee to unwind an embedded swap tied to the CDOs that Barclays was counterparty on. The two European banks were favored to win the auction, because they already had a vested interest in the two complex securities on offer. Deutsche Bank owned junior tranches of the two CDOs being sold and today’s successful bid means that it, along with Barclays, now holds majority ownership in the structure. Barclays, meanwhile, is counterparty to a swap that is tied to the CDO, and this swap needs to be unwound before the deal could be “unlocked” and broken into the individual CMBS assets, market participants said. That is exactly what investors want — the individual CMBS backing the CDOs are valued in the markets at more than the CDO tranches themselves. “You will have more investors to buy them. It is easier to sell the individual parts,” said Ron D’Vari, chief executive officer at NewOak Capital in New York. This differs from the approach taken by the two other consortia, which planned to sell the securities either in their current form as CDOs, or as a repackaged product known as a re-remic, which would allow a new investment-grade bond to be formed. The re-remic approach would have attracted more hedge fund types which like the riskier parts of the restructured CDOs because they would offer hefty yields, D’Vari said. The commercial real estate securities market has come under pressure in recent days, partly on concerns whether the individual CMBS issues from MAX CDO deals would come to market. When the US government sold a chunk of other AIG assets last year that were primarily backed by residential mortgages, the resulting glut in supply wreaked havoc with that sector of the bond market. D’Vari said some of these underlying CMBS face refinancing risks as some of the loans will mature later this year and in 2013.",4262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/defaults-aig/update-1-barclays-deutsche-bank-win-auction-of-toxic-aig-assets-idUSL2E8FQFB720120426

301,AIG,AIG profit beats estimates as investments gain,"(Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group (AIG.N) said quarterly profit more than doubled from a year earlier, exceeding expectations with the help of investment gains. The company on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings of $1.65 a share on an operating basis, beating the $1.12 estimated on average by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AIG’s net income for the quarter was $3.2 billion, or $1.71 per share. That compared with year-earlier net income of $1.3 billion, or 31 cents per share. In the corresponding quarter last year, AIG racked up substantial catastrophe losses arising from the earthquake in Japan. The year-earlier earnings also included a charge for the termination of AIG’s credit facility with the U.S. Federal Reserve. AIG’s global property insurance unit, Chartis, earned $1 billion, compared with a loss of $424 million a year earlier when the Japanese earthquake affected results. The company said its loss ratio improved due to a shift to higher value businesses, pricing improvements and risk selection. “At Chartis, where we had very low natural disaster claims, we’re already seeing the benefits of the realigned consumer and commercial geographic structure and emphasis on growth economies,” AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said in a release. SunAmerica, AIG’s U.S. life insurer, reported a profit of $1.3 billion in the quarter, up from $1.2 billion, helped by reinvestment of cash during 2011 and rising stock markets in the quarter. In the quarter, AIG sold 1.72 billion shares of AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK), which New York-based company spun off in a Hong Kong IPO in 2010.

304,AIG,Treasury to sell more AIG common stock,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Treasury Department said on Friday it plans a third sale of the common stock of American International Group (AIG.N) that it acquired as part of the government bailout of the insurer in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis. The Treasury said the size and price of the offering are to be determined. Buyers purchased $6 billion of AIG common stock in March and $5.8 billion worth in May 2011. AIG has said it intends to buy up to $2 billion of the stock sold in the offering, the Treasury Department said in a statement. AIG bought around $3 billion worth of stock in the March sale, a Treasury official said.

307,AIG,Fed opens bidding on more toxic AIG assets,"NEW YORK, May 4 (IFR) - The Federal Reserve on Friday announced it was opening bidding on another batch of toxic assets from Maiden Lane III, the real estate-backed portfolio acquired in the US government’s 2008 bailout of AIG. It invited nine broker-dealers to bid on the latest chunk of assets up for sale, two collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The announcement comes just a week after the Fed sold two other CDOs from the Maiden Lane III portfolio to Barclays and Deutsche Bank that had a face value of $7.5bn. All-or-none bids have been invited by May 10 from Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and RBS. The complicated investment derivatives helped bring down AIG , which got a massive bailout from the government. But AIG bought back part of the assets last week, and could do so again. “AIG itself indicated they themselves will be a buyer of Maiden Lane III assets, which makes near-term sales even more likely,” said Josh Stirling, who tracks AIG for Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. “ should allow AIG, the Fed and Treasury to continue to drive the story to its logical completion in the coming weeks and months,” Stirling told IFR. The fact that the Fed and AIG booked a gain on last week’s sale, by selling them above market value, all but ensured that the Fed would come back to the market soon to offload more assets. BlackRock Solutions, the investment manager for ML III, will conduct the competitive bid process for the entirety of the latest holdings, known as Triaxx CDOs. If the CDOs are dismantled, the underlying RMBS may be poised to deliver long-time price appreciation, according to investors. High-yield risk assets such as legacy non-agency RMBS are once again considered attractive investments in the current low interest-rate environment. The Fed’s sale last week was successful, despite the market’s concern that the burst of supply would hammer prices. Instead, the underlying securities was absorbed well — and has encouraged other banks to sell crisis-era toxic securities into a market eagerly hunting for yield. Earlier this week, UBS announced its own plan to sell $1.535bn in separate CDOs into a market eagerly looking for yield, hoping to piggyback on the success of last week’s sale. Credit Suisse also pitched a “re-pack” or “re-remic” of pieces of the three large commercial real-estate CDOs to investors this week. Not only was there substantial demand for the last round of Maiden Lane III assets, but the resale value of the underlying securities was somewhere between 77% and 85%. At the end of the day, the aggressive bidding showed that the remainder of the portfolio might be valued higher than expected, and that deals to enable the Fed to exit its AIG rescue are possible, according to securitization specialists.

308,AIG,"AIG shares slump on earnings, government overhang","(Reuters) - Shares of American International Group (AIG.N) tumbled as much as 6 percent on Friday before paring some of the losses after it reported mixed results and as investors took profits following a large run-up in the bailed-out insurer’s shares this year. The shares were down 3.9 percent at $32.81 on Friday in early afternoon trading. On Thursday after the market closed AIG reported results that topped the average of Wall Street expectations as natural disaster claims dropped and the value of the company’s investments increased. Stripping out the investment gains, the results showed some softness in sales at the company’s property and casualty insurance unit, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb said in a note to clients. Prior to reporting its results, AIG’s stock price was up over 46 percent year-to-date. Gloria Vogel, an analyst at Drexel Hamilton who has a $38 target on the stock, said Friday’s share price drop was likely due to profit-taking among investors. “Although the stock has had a huge run year-to-date and may need a breather if the market slows, we nonetheless believe that AIG is still very attractively valued, that earnings should continue to improve, and that stock overhang will decrease,” she said. AIG, which received a total of $182 billion from the U.S. government during the financial crisis, has paid back 75 percent of the bailout, though the U.S. Treasury still holds a 70 percent stake in the company. In March, the U.S. government priced a $6 billion offering of AIG stock at $29 a share. Chief Executive Robert Benmosche acknowledged on a call with analysts on Friday that conventional wisdom has been that as long as the Treasury has a large position in AIG, $29 is probably the ceiling for the stock. But said that should change as the company continues to be profitable and pay down debt. “We believe that earnings will actually be what determines the value of this stock,” he said, adding that sales of non-core assets going forward would add to the company’s balance sheet. If AIG monetized its non-core assets for $23 billion and used the proceeds to repurchase its stock from the government, its run rate return on equity could rise to 6 percent from 4 percent, Gelb said. Each $1 billion of share buybacks adds 5 cents to the company’s annual earnings per share, he said. Several analysts raised their price targets for AIG’s stock on Friday. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods raised its price target to $29 from $26, UBS raised its price target to $34 from $29, and S&P; Capital raised its price target to $39 from $36. Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its price target to $44 from $40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.3 percent following a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report that cast doubts on the strength of the economic recovery.

313,AIG,Fraud case versus AIG ex-CEO Greenberg cleared for trial,"(Reuters) - A New York appeals court on Tuesday gave former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg a partial victory in the state’s fraud lawsuit against him over two suspect reinsurance transactions, but cleared the way for the case to go to trial. The appeals panel said a lower court judge was premature to hold Greenberg and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith liable in October 2010 for damages over an auto warranty insurance transaction with Capco Reinsurance Co, which the state called a sham that helped AIG hide more $200 million of losses. However, the panel said New York State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos also correctly rejected the defendants’ bid to dismiss claims over a better-known transaction with reinsurer General Re Corp. The state said this transaction helped AIG inflate loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk. General Re is a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N). Buffett was not accused of wrongdoing. The unsigned 4-1 decision is the latest twist in a case dating from 2005, when then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer accused Greenberg and Smith of helping to engineer the transactions to hide losses at AIG, which had been the largest U.S. insurer by market value. These transactions led AIG to restate its 2001 to 2004 financial statements. Spitzer’s successors Andrew Cuomo and Eric Schneiderman have also pursued the civil case, which invokes the Martin Act, a powerful state law to combat securities fraud. Greenberg and Smith plan to ask the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, to dismiss the entire case, according to a joint statement from Greenberg’s lawyers David Boies and John Gardiner and Smith’s lawyer Vincent Sama. The attorney general “failed to develop and present any proper, admissible evidence to support its allegations against Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Smith,” Boies and Gardiner said. James Freedland, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said: “We are pleased that the court has paved the way for a trial to hold the defendants accountable for perpetrating a major reinsurance scheme to defraud investors.” The appeals panel said there are “triable issues of fact as to whether defendants knew of, or participated in the fraudulent aspects of the Gen Re and Capco schemes, given the nature and degree of their personal involvement in both of the challenged transactions, as well as defendants’ responsibilities within the corporation.” It also said a definitive ruling on Capco was premature in light of the defendants’ sworn denials that they had committed fraud, and their testimony that an AIG senior vice president had assured them that the transaction was proper. Justice James Catterson dissented. He said that federal law preempted the state’s case, and that even if it did not the General Re claims should be thrown out. Greenberg left AIG in March 2005 after nearly four decades at the helm. AIG in 2006 paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes into its business practices, and in July 2010 agreed to pay $725 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit accusing it of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation. AIG’s transaction with General Re led to five convictions and two guilty pleas of former officials of those companies. A federal appeals court threw out those convictions last August, and a new trial has been scheduled for January 2013. The U.S. government still owns 61 percent of AIG following $182.3 billion of taxpayer-funded bailouts in 2008 and 2009.

Treasury sold AIG common stock in May 2011 and this March. Another sale on Monday - that realized $5.8 billion - reduced taxpayer equity interest in AIG to 61 percent.

317,AIG,NY Fed sells AIG bailout assets to Merrill Lynch,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve said on Thursday it sold all its TRIAXX collateralized debt obligations from a portfolio of assets that was used in the government bailout of insurer AIG to Merrill Lynch, following a competitive bid process with eight other Wall Street firms. Terms of the sale of the assets from the portfolio known as Maiden Lane III were not disclosed, though the New York Fed did say the assets were sold at a profit. Merrill, the broker-dealer unit of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), beat out Barclays Capital (BARC.L), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Credit Suisse CSGN.VX, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Nomura (9716.T) and RBS Securities (RBS.L). “The winning bids, which were materially higher than the original prices ML III paid, demonstrate continued interest in these assets and represent good value for the public,” said New York Fed President William Dudley in a statement. Nearly two week ago, the New York Fed said it “invited” the nine broker-dealers, “based on their expressions of interest,” to submit bids for the TRIAXX CDOs, which are backed by subprime mortgages. The combined principal value of all the TRIAXX CDO securities in the Maiden Lane III portfolio was about $2.5 billion as of March 31, according to the latest Fed data. The fair value of the Maiden Lane III portfolio was $20.21 billion on May 2, according to Fed data. As a part of the government bailout of insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) in 2008, the New York Fed lent $24.3 billion to finance the purchase of securities for Maiden Lane III, while AIG took a $5 billion equity stake. RBS and Barclays had the next closest, or so-called “cover,” bids on one of the larger chunks of TRIAXX mortgage CDOs, said investors familiar with the sale. The TRIAXX CDO 2006-1A had an original face value of $2.25 billion, but its balance had fallen to $992 million as of March 31, according to the latest New York Fed data. These TRIAXX CDOs will likely start trading intact, instead of being dismantled into their mortgage components, because their structure provides certain protections against losses that make it attractive to some investors. “Given the extraordinary demand for what could be described today as ‘outsize yield’ among investors such as insurers or pensions who must fund increasingly burdensome forward obligations, opportunities such as today’s CDOs cannot be overlooked,” said Chris Sullivan, chief investment officer of the United Nations Federal Credit Union. “There seems to have been exceptional demand lately for complex structures versus their underlying components, primarily for the sizeable return advantages,” Sullivan said. In light of improving demand for this type of risky investments, the New York Fed said it will continue to explore through BlackRock Solutions, the investment manager for the Maiden Lane portfolio, the sale of the rest of the assets in Maiden Lane III. “There is no fixed time frame for future sales,” the New York Fed said.

319,AIG,AIG ex-CEO Greenberg eyes reversing NY fraud case,"(Reuters) - Former American International Group Inc Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg said New York’s attorney general should be barred from invoking a 91-year-old state law in a fraud case over two suspect reinsurance transactions. Greenberg and co-defendant Howard Smith, AIG’s former chief financial officer, sought permission on Monday to appeal to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, a May 8 appellate ruling letting Attorney General Eric Schneiderman pursue civil fraud claims against them under the state’s Martin Act. That ruling by the Manhattan appeals court cleared the way for the 7-year-old case to go to trial. Investigators claim a transaction with General Re Corp, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, helped AIG inflate loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk, while a transaction with Capco Reinsurance Co helped AIG hide more $200 million of losses. Both transactions took place more than a decade ago. Unlike under federal law, the Martin Act does not require investigators to prove intent in order to prevail on a securities fraud claim. According to David Boies, a lawyer for Greenberg, a key issue is whether Schneiderman may use the Martin Act “to pursue a de facto securities class action” on behalf of shareholders, despite conflicting federal laws designed to promote “uniformity and certainty” in regulating securities. In a court filing, Greenberg and Smith said that power would make “every executive of a New York company or a company with shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange potentially liable - personally - for substantial damages for misstatements” by their companies, even absent proof of intent or reliance. Granting such power would have “far-reaching implications for New York’s continuing role as an economic and financial capital,” they added. James Freedland, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said: “We are confident that their latest attempt to reverse decades of settled law to escape responsibility for their misconduct will be rejected.” Greenberg and Smith were first sued in 2005 by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general. Spitzer’s successors Andrew Cuomo and Schneiderman have continued to pursue the case. Greenberg, 87, left New York-based AIG in March 2005 after nearly four decades at the insurer’s helm. AIG’s transaction with General Re led to five convictions and two guilty pleas of former officials of those companies. A federal appeals court threw out the convictions in August and a new trial has been scheduled for January 2013. Buffett was not accused of wrongdoing.

321,AIG,HP loses $190 million tax case against IRS,"(Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. on Monday lost a battle with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for more than $190 million in tax refunds tied to a Dutch tax shelter designed by the derivatives arm of American International Group (AIG.N). The ruling turns a spotlight on an aggressive tax-cutting strategy created last decade by AIG Financial Products and bankrolled by several European banks. The strategy involved trading derivatives with the aim of generating capital losses and foreign tax credits for large corporations, like HP, which then used them to try to lower their U.S. tax bills. Judge Joseph Goeke of United States Tax Court in Washington, D.C., ruled against HP, which had sued the IRS in 2009 seeking the refunds. The strategy, broadly known as a foreign tax credit generator, involves complex investments by large U.S. companies in foreign entities, typically in low-tax jurisdictions. The companies claim on their U.S. tax returns offsetting, or tax-lowering, credits for payments they make or owe to foreign tax authorities on the investments. The IRS contends that many foreign tax credit generators lack economic substance and are engineered to create artificial financial benefits that are not valid for IRS deductions. The IRS outlawed many foreign tax credit generators around 2007. An IRS spokeswoman declined to comment on the HP ruling. HP’S AIG STRATEGY USED ABN-AMRO The AIG-FP strategy used by HP involved a Dutch entity, called Foppingadreef, that was created by AIG-FP in 1996 and funded by Dutch bank ABN-Amro. ABNNV.UL In his 82-page opinion, Judge Goeke wrote that HP’s investments in Foppingadreef in 1996 were not valid for more than $15.5 million in capital-loss deductions claimed by HP in 2003 because the investments were not real economic bets. Instead, the judge wrote, HP’s stakes in the Dutch entity were carefully structured loans made by HP to and via the entity, which paid back HP. “HP’s investment is more appropriately characterized as debt, rather than equity, for Federal income tax purposes,” the judge wrote. That legal language echoes rulings of previous years that outlawed retail-investor tax shelters with names like Son of Boss. Foppingadreef also generated for HP at least $178 million in tax savings in so-called indirect foreign tax credits that are not allowed, according to the ruling. Indirect foreign tax credits are tax offsets created by interest, dividends and other investment returns. Because Foppingadreef was not an equity investment, and instead was a debt vehicle, the indirect foreign tax credits claimed by HP were not valid for deductions, the ruling said. Foppingadreef was incorporated in the Dutch Antilles, a Caribbean tax haven, with lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell and Skadden, Arps blessing the entity. AIG-FP sought legal advice for the entity because, the judge wrote, “AIG-FP understood that in order for the transaction to be marketable, it would need to be reviewed by others to ensure that it had broader appeal.” Spokesmen for the two law firms could not be reached for immediate comment. The AIG-FP financial engineer who created the transaction, Robert Findling, wanted to use differences between European and U.S. tax treatments of a certain type of interest payment “to model a foreign investment that would generate a stream of preferred dividends and produce significant foreign tax credits,” the judge wrote. Foppingadreef generated the losses and credits by trading in various derivatives, including warrants and swaptions. AIG-FP, which is based in London, could not be immediately reached for comment. One day after the 1996 incorporation, AIG-FP closed a planned deal to sell a major stake in Foppingadreef to ABN-Amro. A spokesman for ABN-Amro could not immediately be reached for comment. In 1996, AIG-FP began pitching Foppingadreef to clients as an attractive tax-advantaged investment. Over a series of meetings last decade, Foppingadreef was reviewed by HP’s treasury, legal and tax departments in Palo Alto, Calif., at company headquarters, and approved at the highest levels of the company. A spokesman for HP declined to comment on the ruling. In early 2004, HP transferred its shares in Foppingadreef to ABN-Amro, and claimed a capital loss of more than $15.5 million. The judge wrote that the entire transaction was not an investment because in part it was designed to allow HP to cash out its stake — effectively, a loan — at a pre-determined date. In a separate lawsuit filed against the IRS in Tax Court in 2009, HP is seeking to recover an additional $248.5 million in taxes and interest it paid in 1994, 1995 and 1998.

323,AIG,UPDATE 1-AIG ex-CEO Greenberg eyes reversing NY fraud case,"* Lawsuit over General Re, Capco transactions * NY AGs Spitzer, Cuomo, Schneiderman also sued AIG ex-CFO * Defendants want NY’s Court of Appeals to hear case By Jonathan Stempel May 14 (Reuters) - Former American International Group Inc  Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg said New York’s attorney general should be barred from invoking a 91-year-old state law in a fraud case over two suspect reinsurance transactions. Greenberg and co-defendant Howard Smith, AIG’s former chief financial officer, sought permission on Monday to appeal to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, a May 8 appellate ruling letting Attorney General Eric Schneiderman pursue civil fraud claims against them under the state’s Martin Act. That ruling by the Manhattan appeals court cleared the way for the 7-year-old case to go to trial. Investigators claim a transaction with General Re Corp, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  , helped AIG inflate loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk, while a transaction with Capco Reinsurance Co helped AIG hide more $200 million of losses.    Both transactions took place more than a decade ago. Unlike under federal law, the Martin Act does not require investigators to prove intent in order to prevail on a securities fraud claim. According to David Boies, a lawyer for Greenberg, a key issue is whether Schneiderman may use the Martin Act “to pursue a de facto securities class action” on behalf of shareholders, despite conflicting federal laws designed to promote “uniformity and certainty” in regulating securities. In a court filing, Greenberg and Smith said that power would make “every executive of a New York company or a company with shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange potentially liable - personally - for substantial damages for misstatements” by their companies, even absent proof of intent or reliance. Granting such power would have “far-reaching implications for New York’s continuing role as an economic and financial capital,” they added. James Freedland, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said: “We are confident that their latest attempt to reverse decades of settled law to escape responsibility for their misconduct will be rejected.” Greenberg and Smith were first sued in 2005 by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general. Spitzer’s successors Andrew Cuomo and Schneiderman have continued to pursue the case. “The main obstacle is that Martin Act actions fairly clearly aren’t preempted by the securities laws,” said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “As a result, Greenberg has to argue that the action really isn’t a Martin Act action - it’s really just a private class action dressed up as a Martin Act claim.” While Greenberg’s contention is “far from a silly argument,”	 Skeel said “it will be tough to persuade a court to go along.” Greenberg, 87, left New York-based AIG in March 2005 after nearly four decades at the insurer’s helm. AIG’s transaction with General Re led to five convictions and two guilty pleas of former officials of those companies. A federal appeals court threw out the convictions in August and a new trial has been scheduled for January 2013. Buffett was not accused of wrongdoing. The U.S. government still owns 61 percent of AIG, following $182.3 billion of taxpayer-funded bailouts. Greenberg’s company, Starr International Co, once AIG’s largest shareholder, has sued the government for $25 billion over the bailouts, which it has called unconstitutional. The case is New York v.

Benmosche said the shares “will be liquidated after Sept. 4,” according to a transcript of AIG’s annual shareholder meeting on its website. He said the sale would help decrease volatility in AIG’s earnings. AIG spun off two-thirds of AIA in 2010 as part of a package of asset sales to repay its $182 billion U.S. government rescue. Fluctuations in AIA’s share price have caused large swings in AIG’s earnings since then, with quarterly gains or losses of more than $1 billion commonplace. AIG sold part of the stake in March, raising around $6 billion and leaving it with 18.6 percent of AIA, one of Asia’s three largest insurers. Since that sale, which included the lock-up provision, AIA shares have fallen 2.8 percent.

327,AIG,AIG shares fall back below government breakeven price,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Shares in bailed-out insurer American International Group (AIG.N) dipped below the government’s breakeven price on its 61 percent stake in the company, just days after the U.S. Treasury completed another offering of its stock. AIG fell 6.1 percent to $28.60 in afternoon trading on Thursday, below the U.S. Treasury’s $28.72-a-share breakeven point on its holdings. It was the first time in nearly two months that the stock dropped below that point. Since hitting a 13-month high on May 3 the stock has dropped sharply, losing 16.2 percent of its value. Both the S&P; 500 .SPX and the S&P; insurance index .GSPINSC are down around 6 percent over that same time frame. One week ago the Treasury closed an offering of 188.5 million shares of AIG stock, or about 9 percent of the company’s stock. It was the third time in the last year that the Treasury had sold AIG shares and the first time that the underwriters exercised their full over-allotment option, indicating strong demand. But at the same time AIG has been under heavy pressure over its first-quarter results, with some analysts citing soft results in the Chartis property insurance business and others saying investors were taking profits. On Tuesday, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb said AIG may need to increase loss reserves at Chartis. The company’s SunAmerica life insurance business is also under pressure, like peers, from persistently low interest rates that have recently been at historically depressed levels.

328,AIG,New York AG must review Spitzer's emails on AIG,"(Reuters) - New York’s Attorney General must review his predecessor’s private emails relating to a probe of American International Group Inc and decide whether to release them to the public, a state judge has ruled. The office of Attorney General Eric Schneiderman must gain access to an email account belonging to former Attorney General Eliot Spitzer even though it was private, state Supreme Court Justice Christopher Cahill wrote. Cahill’s order was dated April 30 and seen by Reuters on Thursday. A spokesman for Schneiderman said his office is reviewing Cahill’s decision. Spitzer sued former AIG Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith in 2005, claiming the insurance giant fraudulently inflated reserves and hid more than $200 million in losses. Spitzer’s successors, Andrew Cuomo and Schneiderman, have continued to pursue the case. Smith commenced a freedom of information lawsuit in 2008, alleging that Spitzer used a private email account provided by the Democratic National Committee to conduct business related to investigations of AIG and other Wall Street banks. Smith wanted access to the emails to build a defense in the AIG fraud case. Schneiderman’s office argued that because it did not have possession of the email account, it was not required to release the emails under the state Freedom of Information Law. Cahill disagreed. “The determination as to whether a document is a public record subject to disclosure under FOIL must focus on the content and purpose of the document, not its location or the means by which it was transmitted,” the judge wrote.

330,AIG,UPDATE 1-NY Fed postpones latest Maiden Lane III offering,"(Adds background, smaller offering) May 17 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday it has postponed the latest sale of mortgage-backed assets from the Maiden Lane III portfolio, which it acquired as part of a rescue package for the giant U.S. insurer AIG. The Fed bank did not give a reason for the postponement, saying it will sell assets “only if the best available bid represents good value for the public.” Thursday had been the bid submission deadline for assets with a face value of $1.67 billion. Some seven broker-dealers took part in the auction for the collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.

The Fed bank sold all of its TRIAXX CDOs earlier this month. A smaller offering from the Maiden Lane III portfolio, worth $690 million, is going ahead with bids due on May 22. As a part of the government bailout of insurer American International Group Inc in 2008, the New York Fed lent $24.3 billion to finance the purchase of securities for Maiden Lane III, while AIG took a $5 billion equity stake.

335,AIG,Citigroup wins latest auction of US toxic AIG assets,"NEW YORK, May 24 (IFR) - Citigroup won the Federal Reserve’s latest auction of toxic mortgage assets on Thursday, scooping up $1.67bn in securities that the US government inherited in the 2008 bailout of AIG. The auction, postponed from last week, was the latest sell-off as the United States moves to liquidate the roughly $87bn of assets it acquired in the $182bn rescue of AIG, known collectively as the “Maiden Lane” portfolios. Citigroup beat out six other broker-dealers —  Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and RBS — in the auction. The distressed securities helped bring down AIG, then the largest US insurer, and are largely backed by the kinds of toxic residential mortgages that came to symbolize the financial crisis. But residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) have come back into vogue with investors in recent weeks, as they have largely been outperforming the traditional stock and bond markets. The securities sold on Thursday from the Maiden Lane III portfolio bundled RMBS together in complex packages of derivative investment products known as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Citigroup acquired US$1.67bn in slices of the so-called Duke Funding High Grade I Ltd. CDO. The auction, due to take place on May 17, was delayed due to technical documentation issues. “There was additional information concerning the Duke CDO that had not been made available for the bidders,” the Federal Reserve said last Friday in explaining the postponement. Securitization specialists told IFR that bidders had been seeking more information about interest-rate swaps — a secondary layer of speculative trades tied to the securities — before the auction could go ahead. The CDOs sold on Thursday were originally packaged and sold in 2005 by Wachovia, a now-defunct banking corporation that eventually merged with Wells Fargo. It was the second sale of Maiden Lane assets this week. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse beat out six other broker-dealers bidding on $691 million in Maiden Lane CDOs. In the run-up to the latest auctions, several of the bidding dealers were offering their own clients resecuritizations of the CDOs — that is, repackaging the toxic assets in a form containing at least one tranche with a triple-A top grade investment rating. Over the past month, with the market buffeted by volatility driven by the eurozone crisis, non-agency RMBS cash bonds — those backed by mortgages without US government support — have outperformed all other risky-asset sectors, researchers at JP Morgan said. One reason is that mortgage bonds are less correlated to the outside events — economic, political and otherwise — that tend to affect competing asset classes.

337,AIG,"Ex-General Re, AIG execs may settle criminal case","(Reuters) - Four former executives at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) General Re Corp and one at American International Group Inc (AIG.N) are in talks to settle a long-running criminal case accusing them of engineering a reinsurance transaction that fraudulently boosted AIG’s loss reserves. The talks were disclosed in a Thursday court filing, nearly 10 months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned the defendants’ convictions, citing errors by the judge handling their six-week trial in 2008. The General Re defendants include former Chief Executive Ronald Ferguson, former Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Monrad, former Senior Vice President Christopher Garand and former Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham. The AIG defendant is former Vice President Christian Milton. All had been scheduled to be retried in January 2013. Prosecutors had accused the defendants of engineering a sham transaction in 2000 that let AIG inflate its loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk. That transaction helped lead to the 2005 ouster of AIG’s longtime chief executive, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. “The parties have been, and continue to be, engaged in discussions concerning a potential global resolution of this matter,” lawyers for the defendants said in a joint filing with the U.S. District Court in Hartford, Connecticut. “The parties are working diligently to determine whether such a resolution may be reached.” U.S. District Judge Vanessa Bryant on Friday agreed to delay some pretrial proceedings in light of the settlement talks. The office of U.S. Attorney David Fein agreed to the delay, the court filing shows. A trial remains scheduled for January 22, 2013. Tom Carson, a spokesman for Fein, declined to comment. Ferguson’s lawyer Alfred Pavlis, Monrad’s lawyer Reid Weingarten, Garand’s lawyer Robert Cleary, Graham’s lawyer Alan Vinegrad and Milton’s lawyer Thomas Green did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In overturning the convictions, the 2nd Circuit said presiding judge Christopher Droney erred in admitting data suggesting that the transaction caused a 12 percent decline in AIG’s stock price in early 2005, saying other factors could have fueled the drop. It also said Droney did not properly instruct jurors on how to decide whether fraud occurred. Droney had sentenced Milton to four years in prison, Ferguson to two years, Monrad to 1-1/2 years, and Garand and Graham to one year each. They were freed on bail. Former General Re executives John Houldsworth and Richard Napier pleaded guilty in the case and received probation. Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s chief executive, was questioned by investigators but not accused of wrongdoing. General Re is based in Stamford, Connecticut and Berkshire in Omaha, Nebraska. Droney now sits on the 2nd Circuit, having been promoted in December. The reinsurance transaction took place well before AIG in 2008 and 2009 accepted $182.3 billion of taxpayer bailouts. The government still owns a majority of the New York-based insurer. Greenberg, 87, this month sought permission to ask New York state’s highest court to throw out a 2005 civil fraud lawsuit brought by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer accusing him of structuring fraudulent transactions, including the General Re transaction, to hide AIG losses.

339,AIG,AIG can raise enough to help buy out government: analyst,"(Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer AIG (AIG.N) should be able to raise enough capital in the near term to buy out the U.S. government’s remaining 61 percent stake, assuming both the company and the public share in any stock offering, Sandler O’Neill analysts said on Wednesday. In a note to clients, Sandler estimated that AIG would be able to raise $18.2 billion over the next year. That would be more than enough, assuming the government’s remaining stake is worth about $30.75 billion and that the U.S. Treasury sells half of any offering to the company and half to the public. “AIG has participated in approximately half of each offering to date, which suggests that AIG needs to find approximately $15.4 billion to pay off the government’s stake,” analyst Paul Newsome said. The money could come from a variety of sources: $7 billion from AIG’s interest in the U.S. Federal Reserve entity Maiden Lane III, $5.5 billion from selling shares of Asian insurer AIA (1299.HK), $4.5 billion from retained earnings and roughly $1.2 billion from an initial public offering of plane leasing unit ILFC ILFC.N. In the same note, Newsome upgraded AIG shares to “buy,” citing the stock’s recent decline and cheap valuation compared to peers. AIG trades at just above half of book value, while other property insurers are trading at book and life insurers are trading at nearly 80 percent of book.

The company demoted him and cut his salary as a result. AIG said Henri Courpron would remain chief executive of the leasing unit, ILFC, but will now report to a newly named executive chairman, Laurette Koellner. Koellner, a former senior Boeing executive, had been an AIG board member since 2009 but will give up that seat for the ILFC role. The episode is not expected to change the plans for the spin-off of ILFC, which AIG filed to take public last year. AIG’s top executives have said repeatedly that they were waiting for market conditions to become more favorable before moving ahead with the offering. AIG said in a statement it first learned of the relationship via an anonymous tip. Courpron and the employee admitted the affair, though AIG said an outside review found no merit to the tipster’s claims that company assets were misused. AIG also said it has reduced Courpron’s annual salary by $1 million.

344,AIG,"Former AIG, Gen Re execs admit to fraud","(Reuters) - Five former executives of American International Group Inc and Berkshire Hathaway Inc unit Gen Re admitted to conducting a fraudulent reinsurance transaction on Friday as part of a deal to end a years-long criminal case against them. All five entered into deferred prosecution agreements, meaning their indictments will be dismissed in a year if they stay out of trouble. They also agreed to fines ranging from $100,000 to $250,000. The deal brings to an end a high-profile case that has worked its way through the courts since May 2006. In 2008, former Gen Re Chief Executive Ronald Ferguson, Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Monrad, Senior Vice President Christopher Garand and Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham, as well as AIG Vice President Christian Milton, were convicted of engineering a reinsurance deal to fraudulently boost AIG’s reserves. In August 2011, a federal appeals court threw out the convictions and ordered a new trial, citing errors by the judge in the case. The five had been sentenced to anywhere from one to four years in prison, though they were all out on bail, pending their appeals. Last February, a new judge overseeing the case set a January 2013 date for their retrial. As part of the deal, all five agreed to recognize “that aspects of the (reinsurance) transaction were fraudulent,” that there were signs it would be improperly accounted for and that they each should have taken steps to stop it.

347,AIG,Fed auctions off more toxic AIG assets,"NEW YORK, June 25 (IFR) - Credit Suisse, RBS and Morgan Stanley on Monday won the latest Federal Reserve auction of assets from Maiden Lane III, the portfolio of troubled real-estate securities the government acquired in the 2008 bailout of AIG. Credit Suisse won four of the CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations — bundles of real-estate mortgages that brought AIG  to its knees in the depths of the financial crisis. They had a face value of $3.45 billion. RBS bought one $396 million CDO, and Morgan Stanley bought a $392 million CDO in the latest Maiden Lane sale. The Fed will auction off another US$3.13bn across five CDOs on Thursday. Eight broker-dealers have been invited to submit bids for Thursday’s auction: Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, and RBS. The Fed said it would keep selling its Maiden Lane assets “if the sales represent good value for the public,” adding there was no fixed date for the sales to be completed. After Monday’s sale, $23.4 billion in face value remains from the original $47 billion of securities in the Maiden Lane III portfolio. The Fed has also completely sold $39 billion in other assets, known as Maiden Lane II, it acquired from AIG. The Fed said earlier this month that its loans to AIG made during the 2008 bailout had been paid back in full.",6252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fed-aig/fed-auctions-off-more-toxic-aig-assets-idUSL2E8HPC3A20120625
348,AIG,TEXT-Fitch rates American International Group's new notes,"June 27 - Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of ‘BBB’ to  American International Group, Inc.’s (AIG) $750 million issuance of new 4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022. All other AIG ratings are unchanged, including AIG’s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of ‘BBB’ with a Positive Rating Outlook.   Proceeds from the issue will be used for general corporate purposes, including  refinancing of debt maturing in 2013. The new issuance, coupled with debt  issuance and share repurchase activity in May will increase AIG’s pro forma  financial leverage ratio (excluding financial related debt) modestly to 20%.   Fitch’s ratings on AIG and its subsidiaries primarily reflect the benefits of  the AIG organization’s strong competitive positions in life and non-life  insurance partially offset by the comparatively poor recent operating results of the company’s core insurance operations. The Positive Outlook on AIG’s IDR  continues to reflect improvements in the company’s liquidity and financial  profile over the last 12-18 months as it sheds operations and de-leverages the  balance sheet.   Key triggers that could lead to rating upgrades include:   —Earnings improvements at insurance subsidiaries’ Chartis and SunAmerica that  translate into higher earnings-based interest coverage;   —Further transition of AIG’s capital structure and leverage metrics to those of a more traditional insurance holding company that generates a meaningful  reduction in the company’s Total Financing Commitments ratio (TFC);  —Enhanced underwriting profitability and demonstrated reserve stability of the  company’s non-life insurance subsidiaries;  —Further stabilization of sales trends and profitability of the company’s  domestic life insurance subsidiaries;  —Material increases in Chartis’ NAIC risk-based capital ratios.   Key triggers that could lead to rating downgrades include:   —Declines in underwriting profitability and heightened reserve volatility of  the company’s non-life insurance subsidiaries that Fitch views as inconsistent  with that of comparably-rated peers and industry trends;  —Deterioration in the company’s domestic life subsidiaries’ sales or  profitability trends;  —Material declines in RBC ratios at either the domestic life insurance or the  non-life insurance subsidiaries.   Fitch has assigned the following rating:   American International Group, Inc.  —$750 million of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022 rated ‘BBB’.",6272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA018220120627

350,AIG,Exclusive: AIG to resume use of its brand name,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) will resume using its brand name in public in a move to recognize the company’s turnaround, Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said on Thursday. AIG, which received $182 billion in government bailouts during the financial crisis, has all but shunned its own name for years. Not only did various AIG units reorganize under rebranded holding companies, at one time employee ID badges did not even identify the company by name — a measure, Benmosche has said, to protect employee safety. But with recent advertising tests showing higher response rates and lower customer acquisition costs for AIG-branded products, the company said it was time for a change. “The increasingly positive sentiment toward AIG is a powerful asset,” Benmosche said in a memo to staff, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. The company has been running ads for its Matrix Direct term life insurance business using “AIG Direct” branding since last September. Those new ads have been outperforming ads using the Matrix Direct brand by double digits. The Chartis property and casualty business will be known simply as AIG starting this fall, while the SunAmerica life businesses will be known as AIG Life and Retirement. Other AIG entities will keep their names but add an AIG tag to their logos. Shares of AIG fell 2 percent to $30.23 in afternoon trade. The government remains the largest shareholder in the company with a 61 percent stake.

A successful sale would allow Veolia to strengthen its balance sheet, which was saddled with 14.7 billion euros of debt as of the end of last year, by tapping demand to consolidate the fragmented nature of the U.S. waste management industry. Highstar Capital, owner of waste management businesses in the U.S. Northeast and Southeast, has lined up financing and made a final offer for the unit, Veolia ES Solid Waste Inc, the people said. While it was not immediately clear if there was another bidder, Highstar appears to be in the lead to buy the Veolia business, the people said. Waste Connections Inc, a solid waste services company, had been mentioned by industry analysts and bankers as another potential buyer for the Veolia asset, but its chief financial officer said on Thursday the company did not bid. “While we actually have the capital to do such a deal, we are not a part of the banker-led auction process,” Waste Connections CFO Worthing Jackman told Reuters. The French utility has hired Credit Suisse Group  and Barclays to sell its U.S. solid waste management unit as part of its corporate-wide overhaul aimed at cutting debt and returning to profitability. Final bids for the asset, which was expected to be valued at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, were due last week and an outcome is expected in the next several days, the people said. A deal has not been reached yet and there is no certainty Veolia would proceed with the sale, they cautioned. Veolia declined to comment while Highstar did not respond to a request for comment. AIG has cosponsored infrastructure funds together with Highstar, though the latter is an independent asset manager. New-York based Highstar manages more than $5.6 billion through its infrastructure funds. Its waste business has been scooping up competitors, completing 30 acquisitions since 2005, according to its website. Synergies could mean Highstar may have been able to make a competitive offer to Veolia, the sources said. The sale of the U.S. waste management business would come weeks after Veolia sold a majority stake in its regulated UK  water business for 1.24 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) including debt. One of the largest solid waste companies in the United States, Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Veolia ES Solid Waste operates 72 collection facilities and 29 solid waste sanitary landfill facilities in North America. The business has trailing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $250 million and could fetch as much as eight times that in a sale, people familiar with the company have told Reuters previously.",7122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/veolia-waste-sale/update-2-highstar-eyes-veolias-2-bln-u-s-waste-unit-sources-idUSL2E8ICES720120712

356,AIG,AIG contribution to Maiden Lane III repaid in full,"(Reuters) - AIG (AIG.N) has been repaid in full for the equity it contributed to Maiden Lane III, one of the entities created during the financial crisis to help rescue the insurer, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Monday. In the weeks after AIG’s September 2008 near-collapse, the New York Fed created Maiden Lane III to buy collateralized debt obligations from AIG counterparties. The company contributed $5 billion and the bank put up $24.3 billion. Last month, following a series of asset sales, the New York Fed loan was repaid. On Monday American International Group received its equity back, plus accrued interest. As of July 12, that amount was $5.56 billion, according to Fed data.

357,AIG,AIG contribution to Maiden Lane III repaid in full,"* Company gets more than $5.5 bln in equity, interest * AIG will get 1/3 of any future profits July 16 (Reuters) - AIG has been repaid in full for the equity it contributed to Maiden Lane III, one of the entities created during the financial crisis to help rescue the insurer, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Monday. In the weeks after AIG’s September 2008 near-collapse, the New York Fed created Maiden Lane III to buy collateralized debt obligations from AIG counterparties. The company contributed $5 billion and the bank put up $24.3 billion. Last month, following a series of asset sales, the New York Fed loan was repaid. On Monday American International Group received its equity back, plus accrued interest. As of July 12, that amount was $5.56 billion, according to Fed data. Under the original terms of the deal, profits from any future sales will be split between the bank and the company, with AIG getting a one-third share.

358,AIG,Ex-AIG's Greenberg case may be heard by NY high court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state’s highest court could hear securities fraud charges against former American International Group (AIG.N) chief Maurice “Hank” Greenberg and the insurance company’s former chief financial officer, Howard Smith. In a single-sentence order, the state’s appellate division on Tuesday granted a motion by Greenberg and Smith to appeal its May 8 decision to send the case to trial. The charges under one of New York’s toughest laws, the 90-year-old Martin Act, may now be heard by the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court. Greenberg and Smith deny the charges and have fought them under three New York State Attorney-Generals since they were accused in 2005 of involvement in a reinsurance scheme at AIG that masked the company’s true financial position. AIG was bailed out by the federal government in the 2008 financial crisis. Greenberg’s lawyers at Boies, Schiller & Flexner said in a statement on Tuesday that they would challenge parts of the Martin Act, believing it is pre-empted by federal statutes. The Act came into force in 1921. It gives a prosecutor extraordinary powers and discretion in financial fraud cases that exceed those of any other U.S. state. “The appeal will determine the validity of the Martin Act, which the New York Attorney General and his predecessors have used prodigiously, but with questionable legality in light of conflicting federal standards,” the lawyers’ statement said. James Freedland, a spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said the office was “confident the court of appeals will uphold the lower court’s decision and we look forward to trying this case to hold the defendants accountable for perpetrating a major reinsurance scheme to defraud investors.” The case is People of the State of New York v Greenberg in the New York State Appellate Division, First Department, Motion Nos.

360,AIG,NY Fed urges end to Greenberg's AIG bailout lawsuit,"* Ex-AIG CEO says NY Fed breached duties to shareholders * Bank’s lawyer: AIG was not under NY Fed’s “thumb” * Greenberg’s Starr Int’l once held 12 pct AIG stake * D.C. judge let Greenberg’s constitutional case go forward By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Thursday told a federal judge it acted lawfully in bailing out American International Group Inc during the 2008 financial crisis, and should not face a $25 billion lawsuit by the insurer’s former chief executive, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. Greenberg’s case, brought on behalf of his company Starr International Co, accused the New York Fed of wasting more than $60 billion of AIG and taxpayer funds in a “backdoor bailout” that let “favored” trading partners, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, be repaid in full and freed from legal liability. Starr, which once held a 12 percent stake in AIG, also said the bank circumvented the law by allowing the U.S. Treasury to take a nearly 80 percent stake in the New York-based insurer without a vote by existing shareholders who would be diluted. But John Kiernan, a lawyer representing the New York Fed, told U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer at Thursday’s hearing in Manhattan that AIG had not been “acting under the thumb” of the bank, including when it accepted an initial $85 billion credit line at a 14.5 percent interest rate. “The Federal Reserve Bank categorically denies that it threw money away,” and acted “in the public interest and the exigent circumstances at the time to stabilize the market,” said Kiernan, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. Starr’s case, which accuses the New York Fed of breaching duties to AIG shareholders, is separate from a federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C., which also accuses the government of engineering an unconstitutional AIG bailout. That case raised different legal theories, and on July 2, another federal judge let most of it go forward. Once the world’s largest insurer by market value, AIG received a bailout on Sept. 16, 2008, as losses were skyrocketing from risky bets on mortgage debt through credit default swaps. While Engelmayer did not indicate how he would rule, he suggested the New York Fed might have legitimately exercised unusual powers to stabilize the financial system, keep the economy out of collapse, and even require AIG to adhere to commitments it had made on its “death bed” rather than renege. “It is the Fed in the middle of a millennial financial crisis,” the judge said to David Boies, Starr’s lawyer. “It has to look at the health of the financial system.” Boies, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, countered that the bank’s powers are not so broad. “Whatever is the function of the Fed” to help the economy and financial system, he said “that does not depend on the ability to take control of a private company and then provide a backdoor bailout to other companies.” In his comments, Engelmayer also said Starr might have waited too long to pursue some claims by suing in November 2011, given a three-year statute of limitations, unless it could be said that the New York Fed’s later actions brought the initial September 2008 bailout into play. Yet the judge also suggested that AIG might have had little room to maneuver, asking Kiernan whether one could say “if the Fed said ‘Jump,’ AIG would say ‘How high?’” Kiernan disagreed, referring to the $85 billion credit line in saying the bank did not owe fiduciary obligations to AIG shareholders “by virtue of the borrower having a need for the lender.” The bank has also said federal law does not allow second-guessing of when and on what terms it should have helped AIG. The case in Washington, D.C. addressed Starr’s claims that the AIG bailout deprived shareholders of their due process and equal protection rights through an illegal “taking” of property. In his July 2 ruling allowing that case to continue, Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims said there were factual disputes to address. These include who caused AIG’s financial condition, whether the government coerced AIG and the identities of the intended beneficiaries of the bailout. At the time of the bailout, Henry Paulson headed the U.S. Treasury Department, while his successor, Timothy Geithner, had been president of the New York Fed. AIG’s bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion, and the government’s stake in the insurer had fallen to 61 percent. Greenberg led AIG for nearly four decades prior to his 2005 ouster. The 87-year-old attended Thursday’s hearing for about two hours, leaving near the end of Boies’ argument. Shares of AIG closed Thursday up 54 cents at $30.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have lost more than 97 percent of their value since credit conditions began to tighten in mid-2007. The cases are Starr International Co v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-08422; and Starr International Co v. U.S., U.S. Court of Federal Claims, No. 11-00779.",7262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-nyfed-bailout/ny-fed-urges-end-to-greenbergs-aig-bailout-lawsuit-idUSL2E8IQ4VP20120726
361,AIG,AIG launches YouTube campaign as part of rebranding,"(Reuters) - American International Group is continuing its rebranding with a YouTube channel, part of the insurer’s effort to shed the stigma of its 2008 government rescue and essentially reintroduce itself to the public. AIG was on the brink of bankruptcy when it was saved by the government in September 2008. Its $182-billion rescue tarnished the image of what had been the world’s largest insurer, and it has been trying to rebuild its name since. Last month, the company said it would resume the use of the “AIG” brand for its various insurance businesses, reversing a decision taken in the early days of the crisis when the name inspired public derision. The YouTube channel appears to be part of that effort. Though the channel appears to have been set up last month, the company began actively promoting it on its Twitter feed on Thursday, alongside the hashtag “#proud2beAIG”. There are three video sections, each with three clips: “Rebuilding AIG,” “Proud to Be a Part of AIG” and “Giving Back to the Community.” All of the content is geared toward both humanizing the company and making the case for its recovery. “We’d like to tell you a story about an American corporation working to keep a promise it made to the U.S. Government and American taxpayers,” reads the title cards that play at the beginning of the first two-and-a-half minute video, an animated effort with a timeline of the bailout. The second video features Chief Executive Bob Benmosche, who is widely credited with stopping the company’s fire-sale breakup after the bailout and leading the company’s recovery, as well as a number of other employees. The page also links to the restructuring factsheet on AIG’s website and displays the company’s Twitter feed. As of midday Thursday, the channel had just 44 subscribers, with the videos having been viewed just over 2,100 times. An AIG spokesman confirmed the YouTube campaign was a new effort.

363,AIG,AIG could leave Manhattan headquarters-building owner,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group Inc may leave its headquarters in lower Manhattan next year when its lease expires, an executive at SL Green Realty Corp, the company that owns the building said. AIG’s lease for 803,000 square feet of the 1.1 million square-foot building at 180 Maiden Lane expires next year. SL Green bought a 49.9 percent interest in the building when it helped The Moinian Group refinance the property last year. Jim Mead, SL Green Realty Corp chief financial officer on Thursday said in a conference call with analysts Thursday that SL Green entered into the deal thinking there was a good chance AIG would leave. “So we’re actively exploring the possibilities of both a redevelopment of the asset and bringing it to the market for new tenants and also in discussions playing it out with AIG in terms of their occupancy,” Mead said. “So it’s still too early to tell there, but it’s definitely getting a lot of our focus.” An AIG spokesman did not respond to a call on the matter. AIG was one of the biggest near-catastrophes of the financial crisis. It received $182 billion in government bailout funds and has been working to turn itself around ever since. The U.S. government currently holds $30.8 billion in AIG stock, according to the company’s websites. Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst John Guinee said there’s a good chance AIG will stay put and renew its lease rather than incur the expense, distraction and attention of moving. “Given AIG’s visibility and questionable financial stability, they are highly likely to renew,” Guinee said. “Whether they downsize or not, it is too soon to tell. If they move into a nicer building, people will question the upgrade and quality. If they move into a lower quality building, people will question the vitality of the company.” ",7272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aig-lease/aig-could-leave-manhattan-headquarters-building-owner-idUSBRE86Q1LU20120727

365,AIG,AIG to buy Hartford's brokerage unit,"(Reuters) - Bailed-out insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said it will buy independent brokerage unit Woodbury Financial Services from Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (HIG.N) for $90 million to bolster its broker-dealer network. Hartford is expected to receive $115 million in proceeds from the deal, including $25 million in dividends from Woodbury, subject to certain conditions. Hartford said in late March it would shut down its annuity business and sell its life insurance, retirement plan and broker-dealer operations as part of a restructuring to focus on its property insurance business. The company has come under pressure to boost its stock price from hedge fund manager John Paulson, who is also its largest shareholder. AIG’s life and retirement business SunAmerica Financial Group will buy the unit and merge it with its Advisor Group, a network of independent broker dealers. Reuters reported in March that Woodbury, which hasn’t posted a profit in at least five years, would be able to lure bids from a small circle of expansion-minded rivals. Minnesota-based Woodbury, which has about 1,400 advisers, was the 12th-largest independent securities brokerage with $254 million in revenue last year. Yet like its rivals, profit margins have been squeezed by technology, compliance and other costs. Independent advisers receive roughly 90 percent or more of the commissions and fees they generate, but they also are responsible for paying their own business expenses. Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services (LTS.A) and Cetera Financial Group were said to be potential bidders for the unit. On Tuesday, analysts at Sterne Agee said AIG appeared to be getting more cash than expected from the Federal Reserve’s Maiden Lane III asset sales, which would give the company added financial flexibility. While the Woodbury deal is not AIG’s first acquisition since the bailout, it is perhaps the highest-profile, at least domestically. AIG’s other deals were mostly international or related to a non-insurance unit. The company is due to report earnings on Thursday, and if recent patterns hold, the U.S. Treasury is likely to sell another chunk of its 61 percent stake in the company soon after. Hartford said the deal will generate a “modest gain” for the company, and will have no impact on its 2013 earnings.

369,AIG,"AIG second-quarter profit rises, insurance units all gain","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) reported a larger profit for the second quarter on Thursday, as tax benefits boosted results and operating income grew across the company’s varied insurance businesses. The company also reported more than $11 billion in liquidity at the parent company level, a cash pile most people expect it will use to buy down some of the government’s remaining stake. Net profit rose to $2.33 billion, or $1.33 per share, from $1.84 billion or $1 a share a year earlier. Operating income was $1.06 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected earnings of 57 cents per share. Net income was boosted by a tax allowance release of some $1.28 billion, the latest in a series of tax benefits the company has been able to recognize as it returned to profitability. It was partially offset by a tax expense of $331 million and an increase to legal reserves of $450 million. The company, still 61 percent-owned by the U.S. Treasury after its $182 billion bailout, ended the quarter with roughly $11.5 billion in parent company liquidity. Analysts and investors expect the company will use a large chunk of that cash to buy back some of the Treasury’s stake, perhaps as soon as the next few days. In recent quarters the Treasury has launched a share sale the day after results. Some of that capital came from the sale of assets in Maiden Lane III, the crisis-era bailout vehicle set up by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIG has already received $6.1 billion in proceeds from MLIII asset sales and expects to receive another $1.9 billion this month. Chartis, the company’s global property insurer, reported a rise in operating income to $936 million from $783 million a year earlier, as pricing grew, catastrophe losses fell and it expanded in more valuable business lines. Domestic life insurer SunAmerica posted operating profits of $933 million versus $723 million a year earlier. The second quarter of 2011 had a number of one-time items and reserve increases that were not present this time. Fixed annuity deposits fell sharply, while the less rate-sensitive variable annuities grew. Net investment income was flat. AIG also said the fair value of its stake in Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK) fell $493 million during the quarter, impacting results. AIG spun off AIA in late 2010, but still retains a stake of around 19 percent, which it is expected to sell in early September when a lockup expires.

AIG filed for an initial public offering of ILFC last year, but has held back from launching the offer due to uncertain market conditions.

372,AIG,AIG looking to buy back large chunk of shares from U.S. government: WSJ,"(Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N) is looking to buy back a large chunk of its shares from the U.S. government, whose stake in the bailed-out insurer could subsequently go below 50 percent by this fall, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the company’s thinking. The buybacks are likely to be accompanied by one or more public share offerings of AIG stock by the U.S. Treasury, the WSJ said. The timing and scale of future offerings and repurchases are not clear, the Journal said. Reducing the government’s current 61 percent stake to below 50 percent could bring oversight from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to regulate the company when the government is no longer a majority owner. Over the past 16 months the government has reduced its stake in AIG from a peak of 92 percent through a series of at-market sales. Treasury is unlikely to sell its AIG shares below $29 apiece, as it views its break-even price at $28.73 a share, according to the newspaper. AIG shares closed down 43 cents at $30.84 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. A U.S. Treasury spokesman, Matthew Anderson, declined to comment to Reuters on the Journal report.

374,AIG,UPDATE 4-U.S. Treasury says to raise $5 bln from AIG stock sale,"WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Friday it expects to raise $5 billion from its sale of American International Group stock, cutting the government’s stake in the bailed-out insurer to 55 percent. The move comes as President Barack Obama’s campaign for a second term in which he has been forced to defend his administration’s decision to use taxpayer money to prop up companies during the crisis. The Treasury, which earlier on Friday said it expected to sell $4.5 billion in AIG stock, priced the offering at $30.50 a share. The insurer intends to buy up to $3 billion of the offering. Treasury said it will sell 163.9 million shares of AIG stock, which will reduce its holding in the insurer to 55 percent from 61 percent. The insurer received multiple bailouts under both the Obama and Bush administrations, with the government pledging as much as $182 billion in aid. The Obama administration has been unwinding its position in the politically unpopular financial crisis bailout programs. More than 300 small banks have yet to repay taxpayers. The U.S. government hired over a dozen financial institutions to help coordinate and run the offering, including Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Securities, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. AIG shares closed up 1.62 percent at $31.34 on Friday, over 9 percent above the $28.72 price needed for the U.S. government to break even on its investment in the insurer.

375,AIG,Treasury's latest AIG offering gets upsized,"NEW YORK, Aug 3 (IFR) - The US Treasury Department is expected to realise as much as US$5.75bn in proceeds today from the sale of another chunk of equity in bailed-out insurer American International Group. The Treasury on Friday revealed plans to sell US$4.5bn worth of its AIG common stock, comprising US$3bn worth of stock that will be repurchased by the company and US$1.5bn stock that will be sold to investors. However, sources indicated the US$1.5bn component of the share sale had already been upsized to US$2bn. Including a planned “greenshoe” or overallotment option (15% of the total US$5bn), the total amount raised by Treasury could stretch to US$5.75bn. It is understood the offering will be priced at US$30.50 a share, the same price as a similar offering in May and a relatively slim discount to AIG’s closing price US$31.34 today. The figure is above the US government’s break-even price most recently calculated at around US$29 a share. As with the May deal, a syndicate of 11 banks is working on the share sale, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are again the active leads, with JP Morgan and Citigroup in so-called junior active roles. But the latest transaction differs from the May sell-down in several respects. For one, it will be finalised tonight rather than over the weekend, reducing execution risk. Another difference is that the lock-up period preventing future sales following the latest offering is only 30 days, giving the government flexibility to conduct a further sell-down in a relatively short space of time. The lock-up period on the previous deal was 90 days. Prior to today’s deal, the US Treasury held 61% of the company, a stake worth more than US$30bn that has been gradually pared back following the 2008 bailout of the company. The selldown follows AIG’s better-than-expected second quarter earnings released Thursday. In a conference call this morning, the company said it had “ample capital”, including US$5bn in excess liquidity that could be used for capital management and acquisitions. The company also repeated its commitment to US$25-$30bn of capital management through 2015. A key challenge in selling the deal is the ongoing overhang of government stock, a factor that has made some large fundamentally based institutions reluctant to support previous offerings and meant much of the buying demand came from hedge funds. However, sources close to the deal say AIG (whose major institutional shareholder is Bruce Berkowitz’ Fairholme Capital Management) is finding more interest from traditional long-only investors after each share offering. “The texture of the book is increasingly becoming more and more long-only involvement,” one ECM banker said.

376,AIG,U.S. Treasury says to sell $4.5 billion in AIG stock,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Friday it will sell $4.5 billion worth of American International Group (AIG.N) stock, taking another step toward unwinding its position in the financial crisis bailout programs. The sale could cut the government’s stake in the insurer to just above 50 percent. The move accompanies President Barack Obama’s campaign for a second term in which he has been forced to defend his administration’s decision to use taxpayer money to prop up companies during the crisis. The insurer, which received multiple bailouts under both the Obama and Bush administrations, intends to buy up to $3 billion of the offering once it is priced, Treasury said in a statement. Brokers at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney are receiving allocations of AIG’s shares at a price of $30.50 a share, a source familiar with the allocations said on Friday. Assuming Treasury conducts the offering at this price, the sale would represent about 147.5 million shares of AIG stock. That would suggest the offering would reduce Treasury’s stake in AIG to about 52 percent from the current 61 percent holding. The insurer, which is still not overseen by a single regulator, is expected to be slapped with a “systemically important” label from the powerful new U.S. council of regulators. The label would then subject AIG to new rules as well as supervision from the Federal Reserve.

384,AIG,AIG not on the hook for policyholders' Madoff claims: U.S. court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) does not have to cover insurance claims from two former Bernard Madoff clients who sought compensation for their losses under their homeowner’s policy, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an appeal from Robert and Harlene Horowitz, who had sought up to $30,000 in coverage under a fraud safeguard provision in their homeowner’s policy with AIG. The two California residents had sought to make their lawsuit a class action on behalf of other AIG policyholders. The Horowitzes said they lost $8.5 million from their Madoff account when the money manager’s Ponzi scheme was uncovered in 2008, reflecting the amount on their final account statement. But AIG denied they suffered any direct loss under the terms of their insurance policy. The Horowitzes had deposited $4.3 million in their Madoff account over nearly 10 years and withdrawn about $4.5 million over the same period, leaving them with $226,000 more than they invested, according to Wednesday’s ruling. The $8.5 million claim was the indirect loss of potential returns on their initial investment, a scenario that was explicitly excluded from coverage under their policy, AIG argued. In September 2010, U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan agreed with AIG and dismissed the lawsuit. The plaintiffs appealed to the 2nd Circuit, which backed Crotty’s ruling. “The policy expressly excludes coverage for indirect losses — a term that includes the inability to realize income from the money, securities or other property that would have been realized but for the fraud,” the appeals court wrote. AIG could not immediately be reached for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiffs was also not immediately available.

Issuers may be looking to get business done before any bad news emerges later this week in Europe, where Greece is expected to ask for a two-year extension to meet its budget and reform commitments. At mid-morning, the broader credit indices are mixed to start the week.

Greece’s prime minister will meet with European leaders this week, but could run into opposition from Germany on again reworking the terms and schedule of the country’s fiscal reform. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Saturday: “It is not responsible to throw money into a bottomless pit… We cannot create yet another new program.” Along with AIG and JPMorgan, Laboratory Corp of America Holdings came to market today, announcing a benchmark SEC-registered 5s/10s 2-part deal, for pricing later in the day.

394,AIG,Bank of America seeks end to lawsuit tied to AIG case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is urging a federal court to throw out an unusual lawsuit by its shareholders accusing it of concealing a $10 billion fraud case brought by American International Group Inc (AIG.N). The bank argued in papers filed late Tuesday in Manhattan federal court that shareholders should have known the insurer might sue, based on published reports several months earlier. Bank of America also contended that shareholders may not have been harmed by the insurer’s lawsuit. AIG sued Bank of America on August 8, 2011, alleging misrepresentations about the quality of more than $28 billion of mortgage-backed securities it bought from the bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units. Bank of America shares fell 20.3 percent on the day the case was filed. Shareholders led by Camcorp Interests Ltd, a Houston-based investment firm, sued the bank last September, arguing that Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and other officials had known in February 2011 of AIG’s potential claims and should have revealed this “extremely large and material” threat at the time. In its Tuesday court filing, the second-largest U.S. bank said reports published in the New York Times and elsewhere noted the possibility of AIG litigation as early as April 2011. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank also said it had long disclosed its exposure to significant mortgage securities litigation, “a favorite subject” of media and analysts. “The extensiveness of the litigation risk disclosures that B of A did make, the lack of any obvious duty to disclose more, and the fact that it was already widely reported that AIG was considering suing B of A — all undermine any inference of recklessness,” the bank said in the filing. Bank of America also noted that the broader stock market, not just its own shares, plunged on the day AIG filed its lawsuit. That day was the first trading session after Standard & Poor’s took away the United States’ triple-A credit rating. Major U.S. stock indexes fell 5.5 percent to 6.9 percent, and while Bank of America was the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage loser, prices of many rivals fell by double-digit percentages. The complaint “does not so much as mention” the U.S. credit rating downgrade, a “cataclysmic marketwide event” that could just as easily have been responsible for the shareholder losses, the bank said in the filing. Steve Berman, a partner at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro representing the plaintiffs, said on Wednesday: “We are confident we will defeat the bank’s motion to dismiss.” AIG’s $10 billion lawsuit is still pending. In its most recent quarterly report, Bank of America estimated that it might be forced to pay out as much as $4.1 billion more for litigation and regulatory matters than the unspecified sum it has set aside.

396,AIG,ON THE MOVE-Securities America adds adviser in California,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Securities America Inc, the Nebraska-based broker-dealer catering to independent advisers, bolstered its California presence after landing a veteran adviser who managed $150 million in client assets. Adviser Ryan Kaufman, 38, moved to Securities America last week from Woodbury Financial Services, the independent broker-dealer that American International Group said in July it plans to purchase from Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. “When we heard Woodbury was going to be spun off from Hartford, we started putting our ears to the ground to figure out what plan B might be,” said Kaufman, whose branch last year generated about $1.3 million in annual revenue. Kaufman, who entered the financial services industry in 1996, had previously been an adviser with other AIG-affiliated broker-dealers, including SunAmerica Securities and later SagePoint Financial, before learning about the planned purchase of Woodbury. “I thought it would be hard for me to go back to my clients and explain that we were re-affiliating with the parent company,” he said. Kaufman, whose Koi Wealth Management business is located in the greater Sacramento area in Rocklin, California, said he plans to use his move over to Securities America as a chance to build out his branch. He set a goal of ultimately expanding his team to 50 advisers. “We want to never get too big that we cannot have strong peer-to-peer collaboration,” he said. Securities America Financial Corp is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc, which purchased the unit last year from Ameriprise Financial Inc. Securities America has about 1,700 registered representatives. Since the start of the year, Securities America has added at least 17 experienced advisers, who managed about $955 million in client assets at their previous firms, based on moves tracked by Reuters.",8302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/securities-america/on-the-move-securities-america-adds-adviser-in-california-idUSL2E8JU36020120830
397,AIG,DEALTALK-Banks pin hopes on $7.6 bln AIA selldown to buffer poor year,"* Lock-up on AIG’s remaining 18.6 pct stake in AIA expires on Sept. 4 * Deal critical to fees and league table credits for investment banks * AIA shares up 9.5 pct in 2012, beating financial services sub-index By Denny Thomas and Elzio Barreto HONG KONG, Aug 31 (Reuters) - As American International Group becomes free next week to sell a $7.6 billion stake in former unit AIA, deal-starved bankers in Hong Kong are jostling for a role in what may be Asia-Pacific’s biggest stock market event of the year. A lock-up agreement preventing the U.S. insurer from selling the stake expires on Sept. 4. If AIG does decide to sell the entire 18.6 percent stake, the deal would be Asia’s biggest-ever block offering, ahead of Vodafone plc’s $6.6 billion sale in China Mobile two years ago. A role in the AIA Group Ltd selldown could offer a major financial boost to the banks, in the form of a substantial fee for a day’s work, and a significant increase to their deal rankings heading into the final quarter of what has been a dismal year. AIG CEO Robert Benmosche has hinted previously that the stake will be sold after the lockup date expires, though he has not specified how much or when. An AIG spokesman in New York declined to comment for this story. AIG could decide not to sell anything or it could sell off a small chunk. But sources with knowledge of the matter say the investment banking industry is preparing for the U.S. insurer to unload the entire lot. “Everyone is running around to be a part of it. Most people expect AIG to clean out its position,” one financial institutions group banker said. Bailed-out AIG spun off two-thirds of AIA in 2010, raising $20.5 billion in the world’s third-largest IPO ever at the time. AIG agreed to certain restrictions on its remaining stake and sold a chunk in March, raising $6 billion. An AIA transaction would come amid a slump in equity deals in Asia- Pacific, where volumes so far in 2012 are down 33 percent to $98.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. UBS  is the region’s top stock underwriter year-to-date, followed by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Revenues across Asia at investment banks, which in a year can hit several hundred million dollars, have been dampened, as  stock offerings command the highest fees. An IPO typically offers 3 percent of the proceeds. A block deal can offer a similar payout, but fees on such a deal are rarely disclosed. Assuming even a 1 percent fee, a dozen banks could split around $80 million, with the larger payouts going to the lead bookrunners. But a block sale is riskier for banks, as it requires them to buy the shares first before distributing them. When demand flops for a block sale, banks are forced to sit on the shares, taking an immediate paper loss. Bankers had pushed hard for the March AIA mandate, in a deal so competitive that a spat occurred when the time came to assign league table credit. Deutsche Bank and Goldman got the lead roles on the deal, specifying on term sheets that they were the “active” coordinators and bookrunners. That led other banks to complain that the term sheets implied the rest were “passive”, and a major push ensued to revise the credits. In the end, all 11 banks involved got league table recognition, with Deutsche and Goldman taking a greater portion of the fees. To read a story on the matter, click: AIA’s shares are up 9.5 percent so far in 2012 and have soared about 35 percent since the IPO. Fund managers see AIA as a top choice to benefit from Asia’s growing wealth and booming demand for insurance and other financial products. The Hong Kong financial services sub-index is up 4.7 percent in 2012. Despite this year’s gains, AIA is not expensive compared to its peers. It trades at 16.3 times its 12-month forward earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data, while Asia-Pacific insurers on average trade at forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.3. AIA shares have remained resilient despite the stock overhang issue and just a week before the March selldown, the stock came within striking distance of its all-time high. AIG sold the AIA shares at HK$27.15 in the March selldown and on Friday the stock traded flat at HK$26.55. “The previous placement was done in one day and not that well anticipated by the market. Even then the stock digested the placement quite well. While this one is a little larger, it is widely anticipated and the market should not have too much trouble digesting it,” said Credit Suisse analyst Arjan van Veen. Nevertheless, taking no chances, the underwriters are expected to line up a large investor or strategic buyer to take up a big chunk of the deal.",8312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-aia/dealtalk-banks-pin-hopes-on-7-6-bln-aia-selldown-to-buffer-poor-year-idUSL4E8JU2PD20120831

399,AIG,AIG launches AIA sale to help fund $5 billion buyback,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group Inc launched a widely expected sale of a stake in its former Asian unit AIA, providing the insurer with funding to help repurchase up to $5 billion of its stock from the U.S. government. While the U.S. Treasury has not yet announced another share sale, its latest lockup expired early this month, meaning an offering would potentially bring the government’s investment below the 50 percent mark for the first time. The Treasury on Thursday declined to comment on the potential for any upcoming sales. AIG’s shares fell sharply in early trading, even as the rest of the insurance sector rallied, though they pared losses by late afternoon. One analyst said the news was “meaningfully below both our and consensus expectations.” AIG’s sale of up to $2 billion of AIA Group Ltd shares comes two days after a lock-up period on such a sale expired, but is only about a quarter of the $7.6 billion stake the U.S. insurer owned and could have sold. AIG sold $6 billion worth of AIA shares in March. AIA, Asia’s third-largest insurer, was spun out of its parent company in October 2010, when AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche oversaw the company’s listing in Hong Kong after a failed takeover offer from Prudential Plc. Since the listing, AIA’s shares have soared about 34 percent and become a top choice of fund managers looking to benefit from growing wealth in Asia and booming demand for insurance and other financial products. AIA has built a sprawling and successful business across the region, with an army of hundreds of thousands of agents. In July it reported better-than-expected first-half results, with net profit climbing 10 percent to $1.44 billion. AIG is offering about 600 million shares in a range of HK$25.75 to HK$26.75 each, equivalent to a discount of 2.1 percent and a premium of 1.7 percent to AIA’s Thursday close of HK$26.3 ($3.39), a term sheet of the deal showed. It is restricted from selling the remaining $5.6 billion stake for three months, the term sheet noted. The partial sale surprised some Hong Kong bankers and investors, who expected the company to dispose of its entire stake. It was also unusual for AIG to offer the shares at a premium, when block trades normally come at a discount to attract investors. “At the end of the day, this is small compared to AIG’s overall holding, and so it doesn’t remove much of the overhang,” said Kenneth Yue, an analyst at CCB International in Hong Kong. Benmosche said in May AIG would sell its shares in AIA in September, once the lockup expired, but early in August he told an analyst conference call he was looking for the right time and the right price to sell the stake. The AIA transaction comes amid a slump in equity deals in Asia-Pacific, where volumes so far in 2012 are down 33 percent to $98.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Deal-starved bankers in Hong Kong jostled for a role in the AIA sale, looking for a boost to their league table rankings. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs were hired to jointly manage the $2 billion block sale, the term sheet showed. Since a 2008 bailout that swelled to $182 billion, AIG has worked to shed business units and pay back the U.S. government. The U.S. Treasury in August reduced its stake in AIG to 53 percent with the sale of nearly $6 billion worth of shares for $30.50 per share. The shares fell 0.9 percent to $34.48 in late-afternoon trading, well off their morning lows. The stock is nearly 50 percent higher for the year. In a statement, AIG said its board had authorized $5 billion in buybacks, solely from the Treasury, which replaces all other authorizations. The company noted there was no guarantee the government would conduct an offering. “The sale of only a partial stake of AIA and only $5 (billion) of potential buybacks leaves us underwhelmed, and we expect the stock will come under considerable pressure given the much lower-than-expected buybacks from Treasury near-term,” Sterne Agee analyst John Nadel said in a note to clients. At current prices, assuming AIG used the entire $5 billion, the government’s stake would be reduced to around 44 percent. After an early 2011 recapitalization, the Treasury held 92 percent of the company, a position it has reduced with four subsequent sales. AIG is funding only part of the buyback with the AIA proceeds because of ample capital elsewhere to pay for the rest. In early August the company had more than $11 billion in parent company liquidity, which analysts expect to be largely devoted to buying the government out of the stock.

401,AIG,"AIG, Goldman lead Gimme Credit list of top debt issuers","* Gimme Credit analyst says AIG brand no longer toxic * Goldman seen attractive due to strong finances * Energy, finance names dominate list By Ben Berkowitz Sept 6 (Reuters) - Four years after it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy and had to be saved by a record-breaking government bailout, insurer AIG is now one of the most attractive issuers of investment-grade debt in the country, research firm Gimme Credit said on Thursday. American International Group Inc. and investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc led the firm’s latest Investment Grade Top Ten list, which looks at issuers whose bonds are expected to outperform over the next six months. Given its recent history, AIG was a surprise inclusion on the list. The company’s $182 billion taxpayer-funded bailout was at one time supposed to lead to a fire sale of assets, before a new management team changed direction to focus on core areas like U.S. life insurance and global property coverage. The company has returned to sustained profitability, the U.S. Treasury has managed to sell shares four times in the last 18 months, and the stock is up 50 percent this year. “We’re looking at the credit spread that an investor can get on the bond relative to other names,” Gimme Credit analyst Kathy Shanley said of AIG in an interview. “Because AIG was a toxic name for so long and because it is still in the recovery process, the spreads remain relatively attractive.” AIG’s most recent senior debt offering was for $1.5 billion in 4.875 percent 10-year senior notes issued in late May. The price of the notes has risen steadily since the offering, driving the yield down to 3.746 percent as of Wednesday. On Goldman, Shanley said it was attractive because of strong liquidity and capital, as well as faith in management’s ability to adapt to changing markets. “We expect it to exploit new opportunities (such as private banking) even in a more regulated world,” she said in a report accompanying the list. In the interview, Shanley said there were actually some advantages to the heightened regulation from a credit perspective, because it might keep financial companies from taking the kinds of risks that would endanger credit quality. The rest of the list spanned financials (the GE Capital arm of General Electric ); energy and utilities (Cenovus Energy, Exelon Generation, Marathon Petroleum ); media and technology (Interpublic Group , Motorola Solutions ); and retail and consumer products (AutoZone, Newell Rubbermaid ).",9062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/bonds-investmentgrade-top-ten-embargoed/aig-goldman-lead-gimme-credit-list-of-top-debt-issuers-idUSL2E8K56AR20120906

403,AIG,"AIG sells AIA shares at surprise premium, raises $2 billion","HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said it raised $2.02 billion through the sale of a partial stake in its former Asian unit AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK), placing the shares at a surprise premium although analysts were disappointed at the size of the sale. AIG will use the proceeds to buy back up to $5 billion of its stock from the U.S. Treasury, helping to cut the U.S. government’s holding in AIG to below 50 percent for the first time since a $182 billion bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. Treasury is yet to announce plans for a further stake sale in AIG, but a lockup on its next offering expired early this month. The Treasury on Thursday declined to comment. Following the latest block sale, AIG will be left with 13.69 percent stake in AIA, valued at $5.9 billion. AIG is barred from selling any further shares till December 10. The widely expected sale of AIA shares was covered “multiple times” a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Block deals are normally sold at a discount to attract investors, but AIG sold the shares at HK$26.50 each, a 0.8 percent premium to Thursday’s close. AIA shares rose 5.3 percent to HK$27.65 on Friday as traders who had been shorting the stock in anticipation of a weaker price due to the sell-down were forced to buy back shares. AIG did not disclose the buyers, but said the shares were purchased by institutional investors. The shares were sold at a premium due to demand from institutions who would find it difficult to buy such a large block of AIA shares in the open market without disturbing the price, the source added. The source declined to be identified as the details of the share placement was not confidential. Since its listing in 2010, AIA’s shares have soared about 41 percent and become a top choice of fund managers looking to benefit from growing wealth in Asia and booming demand for insurance and other financial products. AIG shares fell 1.7 percent on Thursday, and one analyst said the news was “meaningfully below both our and consensus expectations”.

In a statement, AIG said its board had authorized $5 billion in buybacks, solely from the Treasury, which replaces all other authorizations. The company noted there was no guarantee the government would conduct an offering. “The sale of only a partial stake of AIA and only $5 (billion) of potential buybacks leaves us underwhelmed, and we expect the stock will come under considerable pressure given the much lower-than-expected buybacks from Treasury near-term,” Sterne Agee analyst John Nadel said in a note to clients. At current prices, assuming AIG used the entire $5 billion, the government’s stake would be reduced to around 44 percent. After an early 2011 recapitalization, the Treasury held 92 percent of the company, a position it has reduced with four subsequent sales. AIG is funding only part of the buyback with the AIA proceeds because of ample capital elsewhere to pay for the rest. In early August the company had more than $11 billion in parent company liquidity, which analysts expect to be largely devoted to buying the government out of the stock.

410,AIG,Treasury launches $18 billion AIG stock offering,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Sunday said it will sell most of its stake in insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), making the government a minority investor for the first time since it rescued the company four years ago. While the Treasury was universally expected to sell stock this month, the magnitude of the planned offering — $18 billion — was a surprise that will take the government stake in what had been the world’s largest insurer to around 20 percent from 53 percent currently. The sale will trigger a number of changes for AIG, the most important of which is that it will now fall under Federal Reserve regulation as a savings and loan holding company, since the company owns a small bank. The Treasury will also lose the ability to dictate the terms of further stock sales. AIG said it would buy up to $5 billion of the offering. Last week the company sold part of its stake in the Asian insurer AIA (1299.HK) to help fund that buyback. A number of analysts who follow AIG said at the time they were disappointed the company was not buying back more shares, though they also assumed the eventual government offering would be much smaller than it has turned out to be. The sale, Treasury’s biggest sell-down of its AIG stake so far, comes as President Barack Obama campaigns for a second term and has been forced to defend his support of decisions to use taxpayer money to prop up companies during the financial crisis. The administration has been unwinding its position in the politically unpopular financial crisis bailout programs, with more than 300 small banks having yet to repay taxpayers.

If the Treasury were to sell $18 billion at AIG’s Friday closing price, it would be selling roughly 529 million shares. Treasury said it will also grant to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $2.7 billion of common stock to cover any over-allotments.

413,AIG,AIG shares slip on plans for large U.S. Treasury sale,"(Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N) shares fell 2 percent on Monday as investors braced for the Treasury Department to unload at least $18 billion worth of stock in what could be the largest follow-on offering in the history of the U.S. stock market. The offering represents the government’s biggest sell-down of AIG since rescuing the insurer with bailouts in 2008 and 2009. The planned stock sale would be the largest secondary stock offering since December 2009, and the largest equity offering since Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) initial public offering in May, according to Thomson Reuters data. If investor appetite is strong enough for an additional $2.7 billion worth of overallotment options, the AIG stock sale could be the largest secondary offering on record. IPO Boutique, which advises on equity offerings, said on Monday afternoon the deal was oversubscribed and expected to trade on Tuesday. AIG’s stock closed 2 percent lower at $33.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, the first trading day since the Treasury Department announced on Sunday its plan to sell shares. Investors had widely expected the Treasury to cash out of its AIG shares, but many investors had expected the sales to happen over a longer period of time. Companies have been hesitant to sell stock recently due to market volatility and a lack of investor appetite. Through September 7, year-to-date equity capital markets proceeds were down 27 percent from the same period in 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data, with IPOs down 47 percent and follow-on offerings down 16 percent. “Everyone wants the government to eventually get out of the stock because it’s been a hangup for the company,” said Eric Steiman, an individual investor who owns AIG shares and publishes his investment approach on the web site Covestor. “It’s just a matter of, ‘can the market handle a huge offering?’” A stock sale of $18 billion would be the biggest follow-on offering since Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) sold $19.3 billion worth of stock in 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also reduce the government’s stake in AIG to roughly 20 percent from a current level of 53 percent. That decrease will trigger an important regulatory change for AIG, because once the Treasury’s ownership stake falls below 50 percent, the insurer will start to be regulated by the Federal Reserve as a savings and loan holding company, since AIG owns a small bank. As a result, AIG will have to comply with new rules under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that was passed in 2010, including the Volcker rule, which limits large financial firms’ ability to trade for their own account or own stakes in private equity firms and hedge funds. Even if AIG were to rid itself of the savings-and-loan subsidiary, the Federal Reserve may still designate AIG as a “systemically important financial institution” because of its size. That would subject it to other, stricter federal regulations for large financial firms, including higher capital requirements, stress tests and possible dividend and buyback restrictions. The threat of increased regulation also caused some concern among investors, Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome said in a report. The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve extended a combined $182 billion lifeline to AIG at the peak of the financial crisis, after losses on subprime-mortgage derivatives and credit rating downgrades forced the insurer to come up with a lot of cash quickly. In exchange, the government received a nearly 80 percent equity stake in the company, a high interest rate on loans it extended and some level of management control including board seats and a say on executive pay. Some of the bailout money was never used and the bulk of the remaining funds have been recouped through stock offerings and asset sales. AIG still owes U.S. taxpayers $24.2 billion, according to the company. Treasury’s sale comes as President Barack Obama campaigns for a second term and has been forced to defend his support of decisions to use taxpayer money to prop up companies during the financial crisis. A White House spokesman said on Monday that the AIG stock sale represents a “commitment to recover taxpayer money” and that President Obama is pleased with progress in winding down the government’s stake. The administration has been unwinding its position in the politically unpopular financial crisis programs ahead of the November 6 election amid Republican campaign pressure over the role of the government in the private sector. The government has recouped $342 billion out of $411 billion disbursed to financial institutions through the most prominent bailout, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. But more than 300 small banks that received TARP funds have yet to repay taxpayers. Rescues of AIG and other large banks included other bailout programs. “From the government’s point of view, it’s political,” former AIG Chief Executive Hank Greenberg said in an interview on CNBC, adding that the government had hoped to exit its bailout investments much sooner. AIG itself will buy back $5 billion of its shares in the upcoming stock sale, with the rest going to the broader public. AIG will use $3 billion worth of cash and short-term securities, and $2 billion in proceeds from the sale of its stake in Asian life insurer AIA Group to buy back stock from the government, the company said in a securities filing on Monday. AIG repurchasing shares near its current price - roughly 56 percent of book value - is likely to boost earnings through an accounting gain, but it will also reduce a good portion of cash, Greenberg said. AIG’s largest private shareholder, Bruce Berkowitz, declined to comment on the upcoming stock sale through a spokeswoman. Underwriters for the deal include Citigroup Inc (C.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch division, Barclays PLC (BARC.L), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Royal Bank of Canada’s (RY.TO) RBC Capital Markets division, UBS AG UBSN.VX, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Credit Suisse CSGN.VX and Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX).

414,AIG,UPDATE 5-U.S. Treasury launches $18 billion AIG stock offering,"* AIG to buy back $5 billion of offering * Sale likely to bring AIG under Fed oversight * Execs expect full government exit by 2013 By Soyoung Kim and David Henry NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said it will sell most of its stake in insurer American International Group Inc, making the government a minority investor for the first time since it rescued the company in the depths of the financial crisis four years ago. While the Treasury was universally expected to sell stock this month, the magnitude of the planned $18 billion offering was a surprise that will take the government stake in what had been the world’s largest insurer to around 20 percent from 53 percent currently. The sale announced on Sunday will trigger a number of changes for AIG, the most important of which is that it will now fall under Federal Reserve regulation as a savings and loan holding company since the company owns a small bank. The Treasury will also lose the ability to dictate the terms of further stock sales. AIG said it would buy up to $5 billion of the offering. Last week the company sold part of its stake in the Asian insurer AIA  to help fund that buyback. A number of analysts who follow AIG said at the time they were disappointed the company was not buying back more shares, although they also assumed the eventual government offering would be much smaller than it has turned out to be. Barclays Capital, in a research note Friday, said investors were likely to be disappointed if the government was not out of the stock by the November election. The sale, Treasury’s biggest sell-down of its AIG stake so far, comes as President Barack Obama campaigns for a second term and has been forced to defend his support of decisions to use taxpayer money to prop up companies during the financial crisis. The administration has been unwinding its position in the politically unpopular financial crisis programs ahead of the election, amid heavy Republican campaign pressure over the value of the bailouts, with more than 300 small banks having yet to repay taxpayers. The government also still owns 74 percent of Ally Financial  Inc, the former General Motors auto finance unit that was wrecked by bad mortgage loans. Likewise, The government has redeemed all of its holdings of Citigroup Inc except for $3 billion of preferred securities on which it receives an 8 percent dividend. But the Treasury has steadfastly denied it was rushing to exit the AIG stake before the election, a stance it reiterated on Sunday, even as the repeated profitable sales of the insurer’s stock burnished the reputation of the crisis-era rescue programs. That boost could help the president in his election battle with Republican nominee Mitt Romney. The announcement also comes in the week that the Federal Reserve is expected to announce it is providing the U.S. economy with further monetary stimulus, probably through a third round of so-called quantitative easing. Expectations of the Fed action helped to drive the S&P; 500 to its highest level in more than four years last week, meaning market conditions could be welcoming for the larger AIG sale. The stock has also benefited from that run-up, gaining more than 10 percent in the last month. With the Treasury’s break-even point at $28.72 and AIG shares closing Friday at $33.99, this sale is likely to be profitable as were the government’s four prior offerings of the company’s stock. If the Treasury were to sell $18 billion at AIG’s Friday closing price, it would be selling roughly 529 million shares. Treasury said it will also grant to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $2.7 billion of common stock to cover any over-allotments. If that option were exercised in full, it would cut Treasury’s stake in the company closer to 15 percent. The announcement on Sunday comes just a month after the Treasury sold 188.5 million AIG shares for $5.75 billion in a public offering. That sale was priced at $30.50 per share. AIG executives, among them CEO Bob Benmosche, have said of late they expect the government to be out of the insurer by 2013. Benmosche, who has been fighting cancer while running the company over the last couple of years, is widely credited with saving AIG from a fire sale of assets and redirecting it toward the form it has taken today. The company’s three pillars are the global property insurer Chartis, the U.S. life insurance and annuity company SunAmerica and the market-leading mortgage insurer United Guaranty. Still to be determined is the fate of airplane leasing business ILFC.

415,AIG,AIG may come under much more U.S. regulatory oversight,"(Reuters) - A federal panel may tag American International Group Inc as “too big to fail,” a move the company has been expecting and one that would sharply increase regulatory oversight of the government-rescued insurer. AIG said on Tuesday that the Financial Stability Oversight Council had said it may designate the company as a “systemically important financial institution,” or SIFI, under the Dodd-Frank reform laws. The FSOC is charged with identifying banks and nonbank institutions that are so large or otherwise so important that their collapse could have repercussions across the economy. It has now moved AIG to the so-called Stage 3 review process for nonbank SIFIs. In the third stage, the council looks for factors that would “mitigate or aggravate” a company’s potential to cause harm, including its “resolvability, the opacity of its operations, its complexity, and the extent and nature of its existing regulatory scrutiny,” according to final rules adopted earlier this year. AIG, which received a $182 billion bailout after nearly failing four years ago, has said repeatedly that it fully expects to be tagged by the FSOC and that it has been preparing itself accordingly. In its second-quarter financial report, AIG said it was large enough to meet at least the beginning criteria for an FSOC review, although it could not predict the outcomes of the second- or third-stage reviews. For much of the period since the rescue, the company did not have a primary regulator. If the company is ultimately designated by the council, the Federal Reserve would assume that role. Shares of AIG were up 0.8 percent at $33.54 in early trading. Early last month, the U.S. Treasury sold more than $20 billion of AIG stock at $32.50 per share, reducing its ownership in the company to 15.9 percent.

The U.S.-based insurance company said it had struck a deal to sponsor the World Cup winning All Blacks and five other national teams, with the company’s logo to be displayed on the jersey and shorts of their playing and training gear. “Prominently associating the AIG brand with the All Blacks and the highly competitive and successful New Zealand Rugby Union teams, as well as passionate rugby fans around the world, represents a tremendous opportunity for AIG, the NZRU, and rugby,” AIG President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Benmosche said in a statement. No financial details of the sponsorship deal were disclosed, though the NZRU said they believed it to be “the second most valuable rugby sponsorship” in the world. The organisation’s apparel agreement with Adidas, which runs until 2019, is reportedly the highest sponsorship deal in rugby. “Today’s announcement is a game changer for New Zealand rugby,” NZRU Chief Executive Steve Tew said in a statement. “AIG’s support provides significant additional financial security for the NZRU. “The partnership will help ensure rugby continues to flourish at the community level upwards so that we can keep producing winning teams, run the most exciting competitions in the world and keep turning out, and retaining, the world’s best players and coaches.” The All Blacks jerseys carried a small sponsorship logo of a New Zealand beer brand during the 1990s but have been ‘clean’ since the Adidas deal began in 1999. “Like all New Zealanders we greatly respect the rich and proud heritage of the black jersey, which is why NZRU consulted with senior players and others as we carefully weighed up this latest move,” Tew added. “On balance it is a very positive opportunity to secure the additional funds that we need to help safeguard the future of the game in this country.” The NZRU had consulted with Adidas, which endorsed the new deal. The All Blacks Sevens side will be the first to wear the new jersey and shorts at this week’s IRB World Sevens series on the Gold Coast.

State regulators have alleged that insurers used the list of recently deceased people to stop making annuity payments to dead customers, but, at the same time, did not use the list to check whether any life insurance policy holders had passed away. In a statement, Pennsylvania authorities said AIG had agreed to use the death master file “on a uniform basis” to find dead policyholders and pay beneficiaries. The company said in a statement it began a process of matching policyholder records against the death master database last year to find accounts where no claim had been made yet. AIG also said it would increase reserves by $55 million in the third quarter to cover potentially accelerated benefit payments under the settlement. In addition to Pennsylvania, the other states listed on the agreement were Florida, North Dakota, California, Illinois, New Hampshire and Texas. AIG shares fell 1.3 percent to $35.22 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

427,AIG,"AIG reports big investment gains, premium profits down","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) earned a larger-than-expected profit during the third quarter, due in part to big gains on its investment holdings. Questions about the sustainability of those profits, and uncertainty about the timing and structure of the U.S. Treasury Department selling its remaining 16 percent stake in the insurance giant, contributed to a drop in AIG shares in after-hours trading, analysts said. “One of the biggest questions that people ask is the timing of the next offering of the U.S. government and whether AIG will participate in that offering,” said Paul Newsome, an analyst who covers the firm for Sandler O’Neill Partners. AIG had received $182.5 billion in bailout money from U.S. taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis, and has been working to repay the government for the past few years. The remaining stake pertains to AIG shares the Treasury Department owns in exchange for capital it infused. Last quarter, the Treasury Department sold $26.5 billion worth of AIG shares, including approximately $8 billion purchased by AIG. The government still holds 234.2 million common shares. The timing of future sales, and whether AIG will repurchase stock, is unclear. AIG reported an overall profit of $1.9 billion, or $1.13 per share, for the period, compared with a loss of nearly $3 billion, or $2.10 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected AIG to earn 86 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Because competitors like Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported even stronger third-quarter results, it may have set investors’ expectations even higher for AIG than what analyst figures suggest, Newsome said. AIG shares fell 2 percent after it reported results. The stock had closed at $35.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Combined net investment income from AIG’s property-casualty and life and retirement divisions rose 15 percent, contributing $505 million to earnings. AIG’s sale of certain securities, including a stake in former subsidiary AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK), as well as higher values of bond holdings, contributed to those profits. In AIG’s property-casualty division, net premium earnings fell 3.2 percent during the quarter. Pricing improved, but AIG has been limiting risk-taking in the business, the company said. In its life and retirement division, premiums declined 2.7 percent. Policy fees climbed 5 percent, but low interest rates and costs related to a regulatory probe into death benefits claims also weighed on that business. AIG’s other business, aircraft leasing, also reported a small operating profit, compared with a large loss a year ago. Chief Executive Robert Benmosche, in an interview with CNBC, said he was still waiting for markets to improve before trying to take that business, ILFC Holdings, public.

434,AIG,AIG to focus on managing debt rather than buybacks,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) will focus on managing its debt coverage ratio rather than share buybacks now that the Federal Reserve has become the company’s primary regulator, Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said on Friday. On a conference call with analysts, Benmosche said the Federal Reserve has begun to oversee AIG as its primary regulator, a function related to the small savings and loan that AIG owns. AIG is expected to be designated a systemically important financial institution by a federal panel, which would mean continued Fed oversight regardless of the bank unit. The insurer, rescued in late 2008 with a federal government bailout that ultimately topped $182 billion, said it would have about $2.5 billion in extra capital it could deploy if it sold off the remainder of its stake in AIA (1299.HK). AIG spun off two-thirds of that Asian insurer in 2010 as part of its restructuring and subsequently reduced its stake just below 20 percent. But on the conference call, Chief Financial Officer David Herzog said the company was still considering how it might use capital in relation to its debt. “We haven’t specifically identified any specific transactions that are under consideration,” he said. Up to now, AIG has been using excess capital to buy back shares from the U.S. Treasury, which at one point owned 92 percent of AIG following its rescue. After the government’s most recent sale, that is down to 15.9 percent. On Thursday, AIG reported a larger-than-expected profit for the third quarter, due in part to gains on investment holdings, though analysts said the profits might not have been as strong as those at some peers.

439,AIG,"AIG keen to sell bank, expand mortgages: CEO","HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) is planning to sell its savings and loan business as soon as a federal panel labels the insurance giant “too big to fail,” its chief executive said on Monday. But even without a banking business, AIG is now looking more aggressively at making and purchasing mortgages as investment vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Bob Benmosche said in a telephone interview from Tokyo. AIG, which received $182.5 billion in bailout money from U.S. taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis four years ago, has been working to repay the government and regain its credibility ever since. Although the U.S. government still owns more than 15 percent of the company, the bailout has been repaid in full and actually generated a profit since. AIG is regulated by the Federal Reserve because it has a savings and loan business. But even without it, the insurer is likely to come under permanent Fed oversight anyway as a “systemically important financial institution,” or SIFI. Those designations have not been made yet, but AIG has said all along it is certain to receive one. Benmosche said of the S&L;, “we are planning to close it down. It’s a business that doesn’t makes sense to be in.” He said he would wait to sell the unit so there would be no break in regulatory oversight. He declined to discuss how much the sale might fetch, but he said the business had less than $1 billion of assets. Having the Fed oversee AIG’s liquidity and capital structure is strategically important because it establishes credibility, said Benmosche, who was in Japan overseeing a rebranding effort. Benmosche said he did not know when AIG would receive the SIFI label. “We’re exploring a sale, we’re exploring turning it into a trust vehicle rather than a savings institution with deposits. We’re looking at a whole bunch of options,” he said. AIG has spoken to banks as potential purchasers and hired lawyers, Benmosche said. Even as it looks to sell off the bank, though, one place AIG is bulking up is in mortgages. The company’s mortgage insurer, UGC, has become unexpectedly strong in recent years as competitors have faltered due to crisis-era losses. But Benmosche said AIG would like to go even deeper than just insuring home loans. “We are also now looking at ways we could become direct investors in mortgages,” he said. “We are going to do more of our own direct lending, both commercially and residentially.” AIG’s motivation is the same as for many insurers in this persistently low interest rate environment — yield. With fixed income portfolios struggling, insurers are hungry for even a few extra basis points of relatively safe return. Benmosche said “it makes a big deal” at the current low rates to get that little bit of extra yield by buying mortgages directly, which is why he said AIG is talking to big banks about buying their non-agency mortgage debt. The CEO, credited with turning AIG around from a battered company in the midst of a fire sale of assets, has been active in the media, talking up AIG’s prospects after a November 1 earnings report that some analysts found disappointing. Shares are down nearly 10 percent since the earnings, with most of that coming after the company said it would ease up on buybacks in favor of using its capital to manage its debt load. On Monday alone, the stock fell 1 percent to $31.85, nearing closing lows last seen three months ago. One way AIG might manage that debt is with the sale of ILFC ILFC.N, its aircraft leasing business. The company filed for an IPO of ILFC in the fall of 2011, but progress has been stymied by weak markets. Benmosche said Monday the sale would have to wait until circumstances improved. “The main thing is we feel we should try to get to a 51 percent sale such that we can deconsolidate the debt from AIG, so that’s a target that we have, but we will have to see how it goes,” he said. “We are looking for a major launch that gets us more than halfway there.” With the debt under control, and buybacks essentially completed, AIG has talked about the possibility of paying a dividend as soon as next year. “There’s several things we could be doing and we are still exploring all of those possibilities,” Benmosche said.

441,AIG,NY Fed wins dismissal of ex-AIG CEO's bailout lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York won the dismissal of former American International Group Inc Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s $25 billion lawsuit accusing it of unlawfully bailing out the insurer during the 2008 financial crisis. The decision issued Monday by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan was a ringing endorsement of broad central bank power to try to preserve the global financial system from systemic threats. It was also a defeat for Greenberg, 87, and his Starr International Co. Before the bailout, AIG had been the world’s largest insurer by market value and Starr was its largest shareholder, with a 12 percent stake. “The decision vindicates the Fed at every turn,” said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “It shows a willingness, now and in the future, to give the Federal Reserve extraordinary flexibility to respond to a financial crisis without a serious risk of potential legal liability.” Starr accused the New York Fed of engineering a “backdoor” bailout for Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc at the expense of AIG shareholders, by forcing the insurer to unwind its bets on mortgage debt through hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps. It also contended that the New York Fed breached its duties to shareholders under the law of Delaware, where New York-based AIG is incorporated. But Engelmayer said AIG acted out of “corporate desperation” in accepting the $182.3 billion rescue. He also rejected Starr’s likening the New York Fed to a “loan shark” for providing an initial $85 billion credit line at a 14.5 percent interest rate. “Merely because the AIG board felt it had ‘no choice’ but to accept bitter terms from its sole available rescuer does not mean that that rescuer actually controlled the company,” Engelmayer wrote. The judge also found nothing to suggest that AIG directors who approved the unwinding of the swaps were “in any way less than 100 percent independent.” Starr and Greenberg sued over the bailout last November and are still suing the New York Fed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., under different legal theories. Robert Dwyer, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner who represents Greenberg, said Starr may appeal Engelmayer’s decision to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. He said the decision will not affect the Washington, D.C. case. Greenberg’s office had no immediate comment. The New York Fed said in a statement: “We are pleased with the court’s decision to dismiss this case, which we have always believed to be without merit.” Richard Epstein, a professor at New York University School of Law, said the ruling was not surprising because the New York Fed could not be held legally responsible to always craft perfect solutions in times of crisis. “It’s just too much to demand of anybody that in the face of all these kinds of turmoil, you come up with the optimal solution when no one is clear about what the optimal solution is,” he said. AIG was bailed out on September 16, 2008, one day after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt, as losses soared from the credit default swaps. Greenberg, who led AIG for nearly four decades before he was ousted in 2005, accused the New York Fed of wasting more than $60 billion of AIG and taxpayer funds through the bailout. He said the rescue terms improperly benefited banks such as Goldman, Deutsche Bank AG and Societe Generale, allowing favored counterparties to be repaid in full and freed from legal liability. Greenberg also said the New York Fed improperly let the U.S. Treasury take a 79.9 percent stake in AIG without giving a vote to existing shareholders who would be diluted. The government stake has since fallen to about 15.9 percent. At the time of the bailout, Henry Paulson headed the U.S. Treasury Department, and his successor Timothy Geithner was president of the New York Fed. Engelmayer found that the New York Fed appropriately exercised its authority to try to preserve the banking system, reduce the threat of “grave national and international financial repercussions” and minimize losses to the public. “While driving a hard bargain with the counterparties might have saved AIG and its shareholders money, (the New York Fed) could reasonably conclude that its statutory mission of stabilizing the economy made speed and closure a top priority,” he wrote. “It could reasonably conclude that it was time for the cycle of collateral calls and mammoth rescue loans to end; that the stability of the U.S. economy required decisively terminating AIG’s exposure to counterparties; and that paying par value - as opposed to opening up a bazaar of uncertain and maybe protracted negotiations with counterparties - was the best means to attain such closure.” Engelmayer also said Delaware law should not be used to impose duties on the New York Fed that “squarely conflict” with the New York Fed’s federal responsibilities. He dismissed Starr’s claims “with prejudice,” meaning they cannot be brought again. “The judge is saying that an instrument of government such as the New York Fed serves interests much broader than the private interest of any single party,” said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. In the case before the Court of Federal Claims, which handles lawsuits seeking money from the government, Starr said the AIG bailout deprived shareholders of their due process and equal protection rights through an illegal “taking” of property. The presiding judge, Thomas Wheeler, in July allowed Starr to pursue that lawsuit. But Skeel, the University of Pennsylvania law professor, questioned its prospects in light of Engelmayer’s findings. “The fact that this was so decisively rejected raises doubts about the likelihood of success of the takings case,” he said. Shares of AIG were up 1.6 percent, at $32.31 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They have lost more than 97 percent of their value since credit conditions began to tighten in the middle of 2007. The cases are Starr International Co v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-08422; and Starr International Co v. U.S., U.S. Court of Federal Claims, No. 11-00779.

The judge also found nothing to suggest that AIG directors who approved the unwinding of the swaps were “in any way less than 100 percent independent.” Starr and Greenberg sued over the bailout last November and are still suing the New York Fed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., under different legal theories. Robert Dwyer, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner who represents Greenberg, said Starr may appeal Engelmayer’s decision to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. He said the decision will not affect the Washington, D.C. case. Greenberg’s office had no immediate comment. The New York Fed said in a statement: “We are pleased with the court’s decision to dismiss this case, which we have always believed to be without merit.” Richard Epstein, a professor at New York University School of Law, said the ruling was not surprising because the New York Fed could not be held legally responsible to always craft perfect solutions in times of crisis. “It’s just too much to demand of anybody that in the face of all these kinds of turmoil, you come up with the optimal solution when no one is clear about what the optimal solution is,” he said. AIG was bailed out on Sept. 16, 2008, one day after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt, as losses soared from the credit default swaps. Greenberg, who led AIG for nearly four decades before he was ousted in 2005, accused the New York Fed of wasting more than $60 billion of AIG and taxpayer funds through the bailout. He said the rescue terms improperly benefited banks such as Goldman, Deutsche Bank AG and Societe Generale , allowing favored counterparties to be repaid in full and freed from legal liability. Greenberg also said the New York Fed improperly let the U.S. Treasury take a 79.9 percent stake in AIG without giving a vote to existing shareholders who would be diluted. The government stake has since fallen to about 15.9 percent. At the time of the bailout, Henry Paulson headed the U.S. Treasury Department, and his successor Timothy Geithner was president of the New York Fed. Engelmayer found that the New York Fed appropriately exercised its authority to try to preserve the banking system, reduce the threat of “grave national and international financial repercussions” and minimize losses to the public. “While driving a hard bargain with the counterparties might have saved AIG and its shareholders money, (the New York Fed) could reasonably conclude that its statutory mission of stabilizing the economy made speed and closure a top priority,” he wrote. “It could reasonably conclude that it was time for the cycle of collateral calls and mammoth rescue loans to end; that the stability of the U.S. economy required decisively terminating AIG’s exposure to counterparties; and that paying par value - as opposed to opening up a bazaar of uncertain and maybe protracted negotiations with counterparties - was the best means to attain such closure.” Engelmayer also said Delaware law should not be used to impose duties on the New York Fed that “squarely conflict” with the New York Fed’s federal responsibilities. He dismissed Starr’s claims “with prejudice,” meaning they cannot be brought again. “The judge is saying that an instrument of government such as the New York Fed serves interests much broader than the private interest of any single party,” said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. In the case before the Court of Federal Claims, which handles lawsuits seeking money from the government, Starr said the AIG bailout deprived shareholders of their due process and equal protection rights through an illegal “taking” of property. The presiding judge, Thomas Wheeler, in July allowed Starr to pursue that lawsuit. But Skeel, the University of Pennsylvania law professor, questioned its prospects in light of Engelmayer’s findings. “The fact that this was so decisively rejected raises doubts about the likelihood of success of the takings case,” he said. Shares of AIG were up 1.6 percent, at $32.31 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They have lost more than 97 percent of their value since credit conditions began to tighten in the middle of 2007. The cases are Starr International Co v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-08422; and Starr International Co v.

445,AIG,"UPDATE 3-AIG, others to take up half of China PICC's $3.6 bln HK IPO","* Offer revises down valuation to $15.4 bln-$18.2 bln * 17 cornerstone investors pledge $1.85 bln toward IPO * AIG, State Grid, Sinomach among investors * Offer set to be priced on Nov. 30 By Elzio Barreto and Fiona Lau HONG KONG, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Chinese state-owned insurer PICC Group has secured pledges from American International Group (AIG) and other investors to buy about half of its up to $3.6 billion IPO, set to be the biggest in Hong Kong in two years. The long-awaited offering is set to be priced on Nov. 30. Underwriters have revised down the company valuation and the IPO size, sources with direct knowledge of the deal said,  underscoring the tough environment for fundraising and PICC’s  need to boost its capital base to support business growth. People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China (PICC), one of China’s largest insurers, is tapping the Hong Kong equity market at a time when IPO volumes in the financial centre have tumbled more than 80 percent. PICC will be the biggest Hong Kong IPO since another insurer, AIA Group Ltd, raised $20.5 billion in 2010. The company secured $1.85 billion in commitments from 17 cornerstone investors as varied as Chinese utility State Grid Corp, the country’s leading gold miner Zijin Mining Group, defence contractor Spacechina and China Life Insurance Co Ltd , the sources said. So-called cornerstone investments in IPOs are unique to Asia, where large and well-established investors are guaranteed big allotments in return for holding their shares for a certain period of time, giving investors confidence in the deal. U.S. insurer AIG was added to the list of cornerstone investors who initially signed up, pledging $500 million to the IPO, sources said. It was unclear what caused the delay, but one source had earlier said AIG had dropped out due to valuation issues. AIG was not immediately available for comment. The list is still subject to last minute changes, sources said. “The seller (PICC) is pushing the envelope on valuations,” one of the sources added. French reinsurer Scor and Tokio Marine Holdings  are among the global companies who have committed to buy PICC shares. Scor could not be reached immediately for comment. A Tokio Marine spokesman declined to comment. The price range for the IPO was set at HK$3.43-HK$4.03 per share, valuing PICC at 96 billion yuan to 113.2 billion yuan ($15.4 billion to $18.2 billion) before the IPO, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported, citing four sources familiar with the matter. That is lower than the 130 billion yuan valuation initially sought, IFR added. PICC is offering 6.9 billion primary shares, or 16.7 percent of its enlarged capital, aiming to raise 19.18 billion yuan to 22.6 billion yuan. A record 17 banks have been roped in to sell the offer, which is being marketed to global institutions. IFR previously reported the IPO had been expected to value PICC at $20.8 billion to $30.5 billion, or at 2-2.5 times the 2013 price to book value and at a 2013 price to earnings ratio of 10.5-15, according to pre-deal research reports. Asian insurers on average trade at around 15.9 times forward price to earnings, Thomson Reuters data shows. PICC’s listing comes at a time when the volume of new offerings in Hong Kong has plunged, with IPO activity likely to shrink to its lowest since 2008 as investors shun new deals due to volatility caused by Europe’s debt troubles. Overall issuance in the city is little changed so far in 2012 from 2011 at about $38 billion, but the year has been a dismal one for IPOs, down more than 80 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Most of the activity has been from so-called block deals that target institutional investors, including a $6 billion offering of AIA stock in March and a $2.5 billion sale of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China shares in April. PICC and companies including Future Land Development Holdings Ltd will test investors’ appetite for IPOs in coming weeks with nearly $5.2 billion of deals. Founded in 1949, PICC is China’s first nationwide insurer and has 2.42 million institutional insurance clients and about 130 million individual insurance customers, more than the entire population of Japan. The company is controlled by China’s Ministry of Finance, which has an 88.7 percent stake, while the National Social Security Fund holds the remainder. China International Capital Corp (CICC), Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and HSBC Holdings Plc won mandates as sponsors of the deal. The list of banks also helping to underwrite the IPO includes Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley  and UBS AG, as well Chinese firms such as ABC International and BOC International.",11212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-picc-ipo/update-3-aig-others-to-take-up-half-of-china-piccs-3-6-bln-hk-ipo-idUSL1E8MKG2X20121121

The non-binding agreement announced on Thursday brings AIG closer to its roots in China, where the company’s predecessor was founded more than 90 years ago, and is part of AIG’s plan to invest $500 million in PICC’s planned Hong Kong initial public offering. People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China (PICC) is seeking to raise up to $3.6 billion through the IPO, with AIG and other investors agreeing to buy nearly 50 percent of the shares. To demonstrate its commitment, AIG agreed not to sell more than 25 percent of its stake in PICC for a period of five years after the IPO. But it may offload the entire stake if final legal documentation for the proposed venture with PICC isn’t completed by May 2013, the U.S. company said in a statement. AIG plans to step up in presence in China, by setting up a joint venture with PICC Life, a unit of the Chinese insurer, to distribute life insurance and other products primarily in large cities. AIG’s current Asian exposure includes a 13.7 percent stake in its former Asian unit AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK) and a 9.9 percent stake in PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd 2328.HK>, a unit of PICC Group. AIG was forced to spin off two-thirds of AIA in 2010 as part of a package of asset sales to help repay $182 billion in bailout funds it received from the U.S. government during the 2008 global financial crisis. China had the fifth largest life insurance market in the world in 2011 with $134.5 billion in total written premium, PICC said in its preliminary IPO prospectus, citing figures from the Sigma Report compiled by Swiss Re. Life insurance penetration in China reached 1.8 percent at the end of 2011, compared with 8.8 percent in Japan and 3.6 percent in the United States, it added. PICC Life ranked third among life insurers in China in the six months ended June 2012, with 57.2 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) in total written premium in the period, the company said. It has a life and health insurance distribution network of about 2,200 branches. PICC’s life insurance business accounted for about 29 percent of its gross written premium of 149.2 billion yuan in the six months ended June 2012. The company had 51.4 million life insurance customers at the end of June, up 18 percent from six months earlier. AIG’s predecessor was founded in Shanghai in 1919 by U.S. entrepreneur C.V. Starr.

459,AIG,UPDATE 2-US Treasury to sell its remaining AIG common stock,"* Treasury offering 234.2 million AIG shares * Offer worth $7.8 bln at Monday’s closing share price of $33.36 * U.S. rescued company from collapse in 2008 WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury is selling its remaining stake in insurer American International Group Inc , bringing an end to government ownership of the company about four years after it was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy. The sale will close the chapter on one of the most politically contentious government rescues and turn a profit for taxpayers, a development once seen as inconceivable. In a statement on Monday, the Treasury said it launched an underwritten public offering for its remaining 234.2 million shares of common stock. At Monday’s closing share price of $33.36, the stake would be worth some $7.81 billion. Treasury said that the sale, which is expected to price imminently, would be jointly led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Treasury also said it would continue to hold warrants to buy common stock even after the share offering is complete. In September 2008, AIG was rescued minutes before it would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection. The massive bailout ultimately totaled $182.5 billion. At one point, the government estimated it would never be able to recover all of those funds. But as AIG restructured and returned to viability, it was able to repay the entire rescue plus generate a profit for U.S. taxpayers. AIG was one of the Treasury Department’s most contentious bailouts. U.S. lawmakers began calling for Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s resignation after it was revealed that AIG paid $165 million in retention bonuses to employees of a unit that is blamed for destroying the company through investment in risky derivatives. It prompted Republican lawmaker Charles Grassley to call for AIG executives to resign or commit suicide, though the Iowa senator eventually backtracked from those comments. The company also funneled over $90 billion of taxpayer money - more than half the funds the government used to rescue AIG - to various European and Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Barclays Plc.

460,AIG,Treasury selling all its remaining AIG common stock,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury is selling its remaining stake in insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), bringing an end to government ownership of the company four years after it was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy. In a statement on Monday, the Treasury said it launched an underwritten public offering for its remaining 234.2 million shares of common stock. At Monday’s closing prices the stake would be worth some $7.81 billion. Treasury said that the sale would be jointly led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Treasury also said it would continue to hold warrants to buy common stock even after the share offering is complete. In September 2008 AIG was rescued minutes before it would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection. The bailout ultimately totaled $182 billion. At one time the government estimated it would never recover all of those funds, but as AIG restructured and returned to viability it was able to repay the entire rescue plus generate a profit for taxpayers.

Treasury said that the sale via public offer would be jointly led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. “If the offering is completed, Treasury would continue to hold warrants to purchase AIG’s common stock that were also issued as part of AIG’ participation in Treasury programs,” it  said in a statement.",12102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-treasury-aig/us-treasury-says-selling-all-its-remaining-aig-common-stock-idUSL1E8NA7LL20121210
464,AIG,Chinese group buys AIG aircraft firm for up to $4.8 billion,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) will sell nearly all of aircraft leasing business ILFC ILFC.N to a Chinese consortium for up to $4.8 billion, in a deal that gives the fastest growing aviation market easier and cheaper access to planes. But the sale is at a far cheaper price than AIG sought and will lead to a substantial loss, the insurer’s price for getting out of its last major non-core asset following the U.S. government bailout of the company in the financial crisis. Chinese firms have previously shown interest in aircraft leasing, and the deal would give China access to a global network of about 200 airlines in 80 countries. China is already ILFC’s largest market with 180 planes operating there, giving it 35 percent market share. “It’s the biggest deal we have in the aircraft leasing world and it’s very ambitious,” said Paul Sheridan, head of Asia at aviation consultancy firm Ascend Advisor. “We believe there are not enough aircraft on order in China at the moment. It will help Chinese airlines get more aircraft.” The world’s two largest plane makers — Airbus, owned by aerospace group EADS EAD.PA, and U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) — have predicted demand for $4.5 trillion worth of passenger jets over the next two decades, with about two-thirds of new planes sold in the Asia-Pacific region, and China as the biggest single market in value terms. Analysts say China tends to balance its orders between Airbus and Boeing, partly for political reasons. This means China pays an effective premium for planes as the two manufacturers don’t have to compete as heavily for orders. ILFC’s order books could mean cheaper planes for China, industry experts say. The Chinese consortium is made up of New China Trust, which is one-fifth owned by Barclays Plc (BARC.L); China Aviation Industrial Fund; and P3 Investments Ltd; with outside advice provided by Credit Suisse CSGN.VX It will buy 80.1 percent of ILFC for $4.23 billion, with the option to buy another 9.9 percent. An arm of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK), China’s biggest bank, will join once the deal has regulatory approval. P3 Investments is led by Wing-Fai Ng, co-founder of the now defunct pan-Asia fund Primus Financial Holdings. The deal reinforces China’s appetite for foreign mergers and acquisitions, taking the country’s 2012 tally to $56.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, the biggest since 2008. In the past few days alone, Canada agreed to allow CNOOC (0883.HK) to buy domestic energy company Nexen Inc NXY.TO for $15.1 billion, and China’s privately-owned Wanxiang Group won a politically sensitive auction for bankrupt electric car battery marker A123 Systems Inc AONEQ.PK, partly funded by the U.S. government. AIG, which had said on Friday it was in talks about a sale to Chinese buyers, will submit the offer for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which vets foreign deals for security concerns. In September, the U.S. Treasury cut its stake in AIG to below 16 percent of the outstanding shares from around 53.4 percent. It may have an awkward situation to address, though. Besides being AIG’s largest shareholder, the Treasury also chairs CFIUS. Chinese state-backed investments in some sectors have stirred a political backlash, but aircraft leasing is seen as less sensitive than natural resources or telecoms equipment. “ILFC’s portfolio is not heavily in the U.S. It’s an American-owned asset, but a lot of their aircraft fly outside the U.S.,” said Ascend’s Sheridan, adding he did not expect the U.S. government to block the deal. If the deal is not approved and closed by May 15, 2013, either side will have the right to back out, AIG said in a regulatory filing on Monday. Citigroup acted as AIG’s financial adviser on the deal. AIG received a $182 billion U.S. government bail-out following the global financial crisis, and has been selling off assets worldwide as part of a wider divestment plan. ILFC was considered the last major piece to be sold off. AIG shares fell 1.6 percent to $33.59 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said it was a good deal for the company but nothing to inspire investors, given the loss AIG will record on the sale. “We applaud this move, as it will reduce balance sheet leverage and enhances liquidity if consummated,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said in a note to clients. The company first filed for an initial public offering of ILFC in September 2011, but market conditions since then made the IPO untenable. In selling ILFC directly, AIG is also accepting a far lower valuation that it had sought — just two-thirds of book value, rather than the full book it had long wanted. The deal, expected to close in the second quarter, values the leasing business at $5.28 billion, against its latest book value of $7.9 billion. Publicly traded peers Air Lease Corp (AL.N) and AerCap (AER.N) trade for 1.04 times book and 0.71 times book, respectively, according to Thomson Reuters data. AIG said it would record a non-operating loss of $4.4 billion on the sale, including a charge for tax-related items. Founded by aircraft leasing legend Steven Udvar-Hazy, who sold the company to AIG in 1990, ILFC is among the world’s biggest owners of passenger jets. Its main rival is GECAS, an arm of General Electric Co (GE.N). ILFC will retain its current management and continue to be based in Los Angeles. It will appoint a new board with a majority of U.S. and European representatives, AIG said. In its near-four decades, ILFC has bought more than 1,500 passenger jets from Boeing and Airbus. It has a portfolio of more than 1,000 owned or managed aircraft. It has on order 239 new fuel-efficient planes, including Boeing 787s and Airbus A320neos, and the rights to buy an additional 50 such aircraft.

466,AIG,Supreme Court rejects taxpayer challenge to AIG bailout,"(Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal by a taxpayer who claimed the government’s 2008 bailout of the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) violated the constitutional separation of church and state. Without comment, the court let stand a June 1 ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati that Kevin Murray lacked standing to challenge the $182.3 billion bailout, including its use of taxpayer funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”). The bailout left the government with a controlling stake in New York-based AIG, which it has since reduced. Murray, a Michigan resident and Marine veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, said the bailout violated the First Amendment’s establishment clause because AIG has units that market and sell financing products compliant with Sharia, Islamic law based on teachings of the Koran. He contended that the sale of such products was a basis for a “global jihadist war against the West and the United States,” and sent a message that non-adherents to Islam were outsiders. But the 6th Circuit said nothing in the law authorizing TARP suggested that Congress knew or intended that TARP funds might support the sale of the Sharia-compliant products. “It was only through executive discretion that TARP funds were transferred to AIG and, in turn, its subsidiaries,” it wrote. “Because the (law) does not contemplate the use of federal funds to support religious activities, plaintiff lacks standing.” Other defendants included the Federal Reserve System and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.

470,AIG,U.S. Treasury exits AIG as markets await rebound,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury’s sale of its remaining stake in American International Group Inc (AIG.N) will leave taxpayers with a profit of nearly $23 billion - more than the next three most successful bailouts combined. The government’s profit on the deal is a turnabout from what was one of the most reviled bailouts of the financial crisis. The 2008 rescue later spurred a senator to suggest top executives at the insurer consider suicide. The Government Accountability Office at one point suggested there was a real chance taxpayers would never be repaid in full. Yet they were, with $22.7 billion in total returns, including the proceeds of the sale Treasury launched Monday night, AIG said. The government provided AIG with some $182 billion of support. “Thank You - We Did It,” AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche wrote in a memo to AIG staff on Tuesday. “Today warrants a celebration like no other in AIG’s history and places well in the past a crisis none of us will ever forget.” Even with the windfall, the government will likely lose money on its Troubled Asset Relief Program, the $700 billion bailout launched in the darkest days of the crisis. Banks and auto companies still owe taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. The Treasury said its sale of about 15 percent of AIG’s stock would fetch $7.6 billion, after it sold 234.2 million shares to investors for $32.50 each. (The Treasury also has warrants it can sell to boost the government’s profits down the line). AIG shares rose 4.6 percent to $34.89. Even with the profit on AIG, $38 billion in TARP funds have yet to be recovered, the Treasury said. According to the latest monthly report to Congress, some 237 banks still owe money under the Capital Purchase Program. While that specific program is now profitable, the larger shortfall for the whole program remains. The biggest part of the shortfall is with the Automotive Industry Financing Program, which disbursed funds to General Motors (GM.N), Chrysler and Ally Financial. That facility disbursed $79.8 billion in funds and has recovered $40.9 billion through the end of November. Technically speaking, TARP will also take a loss on AIG. Though as a whole the AIG bailout was profitable, the specific block of shares acquired with TARP money came at a price well above where that stock was ultimately sold. To many, though, it is a distinction without a difference. “It was an ugly process,” said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist with Potomac Research Group, but he added: “Bottom line is that the government made money.” AIG was rescued just before it would have been forced to file for bankruptcy as losses on risky derivatives mounted. It was bailed out as the financial system stood at the brink of disaster, shortly after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America (BAC.N). AIG was one of the Treasury Department’s most hotly contested bailouts.

471,AIG,UPDATE 3-U.S. Treasury exits AIG as markets await rebound,"* Shares price at $32.50 apiece, for total proceeds of $7.6 bln * Total profit to government from AIG investment $22.7 bln * TARP still owed some $38 bln, mostly automakers * Analysts waiting on AIG valuation to rise By Rick Rothacker and Jochelle Mendonca Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury’s sale of its remaining stake in American International Group Inc will leave taxpayers with a profit of nearly $23 billion - more than the next three most successful bailouts combined. The government’s profit on the deal is a turnabout from what was one of the most reviled bailouts of the financial crisis. The 2008 rescue later spurred a senator to suggest top executives at the insurer consider suicide. The Government Accountability Office at one point suggested there was a real chance taxpayers would never be repaid in full. Yet they were, with $22.7 billion in total returns,  including the proceeds of the sale Treasury launched Monday night, AIG said. The government provided AIG with some $182 billion of support. “Thank You - We Did It,” AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche wrote in a memo to AIG staff on Tuesday. “Today warrants a celebration like no other in AIG’s history and places well in the past a crisis none of us will ever forget.” Even with the windfall, the government will likely lose money on its Troubled Asset Relief Program, the $700 billion bailout launched in the darkest days of the crisis. Banks and auto companies still owe taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. The Treasury said its sale of about 15 percent of AIG’s stock would fetch $7.6 billion, after it sold 234.2 million shares to investors for $32.50 each. (The Treasury also has warrants it can sell to boost the government’s profits down the line). AIG shares rose 4.6 percent to $34.89. Even with the profit on AIG, $38 billion in TARP funds have yet to be recovered, the Treasury said. According to the latest monthly report to Congress, some 237 banks still owe money under the Capital Purchase Program. While that specific program is now profitable, the larger shortfall for the whole program remains. The biggest part of the shortfall is with the Automotive Industry Financing Program, which disbursed funds to General Motors, Chrysler and Ally Financial. That facility disbursed $79.8 billion in funds and has recovered $40.9 billion through the end of November. Technically speaking, TARP will also take a loss on AIG. Though as a whole the AIG bailout was profitable, the specific block of shares acquired with TARP money came at a price well above where that stock was ultimately sold. To many, though, it is a distinction without a difference. “It was an ugly process,” said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist with Potomac Research Group, but he added: “Bottom line is that the government made money.” AIG was rescued just before it would have been forced to file for bankruptcy as losses on risky derivatives mounted. It was bailed out as the financial system stood at the brink of disaster, shortly after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America. AIG was one of the Treasury Department’s most hotly contested bailouts. U.S. lawmakers began calling for Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s resignation after it was revealed the insurer paid $165 million in retention bonuses to employees of the derivatives unit that has been blamed for the company’s financial distress at that time.

476,AIG,Chinese group in talks to buy AIG air lease arm,"HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Chinese companies, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is in talks to buy nearly all of American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) aircraft leasing unit for about $5.5 billion, AIG said on Friday. The deal is expected to be announced as soon as early next week, a source familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. AIG, which has been selling assets to pay back a $182 billion U.S. government bailout from 2008, had long been hoping to float its ILFC aircraft leasing unit through an initial public offering, but poor market conditions forced it to delay those plans. An IPO was expected to value the company at $6 billion to $8 billion, according to previous reports on the plans. AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said last month that he was waiting for markets to improve to take ILFC public. AIG said it is in talks to sell a 90 percent stake in the unit to a consortium including trust company New China Trust Co Ltd, China Aviation Industrial Fund, and an investment arm of ICBC (1398.HK) (601398.SS), China’s largest bank. New China Trust is 20 percent-owned by British bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L). “The talks are reasonably far along,” a second source said. An ILFC spokesman declined comment. A spokesman for ICBC declined to comment. Reuters was unable to reach New China Trust and China Aviation. Shares in AIG rose 2.6 percent to $34.13 on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching their highest level in more than five weeks earlier in the day. “We view this news positively, since we think a sale of ILFC is the last large transaction AIG needs to do as it continues its turnaround,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said in a research note. The capital may come at a good time for AIG. Late Friday, it said it expects after-tax losses of at least $1.3 billion from Superstorm Sandy. It said it would contribute $1 billion to its U.S. property insurance units to help cover the losses. According to AIG’s third-quarter earnings report, ILFC’s net book value as of September 30 was $7.9 billion. In the past, Benmosche had been adamant about not selling ILFC for less than book value, although the fact that the IPO process has languished for 15 months may have changed his thinking. ILFC reported total assets of $39.6 billion and $39 million in operating income in the third quarter, compared with an operating loss of $1.3 billion a year earlier, when it took $1.5 billion of impairment charges and fair value adjustments. Founded by aircraft leasing legend Steven Udvar-Hazy, who sold the company to AIG and eventually formed his own group, ILFC is one of the world’s largest leasing companies and among the world’s biggest owners of passenger jets. Its main rival is GECAS, an arm of General Electric Co (GE.N). ILFC’s customers include most of the world’s major airlines. Since it was founded almost 40 years ago, ILFC has bought a combined total of more than 1,500 passenger jets from Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus EAD.PA, according to manufacturer figures. ILFC has a portfolio of more than 1,000 owned or managed aircraft. It has on order 239 new fuel-efficient planes, including Boeing 787s and Airbus A320neos, and has the rights to purchase an additional 50 such aircraft. The leasing company has been looking for areas of growth and beefed up its presence in the Asia Pacific region by opening offices in Singapore and Beijing this year. China has shown interest in buying aircraft leasing businesses before. China Development Bank, the country’s policy lender, was among the short-listed bidders for Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s (RBS.L) aviation business earlier this year, according to a previous Reuters report. That business was bought by a consortium led by Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T). Analysts say China tends to balance its orders between Airbus and Boeing, the world’s two dominant aircraft manufacturers, partly for political reasons. As a result, the manufacturers may not need to compete as heavily for orders as in the rest of the world, so China is paying a premium for aircraft, industry experts say. The order books of ILFC could mean cheaper planes for China. Chinese companies have launched about $51.3 billion worth of overseas acquisitions this year, making the country Asia’s second-biggest spender on outbound transactions, according to Thomson Reuters data, behind Japan. Credit Suisse is among the banks advising the buyers.

478,AIG,"U.S. to sell rest of AIG stock, ending $182 billion rescue","(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury is selling its remaining stake in insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), bringing an end to government ownership of the company about four years after a $182 billion bailout. The sale will close the chapter on one of the most politically contentious government rescues of the global financial crisis and turn a profit for taxpayers, which was once thought to be inconceivable. At one point, the government estimated that it would never recover all of the bailout money, but as AIG restructured and returned to viability, it was able to repay the entire rescue fund plus generate a profit for U.S. taxpayers. “No taxpayer should be pleased that the government had to rescue this company, but all taxpayers should be pleased with today’s announcement, ending the largest of the government’s financial industry bail-outs with a profit to the Treasury Department,” Jim Millstein, the Treasury’s former chief restructuring officer, said in a statement. AIG was rescued just before it would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection in September 2008 as losses on risky derivatives mounted. It was bailed out as the world’s financial system stood at the brink of disaster, shortly after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). AIG was one of the Treasury Department’s most hotly contested bailouts. U.S. lawmakers began calling for Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s resignation after it was revealed that AIG paid $165 million in retention bonuses to employees of the derivatives unit that has been blamed for the company’s financial distress at that time. It prompted Republican lawmaker Charles Grassley to call for AIG executives to resign or commit suicide, though the Iowa senator eventually backtracked from those comments. The company also funneled over $90 billion of taxpayer money - more than half the funds the government used to rescue AIG - to various European and Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Barclays Plc (BARC.L). Robert Benmosche, the former CEO of MetLife (MET.N), took over as CEO of AIG in August 2009, replacing Edward Liddy, who had been installed by the U.S. government. He will ultimately get the lion’s share of the credit for turning the company around and preventing a fire sale of its assets. Benmosche salvaged some of the company’s businesses, defended the company’s employees against their detractors and figured out a path forward that would let the company both repay the government and stay in business. In September, he said the company may be in a position to consider a dividend by next summer. “It was an ugly process,” said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist with Potomac Research Group, but he added: “Bottom line is that the government made money.” In a statement on Monday, the Treasury said it launched an underwritten public offering for AIG’s remaining 234.2 million shares of common stock. The Treasury shares were priced at $32.50, according to sources familiar with the situation. At that price, which represents a 2.6 percent discount to AIG’s Monday close of $33.36, the sale would raise $7.61 billion. The sources declined to be named because no official announcement has been made. Treasury said that the sale, which is expected to price imminently, would be jointly led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup (C.N), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). Treasury also said it would continue to hold warrants to buy common stock even after the share offering is complete. An AIG spokesman declined to comment. The sale closes out AIG’s bailout, but other companies still owe the government. The latest Treasury estimate has the Troubled Asset Relief Program ultimately costing the U.S. taxpayers $60 billion. General Motors (GM.N), auto lender Ally Financial Inc and small banks still owe the Treasury.

479,AIG,"AIG ""profits"" an insult to the concept: James Saft","(Reuters) - To say taxpayers made money from their investment in AIG is to libel the very concept of profit. Come to think of it, it may well be a gross insult to the idea of investment too. The Treasury Department announced on Tuesday it would get $7.6 billion from the sale of its remaining government-owned shares in American International Group, taking it to what was widely reported to be a profit of $22.7 billion on the bailout. That’s $182 billion well invested, is the clear implication, though even the Treasury seems wary of calling the bailout bucks profit, using the more bureaucratic “positive return” in its press release. You can quibble with the figures - for example that math takes no account of the value of tax breaks AIG received as part of the deal - but the real problem is with the very concept of the government investing in public financial companies which would otherwise go bust. In financial services, companies take risks with the time value of money, hopefully creating value in the process. Banks, or crypto-banks like AIG was, borrow money for short periods and lend it out at higher rates for longer periods. Interest rates, the ability to inspire confidence and thus command access to credit, and credit risk management - how well you choose who to lend to - are the three cornerstones of profit and survival in banking. In a fiat currency regime, one in which the government can create money at will, banks are essentially creatures of the state, with the government controlling both regulation and, in essence, interest rates. Those are two important determinants of financial services profitability, but the U.S. went a huge step further when it injected capital into AIG, a move that had the effect of bailing out the insurer’s counterparties in the banking industry. When the U.S. bailed out AIG, and for that matter the other banks, it at a stroke removed the issue of confidence, making them immediately better risks because of the perception that they had a backer with unfathomably deep pockets. That makes a nonsense of the concept of profits, much less of investment; AIG was owned by an entity that had enormous control over most of the forces which determined how profitable it was: interest rates, regulation and access to and cost of capital. So sure there was a “positive return” on the deal but the real measure of the wisdom of the bailouts has to be a much wider accounting of the costs, and on this front the AIG deal, and the banking bailout as a whole, has to be deemed a failure. There are two strong arguments against the effects of the bailouts. The first, and most commonly cited, is that the bailouts may have made things easier in the short term but that, by creating the belief that the too big won’t be allowed to fail, has set the stage for an even more damaging and costly crisis in the future. Every bank counterparty in the world lives in full expectation that should their exposures to a big U.S. institution turn sour they, like AIG’s creditors, will be paid in full. That moral hazard suppresses volatility but also suppresses risk measurement by financial markets. The second, and in some ways more compelling argument, is that we are already paying for the bailout, in the form of an artificially large financial sector which serves as a private tax on the rest of the economy, misallocating capital wildly as it goes along. If you want more of something, then subsidize it, and that is exactly what we’ve been doing with financial intermediation for years, culminating in the bank bailouts, of which AIG was a key piece. The financial sector’s share of U.S. GDP almost quadrupled between the end of World War II and the peak just before the crash, despite there being almost no evidence that all this furious intermediation and maturity transformation was producing anything of value. So when we bailed out AIG we may have helped to move it, and the banking industry more broadly, back to profit, but we’ve entrenched a system which is over-banked and in which many of the individuals within it have an inherent conflict of interest with the public good, with the steady and stable growth of the economy and even with the good of shareholders. So sure, call the AIG deal an investment if you want, and call what came out of it a profit if you like, but stop using those words to denote real people taking genuine risks in an equitable system.

481,AIG,Treasury says has completed final sale of AIG stock,"(Reuters) - The Treasury Department said on Friday it has completed its final sale of common stock in American International Group (AIG.N), reducing its shares in the insurer to zero four years after a massive government bailout. Treasury said it received $7.6 billion in proceeds from the sale of its remaining 234 million shares at $32.50 per share. Overall, Treasury and the Federal Reserve received a $22.7 billion positive return on their combined $182.3 billion bailout, the department said. “Today officially begins a new chapter at AIG,” Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said in a statement. The sale is part of Treasury’s efforts to wind down its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), created in 2008 to help rescue companies stricken by the financial crisis. More than 90 percent ($380 billion) of the $418 billion disbursed for TARP has already been recovered to date through repayments and other income, Treasury said in a statement. AIG was rescued just before it would have been forced to file for bankruptcy, as losses on risky derivatives mounted. It was bailed out as the financial system stood at the brink of disaster, shortly after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America (BAC.N). AIG shares were down 0.7 percent to $34 in midday trade on Friday.

484,AIG,AIG to raise up to $6.5 billion through AIA share sale: sources,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group Inc may raise as much as $6.5 billion from the sale of its remaining stake in AIA Group Ltd in Asia’s second-largest block sale ever, exiting a business the U.S. insurer started nearly 100 years ago. The sale marks the end of an era for AIG in Asia and its Chief Executive Robert Benmosche, who took AIA public in Hong Kong in the world’s third-biggest initial public offering ever two years ago. AIG was forced to sell parts of its massive business, including AIA, after the U.S. government bailed the company out in 2008 as it teetered on the brink of collapse. The government ultimately spent $182 billion on the rescue. AIG (AIG.N) is offering its 13.69 percent stake in AIA (1299.HK), or 1.65 billion shares, in a range of HK$29.65-HK$30.65 apiece, sources with direct knowledge of the plan said. That is a discount of up to 6.3 percent to AIA’s close at HK$31.65 in Hong Kong on Friday, the sources said, declining to be identified as the terms of the offering weren’t yet public. Trading of AIA was suspended on Monday at the company’s request. “There are plenty of candidates out there ready to buy into the stock,” said Ping Cheng, an insurance analyst at DBS Vickers in Shanghai. “AIA offers very solid growth outlook and has a profitable profile. The expectation is that there is plenty of growth out there. They just did an acquisition in Thailand, they’re in the low penetration markets like Vietnam, Cambodia.” Shares in AIA have soared about 61 percent since the $20.5 billion IPO in 2010, and have become a top choice of fund managers looking to benefit from growing wealth in Asia and booming demand for insurance and other financial products. The widely expected block offering of Asia’s third-largest insurer will be surpassed only by Vodafone plc’s (VOD.L) $6.6 billion stake sale in China Mobile (0941.HK) two years ago. The offering also comes one week after a lockup on the shares expired, adding to two other rounds of AIA share sales in September and March that had raised about $8 billion in total. The AIA selldown adds to a flurry of block offerings which target a select number of institutional investors and seek to bypass volatile demand from retail investors. Those deals have surged nearly 90 percent so far in 2012 from 2011 to $49.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, helping investment banks in Asia, ex-Japan, buffer their business from the 60 percent plunge in IPOs. AIG, which expects to use the net proceeds from the AIA sale for general corporate purposes, said earlier on Monday that it had commenced a sale of the shares in Hong Kong by placing them to certain institutional investors. AIG did not identify the potential buyers or disclose the terms of the offering. Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) were hired as joint global coordinators for the offering, with Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) also acting as bookrunners. AIG’s exit from AIG comes at a time when Asia’s insurance industry is growing, attracting buyers hoping to tap into the expansion. A Thai conglomerate bought HSBC’s stake in Ping An Insurance (2318.HK) for $9.38 billion, while Hong Kong businessman Richard Li acquired ING’s ING.AS Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand insurance units for $2.14 billion. AIG’s exit from AIA has forced the U.S. insurer to strike out on its own in Asia, where it is focusing its attention on China. AIG became the biggest cornerstone investor in the $3.6 billion IPO of People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China (PICC), also inking a joint venture to sell life insurance in the world’s second-largest economy. “The AIA exit was more about returning cash to repay the government, to strengthen its domestic U.S. business,” said Cheng from DBS Vickers. “Betting on China, they’re using a small part of their funds, putting on a long-term story. It’s probably easier for you to have a foothold in China going through a strategic holding rather than going directly yourself.” AIG’s business started in Shanghai in 1919 by U.S. entrepreneur C.V. Starr, with AIA ultimately becoming the name of its regional operation. Twenty years later, Starr temporarily relocated to the United States to avoid political instability in Asia, and following World War II, decided to run his U.S. businesses from New York. They came to be known as AIG, whose shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1984. AIA has built a sprawling and successful business across the region, with an army of hundreds of thousands of agents competing head-to-head with Prudential in several countries. AIA moved to split off from AIG after the U.S. company nearly collapsed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, prompting the U.S. government bailout. Its 2010 IPO came after a failed takeover offer of Prudential Plc (PRU.L). On Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department said it has completed its final sale of common stock in AIG, cutting its shares in the insurer to zero four years after the bailout.

488,AIG,Capital curbs on insurers will add to government burden: IIF,"LONDON (Reuters) - Proposed curbs on insurers aimed at preventing a repeat of AIG’s 2008 taxpayer bailout could raise the cost of insurance, making more people dependent on the state, a finance sector lobby group said. “As currently designed, there is a high risk of detrimental unintended consequences,” the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said on Monday. Under draft proposals published in October, big insurers involved in risky activities beyond their core business, such as derivatives investment, would have to hold extra capital. They would also be subject to closer regulatory scrutiny and would have to draw up detailed plans for winding themselves down in the event they fail. The IIF said a capital surcharge, if applied across all big insurers, would make it harder for them to pool risk, pushing up the cost of cover and forcing more households and businesses to rely on the state for protection. “A blanket capital surcharge may raise the cost of offering traditional insurance products and result in reduced availability of products currently meeting social needs,” said Steven Kandarian, chief executive of U.S. insurer MetLife and vice chair of the IIF’s insurance regulatory committee. The proposals, drawn up by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), also “borrow excessively” from parallel regulations designed for the banking sector, and do not take key differences between the two industries into account, the IIF said. Insurers argue they are fundamentally less risky than banks because they do not lend and their customers cannot withdraw cash overnight. Although insurers emerged from the 2008 crisis in better shape than banks, AIG and Swiss Re both required emergency funding after absorbing big losses on credit default swaps they wrote. Some smaller insurers in the United States and the Netherlands also received emergency capital injections. The IAIS proposals form part of an effort by the G20 group of countries to do away with the need to bail out failing banks and insurers because their collapse might destabilize the financial system. The Geneva Association, an insurer-funded think tank, said on Monday any additional curbs on insurers needed to reflect the fact they are on average smaller and less intertwined with the global economy than banks. The Financial Stability Board, a regulatory taskforce for the G20 nations, is due next year to publish a list of insurers that it considers big enough to pose a threat to the financial system if they were to collapse.

A weak Chinese property sector limited gains in mainland markets, after data showed home prices in China’s 70 major cities rose in November for the fourth month in the last five, raising fears that more sector curbs could be in store. The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.1 percent, while the China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong edged up 0.1 percent. Excluding AIA and a placement involving Shui On Land, turnover in Hong Kong was almost HK$68 billion, near its 30-day average. In the mainland, the CSI300 of the top Shanghai and Shenzhen listings and the Shanghai Composite Index  both rose 0.1 percent as they eked out a third-straight gain. Shanghai volume was the lowest in three days, but still nearly 30 percent above its 30-day average. “There’s some year-end window dressing going on since this is the last full trading week this year,” said Jackson Wong, vice-president for equity sales at Tanrich Securities. “If you exclude AIA, trading is actually quite light today.” On Tuesday, AIA Group slid to HK$30.60 at the resumption of trade after American International Group  sold its remaining stake in AIA for $6.45 billion. Its closing price was above the HK$30.30 per share that the deal was priced at and near the top end of the HK$29.65-HK$30.65 range it had been marketed at, pointing to strong demand for the placement. China Oilfield Services Ltd  tumbled 5.7 percent in Shanghai and 1.3 percent in Hong Kong after Norwegian authorities claimed the company could owe up to $140 million in taxes related to a 2008 acquisition. Property developers China Vanke slumped 3.6 percent in Shenzhen, while China Overseas Land shed 1.9 percent, both trimming strong 2012 gains, with losses accelerating after the monthly home price data was released. Vanke, which has lost 5 percent on Monday and Tuesday combined, remains up 23.4 percent in 2012. The official Xinhua news agency said China’s leaders decided at the annual economic policy setting conference over the weekend to maintain controls on the sector in the new year. CHINA BANKS A-SHARES STRONG Strength in Chinese banking stocks accounted for a third straight daily gain for onshore indexes as retail investors chased large cap counters on hopes that the current rally runs through into the new year. China Merchants Bank  was up 1.2 percent in Shanghai and 1 percent in Hong Kong. Its Shanghai listing had been down 16.5 percent on the year on Dec. 3, but a 20 percent rally since then has pushed it into positive territory in 2012. Much of the rally in the Chinese banking sector this month has come after China’s insurance regulator abolished limits for insurance firms’ investments in the country’s banks. Previously, firms were unable to invest in more than two banks if they owned more than 5 percent of any single bank.

It’s probably easier for you to have a foothold in China going through a strategic holding rather than going directly yourself.” AIG’s business started in Shanghai in 1919 under U.S. entrepreneur C.V. Starr, with AIA ultimately becoming the name of its regional operation. Twenty years later, Starr temporarily relocated to the United States to avoid political instability in Asia, and following World War Two decided to run his U.S. businesses from New York. They came to be known as AIG, whose shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1984. AIA has built a sprawling and successful business across the region, with an army of hundreds of thousands of agents competing head-to-head with Prudential in several countries. AIA’s 2010 IPO came after a failed takeover offer from Prudential Plc (PRU.L). On Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department said it has completed its final sale of common stock in AIG, cutting its shares in the insurer to zero four years after the bailout.

The sale, which priced near the top of its indicative range, marks the end of an era for AIG in Asia and its Chief Executive Robert Benmosche, who took AIA public in Hong Kong in the world’s third-biggest IPO two years ago. AIG was forced to sell parts of its massive business, including AIA, after the U.S. government bailed the company out in 2008 as it teetered on the brink of collapse. The government ultimately spent $182 billion on the rescue. AIG priced its 13.69 percent stake or 1.65 billion shares in Asia’s third-largest insurer at HK$30.30 per share. The deal had been marketed at HK$29.65-HK$30.65 apiece. That is a discount of 4.3 percent to AIA’s close at HK$31.65 in Hong Kong on Friday. AIA shares fell 0.8 percent in early Tuesday trade, less than the discount, underscoring demand for the stock. Trade had been suspended on Monday at the company’s request. “There are plenty of candidates out there ready to buy into the stock,” said Ping Cheng, an insurance analyst at DBS Vickers in Shanghai. “AIA offers very solid growth outlook and has a profitable profile. The expectation is that there is plenty of growth out there. They just did an acquisition in Thailand, they’re in the low penetration markets like Vietnam, Cambodia.” Shares in AIA have soared about 61 percent since the $20.5 billion IPO in 2010, and have become a top choice of fund managers looking to benefit from growing wealth in Asia and booming demand for insurance and other financial products. The block offering, surpassed only by Vodafone plc’s  $6.6 billion stake sale in China Mobile two years ago, comes one week after a lockup on the shares expired, adding to two other rounds of AIA share sales in September and March that had raised about $8 billion in total. “The short time frame in which (the placing) was completed demonstrates the strength of investor support for AIA and its growth prospects,” AIA’s Chief Executive Mark Tucker said in a statement. The deal also adds to a flurry of block offerings which target a select number of institutional investors and seek to bypass volatile demand from retail investors. Those share sales have surged nearly 90 percent so far in 2012 from 2011 to $49.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, helping investment banks in Asia, ex-Japan, buffer their business from a 60 percent plunge in IPOs. AIG, which expects to use the net proceeds from the AIA sale for general corporate purposes, has not identified the buyers. Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc  were hired as joint global coordinators for the offering, with Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley also acting as bookrunners. AIG’s exit from AIA comes at a time when Asia’s insurance industry is growing, attracting buyers hoping to tap into the expansion. A Thai conglomerate bought HSBC’s stake in Ping An Insurance  for $9.38 billion, while Hong Kong businessman Richard Li acquired ING’s Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand insurance units for $2.14 billion.

501,AIG,AIG may join bailout lawsuit against U.S. government,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American International Group Inc, the insurer rescued by the U.S. government in 2008, drew angry condemnation from lawmakers on Tuesday after saying it may join a lawsuit that alleges the bailout terms were unfair. A leading congressional Democrat called criticism of the deal’s terms “utterly ridiculous,” and former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer - who probed AIG when he was in office - called the prospect of a suit “insulting to the public.” The White House declined to comment on the potential for a lawsuit but defended the $182 billion bailout. Meanwhile, newly elected Senator Elizabeth Warren, feared by Wall Street as a potential thorn in its side on the Senate Banking Committee, called the suit talk “outrageous” and said the company should not “bite the hand that fed them for helping them out in a crisis.” The move would be something of a shock, given that AIG just launched a high-profile television ad campaign called “Thank you, America,” in which it offers the public its gratitude for the bailout. On Tuesday, the company promoted the ads on Twitter, even as it came under fire over the lawsuit. Securities experts said AIG’s board needs to consider the matter as part of its fiduciary duty, but also said it was unlikely they will actually join. AIG said its board would meet Wednesday to discuss joining a lawsuit filed against the government by the insurer’s former chief executive, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. Greenberg, whose Starr International owned 12 percent of AIG before its near-collapse, has accused the New York Fed of using the rescue to bail out Wall Street banks at the expense of shareholders, and of being a “loan shark” by charging exorbitant interest of 14.5 percent on the initial loan. “If AIG enters this suit it would be the equivalent of a patient suing their doctor for saving their life,” said Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner who teaches in the finance department at Boston University. A federal judge in Manhattan already dismissed one of Greenberg’s suits in November; it is being appealed. In his ruling dated November 19, Judge Paul Engelmayer said AIG had notified the court it would hold a board meeting January 9 to discuss joining one of the suits, with a decision expected by the end of the month. A separate suit under different legal theories is still pending in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington. In a mid-December hearing in the Washington case, a lawyer for AIG told the court that all sides had already made three written submissions to the board and that the board would spend half the day on January 9 discussing the suit. One expert in securities law said he doubted AIG would ultimately decide to join the case. “All the fiduciary standards that guide board behavior would warn against joining the suit,” said James Cox, a professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University School of Law in Durham, North Carolina. “I see nothing to be gained by AIG piling on, and I see a lot of downside risk.” An AIG spokesman declined to comment beyond confirming that the board would meet as planned. The deliberations were first reported by the New York Times. The New York Fed said Tuesday there was no merit to any allegations that the bank harmed AIG. “AIG’s board of directors had an alternative choice to borrowing from the Federal Reserve and that choice was bankruptcy. Bankruptcy would have left all AIG shareholders with worthless stock,” a representative of the bank said Tuesday. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, acknowledged that AIG’s board has a fiduciary duty to consider the lawsuit. But he also said the company had a choice in 2008 and picked what it considered the better option. “The idea that AIG might sue the government is an unbelievable insult to our nation’s taxpayers, who cleaned up the mess this firm created,” he said in a statement. Cummings’ former colleague, the recently-retired Barney Frank, said he was “stunned” by the news and added that AIG was a fully willing participant in the rescue. “There was not the hint of a suggestion of any coercion. They did this very voluntarily, very gratefully. And if the company were now to go around and join this lawsuit, that would be outrageous,” Frank said in an interview. The U.S. Treasury declined to comment. It completed its final sale of AIG stock in mid-December, concluding the bailout with what Treasury called a positive return of $22.7 billion. AIG shares fell 0.8 percent to close at $35.65. After losing half its value in 2011, the stock rose more than 52 percent in 2012, tripling the gains of the broader S&P; insurance index. If AIG decides to join Greenberg’s suit, it would be another legal victory for the man who once ran the world’s largest insurance company but was ultimately forced to leave under a cloud of scandal. On Monday, a federal judge ruled that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman does not have standing to object to a $115 million settlement between AIG shareholders and the former chief executive. Schneiderman wanted the deal rejected. The judge’s ruling apparently clears the way for approval of the deal, whose broad releases would preclude New York from pursuing its high-profile 2005 fraud case against Greenberg, according to court papers. The state case, brought by Spitzer, accuses Greenberg and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith of using sham transactions to mask the company’s financial position. The claims, which Greenberg and Smith have fought through three New York attorneys general, await an appeal at the state’s highest court.

504,AIG,COLUMN-How AIG board landed at center of Greenberg suit: Frankel,"By Alison Frankel NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - On Wednesday, as Dealbook reported in a terrific story Monday night, AIG’s 12 board members will hear an extraordinary presentation. Starr International Company, which is controlled by former AIG chief Hank Greenberg, will ask the company to join a $25 billion case in federal claims court that accuses the United States of wrongfully seizing control of AIG from shareholders when the government took control of the teetering insurer in September 2008. Then, according to a court filing in which AIG described the process, the government and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will counter Starr’s arguments and urge the board to forego litigating against its federal saviors (who have since been paid back in full). By the end of the month, the board will decide whether to take on Starr’s derivative claims against the government, risking accusations of ingratitude, or to vote against pursuing the litigation, risking possible shareholder derivative claims that it has breached its own fiduciary duties. Starr hasn’t made any threats of breach-of-duty claims against AIG’s board, and its lawyers at Boies, Schiller & Flexner declined comment through a firm representative. So far, AIG’s conduct in Starr’s litigation against the federal government has actually helped Greenberg’s company, as you’ll see below. But as the AIG board deliberates, directors will be wary of the former chairman’s well-exercised trigger finger for lawsuits. Starr’s campaign against the feds began in November 2011 as two different cases: the federal claims court complaint against the United States (asserting both direct shareholder claims and derivative claims on behalf of AIG for the government’s supposedly unconstitutional conduct) and a shareholder derivative complaint in federal court in Manhattan against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which was the instrument of the $182 billion federal bailout of AIG. In a landmark (and cogently written) ruling last November, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer dismissed the entire case in Manhattan federal court. The judge said (and here I’m summarizing an 89-page ruling) that Starr hadn’t adequately established the Federal Reserve’s fiduciary duty to AIG and its shareholders, and even if such a duty existed, AIG’s claims under Delaware law would be pre-empted by the federal government’s larger responsibility to stabilize the national economy. But there was an intriguing paragraph in Engelmayer’s opinion, little noticed at the time, that hinted at the AIG board’s ongoing concern about its obligation to assume Starr’s claims against the government. Engelmayer said that he had encouraged AIG’s board to decide whether to join Starr’s case and that AIG’s lawyers said board discussions were under way. Engelmayer’s opinion disclosed that AIG had already set aside time at the Jan. 9 board hearing for presentations on the Starr litigation. In fact, AIG’s role in the Starr suits has been a giant question mark hovering over the cases since they were filed. Derivative suits, as you know, are brought by shareholders standing in the shoes of a corporation, asserting claims that rightfully belong to the corporate board. Under Delaware law, which governs the AIG litigation, shareholders must be prepared to show that before filing suit they served the board with a demand that it bring its own claims or that such a demand would have been futile. Usually shareholders file derivative breach-of-duty claims against board members, so their complaints argue that boards are too conflicted to decide whether to sue themselves. Here Starr wasn’t suing the AIG board but rather the federal government on behalf of AIG. Nevertheless, Starr did not serve a demand on AIG’s board before filing its suits in Manhattan federal court and federal claims court in Washington. The government argued in both Manhattan federal court and federal claims court that Starr’s failure to serve a presuit demand on the AIG board, or otherwise to assert the futility of a demand, meant that the derivative claims had to be tossed. But it was forced to make those arguments without supporting briefs from AIG. Starr and AIG reached a side deal, agreeing to extend the deadline for AIG, as a nominal defendant in both cases, to respond to Starr’s complaints. Claims court Judge Thomas Wheeler explained the terms of the side deal in an order in March 2012 that approved the joint stipulation (despite the government’s objection): AIG wouldn’t have to answer the complaint until after a ruling on preliminary motions, but Starr couldn’t argue that the delay represented the board’s tacit endorsement of the suits. The side deal was quite a boon to Starr: In the federal court case, AIG specifically asked Judge Engelmayer not to rule on the presuit demand issue, despite the government’s argument that it required him to toss Starr’s derivative claims. If the government had prevailed in both of its dismissal motions, AIG and its lawyers at Weil, Gotshal & Manges would never have had to figure out how to respond to Starr’s claims. But it didn’t. In July 2012, Wheeler ruled that Starr could proceed not only with direct claims that the government’s purchase of a 79.9 percent stake in AIG was an unconstitutional taking of shareholders’ property without compensation but also with derivative takings claims related to the stock sale and the takeover of AIG assets by the Fed’s Maiden Lane facility. (He tossed Starr’s other constitutional claims.) The judge put off any ruling on the government’s argument that Starr failed to make the proper presuit demand, writing that the procedure is supposed to safeguard the power of the corporate board, which, in this case, had agreed to delay consideration. “Here, AIG — the party the demand requirement was meant to protect — has not sought to enforce its right to a demand but instead has requested that the court defer ruling on the issue,” he wrote. “Under such circumstances, the court is not compelled to address the demand issue at this time.” Wheeler’s ruling meant that AIG’s board had to deal with Starr’s assertions. Starr underlined that obligation in August, when it served a demand on the board that called for AIG to bring claims against the government. AIG’s lawyers subsequently informed Engelmayer and Wheeler that the board had begun evaluating its options; in a Sept. 5 filing with Wheeler, Weil Gotshal outlined the deliberation process. “The making of the demand by Starr is a significant change in the litigation landscape, and, as we reported to the court, AIG’s board has established an orderly and deliberative process pursuant to which the board will consider the novel and complex issues raised by Starr’s demand,” AIG wrote. “The process will include written presentations addressing specific questions from AIG and written replies, and then oral presentations to the board, by Starr and the government.” AIG has since said that discussion of the Starr suit will consume the entire morning of the board meeting Wednesday. (AIG counsel Joseph Allerhand of Weil referred me to an AIG spokesman, who didn’t return my call.) If the board refuses to join the case, it’s certainly conceivable that Starr (or another shareholder, for that matter) could allege that directors were improperly bypassing claims that have already survived a dismissal motion. AIG, of course, would respond that litigating against the government, particularly in these circumstances, is an expensive and unnecessary diversion from its recovery. It only helps a future AIG defense that the board has given serious consideration to Starr’s claims. Starr’s direct claims against the United States, based on the dilution of the value of AIG shares after the stock sale to the government, will proceed regardless of the AIG board’s decision, since those claims belong to shareholders, not to the corporation. Starr has moved for certification of a class of prebailout shareholders and told Judge Wheeler at a status conference in December that deposition and discovery are under way.",1082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-lawsuit-greenberg/column-how-aig-board-landed-at-center-of-greenberg-suit-frankel-idUSL1E9C8H2U20130108

510,AIG,AIG may join bailout suit against U.S. gov't,"* Board to meet Wednesday to decide * NYTimes first reported plans to join suit * Ex-CEO Greenberg called Fed ‘loan shark’ Jan 8 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc, the insurer rescued by the U.S. government in 2008 with a bailout that ultimately totaled $182 billion, may join a lawsuit against the government alleging the terms of the deal were unfair. The company confirmed a New York Times report that said AIG’s board would meet Wednesday to discuss joining a lawsuit filed against the government by the insurer’s former chief executive, Hank Greenberg. The move would be something of a shock development given that AIG just launched a high-profile TV ad campaign called “Thank you America,” in which it offers gratitude for the rescue, which was fully repaid with a profit last year. At the same time, Chief Executive Bob Benmosche has complained publicly that the company and its management have not gotten enough credit for avoiding a collapse, turning the business around and returning to profitability. Greenberg, whose Starr International owned 12 percent of AIG before its near-collapse, has accused the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of using the rescue to bail out Wall Street banks at the expense of shareholders, and of being a “loan shark” by charging exorbitant interest on the initial loan. A federal judge in Manhattan dismissed Greenberg’s suit against the New York Fed in November; a separate suit under different legal theories in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims is still pending. An AIG spokesman declined to comment beyond confirming that the board would meet.",1082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-lawsuit-government/aig-may-join-bailout-suit-against-u-s-govt-idUSL1E9C81DR20130108

Greenberg claims the rescue was unfair to shareholders and that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York charged an excessive interest rate on its initial loan. He is seeking billions of dollars in damages. AIG said its board had carried out its legal and fiduciary duty to consider joining Greenberg’s lawsuit before making its decision. Greenberg has a case pending in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., and is also appealing the dismissal of a lawsuit in the federal court in New York. AIG’s Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said in an interview with CNBC that ultimately the public had to trust the company. “It is not acceptable socially for AIG to have taken this money and to think we can go back and sue the government,” Benmosche said. AIG said it would not pursue Starr’s claims nor would it allow Starr to pursue them on AIG’s behalf, setting the stage for a fresh legal fight between Greenberg and the company. The idea that AIG might sue the government struck a raw nerve with the public, which took to the Internet to vent its anger at what it viewed as the company’s audacity. The volume of AIG mentions on Twitter rose more than 50-fold on Tuesday, according to Topsy Analytics. Starr’s attorney, David Boies, said in a statement that AIG’s effort to block Starr from pursuing claims was contrary to shareholders’ interests. “Whether or not the AIG Board will be successful in blocking Starr’s efforts to recover damages for their shareholders will ultimately be decided the Court,” Boies said.

Dozens of obscene comments made descriptive references to the anatomy of Chief Executive Robert Benmosche. And those were the gentler barbs. The New York Daily News ran an editorial cartoon in which a lifeguard saves a drowning man with “AIG” on his belly. When the lifeguard asks the man how he feels, the victim says, “Like suing you.” The vitriol was just like it had been in late 2008 and early 2009 when, with the United States deep in recession, AIG employees hid ID badges and their families were threatened amid an uproar over bonuses. A group of congressmen led by Vermont Democrat Peter Welch sent AIG’s chairman a letter late on Tuesday, advising, “Don’t do it.

A leading congressional Democrat called criticism of the deal’s terms “utterly ridiculous,” and former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer - who probed AIG when he was in office - called the prospect of a lawsuit “insulting to the public.” The White House declined to comment on the potential for a lawsuit but defended the $182 billion bailout. Newly elected Senator Elizabeth Warren, feared by Wall Street as a potential thorn in its side on the Senate Banking Committee, called the lawsuit talk “outrageous” and said the company should not “bite the hand that fed them for helping them out in a crisis.” In a statement late Tuesday, AIG said it had no choice but to consider the demand from its former chief executive, Hank Greenberg, and his holding company Starr International that AIG join his lawsuit. Greenberg has sued for damages over the bailout and wants AIG to join him in challenging the “exorbitant” terms of the government rescue. Legal action by AIG would be shocking, given that the company has just launched a high-profile television ad campaign called “Thank you, America,” in which it offers the public its gratitude for the bailout. On Tuesday, AIG promoted the ads on Twitter, even as it came under fire over a possible lawsuit. “AIG has paid back its debt to America with a profit, and we mean it when we say thank you to the American people,” CEO Bob Benmosche said in a statement. “At the same time, the Board of Directors has fiduciary and legal obligations to the Company and its shareholders to consider the demand served on us and respond in a fair, appropriate, and timely manner,” he said. AIG said its board would meet Wednesday to discuss joining the lawsuit, with three options on its plate: take over and pursue the claims made by Starr; refuse Greenberg’s demand and block Starr from pursuing its claims; or let Starr pursue the claims on AIG’s behalf. It expects to make a decision “in the next several weeks,” Benmosche said. Greenberg, whose Starr International owned 12 percent of AIG before its near-collapse, has accused the New York Fed of using the rescue to bail out Wall Street banks at the expense of AIG shareholders. He has also called the NY Fed a “loan shark” for charging the “exorbitant” interest of 14.5 percent on its initial loan to AIG. “If AIG enters this suit it would be the equivalent of a patient suing their doctor for saving their life,” said Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner who teaches in the finance department at Boston University. A federal judge in Manhattan already dismissed one of Greenberg’s lawsuits in November; it is being appealed. In his ruling dated Nov. 19, Judge Paul Engelmayer said AIG had notified the court it would hold a board meeting Jan. 9 to discuss joining one of the lawsuits, with a decision expected by the end of the month. A separate lawsuit under different legal theories is still pending in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington. One expert in securities law said he doubted AIG would ultimately decide to join the case. “All the fiduciary standards that guide board behavior would warn against joining the suit,” said James Cox, a professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University School of Law in Durham, North Carolina. “I see nothing to be gained by AIG piling on, and I see a lot of downside risk.” The deliberations were first reported by the New York Times. The New York Fed said Tuesday there was no merit to any allegations that the bank harmed AIG. “AIG’s board of directors had an alternative choice to borrowing from the Federal Reserve and that choice was bankruptcy. Bankruptcy would have left all AIG shareholders with worthless stock,” a representative of the bank said Tuesday. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, acknowledged that AIG’s board has a fiduciary duty to consider the lawsuit. But he also said the company had a choice in 2008 and picked what it considered the better option. “The idea that AIG might sue the government is an unbelievable insult to our nation’s taxpayers, who cleaned up the mess this firm created,” he said in a statement. Cummings’ former colleague, the recently retired Barney Frank, said he was “stunned” by the news and added that AIG was a fully willing participant in the rescue. “There was not the hint of a suggestion of any coercion. They did this very voluntarily, very gratefully. And if the company were now to go around and join this lawsuit, that would be outrageous,” Frank said in an interview. The U.S. Treasury declined to comment. It completed its final sale of AIG stock in mid-December, concluding the bailout with what Treasury called a positive return of $22.7 billion. AIG shares fell 0.8 percent to close at $35.65. After losing half its value in 2011, the stock rose more than 52 percent in 2012, tripling the gains of the broader S&P; insurance index .",1092013,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-lawsuit-government/rpt-update-6-aig-may-join-bailout-lawsuit-against-u-s-government-idUSL1E9C82H220130109

Greenberg has a case pending in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., and is also appealing the dismissal of a lawsuit in the federal court in New York. AIG’s Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said in an interview with CNBC that ultimately the public had to trust the company. “It is not acceptable socially for AIG to have taken this money and to think we can go back and sue the government,” Benmosche said. AIG said it would not pursue Starr’s claims nor would it allow Starr to pursue them on AIG’s behalf, setting the stage for a fresh legal fight between Greenberg and the company. The idea that AIG might sue the government struck a raw nerve with the public, which took to the Internet to vent its anger at what it viewed as the company’s audacity. The volume of AIG mentions on Twitter rose more than 50-fold on Tuesday, according to Topsy Analytics. Starr’s attorney, David Boies, said in a statement that AIG’s effort to block Starr from pursuing claims was contrary to shareholders’ interests. “Whether or not the AIG Board will be successful in blocking Starr’s efforts to recover damages for their shareholders will ultimately be decided the Court,” Boies said. Former Obama administration adviser Austan Goolsbee said “GO SCREW YOURSELVES” in a multi-tweet tirade. Comedian Andy Borowitz drafted a mock letter from the company to taxpayers, asking for more bailout money to pay for the cost of the lawsuit. Dozens of obscene comments made descriptive references to the anatomy of Chief Executive Robert Benmosche. And those were the gentler barbs. The New York Daily News ran an editorial cartoon in which a lifeguard saves a drowning man with “AIG” on his belly. When the lifeguard asks the man how he feels, the victim says, “Like suing you.” The vitriol was just like it had been in late 2008 and early 2009 when, with the United States deep in recession, AIG employees hid ID badges and their families were threatened amid an uproar over bonuses. A group of congressmen led by Vermont Democrat Peter Welch sent AIG’s chairman a letter late on Tuesday, advising, “Don’t do it. Don’t even think about it.” Other members of Congress threatened hearings. AIG took to Twitter to defend itself, saying it was legally obligated to at least consider action, but its defense mostly fell on deaf ears. The U.S. government rescued the company from the brink of bankruptcy in September 2008 with a bailout that ultimately topped $182 billion. After a recapitalization deal closed in early 2011, the U.S. Treasury owned 92 percent of AIG. The Treasury sold the last of that stake in mid-December 2012. The government has said it earned a return of $22.7 billion on the rescue. In a statement, the Obama administration welcomed AIG’s decision. “AIG ran a careful process and the board’s decision not to join Starr International’s lawsuit is the right result,” Assistant Treasury Secretary Timothy Massad said. “We continue to believe that Starr’s case is without merit and will continue to defend our actions vigorously.” AIG shares rose 0.3 percent to close at $35.76.

526,AIG,"AIG sues NY Fed over right to sue Bank of America, others","NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc has filed a lawsuit against a vehicle created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help bail out the insurer, in a bid to preserve its right to sue Bank of America Corp and other issuers of mortgage debt that went sour. The complaint filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan seeks a declaration that AIG has not transferred billions of dollars of “litigation claims” to Maiden Lane II, including many related to the insurer’s $10 billion lawsuit against Bank of America. Maiden Lane II was created in December 2008 to buy residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from AIG and ease liquidity strains. According to the complaint, New York Fed officials in December told Bank of America that Maiden Lane II had, by agreeing to buy the securities, assumed from AIG all litigation claims relating to what it bought. AIG said this included more than $7 billion of damages claims against Bank of America. AIG is not seeking monetary payments in the lawsuit, but wants the court to clarify that the New York-based insurer still has the right to sue issuers of securities in Maiden Lane II. New York Fed spokesman Jack Gutt declined to comment. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson also declined to comment. The lawsuit is part of the fallout from AIG’s $182.3 billion federal bailout that began in September 2008, and which was fully paid off last year. It came after AIG provoked a firestorm in Congress and from the American people this week as it mulled whether to sue the government that bailed it out by joining a $25 billion lawsuit by former Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. AIG eventually decided to stay out of that case. When it sued Bank of America in August 2011, AIG accused the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender of misrepresenting the quality of more than $28 billion of securities it had bought from the bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units. An AIG spokesman said Friday’s lawsuit “narrowly seeks a declaration from the Court that a 2008 contract between AIG and ML II did not transfer to ML II AIG’s right to sue Bank of America and other financial institutions for the billions of dollars of damages they caused AIG and its shareholders in connection with the fraudulent sale of RMBS to AIG.” According to Friday’s complaint, Maiden Lane II paid $20.8 billion for a variety of subprime and other mortgage securities from AIG, barely half of their estimated $39.3 billion face value.

529,AIG,AIG counsel told board Greenberg lawsuit has low chance of success,"(Reuters) - AIG Inc’s (AIG.N) counsel informed its board that a bailout lawsuit filed by former chief executive Hank Greenberg against the U.S. government has a low likelihood of success, as the insurer weighed whether to join the suit, according to a court filing. Greenberg’s case, brought on behalf of his company Starr International Co, accused the U.S. government and the New York Federal Reserve of wasting more than $60 billion of AIG and taxpayer funds in a “backdoor bailout” that let “favored” trading partners, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), be repaid in full and freed from legal liability. Insurer AIG weighed whether to join the lawsuit filed by Greenberg and his company, which owned 12 percent of AIG before its $182 billion rescue that started in 2008. However, facing anger from Congress and the American people, AIG said earlier this month that it would not sue the U.S. government over the terms of the bailout. In a letter filed with a New York court on Wednesday, AIG lawyer Paul Curnin said he put Starr’s likelihood of success “at no more than 20 percent.” Curnin said the available evidence, including more than 3000 pages of exhibits, did not support Starr’s assertion that the U.S. government or the New York Fed coerced AIG’s board into accepting the bailout loans in September 2008. The court filing showed that before deciding not to join Greenberg’s lawsuit the AIG board discussed issues such as potential damage to the company’s brand and image. The Treasury sold the last of AIG’s stake in mid-December 2012. The government has said it earned a return of $22.7 billion on the rescue. The cases are Starr International Co v.

The unanimous ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed a finding in a lower court that the reports must be disclosed. The information in question grew out of a 2004 dispute between AIG and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In resolving the dispute, AIG agreed to hire an outside consultant to review some of its internal policies. After unsuccessfully asking the SEC for a copy of the consultant’s work, including any reports and other information, journalist Sue Reisinger filed a request in federal court in Washington in 2011. A judge ordered AIG and the SEC to turn over copies of the records, but the appeals court disagreed, finding that the reports are not public records under the law. “Documents created by the independent consultant are not government documents,” Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote for a three-judge panel. That the reports were at some point provided to the government still does not make them public, she added. Reisinger is a reporter for Corporate Counsel and American Lawyer magazines, owned by ALM Media Properties LLC. Thomson Reuters is a direct competitor with ALM. “On behalf of a public that deserves to see these documents, I am obviously disappointed with the ruling,” Reisinger wrote in an email in response to a request for comment.

534,AIG,NY State appeals denial of objection to AIG shareholder deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is seeking to overturn a federal judge’s decision denying him the right to derail a $115 million settlement between American International Group Inc shareholders and the insurer’s former chief executive. Schneiderman filed a notice of appeal Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan, saying he was taking the case to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. District Court Judge Deborah Batts in Manhattan ruled January 7 that Schneiderman lacked standing to object to the settlement and could not intervene in the case. The settlement is intended to resolve claims of improper accounting and other fraudulent practices at New York-based AIG dating to 1999. Schneiderman claims the deal is unfair and inadequate. He says it doesn’t account for market fallout from a 2000 transaction with General Re Corp, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), which various government investigators have said allowed AIG to inflate loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk. Schneiderman argued a math error by the expert caused the transaction to get no weight in the calculation of damages. The transaction is part of a lawsuit the New York attorney general’s office brought against AIG former chief executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg and Howard Smith, AIG’s former chief financial officer, in 2005. If the deal is approved, it would effectively end the New York attorney general’s case against Greenberg and Smith. The “broad terms of the releases” would preclude New York pursuing its case on behalf of AIG shareholders, Schneiderman said in court papers. Batts must approve the agreement between shareholders and Greenberg, Smith, other executives, and Greenberg’s companies C.V. Starr & Co and Starr International Co. The judge set a fairness hearing for April 10. A spokeswoman for Boies, Schiller & Flexner, which represents Greenberg and his companies, declined comment on the appeal.

538,AIG,AIG 4th quarter operating results beat expectations,"(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations, although Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said some employee bonuses will be smaller this year because the company did not meet all of its performance targets. Overall, the company reported a $4 billion loss on Thursday, due mainly to the sale of aircraft leasing business, ILFC, as well as losses incurred from Superstorm Sandy. But AIG’s underlying business trends - with stronger operating earnings in its life insurance business, better underwriting margins in its property and casualty business and higher investment income - helped lift operating earnings above what analysts expected. “It looks pretty good,” Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome said of AIG’s earnings report. “Relative to what I was looking for, the life insurance business did better than expected and some of the noncore businesses - like direct investment, and the capital markets operation, which aren’t necessarily the highest-quality earnings - also reported bigger gains than I expected.” In after-hours trading AIG shares rose 4.2 percent, to $38.84. Last year marked an important milestone for the insurance group, which was rescued by U.S. taxpayers in 2008 with a bailout that eventually exceeded $180 billion. The U.S. government, which took a stake in the insurer in exchange for the bailout, exited nearly its entire investment in the company in 2012. The Treasury Department still holds warrants to purchase about 2.7 million shares, but sold the remainder of its common stock last quarter. The Federal Reserve also sold off its holdings in an AIG-bailout related vehicle in 2012. The bailout exit lifted some uncertainty for investors and AIG replaced Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in the fourth quarter as the hedge fund industry’s favorite stock. AIG came under enormous public pressure to slash bonuses while taxpayers were supporting the company. As recently as last month, the watchdog office of the Treasury Department’s bailout program said the agency had approved excessive pay for executives at bailed-out companies - including AIG - even in 2012. In a memo to employees, Benmosche called the fourth quarter a “historic” one for the company, but also said some bonuses will be smaller this year because of weak performance. “We still have work to do, and we didn’t meet all our business goals in 2012, which will mean some short-term incentive pools will be smaller this year than last year,” he said in the memo, which was obtained by Reuters. While the company exceeded outsiders’ expectations, AIG management might have had more aggressive performance targets internally, Newsome said. For instance, low-interest rates have been crimping life-insurance profits industry-wide for some time, leading analysts and investors to expect less from the business. “Maybe AIG did better than Wall Street expected, but not as good as they wanted,” he said. AIG’s life-insurance business reported a 20 percent jump in after-tax operating income last quarter. AIG attributed the improvement to its efforts to “actively manage spread income.” Its direct investment book reported after-tax operating income of $509 million, while the capital-markets operation reported $300 million in after-tax operating income. A year ago those operations reported an after-tax loss of $27 million and after-tax income of $46 million, respectively. In property and casualty, AIG reported an after-tax operating loss of $945 million, due to the Sandy losses. However, the company cited stronger underwriting margins in the business, which Newsome said was a positive sign. Overall, AIG posted a net loss of $4 billion, or $2.68 per share, for the period, compared with a year-earlier profit of $21.5 billion, or $11.31 per share. On an operating basis, the company earned $290 million, or 20 cents per share. The company recorded after-tax losses of $1.3 billion in the quarter from Superstorm Sandy. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected a loss of 8 cents per share in the quarter.

539,AIG,UPDATE 3-AIG 4th quarter operating results beat expectations,"* 4th quarter loss $4 bln, or $2.68 per share * Includes $4.4 bln ILFC loss, $1.3 bln in Sandy losses * Operating EPS of 20 cents beats expectations * Shares rise after-hours trading By Lauren Tara LaCapra Feb 21 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc  reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations, although Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said some employee bonuses will be smaller this year because the company did not meet all of its performance targets. Overall, the company reported a $4 billion loss on Thursday, due mainly to the sale of aircraft leasing business, ILFC, as well as losses incurred from Superstorm Sandy. But AIG’s underlying business trends - with stronger operating earnings in its life insurance business, better underwriting margins in its property and casualty business and higher investment income - helped lift operating earnings above what analysts expected. “It looks pretty good,” Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome said of AIG’s earnings report. “Relative to what I was looking for, the life insurance business did better than expected and some of the noncore businesses - like direct investment, and the capital markets operation, which aren’t necessarily the highest-quality earnings - also reported bigger gains than I expected.” In after-hours trading AIG shares rose 4.2 percent, to $38.84. Last year marked an important milestone for the insurance group, which was rescued by U.S. taxpayers in 2008 with a bailout that eventually exceeded $180 billion. The U.S. government, which took a stake in the insurer in exchange for the bailout, exited nearly its entire investment in the company in 2012. The Treasury Department still holds warrants to purchase about 2.7 million shares, but sold the remainder of its common stock last quarter. The Federal Reserve also sold off its holdings in an AIG-bailout related vehicle in 2012. The bailout exit lifted some uncertainty for investors and AIG replaced Apple Inc in the fourth quarter as the hedge fund industry’s favorite stock. AIG came under enormous public pressure to slash bonuses while taxpayers were supporting the company. As recently as last month, the watchdog office of the Treasury Department’s bailout program said the agency had approved excessive pay for executives at bailed-out companies - including AIG - even in 2012. In a memo to employees, Benmosche called the fourth quarter a “historic” one for the company, but also said some bonuses will be smaller this year because of weak performance. “We still have work to do, and we didn’t meet all our business goals in 2012, which will mean some short-term incentive pools will be smaller this year than last year,” he said in the memo, which was obtained by Reuters.

540,AIG,AIG is the new Apple of hedge fund managers' eyes: report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N) has replaced Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the hedge fund industry’s favorite stock, according to a Goldman Sachs Group analysis of fourth-quarter regulatory filings. The American insurer, bailed out by the U.S. government during the financial crisis, knocked Apple out of the top spot in a list of stocks deemed most important to hedge funds, according to a Goldman report released late Wednesday. The fact that Apple has lost favor with many hedge fund managers is not too surprising, given the 20 percent slide in the stock in the fourth quarter. Still, Apple’s fall from grace follows a long run as No. 1. “For the first time in three years Apple was not the top stock in our VIP list, instead ranking as the third most frequent top-10 holding,” the report said, adding that funds reduced their Apple positions “by over 30 percent.” AIG was held by a number of well known hedge fund managers at the end of 2012, including Daniel Loeb’s Third Point, David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management and George Soros’s personal money management firm, according to quarterly 13-F regulatory filings that became public last week. Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme Capital Management also owns a major stake in AIG. Activist hedge fund Jana Partners added to its AIG holdings in the fourth quarter. Loeb began scooping up AIG shares in the second and third quarters of 2012, arguing it is a “cheap restructured equity” that has “significant upside,” according to a recent Third Point investor letter reviewed by Reuters. AIG was one of the hedge fund’s biggest winners in the fourth quarter, the letter said. Shares of AIG rose 7.65 percent in the quarter. Loeb and several other notable hedge fund managers, including Omega Advisors’ Leon Cooperman and Eton Park’s Eric Mindich, dumped their Apple stakes in the fourth quarter, according to regulatory disclosures filed in February. Apple shares have tumbled in price since hitting an all-time high of $705.07 on September 21. They had fallen 24 percent by the end of 2012. The stock has continued to languish this year and was one of the worst performers in the S&P; 500 stock index in January, dropping 17 percent as investors continued to worry about increasing competition and declining profit margins. The company is also now embroiled in a legal battle with hedge fund veteran David Einhorn, who has been a proponent of the technology giant for many years at his hedge fund Greenlight Capital, even dispensing Ipod Nanos to investors as a gift in 2011. Einhorn, who added to his hedge fund’s Apple holdings in the fourth quarter, has filed a lawsuit to block changes in Apple’s policy for issuing preferred stock.

546,AIG,"Judge puts AIG/New York Fed case on hold, BofA still on","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge has put American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) dispute with a financial crisis-era bailout vehicle on hold while another court addresses the insurer’s separate $10 billion lawsuit against Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) over defective mortgages. In rejecting AIG’s effort to litigate quickly against the Maiden Lane II vehicle created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said that “on the face of it” some of the New York Fed’s and Maiden Lane’s actions “perhaps are unattractive and, indeed, wrongful.” The dispute concerns whether AIG transferred $18 billion of litigation claims to Maiden Lane, which the New York Fed created in December 2008 to buy residential mortgage securities from AIG as part of that company’s rescue three months earlier. AIG said such a transfer would block its efforts to recoup losses from banks. On January 11, it sued for a court declaration that it had not transferred those claims, including more than $7 billion in the Bank of America case. That case had been filed in August 2011 and accuses the second-largest U.S. bank of having misrepresented the quality of more than $28 billion of securities that AIG bought. It is being handled in Los Angeles federal court, where Bank of America is arguing that Maiden Lane, not AIG, should be making the claims. In seeking to halt the New York case, Maiden Lane accused AIG of trying an “end run” around the California case and that Bank of America is best able to challenge AIG’s ability to sue. Kaplan concluded that it remained best to let the California case take its course. “Given the availability of that course of action, there is no justification for a wasteful, unseemly, and unnecessary contest between sister courts over where the controversy should proceed at this time,” he wrote. He said the New York Fed’s support of Bank of America’s argument that AIG had assigned some claims to Maiden Lane appeared to “circumvent” its choice-of-court agreement with AIG. The judge said that if the New York Fed or Maiden Lane were to raise such claims they would have to do so in New York. “On the face of it, the actions of the FRBNY and its instrumentality, Maiden Lane II, sic perhaps are unattractive and, indeed, wrongful,” Kaplan wrote. Jack Gutt, a New York Fed spokesman, declined to comment. AIG said in a statement that the New York Fed was wrongfully trying to avoid a commitment to resolve the dispute in New York. “We remain hopeful that, in light of the Court’s decision, the New York Fed will honor its commitment to have the matter addressed in that forum,” the company said.

AIG claims it has the right to recoup these losses and did not transfer them when it transferred $18 billion in litigation claims to the U.S. Federal Reserve in relation to the Fed’s bailout of the insurer. The settlement the New York Fed submitted on Thursday to a Los Angeles court shows that when the Fed agreed to purchase troubled assets from AIG, it understood that it was acquiring all “right, title and interest” in them. That included litigation claims associated with those securities or their acquisition by AIG, according to the settlement. The details from the settlement between the Fed and BofA could undermine AIG’s assertion in its lawsuit filed Jan. 11 that it did not transfer litigation claims to the Fed, including more than $7 billion in the Bank of America case. Under the settlement between the Fed and Bank of America, BofA agreed to pay the New York Fed some $62 million in settlements, including $43 million related to the residential mortgage securities.

The government rescued AIG at the depths of the financial crisis as the insurer teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. The bailout ultimately totaled $182 billion, and when all was said and done the Treasury owned more than 90 percent of the company. The Treasury sold the last of that stock last year but still held some warrants. AIG said Friday it had repurchased all of them. They had originally been issued in 2008 and 2009. “The U.S. Treasury does not have any residual interest in AIG after AIG’s repurchase of these warrants,” the company said in a statement.

553,AIG,"In AIG/BofA case, NY Fed reveals details of settlement with bank","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York this week made public a mortgage-securities settlement with Bank of America that could bolster the BofA’s case against American International Group Inc over claims on the assets. AIG filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Bank of America aimed at recouping losses from the U.S. lender. AIG claims it did not lose the right to recoup these losses when it transferred $18 billion in litigation claims to the New York Fed after the U.S. central bank bailed out the insurer during the 2008 financial crisis. The settlement the New York Fed submitted to a Los Angeles court on Thursday showed that, when it agreed to purchase assets from AIG as part of its bailout, it understood that it was acquiring all “right, title and interest” in them. That included litigation claims associated with those securities, the settlement said. Earlier this week, a federal judge in New York put a related AIG dispute with the New York Fed on hold while the Los Angeles court addresses the insurer’s lawsuit against Bank of America. The Los Angeles court will ultimately have to decide who owns the Bank of America litigation claims. The settlement filed on Thursday showed that Bank of America agreed to pay the New York Fed some $62 million, including $43 million related to the residential mortgage securities. As part of the settlement, the New York Fed unit that held the assets, called Maiden Lane II, released all claims it had against Bank of America related to those securities. Asked why the New York Fed did not instead pursue further claims against Bank of America, given the size of AIG’s claims, a spokesman said the Fed bank wanted to secure the $62 million settlement. It made the decision after “an analysis of the strength of the potential claims, the cost of pursuing such claims and the likelihood that it would succeed if it was to pursue them,” the spokesman said. AIG’s bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion. The bailout was fully paid off last year, however, with a realized public net gain of $2.8 billion.

556,AIG,AIG shareholders win class-action status in lawsuit versus U.S.,"(Reuters) - Two groups of American International Group Inc (AIG.N) shareholders won class-action status from a federal judge on Monday in a $25 billion lawsuit by former Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg over alleged losses caused by the U.S. government’s bailout of the insurer. U.S. Court of Federal Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler also appointed Greenberg’s lawyer, David Boies, of Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, as lead counsel for the classes. Greenberg’s Starr International Co, once AIG’s largest shareholder with a 12 percent stake, sued the United States in 2011 over what eventually became a $182.3 billion bailout for the New York-based insurer. It said that by taking a 79.9 percent AIG stake and then conducting a reverse stock split without letting existing shareholders vote, the government conducted an illegal taking that violated the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Citing Boies’ estimate that “tens of thousands” of shareholders might be affected, Wheeler said “class certification is by far the most efficient method of adjudicating these claims.” He distinguished the case from the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2011 rejection of class status for more than 1 million Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) workers alleging gender bias, saying the AIG claims are “based on the same exact government action” rather than “literally millions” of separate actions. One class includes AIG shareholders as of September 22, 2008, when a credit agreement awarding the 79.9 percent stake took effect. The other class includes shareholders as of June 30, 2009 who were denied a chance to vote on the reverse split. U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Charles Miller declined to comment. AIG decided on January 9 not to join Greenberg’s lawsuit, amid anger from Congress and voters at the prospect that it might sue the same entity that rescued it from collapse.

558,AIG,Greenberg doubles claims in AIG bailout lawsuit vs U.S. to $55 billion,"(Reuters) - Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) chief executive, has more than doubled the size of his class-action lawsuit against the United States over the insurer’s bailout to roughly $55.5 billion from $25 billion. In an amended complaint filed late Monday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Greenberg’s Starr International Co said it is now seeking damages over Maiden Lane III LLC, a vehicle designed to rid banks of toxic debt underlying transactions with AIG. The claims are in addition to claims that Starr previously asserted over the government’s taking of a 79.9 percent stake in AIG in September 2008, which was eventually swapped for 562.9 million common shares. In the amended complaint, Starr said it is seeking to recover, on behalf of shareholders and the company, $23 billion over the government’s 79.9 percent stake, plus as much as $32.5 billion of collateral it said was given away through Maiden Lane III. It is also seeking unspecified damages related to AIG’s 1-for-20 reverse stock split in June 2009. Starr said the various actions constituted an illegal taking that violated the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. AIG in January refused to help Starr pursue the lawsuit, and on Tuesday reaffirmed that refusal. In an earlier version of the complaint, Starr estimated total damages as being “in no event less than $25 billion.” This phrase does not appear in the new complaint, which was also filed by Greenberg’s lawyer David Boies of Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP. Prior to the bailout, Starr had held a 12 percent AIG stake, making it the largest shareholder of what had been the world’s largest insurer by market value. A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Robert Dwyer, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, declined to comment. CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT Starr filed the amended complaint a few hours after U.S. Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler awarded class-action status to two groups of shareholders, which the judge said could number in the tens of thousands, challenging the $182.3 billion AIG bailout. Maiden Lane III, named for the downtown Manhattan street where AIG is based, was created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to repurchase from AIG counterparties more than $62 billion of assets linked to collateralized debt obligations. Starr said the repurchases, sometimes done at 100 cents on the dollar, was a “backdoor” bailout for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Societe Generale SA (SOGN.PA) and other banks that had entered more than $400 billion of credit default swaps with AIG. “Without any budgetary, regulatory, or other authority, FRBNY and its agents took or illegally exacted 79.9% equity and voting interest from AIG in September 2008, (and) gave away AIG’s legal rights and $32.5 billion of its collateral through the Maiden Lane III transaction,” the amended complaint said. Starr is separately appealing the November 2012 dismissal of its related lawsuit against the New York Fed. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan at the time said he found nothing to suggest that AIG directors were coerced into accepting the bailout, which he called the result of “corporate desperation. AIG decided on January 9 not to join Greenberg’s lawsuit, citing potential harm to its reputation. Some politicians and voters had recoiled at the prospect that AIG might sue the same government that had rescued it from collapse. Starr attacked this decision, saying it stemmed from government coercion and justified its lawsuit on AIG’s behalf. “The United States indicated it would wage a negative public relations campaign against AIG and its directors, terminate any cooperative relationship with AIG, and heavily scrutinize AIG’s SEC, tax, and other filings,” Starr said in the complaint. Jim Ankner, an AIG spokesman, said the board is standing by the decision and opposes the lawsuit by Greenberg, who had led the insurer for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster. “AIG will neither pursue these claims itself nor permit Starr to pursue them in AIG’s name,” he said. “AIG will move to dismiss the derivative claims asserted by Starr in AIG’s name.” On March 1, AIG eliminated the government’s last financial stake by repurchasing warrants from the Treasury Department.

560,AIG,AIG sets compensation clawback policy for executive wrongdoing,"(Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N), the insurer whose government bailout was marked by controversy over executive salaries, on Wednesday said its board adopted a clawback policy to recover compensation in case of mistakes or wrongdoing. In a regulatory filing, AIG said its board adopted the policy last week “to encourage sound risk management and individual accountability.” The policy provides a mechanism to pull back bonuses and equity awards from executives for at least the one-year period prior to any event that triggers a clawback. Among those triggering events are a financial restatement, failures of risk management or acts that hurt the company’s reputation. AIG received a bailout in September 2008 while on the brink of bankruptcy. Its rescue ultimately totaled $182 billion, all of which the government recouped, plus interest. During the course of that bailout, executive compensation was a huge sticking point. Protests broke out in early 2009 after certain executives received millions of dollars in bonuses following the rescue. At one point, the U.S. Congress considered legislation to claw back those bonuses, though it never became law.

565,AIG,UPDATE 2-AIG files to dismiss part of Greenberg suit over bailout,"* Asks court to block derivative action * AIG board already decided not to join suit * Greenberg seeking more than $55 bln in damages April 8 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc  has asked a court to block Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s efforts to sue the U.S. government on AIG’s behalf, saying its former CEO has not proven he should have the right to do so. Earlier this year, AIG drew sharp criticism from members of Congress and an outraged public when the firm considered the possibility of joining Greenberg’s lawsuit, which challenges the terms of the insurer’s $182.3 billion bailout by the federal government in 2008. AIG said Greenberg had forced its hand in even deliberating the prospect, but that ultimately it did not want to sue anyway amid a public backlash. Absent AIG’s participation, Greenberg is pursuing a derivative claim, seeking to sue the U.S. government on AIG’s behalf over the terms of the $182.3 billion rescue. Greenberg and his company Starr International, which owned 12 percent of AIG before the rescue, are also suing the government directly. But the insurer, in a filing dated Friday, said Starr had not met the burdens necessary to be allowed to pursue claims on the company’s behalf. “Starr has alleged no facts showing that the AIG board’s decision to refuse Starr’s demand cannot be attributed to a rational business purpose,” AIG said. The company said its board also feared “incalculable harm to AIG’s corporate brand and image and relationships with shareholders, customers, regulators and elected officials” if it pursued a lawsuit. A lawyer for Starr, Robert Dwyer, said in a statement that AIG’s filing repeats the position the company’s board took in January and does not impact claims Starr is pursuing directly on behalf of AIG shareholders. Starr will oppose AIG’s motion in a filing later this month, Dwyer, of the law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, said. The company has until April 26 to respond in court. Last month Starr amended its complaint, more than doubling the damages it is seeking to roughly $55.5 billion.

566,AIG,Fitch Publishes Updated Credit Analysis on AIG,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings today published an updated credit  analysis on American International Group (AIG). The report provides a  comprehensive analysis of AIG's credit, operating and financial profile. Fitch has an Issuer Default Rating of 'BBB+' on AIG with a Stable Rating  Outlook.  AIG's net profits over the last four years were materially affected by noncore  operations' results and restructuring activity. With the divestiture or runoff  of many non-core operations and the December 2012 sale of the remaining U.S.  government common stock ownership in AIG, the company is now an independent,  publicly owned company with operational focus on global property casualty  insurance and domestic life and retirement services.  The company has substantially reduced financial leverage since 2009. The pending  sale of a large majority stake in aircraft lessor International Lease Finance  Corporation (ILFC) will further reduce consolidated leverage and promote the  operational focus on insurance operations. Fitch believes that AIG's future earnings and interest coverage improvement will  hinge on the performance of the company's core insurance segments, particularly  in property casualty operations. Fitch's recent upgrade of the life insurance  subsidiaries was largely driven by a return to stronger operating profits and  earnings stability. Core U.S. property casualty results in 2012 were negatively  affected by Hurricane Sandy losses, which were outsized relative to peers. AIG has approximately $5.9 billion of debt maturing in 2013 and in 2014. Almost  two-thirds of this is related to operating debt where the company has assets  maturing to fund the repayment.

567,AIG,AIG files to dismiss part of Greenberg suit over bailout,"* Asks court to block derivative action * AIG board already decided not to join suit * Greenberg seeking more than $55 bln in damages April 8 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc  has asked a court to block Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s efforts to sue the U.S. government on AIG’s behalf, saying its former CEO has not proven he should have the right to do so. Earlier this year, AIG drew sharp criticism from members of Congress and an outraged public when the firm considered the possibility of joining Greenberg’s lawsuit, which challenges the terms of the insurer’s $182.3 billion bailout by the federal government in 2008. AIG said Greenberg had forced its hand in even deliberating the prospect, but that ultimately it did not want to sue anyway amid a public backlash. Absent AIG’s participation, Greenberg is pursuing a derivative claim, seeking to sue the U.S. government on AIG’s behalf over the terms of the $182.3 billion rescue. Greenberg and his company Starr International, which owned 12 percent of AIG before the rescue, are also suing the government directly. But the insurer, in a filing dated Friday, said Starr had not met the burdens necessary to be allowed to pursue claims on the company’s behalf. “Starr has alleged no facts showing that the AIG board’s decision to refuse Starr’s demand cannot be attributed to a rational business purpose,” AIG said. The company said its board also feared “incalculable harm to AIG’s corporate brand and image and relationships with shareholders, customers, regulators and elected officials” if it pursued a lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Starr’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Last month Starr amended its complaint, more than doubling the damages it is seeking to roughly $55.5 billion.

568,AIG,NY judge approves $115 million AIG shareholder settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday approved a $115 million settlement between American International Group Inc (AIG.N) shareholders and former CEO Maurice “Hank” Greenberg and other defendants over alleged improper accounting at the insurance giant. The accord is the latest in a string of settlements to spill out of class-action securities fraud litigation tied to practices at the insurer dating to 1999. In total, $937.5 million in settlements have been approved with defendants, including AIG. U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts in Manhattan gave final approval to the pact at a court hearing, calling it “fair, reasonable and adequate.” “Defendants are pleased that all those claims have been resolved,” Robert Dwyer, a lawyer for Greenberg at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, said in a statement. Batts approved a $725 million settlement with AIG in February 2012. She earlier approved a $97.5 million accord with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers PWC.UL. In August, a federal appeals court reversed a decision by Batts rejecting preliminary approval of a fourth settlement for $72 million with General Re, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc(BRKa.N). LONG-RUNNING LAWSUIT The settlement with Greenberg and the other defendants resolves a 2004 lawsuit accusing the defendants of misleading investors in connection with an alleged illegal bid-rigging scheme in the insurance industry. The lawsuit also accused Greenberg and others of making false and misleading statements about an alleged accounting fraud that resulted in a $3.9 billion restatement by AIG in 2005. AIG separately paid $1.6 billion to settle various regulatory investigations of the accounting fraud, and Greenberg and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith paid $16.5 million to settle claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The alleged activities took place well before AIG accepted $182 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Among those participating in the $115 million settlement are Greenberg, Smith, two other executives and two of Greenberg’s companies, C.V. Starr & Co and Starr International Co. Two Ohio state pension funds acted as lead plaintiffs for the class, which covers AIG shareholders who bought stock from October 1999 to April 2005. Batts also approved awarding 13.25 percent of the settlement, or $15.24 million, as attorneys fees to plaintiffs’ lawyers led by the law firms Labaton Sucharow and Hahn Loeser & Parks. Thomas Dubbs, a lawyer at Labaton, did not respond to a request for comment. Dwyer, Greenberg’s lawyer, said in his statement that the settlement also “effectively extinguishes all damages claims” asserted in a separate civil fraud lawsuit being pursued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The lawsuit, filed in 2005, seeks more than $6 billion in damages and centers on two allegedly fraudulent reinsurance transactions in 1999 and 2000. Schneiderman had sought to object to the settlement, but Batts said in January he did not have standing. Schneiderman has filed a notice of appeal. Damien LaVera, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said regardless the outcome of the settlement, “our office intends to continue to pursue this case.” An AIG spokesman declined to comment on the settlement.

571,AIG,Court backs AIG bid for new venue in big Bank of America fraud case,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) won a legal victory over where a mortgage fraud lawsuit it brought against Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) should be heard, a two-year-old case that has largely been on hold because of the dispute over venue. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday agreed with AIG that the case belongs in state court, not federal court as Bank of America preferred. It threw out an October 2011 lower court ruling that had denied AIG’s bid to move the case back to the New York state court where it had begun two months earlier. Writing for a three-judge appeals court panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Pierre Leval rejected Bank of America’s argument that the case belonged in federal court under the Edge Act, a 1919 law governing international banking. “Removal from state to federal court was not authorized by the statute,” he wrote. AIG had sued Bank of America for $10 billion. It accused the bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units of engineering a “massive” fraud by misrepresenting the quality of more than $28 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities in 349 trusts it bought, and lying to credit rating agencies about the underlying loans. Shares of Bank of America plunged 20.3 percent on the day the lawsuit was announced. The case is part of AIG’s effort to recover from activities that it says helped trigger its near collapse in 2008, leading to $182.3 billion of federal bailouts. It is unclear how Friday’s decision affects the part of AIG’s case relating to Countrywide, which has been moved to the court of U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson called Friday’s decision “a narrow procedural ruling.” AIG spokesman Jon Diat said the insurer was pleased with the decision. But the venue issue may not be over, because the 2nd Circuit said Bank of America may pursue an alternative argument to keep the case in federal court. Venue disputes often arise when parties expect more favorable results in particular courts. The Edge Act was adopted to help federally chartered banks compete more effectively in offshore banking. To help free those banks from extra burdens from state regulators, it lets federal courts hear lawsuits against U.S. companies over banking transactions that are international or in a U.S. territory. In keeping the case in federal court, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in October 2011 recognized that a handful of the underlying home loans concerned properties in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But AIG countered that the securities it bought were created and sold entirely in the United States. It also said that of the 1.7 million home loans underlying the trusts, just 27 involved property in U.S. territories. Leval accepted AIG’s argument, and called Bank of America’s broader interpretation of the admittedly ungrammatical Edge Act statute “arbitrary and illogical.” He did not address the merits of AIG’s damages claims. Jones has left the federal bench, and U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan now oversees the case in Manhattan federal court. Pfaelzer oversees a variety of litigation over the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in July 2008. Her approval is required for the bank’s record $500 million settlement, announced on Wednesday, with investors who claimed Countrywide misled them into buying risky mortgage debt.

575,AIG,"AIG beats estimates, property and casualty business shines","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) property and casualty business booked its first underwriting profit in two and a half years during the first quarter, as the insurer wrote more premiums at higher prices and reported lower losses. The long-awaited turnaround in AIG’s property and casualty business helped the company beat analysts’ quarterly profit expectations on Thursday, sending its shares up 3 percent in after-hours trading. The unit reported a combined ratio of 97.3 percent last quarter, the first time that ratio has dropped below 100 since the third quarter of 2010. A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims. “The important thing for this quarter is that the combined ratio improved,” said Josh Stirling, an insurance analyst with Bernstein Research. “That’s the thing people will focus on: they actually made money.” Insurers have had trouble raising prices in the property and casualty business for some time. AIG has not reported an annual underwriting profit there since 2007, but the first quarter seems to have been a turning point. Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N), Chubb Corp (CB.N) and ACE Ltd ACE.N also beat earnings expectations last month, citing higher pricing. AIG’s property and casualty unit reported operating income of $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up from $1 billion a year earlier. Its first-quarter, property-and-casualty underwriting income of $231 million compares with a $180 million underwriting loss in the same period a year ago. AIG’s life insurance business also reported some improvement, with higher returns on alternative assets and gains on the value of securities held in its investment portfolio. Its operating income rose to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion a year ago. But like other life insurers, the business is still navigating a low interest-rate environment that hurts interest income from bonds and makes it difficult to sell fixed annuities. Overall, AIG’s profit fell 35 percent to $1.98 billion, or $1.34 per share, from $3.05 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. On an operating basis, AIG earned $1.34 per share, compared with an average analyst estimate of 87 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The profit decline was related to lower premium income because of special items, including foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding those factors, net premiums rose 4 percent compared with the year-ago period. AIG also spent more to upgrade infrastructure, technology and personnel, driving expenses higher. In a memo to employees obtained by Reuters, Chief Executive Robert Benmosche called it a “strong quarter,” but said further improvement was needed. “Our priority this year is to improve operating fundamentals and reduce costs,” he said. “Whether this means lowering the cost of capital, re-engineering our systems, or focusing on business lines and geographical locations that make strategic sense for our company, each one of us should be looking for ways to improve efficiencies and eliminate expenses.” The March quarter was an important benchmark for AIG, because it was the first in which the U.S. government had fully exited all its bailout-related holdings. The Federal Reserve and Treasury Department together offered $182 billion in combined support for AIG stemming from the 2008 financial crisis. After years of restructuring, selling assets and returning its government-owned stock to the public, AIG eliminated the government’s last financial interest in March when it bought back warrants from the Treasury for about $25 million. Despite that progress, there are still some questions hanging over AIG, including how it will be treated under its presumed status as a “systemically important financial institution,” or SIFI, which the Federal Reserve has not yet officially designated, and when it will be able to resume dividend payments. AIG shares have risen 19 percent this year, closing at $42.13 on Thursday. But they remain well below the company’s book value of $59.39, excluding market gains and losses. Analysts say investors are hesitant to value AIG as richly as other insurers because of its bailout, its volatile earnings since 2007 and its ongoing turnaround plan. While management is investing in some long-neglected areas of AIG, overall it is trying to reduce costs and staff. Benmosche also wants AIG’s property and casualty business to produce a return-on-equity of at least 10 percent and a coverage ratio of 90 to 95 by 2015. Some investors are also waiting for the company to reinstate its dividend, which has been suspended since 2008. The company has so far offered cautious guidance on that topic. While resuming dividend payments is important to management, AIG’s first priority is getting ratings agencies and regulators comfortable with its capital levels, executives have said. AIG has also been using excess capital to buy back some of its more expensive debt and its stock. The company called $1.1 billion of junior subordinated notes and spent $1.3 billion buying back debt during the first quarter, which will reduce interest payments by $165 million a year. AIG is also considering calling another $750 million in callable hybrids in the second quarter, which would save it another $50 million in annual interest payments. “I would love to be able to put a dividend on the stock,” Benmosche said in a conference call in February. But he also noted that ratings agencies “want more time to see us continue to evolve with the good, solid earnings that you’ve seen so far.” ",5022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aig-results/aig-beats-estimates-property-and-casualty-business-shines-idUSBRE94114520130502

Some investors are also waiting for the company to reinstate its dividend, which has been suspended since 2008. The company has so far offered cautious guidance on that topic. While resuming dividend payments is important to management, AIG’s first priority is getting ratings agencies and regulators comfortable with its capital levels, executives have said. AIG has also been using excess capital to buy back some of its more expensive debt and its stock. The company called $1.1 billion of junior subordinated notes and spent $1.3 billion buying back debt during the first quarter, which will reduce interest payments by $165 million a year. AIG is also considering calling another $750 million in callable hybrids in the second quarter, which would save it another $50 million in annual interest payments. “I would love to be able to put a dividend on the stock,”  Benmosche said in a conference call in February. But he also noted that ratings agencies “want more time to see us continue to evolve with the good, solid earnings that you’ve seen so far.”",5022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-results/update-2-aig-beats-estimates-property-and-casualty-business-shines-idUSL3N0DJ4J720130502

578,AIG,AIG may pursue fraud case versus BofA over Countrywide,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) may pursue a lawsuit accusing Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) Countrywide unit of causing billions of dollars of losses by fraudulently inducing it to buy risky residential mortgage-backed securities. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles on Monday said AIG could pursue claims that Countrywide falsely represented in offering documents that it followed underwriting guidelines, as part of a “company-wide culture of abandonment of underwriting standards and wholesale use of ‘exceptions.’” Pfaelzer dismissed AIG claims related to alleged oral misstatements and negligent misrepresentations. She also allowed AIG to submit an amended complaint. The case is part of overlapping litigation begun in 2011, when AIG sued Bank of America for $10 billion over activities it said helped trigger its near collapse in 2008 and subsequent $182.3 billion federal bailout. Bank of America has paid more than $40 billion to settle legal, regulatory and borrower disputes tied to its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp in July 2008 and Merrill Lynch & Co six months later. On Monday, it reached a $1.6 billion cash settlement with bond insurer MBIA Inc (MBI.N) over Countrywide. And on May 30 it will ask Justice Barbara Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court to approve an $8.5 billion settlement with Countrywide investors, an accord that AIG also opposes. In the $10 billion case, AIG accused Bank of America, Countrywide and Merrill of a “massive” fraud by misrepresenting the quality of more than $28 billion of RMBS it bought, and lying to credit rating agencies about the underlying loans. Pfaelzer handles a part of that case related to Countrywide, and ruled even though New York-based AIG and Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America are battling over whether the case belongs in federal court at all. Last month, a federal appeals court in New York agreed with AIG that the case should return to the state court where it began, but gave Bank of America another chance to keep it in federal court. A separate issue is whether AIG assigned its right to sue over $7.3 billion of losses in the Bank of America case to Maiden Lane II, a vehicle created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to buy troubled RMBS from the insurer. Pfaelzer said AIG may for now sue over RMBS sold to Maiden Lane II, but that Bank of America may later renew its objection. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the bank believes it has strong defenses to the remaining claims. AIG spokesman Jon Diat said: “As a result of the court’s decision, AIG is able to pursue its full damages claim against Bank of America.” Pfaelzer oversees a variety of litigation over Countrywide. Her approval is required for the bank’s record $500 million settlement, announced last month, with investors who also claimed Countrywide misled them into buying risky mortgage debt.

AIG, which is already regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve, expects more oversight if it is declared a “systemically important financial institution,” or SIFI. The designation is widely expected after the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council told the company in October that it may do so. AIG’s board is looking at candidates who have run regulated financial institutions as well as former regulators, according to the sources. There is no specific time frame or deadline for a new director to be named, the sources said. The names of potential candidates could not be learned. AIG spokesman Matt Gallagher declined to comment on Wednesday. AIG has been reshaping its board since repaying the government’s crisis-era bailout. The search for a director with regulatory experience highlights how major financial institutions now feel even more pressure to manage their relationships with regulators. Earlier this month, AIG shareholders elected two new directors to the board with insurance experience: William Jurgensen, former CEO of Nationwide Insurance, and Theresa Stone, a former insurance executive. The board’s regulatory, compliance and public policy committee, is chaired by Douglas Steenland, the former CEO of Northwest Airlines Corp and includes Jurgensen and Henry Miller, a restructuring expert. The committee’s duties include reviewing AIG’s relations with regulators and governmental agencies.

583,AIG,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg seeks dismissal of case against him,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York’s highest court will hear arguments on Tuesday on whether to dismiss a lawsuit accusing Hank Greenberg of orchestrating sham transactions when he was head of insurance company American International Group Inc. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman dropped damages claims in the case last month, but he is still trying to have Greenberg, 88, banned from the securities industry and from being a director or officer of a public company. David Boies, a prominent lawyer who represents Greenberg, said he would argue at Tuesday’s hearing for a dismissal of the lawsuit. “The case is over,” Boies told Reuters on Friday. Schneiderman disagreed. “Three consecutive attorneys general have pursued this case,” said his spokesman, Damien Lavera. “Justice demands personal accountability for people who commit fraud, no matter how rich or well-connected they may be.” Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general at the time, brought the lawsuit in 2005. Andrew Cuomo, Spitzer’s successor and now New York’s governor, later oversaw the case. It centers on two transactions in which AIG misled its shareholders. One, with General Re Corp, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, raised AIG’s loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk. Another, with Capco Reinsurance Co, hid a $210 million underwriting loss in an auto-warranty program. At Tuesday’s hearing, New York’s Court of Appeals will hear Greenberg’s effort to reverse lower court rulings that allowed the case against him and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith to go forward. The appeal originally included a much-anticipated challenge to New York’s Martin Act, the 1921 securities fraud statute that attorneys general Spitzer, Cuomo and Schneiderman have wielded against Wall Street since the early 2000s. Boies was set to argue that the state attorney general lacks authority to recover damages on behalf of private entities. Those arguments became moot on April 25, when Schneiderman dropped his damages claims against Greenberg and Smith. “I’m disappointed, but I’m not going to complain,” Boies said on Friday. “I think the Martin Act issue is an important issue.” Regarding the state’s remaining claim, Boies said he would tell the judges that the state could not seek injunctive relief now because it did not push for it in the lower courts. “They have now abandoned the only claim they made in the trial court, which was a claim for damages,” Boies said. “Their attempt to keep the case alive by adding a new claim for injunctive relief should fail.” He said he might also argue that the state had wrongly relied on hearsay evidence to support the Gen Re claim. “There is no admissible evidence ... of any knowledge or participation by Mr. Greenberg or Mr. Smith in the activity that is alleged to be improper,” Boies said. Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, who will present the attorney general’s case on Tuesday, is expected to argue that the state is not making a new claim and that the trial should proceed. In court papers, the state has said Greenberg “initiated, negotiated and approved” the transaction with Gen Re “with knowledge of its fraudulent terms.” Smith helped implement the deal and also knew of the sham, the state said. A seven-member panel of the court will hear the arguments in Albany. A decision could come in June. Spitzer, who went on to become New York governor before resigning in 2008, applauded Schneiderman’s resolve in bringing the case to trial. “Money is no longer what matters in this litigation,” he told Reuters. “What is critical is the historical record be set out with accuracy.” Former New York governors George Pataki and Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo’s father, said in a joint op-ed piece published in the Wall Street Journal on May 12 that Schneiderman should drop the case. The transaction with General Re led to five convictions of and two guilty pleas from former officials of the companies. A federal appeals court overturned the convictions in 2011, citing errors by the trial judge. The five entered into deferred prosecution agreements. As part of the deals, all five agreed that aspects of the transaction were fraudulent and that they should have taken steps to stop it. Buffett was not accused of wrongdoing. Greenberg left New York-based AIG in March 2005 after nearly four decades at the insurer’s helm. After his ouster, AIG paid $1.6 billion to settle regulators’ claims of improper accounting and other practices. AIG also restated financial results for several years. The case is People v.

584,AIG,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg should still face trial: NY state lawyer,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hank Greenberg should still face trial over sham transactions he is accused of orchestrating while he was head of American International Group (AIG.N), even though New York has dropped most of its claims against him, a lawyer for the state argued on Tuesday. “We’re looking for a deterrent effect,” Barbara Underwood, the state solicitor general, told New York’s highest court. She said the state wanted an admission from Greenberg, who headed AIG until March 2005. Greenberg is accused of misleading shareholders over the financial health of AIG through transactions a decade ago that the attorney general has said were designed to help boost the company’s share price. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman dropped claims for as much as $6 billion in damages last month, but he is still trying to have Greenberg, 88, banned from the securities industry and from being a director or officer of a public company. New York’s Court of Appeals heard arguments on Tuesday over whether the case against Greenberg and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith should go forward. A decision could come in June. David Boies, a prominent lawyer who represents Greenberg, asked the judges to throw out the case before trial, arguing there was no evidence of wrongdoing and no basis for injunctive relief such as the bans. “In order to get injunctive relief, you must show either some danger of continuing violation or some ability to ask for disgorgement and restitution,” Boies told the panel. The judges questioned Boies about evidence against Greenberg and they also pressed Underwood about whether the attorney general was seeking a moral victory. “We’re going to trial on that?” Judge Eugene Pigott asked Underwood after she said the attorney general was seeking bans on the two executives. Underwood responded that the attorney general may also seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. She said the state was entitled to go after “performance-based compensation that was affected by these frauds.” She declined to cite a figure. The lawsuit, filed in 2005, was one of the biggest enforcement actions brought by Eliot Spitzer when he was New York attorney general. The case centers on two transactions in which AIG was accused of misleading its shareholders. One, with General Re Corp, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), raised AIG’s loss reserves by $500 million without transferring risk. Another, with Capco Reinsurance Co, hid a $210 million underwriting loss in an auto-warranty program. In court papers, the state has said Greenberg “initiated, negotiated and approved” the transaction with Gen Re “with knowledge of its fraudulent terms.” CFO Howard Smith helped implement the deal and also knew of the sham, the state said. Judge Robert Smith asked Boies if a jury could decide that Greenberg’s subordinates wouldn’t do “a crooked deal” without asking him. Boies noted AIG did thousands of transactions, but Judge Smith retorted that the General Re transaction was a $600 million deal. Vincent Sama, an attorney who argued for CFO Smith, also told the court it could not infer the CFO knew what was going on. Five former officials of AIG and General Re entered into deferred prosecution agreements in which they agreed that aspects of the transaction were fraudulent. Buffett was not accused of wrongdoing. Greenberg left New York-based AIG in March 2005 after nearly four decades at the insurer’s helm. After his ouster, AIG paid $1.6 billion to settle regulators’ claims of improper accounting and other practices. AIG also restated financial results for several years. Last month, a federal court approved a class action settlement between AIG and shareholders over the same transactions that are at the center of the state’s lawsuit, forcing Schneiderman to drop his damages claims against Greenberg and Smith. Boies had been planning to argue in the appeal that federal law prevents the state attorney general from recovering damages on behalf of private entities. That would have been a major challenge to New York’s securities fraud statute, the 1921 Martin Act, which attorneys general have wielded against Wall Street since the early 2000s. But Boies on Tuesday said Schneiderman’s move to withdraw the damages claims against Greenberg had rendered that argument moot. “I believe that’s over with,” Boies said when asked whether the question of the Martin Act being pre-empted by federal law was still before the court.

The insurer and Maiden Lane II, a vehicle created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to buy troubled RMBS from the insurer, agreed to dismiss the case without prejudice, according to a May 28 court order, which was made public on Thursday.

Earlier this month, in a case involving Bank of America Corp’s Countrywide unit, a federal judge in California said AIG may sue over RMBS sold to Maiden Lane II. “In light of the recent ruling that AIG did not assign its fraud claims to ML II, we have agreed to dismiss our declaratory judgment action, without prejudice to our right to reinstitute it if necessary,” AIG spokesman James Ankner said.

587,AIG,Sale of AIG plane lease unit to Chinese group at risk,"(Reuters) - A Chinese group’s purchase of ILFC, one of the world’s largest airplane leasing companies, could collapse after insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said on Friday it did not receive a scheduled deposit payment. Under terms of the agreement, the missed payment gives AIG the right to cancel the sale, though such a decision was not expected to be imminent. It is unclear from the agreement whether AIG would be entitled to some sort of break-up fee, and if so, how much. AIG declined to comment, while a spokesman for the consortium was not immediately available to comment. Missing a payment on a signed deal is highly unusual. Bankers and attorneys said it underscored the difficulties in dealing with a consortium of investors who may have differing opinions about how deals should get done and how much each party pays. The Chinese government’s involvement complicates matters even further. “Consortiums in general pose concerns,” said Morton Pierce, a partner in the mergers and acquisitions department at law firm White & Case. “A foreign consortium adds another element of complexity.” AIG said last December it would sell up to 90 percent of ILFC for up to $4.8 billion. Two weeks ago, the sides agreed to extend the deadline for the deal’s closing by a month to mid-June. The Chinese consortium was to include New China Trust, which is one-fifth owned by Barclays Plc (BARC.L); China Aviation Industrial Fund; and P3 Investments Ltd. An arm of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK), China’s biggest bank, was meant to join the group once the deal had regulatory approval. But executives at aircraft leasing companies have speculated since the deal was announced last December that it might not close, according to one person who has spoken to a number of the executives over the past few weeks. “This appeared to be a group of investors who were not household names for the most part and who did not have experience with Western investing,” said the person, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak to the media. But another source said the deal was not expected to fall apart, and could still go through. Deals with Chinese buyers were often more complicated due to the government’s role in all business transactions, this person added. “Things take longer and it is not always clear who is making decisions,” the person said. “The approval process is not as transparent as it is in the U.S.” Even with the difficulties in getting approval at home, Chinese companies have become more comfortable doing deals in the United States, despite past stumbles. With over $10.5 billion in deals in the United States so far, 2013 is on pace to be the biggest year for M&A; by Chinese companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. There were $11.5 billion in deals by Chinese companies in the United States in 2012 - a significantly higher figure than in any year other than 2007. ILFC was the last key asset that AIG was attempting to dispose of following its government-backed restructuring. AIG filed to take the business public in 2011 before ultimately agreeing on the direct sale last year. “We are disappointed by this news, as the sale was significant to AIG’s restructuring. Still, we think ILFC is an attractive franchise and note that AIG may have other options, including an initial public offering,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said in a note to clients. With nearly 1,000 owned or managed planes, ILFC is one of the world’s largest players in the market for buying aircraft and leasing them to airlines. But ILFC has been hurt after recording heavy charges in recent years to write down the value of older planes in its fleet. The sale price was about half of what AIG had once insisted the business should be worth. AIG shares fell 2.4 percent to $45.12 in afternoon trading.

590,AIG,GM rejoins S&P; 500 four years after U.S. bailout,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) will rejoin the S&P; 500 index this week, marking a key milestone in the recovery of a company that needed billions of dollars to stay afloat during the financial crisis. GM will return to the S&P; 500 after the stock market closes on Thursday, the S&P; Dow Jones Indices said on Monday. At the same time, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) will join the S&P; 100 index. The move represents a symbolic victory for GM, which has taken steps to overhaul its operations and return to viability since its near-collapse in 2009. Companies in this index are considered leaders in their industry, the S&P; said on its website. Returning to the index will help boost shares, particularly important in the case of GM, which is still partially owned by the U.S. government. AIG received $182 billion in U.S. funds, while GM took $50 billion during the economic recession in 2008 and 2009. The bailouts were highly controversial, but government officials said they were necessary to stabilize the weak U.S. economy. In December, the U.S. Treasury Department announced it was selling its remaining stake in AIG. Taxpayers made a profit on the AIG bailout, a once unthinkable outcome. Later that month, the U.S. Treasury said it would exit GM by early 2014. But unlike AIG’s case, the U.S. government is likely to lose billions of dollars on GM. GM will replace H. J.

593,AIG,UPDATE 2-AIG finally gets advance for sale of aircraft-leasing unit,"June 5 (Reuters) - AIG’s sale of its airplane-leasing business to a Chinese consortium overcame a key financing stumble and has likely cleared a major U.S. regulatory hurdle as well, but questions about the deal’s future persist. The Chinese consortium buying International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) placed about 10 percent of the purchase price in an escrow account, American International Group said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. A delay in the payment had threatened to derail the deal. The deposit also indicated that the U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had decided that the deal posed no threat to national security, according to a source familiar with the situation and a review of the contract between AIG and the buyers. The ILFC buying consortium includes New China Trust, one-fifth owned by Barclays Plc ; China Aviation Industrial Fund, and P3 Investments Ltd. An approval from CFIUS, a secretive body made up of several government agencies and headed by the U.S. Treasury secretary, would be a major milestone for the $4.8 billion deal. It would also come ahead of a summit later this week between U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. National security concerns and political backlash against  deals involving Chinese buyers have for years hindered dealmaking between companies in the world’s two largest economies. CFIUS, whose reviews are notorious for lack of transparency, has added to the uncertainty by leaving dealmakers with little guidance on what would raise alarms in Washington. AIG, the Treasury Department and a spokesman for the consortium were not immediately available to comment. The deal still needs approvals from other regulators, and  AIG’s contract with the consortium is set to expire on June 14. The insurer has not yet decided whether it would extend it or look for other options for ILFC, a source familiar with the situation said. Other options before AIG could include an initial public offering. AIG filed to take the business public in 2011 before ultimately agreeing on the sale last year. AIG has done that before, notably when it took Asian insurance business AIA public after a $35.5 billion deal to sell it to Britain’s Prudential Plc fell apart. With nearly 1,000 owned or managed planes, ILFC is one of the world’s largest players in the business of buying aircraft and leasing them to airlines. AIG announced the deal to sell ILFC last December . Two weeks ago, the two sides agreed to extend the deadline for the deal’s closing by a month, to mid-June . But last week, AIG said the consortium had failed to wire the money for the initial deposit on the deal, raising questions about whether it would go ahead. The source attributed the delay in the escrow deposit to complexities arising from dealing with banks in China and the involvement of several parties and regulators in the cross-border transaction. ILFC was the last major asset that AIG was attempting to dispose of following its government-backed restructuring. It has recorded heavy charges in recent years to write down the value of older planes in its fleet. The sale price for ILFC was about half of what AIG once said the business was worth. AIG shares closed down 20 cents at $43.90 on Wednesday.",6052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-ilfc/update-2-aig-finally-gets-advance-for-sale-of-aircraft-leasing-unit-idUSL1N0EH0UP20130605

597,AIG,Former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg loses bid to dismiss NY case,"(Reuters) - Former American International Group (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg failed to persuade New York state’s highest court to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold him accountable for sham transactions at the insurer. The decision by the state’s Court of Appeals is a victory for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has been pursuing a case first brought in 2005. Greenberg, 88, has argued that there was no admissible evidence that he orchestrated a $500 million transaction with reinsurer General Re Corp that misled AIG shareholders, and that the case should have ended in April when the state dropped a claim for as much as $6 billion in damages. But in a 7-0 decision on Tuesday, the Court of Appeals said there was easily enough evidence that Greenberg and co-defendant Howard Smith, AIG’s former chief financial officer, knew the AIG-Gen Re transaction was fraudulent for the case to go forward. “We have no difficulty in concluding that ... there is evidence sufficient for trial that both Greenberg and Smith participated in a fraud,” Judge Robert Smith wrote for the state’s top court. The ruling also said that the attorney general could seek to ban Greenberg and Smith, 68, from participating in the securities industry and from serving as officers and directors of public companies. Greenberg led AIG for nearly four decades before he was ousted in 2005. The following year, AIG paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes into its business practices. The Greenberg case was brought by former state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, and was later pursued by his successors Andrew Cuomo, now New York’s governor, and Schneiderman. The long-running state case against Greenberg and Smith hit a roadblock in April when a federal judge approved a $115 million settlement between AIG shareholders and Greenberg, Smith and other defendants over the alleged improper accounting. Schneiderman withdrew the damage claims because of an unrelated 2008 Court of Appeals ruling that barred his office from seeking restitution on behalf of victims who settled a federal class-action, even if they were not made whole. But the attorney general said the state still wanted a trial of Greenberg and Smith over the transaction with General Re, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N), which allegedly boosted loss reserves without transferring risk. The state case also includes a transaction with Capco Reinsurance Co that hid a $210 million underwriting loss in an auto-warranty program. The AIG-Gen Re transaction was the subject of a federal criminal case in which Greenberg and Smith were named as alleged co-conspirators, but not defendants. In the criminal case, four former Gen Re executives and a former AIG executive were found guilty in 2008 of engineering the reinsurance deal. In 2011, however, a federal appeals court threw out the convictions and ordered a new trial, citing errors by the judge. Last year, the former executives admitted to conducting the fraudulent transaction and cut deals to end the criminal case against them. Smith cited the federal appeals court decision in his opinion on Tuesday, saying the court held there was enough evidence to support the jury’s finding that the fraudulent conspiracy started with a telephone call from Greenberg. David Boies, a lawyer for Greenberg, and Vincent Sama, a lawyer for Smith, said they were disappointed with the Court of Appeals ruling. But they said they would seek to dismiss the remaining case in the lower courts because the state isn’t entitled to the remedies it is seeking. Boies may argue the state can’t go for the bans because there’s no risk of continuing violations by his client. The state also claims it is entitled to go after performance based compensation affected by the fraud. But Boies may argue it can’t seek the compensation, because AIG paid it, not the state. AIG and Greenberg and Smith released all claims that existed against each other in November 2009. There is room for argument about whether the proposed bans “would be a justifiable exercise of a court’s discretion,” Smith wrote in his opinion. But that question and the availability of other relief Schneiderman may seek must be decided by the lower courts, the court said. The appeal originally included a much-anticipated challenge to New York’s Martin Act, a powerful 1921 securities fraud statute that Spitzer used aggressively to fight Wall Street. That issue become moot after Schneiderman withdrew the damages claim. The case is New York v. Greenberg et al, New York State Court of Appeals, No. 63.

600,AIG,Judge narrows Greenberg lawsuit versus U.S. over AIG bailout,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has allowed former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg to continue his multibillion dollar lawsuit against the United States over the insurer’s bailout, but took away some of his claims. Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims said Greenberg’s Starr International Co may pursue claims over the government’s taking of a 79.9 percent stake in AIG in September 2008 and a separate 1-for-20 reverse stock split in June 2009. The judge rejected the government’s arguments that these claims should be dismissed because the stake has already been divested, and that such claims more properly belonged to AIG itself because shareholders all suffered the same type of harm. Wheeler nonetheless granted motions by the government and AIG to dismiss “derivative claims” that Starr had asserted on behalf of AIG, including over the insurer’s refusal to help him pursue the lawsuit. AIG’s board decided unanimously in January not to join Starr’s case after a public backlash, including from Congress. Critics objected to the prospect that AIG might effectively be asking taxpayers whose money helped save it from collapse during the 2008 financial crisis to return billions of dollars. While saying he was “troubled” that Treasury Department lawyers may have pressured AIG to stay out of the lawsuit, Wheeler said the board exercised its business judgment in an “informed, transparent, rational, and exemplary fashion.” The judge ruled one day after New York’s highest state court said state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman may pursue an unrelated case against Greenberg, 88, over an alleged accounting fraud at AIG more than eight years ago. Including the effect of the reverse stock split, AIG’s share price has fallen roughly 96 percent since the middle of 2007, when credit market conditions began to tighten. Starr once held a 12 percent stake in AIG, which had been the world’s largest insurer by market value prior to the financial crisis and a $182.3 billion federal bailout. Its lawsuit grew in March to roughly $55.5 billion in size. This comprised $23 billion related to the 79.9 percent stake, which was later swapped for 562.9 million common shares, plus $32.5 billion of collateral that Starr said the government gave away to help rid banks that dealt with AIG of toxic debt. Starr has alleged that the bailout and related government actions constituted an illegal taking that violated the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. David Boies, a lawyer for Starr, in a statement said he was pleased that Wheeler let stand claims for “tens of billions of dollars that the government took without just compensation and/or illegally exacted.” AIG spokesman Jon Diat said the New York-based insurer is pleased with the decision. U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Allison Price declined to comment. A trial could begin late next year. Starr is separately appealing another judge’s dismissal of its related lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

604,AIG,Bank of America rejects AIG bid to reopen $8.5 bln mortgage accord,"NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp  has rejected a bid to re-open negotiations into its proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities, indicating it plans to take its chances that a New York judge will approve the deal. American International Group Inc and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, Chicago and Indianapolis, which object to the settlement, sent a letter to Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee overseeing the securities. The letter, which was filed in New York State Supreme Court on Thursday, requested immediate settlement discussions. “We are willing and available now to discuss ... how to best construct an open, fair and transparent process,” Daniel Reilly, a lawyer for AIG, and Derek Loeser, a lawyer for the home loan banks, wrote. AIG and other objectors complained that the accord offered them only a fraction of what they lost, and was negotiated without them. Justice Barbara Kapnick, who is hearing testimony to decide whether to approve the settlement, had asked the parties to consider mediation rather than wait for her to rule. Kapnick made the request on June 14 before a break in the proceeding, which resumes July 8, the letter said. Bank of America had agreed to the settlement two years ago to resolve the claims of investors in bonds issued by mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp, which it bought in 2008. It hopes a settlement, if approved, will resolve much of its remaining legal obligations stemming from Countrywide. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank paid $2.5 billion for Countrywide, but the purchase became an albatross and has cost the bank tens of billions of dollars for litigation, loan buybacks and other mortgage-related costs. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc , MetLife Inc and Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Co entered into the settlement.

605,AIG,"UPDATE 2-Prudential to fight U.S. proposal to label it ""systemic""","By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON, July 2 (Reuters) - Insurance company Prudential Financial Inc said on Tuesday it will contest a proposal by the new U.S. risk council to designate it as systemically important, a tag that would subject it to stricter oversight by federal banking regulators. In a financial filing on Tuesday, the company declared it would request a closed-door hearing before the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a new body of regulators created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law. “We continue to have faith in the integrity of the FSOC’s review process, which provides for the ability to contest the proposed designation under the applicable regulations,” the company said. So far, only a small group of non-bank financial firms have revealed that the FSOC has proposed tagging them as systemic. Prudential’s decision came one day before the end of a 30-day window to notify the FSOC that it intended to legally challenge the designation. In deciding to appeal, Prudential is wading into uncharted legal territory. The FSOC, which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary and comprised of the country’s top federal financial regulators, is a relatively new federal body that is testing its legal powers. It is tasked generally with policing for systemic risks in the marketplace. It has the specific power to classify large firms whose failure could threaten financial markets as “systemically important financial institutions,” or SIFIs, which triggers additional scrutiny by the Federal Reserve. The designation also comes with higher capital requirements and other costly rules. Certain large banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc  and Citigroup Inc automatically received the SIFI designation. “The Council has developed a robust process for evaluating whether a nonbank financial company should be subject to Board of Governors supervision and to enhanced prudential standards,” a Treasury spokeswoman said about Prudential’s decision. “While the Council does not comment on proposed designations, the Council will grant a hearing within 30 days for any company that contests it. Under the law, a company can request a hearing if it has concerns about the proposed designations. The FSOC will now have 30 days to schedule a non public hearing for Prudential. After that it will need to make a final decision within 60 days. “We will continue to work closely with regulators to demonstrate our belief that the company does not meet the requirements of the SIFI designation under the relevant statute,” the company said. The FSOC last month notified Prudential, along with GE Capital and American International Group Inc, that it was proposing to designate all three. On Tuesday, GE Capital and AIG both signaled they will not appeal the FSOC’s proposal. “We have strong capital and liquidity positions and we are already supervised by the Fed. Accordingly, we have decided not to appeal or ask for a hearing,” said Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric Co. “We have been and will be prepared to meet the requirements for SIFIs.” A spokesman for AIG was less direct in his statement, saying AIG “welcomes supervision by the Federal Reserve, and is already working closely with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.” All three companies previously disclosed what the FSOC was doing because they are publicly traded, but the FSOC is not allowed to name companies until the process is completed. Although the hearing will not be public, many lawyers are expected to watch the process closely. Paul Atkins, a former Republican commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who is a critic of the FSOC, said on Tuesday that he believes Prudential does not meet the criteria to be a SIFI and he is glad the firm is fighting back. “The FSOC is a travesty,” he said. “The process is antithetical to a democratic society - no transparency, no rule of law, no accountability.” Atkins also predicted that an appeal could end up in the courts and noted there is already an outstanding lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the FSOC’s broad powers. However, he also said that Dodd-Frank limits the grounds on which companies can challenge a SIFI designation. Alice Joe, executive director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said the challenge shows frustration with how regulators are applying bank-centric rules to non-banks. “If Prudential is designated, it will be a slippery slope for all other large insurance companies,” Joe said. “Their business models aren’t designed to put up capital, so there will be a major transformation of the industry taking place.”",7022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/gecapital-fsoc/update-2-prudential-to-fight-u-s-proposal-to-label-it-systemic-idUSL2N0F81J120130702
606,AIG,Fed Chairman Bernanke should not testify in AIG bailout lawsuit: U.S.,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve chairman should not testify in the lawsuit by American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) former chief Maurice “Hank” Greenberg against the United States over the insurer’s 2008 bailout, the U.S. Department of Justice said. In a Monday filing with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the government said Greenberg’s Starr International Co failed to show the “extraordinary circumstances” needed to justify a deposition of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in the multibillion-dollar lawsuit. The government said information about Bernanke’s role in the bailout of AIG can be obtained elsewhere, such as minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or interviews of other officials. It said this obviated any need for a deposition that Starr wants to hold on August 16, and added that high-ranking government officials like Bernanke in general cannot be deposed over the reasons that they took official actions. David Boies, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner representing Starr, said in an email: “We believe Mr. Bernanke has important testimony to give in this case.” Last month, Court of Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler said Starr may pursue claims over the government’s taking of a 79.9 percent stake in AIG in September 2008 and a separate 1-for-20 reverse stock split in June 2009. A trial could begin late next year. AIG’s board decided in January not to join Starr’s lawsuit after a public backlash, including from Congress. Starr once held a 12 percent stake in AIG, which had been the world’s largest insurer by market value prior to the financial crisis and a $182.3 billion federal bailout. Greenberg, 88, led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster. Starr is appealing another judge’s dismissal of a related lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

607,AIG,"UPDATE 1-U.S. risk council designates AIG, GE Capital for tougher oversight","By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON, July 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. financial risk council on Tuesday said it has designated American International Group and GE Capital as systemically risky, bringing them under stricter regulatory oversight. The Financial Stability Oversight Council’s decision to name its first set of “systemically important” non-bank firms had been long expected by the financial services industry. The designation shows that regulators believe the two companies are so big their failure could destabilize the financial system. The firms now come under regulation by the Federal Reserve and must meet capital and other requirements. “These designations will help protect the financial system and broader economy from the types of risks that contributed to the financial crisis,” said Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who also leads the oversight council. The risk council, which includes the heads of other financial regulatory agencies, is a relatively new federal body that is testing its powers under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law for the first time. After a number of non-bank firms struggled during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Dodd-Frank gave the regulatory council the power to identify potentially risky non-bank firms and regulate them more like banks. The first set of designations will not come as a surprise to the financial services industry. AIG in particular was expected to be tagged ‘systemically important’ after it received a crisis-era bailout amid fears its size and interconnectedness could bring down the financial system. AIG and GE Capital chose not to fight the group’s efforts to bring them under tougher regulatory scrutiny. “AIG did not contest this designation and welcomes it,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, which is the financial services arm of General Electric, said the company had been prepared for the council’s decision. “We have strong capital and liquidity positions, and we are already supervised by the Fed,” he said. The oversight group does not name companies under consideration for this designation until it makes a final decision, but AIG and GE Capital had previously disclosed that the council had proposed declaring them systemically risky. Prudential Financial had also disclosed that the council had proposed designating it as systemically risky, but the company last week said it would contest the proposal by asking for a hearing before the regulatory group. The council said on Tuesday it would hold a written and oral hearing for a nonbank firm, but it did not name the company. Prudential declined to comment on Tuesday.",7092013,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-fsoc/update-1-u-s-risk-council-designates-aig-ge-capital-for-tougher-oversight-idUSL1N0FF1VW20130709
608,AIG,Former AIG chief Greenberg sues Eliot Spitzer for defamation,"(Reuters) - Former American International Group Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg sued Eliot Spitzer on Friday, alleging the former New York governor defamed him in several statements to the press, according to the lawsuit. One Spitzer comment cited in the court filing was made to a legal newspaper in 2012, saying AIG was run “in a corrupt way,” said a copy of the lawsuit filed in a New York state court and posted on the Fox Business website. “This lawsuit is frivolous,” Spitzer, who is eyeing a political comeback, said in an emailed statement, adding a recent decision from the New York Court of Appeals bolstered his view. New York’s high court last month rejected Greenberg’s attempt to dismiss a fraud suit brought by the state’s attorney general. Spitzer added he “will be happy to discuss the relevant facts in the days ahead.” Spitzer made his reputation as fierce critic of Wall Street, but resigned from the governorship five years ago during a prostitution scandal. He said on Thursday he had collected enough signatures to get on the Democratic primary ballot for New York City comptroller. Greenberg led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster. The following year, the insurer paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes into its business practices. In addition to his 2012 comments to the New York Law Tribune, Spitzer appeared on CNBC’s “The Closing Bell with Maria Bartiromo” in July 2012, according to Greenberg’s lawsuit. Spitzer was asked to comment on allegations he had disparaged Greenberg in a meeting with former New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco. Spitzer told Bartiromo that Greenberg was “one in a litany of corporate executives who defrauded the market,” the lawsuit said. A few days later, Spitzer repeated his allegations of fraud on his own television show, the lawsuit said. Greenberg is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.

610,AIG,Judge says Bernanke should testify in AIG bailout lawsuit,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Monday that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should testify in the multibillion-dollar lawsuit by the former chief of American International Group Inc (AIG.N), Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, against the United States over the insurer’s 2008 bailout. Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims rejected the government’s effort to keep Bernanke from submitting to a deposition by Greenberg’s Starr International Co, once AIG’s largest shareholder with a 12 percent stake. Wheeler called Bernanke a “central figure” in the decision to rescue AIG, making him a “key witness” who could provide “highly relevant” testimony about the government’s bailout of the insurer, which eventually totaled $182.3 billion. “Indeed, the court cannot fathom having to decide this multi-billion-dollar claim without the testimony of such a key government decision-maker,” Wheeler wrote. “These facts constitute ‘extraordinary circumstances’ for the taking of Mr. Bernanke’s deposition,” which the judge said he plans to attend. A Fed spokesman declined to comment. Alanna Rutherford, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner representing Starr, said the company is pleased with the decision. Once the world’s largest insurer by market value, AIG was bailed out on September 16, 2008, as losses were skyrocketing from risky bets on mortgage debt through credit default swaps. The government initially took a 79.9 percent stake in the New York-based insurer. Starr sued in 2011, and maintains that the bailout shortchanged shareholders out of tens of billions of dollars. The company called the government’s action an illegal taking that violated the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. It is also suing over a 1-for-20 AIG reverse stock split in June 2009. The government had argued that details about Bernanke’s role could be obtained elsewhere, such as meeting minutes from the Fed’s Board of Governors, and that high-ranking U.S. officials in general should not be deposed over their official actions. It also said a deposition would distract Bernanke from overseeing the nation’s economy and fiscal policy. Wheeler, however, said it is “relatively routine” for top government officials to testify in Court of Federal Claims cases when they have personal knowledge of relevant information. The court sits in Washington, D.C., and handles lawsuits seeking money from the government. According to Wheeler, officials who have testified have included Dick Cheney, then secretary of defense; Andrew Cuomo, then secretary of housing and urban development; and General Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Wheeler asked both sides to schedule a deposition. He said the August 16 date proposed by Starr is acceptable to him. The government eliminated its last AIG stake on March 1.

612,AIG,UPDATE 3-AIG investors cheer first capital return since bailout,"* 2nd-quarter operating earnings $1.12/share vs est $0.85 * Net income up 17 percent * Announces quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share * To repurchase $1 billion of its stock * Shares rise 6 pct after the bell   (Adds background, analyst comment, life insurance unit results; updates shares) By Aman Shah Aug 1 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc  announced its first capital return since its 2008 bailout, through a dividend and share buyback, sending its shares up 6 percent after the bell. The insurer, which was almost wiped out by its derivative bets in the crash five years ago, reported a quarterly profit that handily beat Wall Street estimates, along with a quarterly divided of 10 cents and a share buy back of up to $1 billion. “Return of the quarterly dividend as well as the buyback is a clear affirmation of the progress AIG has made since the mortgage crisis,” Macquarie Equities Research analyst Amit Kumar said in an email to Reuters. The company also reported strong growth at its property casualty insurance unit, indicating it was on track to improve profitability after a long-awaited turnaround. The insurer has not paid dividends since receiving the first portion of a U.S. taxpayer-funded bailout in 2008 that eventually topped $180 billion. AIG finished paying back those funds early this year. “AIG is a fundamentally different, simpler company than it was three years ago,” Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said in a statement. Insurers have had trouble raising prices in their property and casualty businesses for some time, and losses from weather events and other natural disasters have also hurt the business. AIG has not reported an annual underwriting profit since 2007, but the first quarter seems to have been a turning point. “Investors want to see that AIG is recovering and driving margins by transforming its property and casualty business,” said Josh Stirling, an insurance analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. The company said that as of Thursday the sale of its aircraft leasing unit, International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC), has not yet been closed. AIG has been trying to offload the business for years, as part of its post-crisis restructuring and capital-raising plans, but had trouble finding a buyer. It agreed to sell a majority of ILFC to a consortium of investors at a value of $5.3 billion in December. The buyers have been in the process of getting loans to move forward with the deal, prodding AIG to extend the deadline for its completion. Last quarter, the U.S. Federal Reserve formally designated AIG as a “systemically important financial institution,” or SIFI. The SIFI tag means the insurer would face tighter regulations and possibly an annual stress test similar to the one that large U.S. banks must go through before raising dividends, buying back stock or executing large acquisitions. However, AIG said the capital returns were approved without assuming the pending sale. “A lot of people thought that ILFC had to be sold first ... the capital plan was approved without the sale and that gives a lot of credence to the capital position,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski told Reuters. AIG’s property casualty unit posted a 16 percent rise in operating income, even as the company swung back to an underwriting loss, hurt by higher disaster losses. The business reported a combined ratio of 102.6 percent, up from 97.3 percent in the first quarter. A ratio below 100 means that an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims. AIG is the fifth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States with a market share of 4.52 percent, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a multi-state insurance regulatory body. An unexpected spike in interest rates late in the quarter helped the company’s life insurance business, which has been suffering from low rates for several years. The business reported higher gains on the value of securities held in its investment portfolio, and returns on alternative assets rose. Its operating income increased 23 percent to $1.15 billion. Long-term rates began rising in May after hitting near-historic lows, and in late-June rates spiked suddenly - but temporarily - after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated that the central bank may pull back from its monetary easing program earlier than expected. AIG’s net income rose to $2.73 billion, or $1.84 per share, in the second quarter, from $2.33 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, AIG earned $1.12 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 85 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AIG shares, which have risen about 30 percent so far this year, closed at $47.07 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. They were at a two-year high of $49.90 in trading after the bell.

All but three of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors ended higher, led by gains in the consumer discretionary index, up 0.7 percent. The jobs report showed non-farm payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, below expectations, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, its lowest since December 2008. The mixed data could make the Federal Reserve more cautious about scaling back its massive economic stimulus. The tepid report follows a series of better-than-expected data and optimism about strong growth in the second half of the year. “The employment number clearly was a surprise on the downside,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago. “That the jobs picture has improved is pretty well established, so (the report) may not be the driver that it was before,” Kuby said. Among the biggest drags on both the S&P; 500 and the Dow was Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company. Its shares fell 1.2 percent to $124.95. The company posted a steeper-than-expected 26 percent drop in quarterly profit. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 30.34 points, or 0.19 percent, at 15,658.36, a record close. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 2.80 points, or 0.16 percent, at 1,709.67, also a record. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 13.84 points, or 0.38 percent, at 3,689.59. Stocks bounced late in the day after trading mostly flat, and both the Dow and S&P; 500 also reached intraday record highs. “This may be a little bit of traders not wanting to go into the weekend short,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Second-quarter earnings have mostly beaten expectations, with the season in its final innings. Of the 391 companies of the S&P; 500 that have reported, 67.8 percent have topped analyst expectations, in line with the average beat over the past four quarters, data from Thomson Reuters showed. About 55 percent have reported revenue above estimates, more than in the past four quarters but below the historical average. LinkedIn shares jumped 10.6 percent to $235.58 and several brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after results on Thursday topped expectations. Dell’s special committee and a group led by founder and Chief Executive Michael Dell announced a deal that dramatically increases the chances of his $24.6 billion buyout going through. Dell shares gained 5.6 percent to $13.68.

The Dow and the S&P; 500 pulled back from the record closing highs they hit on Thursday after the jobs report showed non-farm payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, below expectations, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, its lowest since December 2008. Coming off a series of better-than-expected data and optimism about strong growth in the second half of the year, the tepid jobs report was a reality check, analysts said. “Stock investors are scared of both the tapering and a potentially slowing economy,” said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. “They’re not sure what they’re scared of, but they know they’re scared. And very few people want to buy stocks at an all-time high.” Five of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sectors moved lower, led by losses of nearly 1 percent in the energy index. Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500 after posting a steeper-than-expected 26 percent drop in quarterly profit. Shares of the company fell 2.3 percent to $123.55. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 17.38 points, or 0.11 percent, at 15,610.64. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.90 point, or 0.05 percent, at 1,705.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3.18 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,678.92. The tech-heavy index was boosted by gains of 5.9 percent in Viacomm, which reported an increase in its third-quarter revenue, and by a 0.7 percent uptick in Apple. On Thursday, the S&P; 500 posted its strongest day in three weeks and closed above the 1,700 level for the first time. Time Warner Cable fell 1.8 percent to $115.56 after Bloomberg reported that Cox Communications Inc has held talks about merging with cable provider and rival Charter Communications Inc.

The Dow and the S&P; 500 pulled back from the record closing highs they hit on Thursday after the key jobs report showed non-farm payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, below expectations, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, its lowest reading since December 2008. Coming off a string of better-than-expected data and optimism about strong growth in the second half of the year, analysts described the tepid jobs report as a reality check. “Stock investors are scared of both the tapering and a potentially slowing economy,” said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. “They’re not sure what they’re scared of, but they know they’re scared. And very few people want to buy stocks at an all-time high.” The Fed’s support has been a pillar of the recovery from the deepest recession since the Great Depression. The central bank has reiterated that it will continue to stimulate the economy until it is capable of standing on its own, reassurances that helped the S&P; 500 post its strongest day in three weeks on Thursday and close above the 1,700 level for the first. Five of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sectors moved lower on Friday, led by losses of more than 1 percent in the energy index . Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 after posting a steeper-than-expected 26 percent drop in quarterly profit. Shares of the company fell 2.3 percent to $123.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 27.74 points, or 0.18 percent, to 15,600.28. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 2.51 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,704.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged down 1.85 points, or 0.05 percent, to 3,673.89. Time Warner Cable fell 2.3 percent to $114.97 after Bloomberg reported that Cox Communications Inc has held talks about merging with cable provider and rival Charter Communications Inc. Charter added 4.4 percent to $133.59. Dell’s special committee and a group led by founder and chief executive Michael Dell announced a deal that dramatically increases the chances of his $24.6 billion buyout going through. Dell shares gained 5.3 percent to $13.64. LinkedIn shares jumped 11.5 percent to $237.15 and several brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after results on Thursday topped expectations. AIG Inc also beat expectations on Thursday and announced its first capital return since its 2008 bailout through a dividend and share buyback, sending its shares up 2 percent to $48.02.

Consumer spending, however, increased in June and inflation pushed higher, which could strengthen expectations that the Fed will wind down its bond purchases later this year. S&P; 500 futures were volatile before moving slightly lower. Data showed non-farm payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, below expectations, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, its lowest reading since December 2008. The government also cut its previous estimates for hiring in May and June. “The report shows that the health of the labor market is improving but at the same time, unhealthy,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “The stock market is a bit schizophrenic here, because while it does keep the Fed more on the sidelines, it’s not a good sign of our economy. There is this balancing act here where the market wants growth but not too much too soon.” The Fed said on Wednesday the U.S. economy continues to recover but is still in need of support, offering no indication that it is planning to reduce its $85 billion a month bond-buying stimulus at its next meeting in September. The Fed’s support has been a pillar of the recovery from the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and the U.S. central bank has reiterated that it will continue to stimulate the economy until it is capable of standing on its own. S&P; 500 futures fell 3 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures dipped 20 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 7 points. Traders of short-term U.S. interest-rate futures boosted bets that the Federal Reserve will wait until 2015 before raising short-term borrowing costs after the payrolls report. LinkedIn shares jumped 9.7 percent in premarket trading and several brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after results topped Wall Street’s expectations on Thursday. AIG Inc also beat expectations on Thursday and announced its first capital return since its 2008 bailout through a dividend and share buyback, sending its shares up 4.4 percent in premarket trading.

Employers likely hired enough workers last month to push the U.S. jobless rate slightly lower, which could bolster expectations the Federal Reserve will start drawing down its huge economic stimulus program later this year. The Fed, however, said on Wednesday the U.S. economy continues to recover but is still in need of support, offering no indication that it is planning to reduce its $85 billion a month bond-buying stimulus at its next meeting in September. The Fed’s support has been a pillar of the recovery from the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and the U.S. central bank has reiterated that it will continue to stimulate the economy until it is capable of standing on its own. Stocks rose broadly on Thursday after data showed U.S. factory activity jumped to a two-year high in July and first-time applications for jobless benefits hit a 5-1/2-year low last week, bolstering views economic growth would accelerate in the second half of the year. “The level of comfort that investors have with the eventual offset of tapering has given stability to the market,” said Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, in reference to the expected wind-down of the Fed’s stimulus. “We celebrated good news yesterday and the rally had more to do with the strong data than with the Fed,” he said. “Good news is good news.” S&P; 500 futures rose 2 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.

625,AIG,UPDATE 1-U.S. asks reversal of ruling Bernanke must testify in AIG lawsuit,"WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday asked an appeals court to reverse a judge’s ruling last month that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke must testify in a lawsuit about American International Group Inc’s  2008 bailout. Bernanke cannot be forced to sit for a deposition because high-ranking U.S. government officials are generally protected from being drawn into time-consuming civil litigation, the Justice Department said in its petition. The petition was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. “The demands of civil litigation, if not appropriately limited by the courts, will impair the ability of senior government officials to lead the departments and agencies for which they are responsible,” the petition said. Parties to a lawsuit also do not have the right to depose agency officials to cross-examine the basis of their decisions, the Justice Department argued. Former AIG chief Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s Starr International Co. is suing the U.S. government for allegedly short-changing AIG shareholders by tens of billions of dollars during the bailout. Starr was once AIG’s largest shareholder, with a 12 percent stake. Alanna Rutherford, a lawyer for Starr, said in response to the government’s filing: “It’s disappointing that the government seeks to delay discovery of the facts in this important case.” ",8162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-courts-bernanke/update-1-u-s-asks-reversal-of-ruling-bernanke-must-testify-in-aig-lawsuit-idUSL2N0GH1K620130816

632,AIG,CORRECTED-Brighter days may await stocks leaving Dow industrials,"(In paragraph 4, corrects AIG company name and stock symbols for AIG and GM) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The big shakeup in the Dow Jones industrial average’s membership may yield some surprising results when it comes to stock performance. By one measure, at least, the index’s three “has-beens” - Hewlett-Packard Co, Alcoa Inc and Bank of America Corp look like they have significantly more upside potential than do the newcomers: Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc and Nike Inc. An invitation to join the Dow has not always been a sign of good things to come for a company’s shareholders, but getting the boot from the index has by no means meant disaster either. Former Dow components such as Honeywell International Inc , Altria Group Inc, Monde International Inc  and Kraft Foods Group Inc have prospered since leaving the Dow. At the same time, other former Dow stocks, among them Citigroup Inc, General Motors Co, American International Group Inc and Eastman Kodak Co, have struggled mightily. Citigroup is down roughly 90 percent in the last decade, when its share price is adjusted for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, and Kodak is just trying to survive. UnitedHealth Group Inc and Chevron Corp have out gained the Dow since being added as components. And tech powerhouses Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp  are essentially unchanged in price over the past decade, while the Dow 30 has risen more than 50 percent. Alcoa, Hewlett-Packard and Bank of America, on average, are undervalued by more than 30 percent, according to a valuation metric used by Thomson Reuters StarMine. By contrast, StarMine’s so-called intrinsic value for Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike implies these three, on average, offer little to no upside from their current stock prices. Goldman is the only one of the three new components with the potential for gain, according to StarMine. The investment bank, at $164.35 a share on Tuesday, trades at a discount of roughly 30 percent to its intrinsic value of $235.67, a potential 43 percent gain if the model proves accurate. Nike, at $66.41, and Visa, at $183.69, are overvalued by 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, according to StarMine. Intrinsic value gauges a company’s current stock price against its long-term earnings potential as estimated by the most accurate analysts covering the stock. By this measure, the best pick of former Dow components is Hewlett-Packard, which StarMine estimates has an intrinsic value of $44.70 a share, compared with Tuesday’s price of $22.20, a potential gain of more than 100 percent. Bank of America, meanwhile, could rise 63 percent from its current $14.64. According to StarMine projections, its intrinsic value is $23.83. Even Alcoa, which hasn’t had a stock price north of $10 since May 2012, is seen having a potential gain of roughly 6 percent from its current price of $8.05, the lowest of any current Dow component.

AIG stopped entering new deals with Berkshire units including National Indemnity Co. and General Re about two months ago, but existing contracts will not be affected, Bloomberg said, citing the person. The decision comes after Berkshire hired away senior AIG executives and Buffett said he planned to expand his company’s commercial insurance operations that compete with AIG.

636,AIG,AIG CEO apologizes for comments equating bonus criticism and lynching,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of insurer American International Group (AIG.N) apologized for a “poor choice of words” on Tuesday after coming under fire for equating criticism of banker bonuses with the lynching of African-Americans in the Deep South. Outrage over bonuses paid to bankers “was intended to stir public anger, to get everybody out there with their pitch forks and their hangman nooses, and all that - sort of like what we did in the Deep South <decades ago>. And I think it was just as bad and just as wrong,” Chief Executive Bob Benmosche was quoted as saying in an interview in The Wall Street Journal. His words provoked a sharp reaction. “Simply outrageous. AIG should disavow statement now,” tweeted Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, called for Benmosche to resign. “I find it unbelievably appalling that Mr. Benmosche equates the violent repression of the African American people with congressional efforts to prevent the waste of taxpayer dollars,” Cummings said in a statement. Benmosche later apologized for the remarks. “It was a poor choice of words. I never meant to offend anyone by it,” Benmosche said in a statement. Thousands of people, mainly African-Americans and primarily in the South, were beaten, hanged and killed in the 19th and 20th centuries by racist mobs. In contrast, government officials and activists criticized banks and other financial institutions that handed out bonuses during the financial crisis, despite a still-shaky economy and many of the banks’ own roles in causing the economic meltdown beginning in 2008.

637,AIG,Fitch Expects to Rate AIG's New Sr. Unsecured Notes 'BBB',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a rating of 'BBB'  to American International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) $1 billion issuance of 4.125%  senior notes due 2024. The transaction is expected to close on Oct. 2, 2013.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The new issue rating is equivalent to the ratings on AIG's existing senior debt.  Proceeds from the issue will be used for general corporate purposes. The new  issuance will increase AIG's pro forma financial leverage ratio (excluding  financial related debt) modestly to approximately 20% from 19% at June 30, 2013.  On Aug. 8, 2013, Fitch affirmed all of AIG's ratings, including AIG's Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key triggers that could lead to future rating upgrades include:  --Demonstration of higher and more consistent earnings within Property/Casualty  or Life & Retirement operating segments that translate into average  earnings-based interest coverage above 7.0x, corresponding with operating  earnings of approximately $11 billion;  --Further improvement in AIG's capital structure and leverage metrics that  reduce the company's total financing and commitments (TFC)ratio to below 0.7x; -- A shift toward consistent underwriting profits would promote positive  movement in the property/casualty subsidiary financial strength ratings. Key triggers that could lead to a future rating downgrade include:  --Increases in financial leverage as measured by financial debt-to-total capital  to a sustained level above 30%, or a material increase in the TFC ratio from  current levels;  --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries that Fitch views as inconsistent with  that of comparably-rated peers and industry trends; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital(RBC) ratios at either the domestic  life insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries, and/or failure to achieve  the above noted capital structure improvements. Fitch has assigned the following rating: --USD1 billion of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due Feb. 15, 2024 at 'BBB'.

638,AIG,Ex-AIG CEO Greenberg wins temporary delay in NY fraud case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former American International Group (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg on Thursday won a short reprieve from New York’s case accusing him of orchestrating sham transactions at AIG. State appeals court Associate Justice David Friedman granted Greenberg’s request to halt pre-trial proceedings in the case until a panel of the court can consider his request. The ruling is the latest twist in an eight-year old case in which the New York attorney general is seeking to hold Greenberg accountable for allegedly improper accounting at the insurance giant. Friedman’s decision will only be in effect for a couple of weeks, until a full appeals court panel decides whether to postpone the case while it decides whether to remove the judge overseeing the case, Justice Charles Ramos. Greenberg claims that Ramos is biased against him. His lawyers asked the judge to recuse himself. But last week, the judge refused to do so. The former CEO now wants the appeals court to reverse Ramos’s decision to keep himself on the case. Greenberg’s lawyers argue Ramos has at least created the appearance of partiality, prejudging the case in a way that would preclude him from presiding over a fair trial. They also claim he has made decisions based on inadmissible evidence. Attorney David Boies, who represents Greenberg, said in a statement that his client was pleased the appeals court judge agreed to hold up the proceedings. “However,” Boies said, “we are troubled by the attorney general’s decision to continue pursuing this litigation.” Boies said that “no legitimate public purpose justifies the expenditure of taxpayer resources” on the lawsuit. Greenberg’s lawyers have argued the case should have ended in April, when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman dropped a claim for damages in the case. Schneiderman is now seeking to have Greenberg and his co-defendant, former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith, banned from the securities industry and from participating as officers or directors of public companies. Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, declined to comment on Thursday’s ruling. The lawsuit accuses Greenberg of overseeing a $500 million transaction with reinsurer General Re Corp that misled AIG shareholders, and another, similar transaction. Greenberg led AIG for nearly four decades before he was ousted in 2006. The following year, AIG paid $1.64 billion to settle state and federal probes into its business practices. The case is New York v Greenberg, et al, New York state Supreme Court, New York County.

640,AIG,Bernanke does not have to testify in AIG bailout lawsuit -ruling,"WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke does not have to testify in the multibillion-dollar lawsuit by the former chief of American International Group Inc  against the United States over the insurer’s 2008 bailout, a federal appeals court said on Wednesday. The ruling, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, overturned a lower court decision from July that said Bernanke should submit to a deposition by lawyers for former chief executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. Deposing Bernanke while he is in office could disrupt “significant” ongoing government activities, the panel said. Greenberg’s Starr International Co, once AIG’s largest shareholder with a 12 percent stake, also did not meet the legal threshold to depose senior government officials and have access to the Fed’s deliberative process or Bernanke’s mental processes, the panel said. “Starr’s efforts to inquire into these issues have all the appearance, and vices, of a fishing expedition rather than an effort to establish legally material facts,” it said. Bernanke is due to step down from his role in January. The panel said Starr could seek Bernanke’s testimony after he left that position, but would have to better make the case in order to obtain that testimony. A lawyer for Starr, David Boies, said they would seek to depose Bernanke after he leaves office. “We are confident that we can make the showing of the importance of this testimony that the Court requires,” he said in a statement. Once the world’s largest insurer by market value, AIG was bailed out on Sept. 16, 2008, as losses were sky-rocketing from risky bets on mortgage debt through credit default swaps. The government initially took a 79.9 percent stake in the New York-based insurer. Starr sued in 2011, and maintains that the bailout short-changed shareholders out of tens of billions of dollars. The company called the government’s action an illegal taking that violated the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

641,AIG,JPMorgan close to $6 billion settlement with investors: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is nearing an agreement worth close to $6 billion with a group of institutional investors to settle claims over shoddy mortgage-backed securities issued in the run-up to the financial crisis, a source familiar with the talks said. Representatives of JPMorgan and the investors met on Friday to discuss the settlement, though the two sides have not yet agreed to formal terms, the source said. The potential deal is separate from the preliminary $13 billion settlement JPMorgan has reached with the U.S. government that would resolve a raft of civil actions brought by several enforcement agencies. The group of more than a dozen bondholders includes BlackRock Inc, Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Co and Neuberger Berman Inc, the source said. Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investors group, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan also was not immediately available outside regular U.S. business hours.

A New York state judge is weighing whether to approve that deal after American International Group Inc and others objected, arguing that it was too small. In 2011, the law firm said its investor clients had instructed trustees overseeing $95 billion of securities issued by JPMorgan’s affiliates during the housing boom to investigate whether the bonds were backed by ineligible mortgages. The firm said its clients represented holders of more than 25 percent of the voting rights in the securities, which included bonds from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two firms that JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis. JPMorgan reported a third-quarter loss earlier this month, the first under CEO Jamie Dimon, after recording a $7.2 billion after-tax expense to add money to its legal reserves in anticipation of settling the U.S. government’s mortgage claims. The company had $23 billion in its legal reserves as of the end of the quarter. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that JPMorgan’s tentative $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government could end up costing the bank closer to $9 billion after taxes, because the majority of the deal was expected to be tax deductible.

643,AIG,RLPC-Consortium in talks with AIG to buy 81 pct of ILFC,"LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - A private consortium is seeking to raise a $2.1 billion syndicated loan to back the purchase of an 81 percent stake in US insurer American International Group’s  aircraft leasing unit ILFC, banking sources said on Thursday. AIG said in December 2012 that it had reached an agreement to sell a stake of up to 90 percent of California-based ILFC to a consortium of investors, based mainly in China, for $4.7 billion. The investor group - P3 Investments and Taiwan’s Fubon Group - is now buying an 81 percent stake and AIG will hold the remaining 19 percent, the sources said. This proposal is still at a preliminary stage, but a draft term sheet for a $2.1 billion acquisition loan has already been sent to potential lenders, they added. ILFC’s employees will receive up to eight percent of the equity interest after the acquisition, which will dilute the private consortium’s stake to 74.5 percent and AIG’s stake to 17.5 percent, the sources said. AIG could not immediately be reached for comment. P3 Investments has been trying to raise acquisition loans in  Asia for nearly a year. P3 has revealed only background information about the identities of its partners, which it describes as limited partners from regional family offices from Hong Kong and leading financial institutions in Hong Kong, the sources said. Potential lenders are asking for more clarity on the consortium partners to provide funding for the acquisition. P3’s partners include a Hong Kong-based asset management company led by Ng Wing-fai, two unnamed Hong Kong real estate companies and the chairman of a Hong Kong diversified conglomerate, the sources said. Ng Wing-fai, co-founder of the now defunct pan-Asia fund Primus Financial Holdings, was on the board of directors for Fubon Hong Kong from 2004 to 2006. The $2.1 billion loan is bigger than a $1.5 billion financing that banks were originally approached about in July. It is structured to repay in full at maturity instead of having amortising repayments through the life of the loan as originally proposed, the sources said. The deadline for banks to respond has been extended until the end of the year by co-ordinating lead banks Bank of Taiwan and Mega International Commercial Bank. The loan is being raised through a special purpose vehicle called Jumbo Acquisition Ltd. It will be priced at 500 basis points (bps) over Libor and steps down to 425 bps if debt ratios decrease. BNP Paribas is financial adviser to the buying consortium, sources said. ILFC is rated Ba3 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. With around 1,000 owned and managed aircraft, ILFC operates with a global network of around 200 airlines in more than 80 countries, including major flag carriers, medium and small-sized airlines and cargo carriers, according to the company’s website.",10242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/ilfc-loan/rlpc-consortium-in-talks-with-aig-to-buy-81-pct-of-ilfc-idUSL5N0IE49R20131024
644,AIG,AIG earnings point to room for improvement-analysts,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc reported earnings nearly in line with expectations on Thursday, but the stock fell after hours as analysts still saw room for improvement in the insurer, which almost went under during the financial crisis. AIG, which saw sour derivative bets threaten the company’s future five years ago, saw stronger commercial lines business. Analysts said they had expected better results in its consumer lines business. The company also matched its 10-cent dividend of the second quarter and said that it bought back $192 million in stock in the three months ended September 30. AIG “is becoming a normal company,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Josh Stirling said. “They’re making great progress in fixing their underwriting in their commercial lines business, but still have more progress to make in consumer lines. They really need to get margin improvements in both,” he said. Commercial underwriting saw net premiums earned edge down 2 percent to $5.142 billion from the year-ago quarter, but the combined ratio improved to 100.2 from 106.0. A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims. In its consumer underwriting, AIG saw a 6 percent dip in net premiums earned to $3.27 billion. That combined ratio rose to 99.9 from 98.8 in the third quarter of last year.

BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski pointed to stalled progress in the property and casualty unit. “We did not see any meaningful improvement in the P&C; underwriting,” he said. Net premiums earned in the company’s property casualty unit fell 4 percent to $8.43 billion in the quarter ended September 30, while the combined ratio improved 3.4 points to 101.6, indicating the business is still not booking an underwriting profit. Shares fell 0.62 percent in the Thursday session to close at 51.65. Shares of the company fell 3 percent in after-hours trading after the results. The company’s dividend in the second quarter was its first since receiving the first portion of a U.S. taxpayer-funded bailout in 2008 that eventually topped $180 billion. AIG finished paying back those funds early this year. “We continue to remain optimistic about the future,” Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said in a statement. In a separate filing, the company said the sale of its ILFC aircraft leasing unit had not yet closed and that the sale could still be terminated. “We continue to consider ILFC as a non-core business and we are continuing to pursue other options including an alternative sale or an initial public offering,” the company said in the filing.

AIG, which saw sour derivative bets threaten the company’s future five years ago, saw stronger commercial lines business. Analysts said they had expected better results in its consumer lines business. The company also matched its 10-cent dividend of the second quarter and said that it bought back $192 million in stock in the three months ended Sept. 30. AIG “is becoming a normal company,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Josh Stirling said. “They’re making great progress in fixing their underwriting in their commercial lines business, but still have more progress to make in consumer lines. They really need to get margin improvements in both,” he said.

649,AIG,AIG settles with former executive before $274 million pay trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) has agreed to settle a $274 million lawsuit by a former executive who said the insurer refused to pay him during the financial crisis in 2008. The settlement came as a trial was due to have begun Tuesday in a federal court in New York, which was expected to reopen the issue of executive pay at AIG. The group was bailed out by the U.S. government in the crisis. The executive, Kevin Fitzpatrick, was president of an AIG real estate unit until he left the New York-based insurer in 2009. The terms of the settlement are confidential, Sean O’Shea, a lawyer for Fitpatrick, said on Wednesday. “We’re very happy.” Jon Diat, a spokesman for AIG, confirmed the settlement but declined further comment. In his lawsuit, which was filed in 2009, Fitzpatrick said AIG breached agreements with him and entities he controlled that entitled him to a share of profits earned on AIG real estate investments. The 22-year AIG veteran said the company, in October 2008, refused to make profit distributions to him and other employees of his unit, AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. AIG’s refusal to pay came a month after the U.S. government agreed to the first part of what became a $182-billion bailout of the insurance giant, which had insured financial products linked to mortgages that failed in the financial crisis. After AIG stopped making the profit payments, Fitzpatrick said he resigned. The company denied wrongdoing and said Fitzpatrick had been paid everything he was owed. AIG also called Fitzpatrick’s departure a termination, saying he stole “vast quantities” of confidential, proprietary information in document, computer drive and email form. In a sign of the case’s significance, the company had regularly disclosed the lawsuit as a material piece of litigation in its quarterly reports. In its most recent one, filed Thursday, AIG said Fitzpatrick had said he was owed at least $274 million, although it noted he was also seeking additional unspecified amounts of carried interest and punitive damages. The lawsuit, filed in December 2009, came as AIG was attempting to move past a fire storm of public outrage over $165 million in bonuses to employees in the unit whose complex financial products had caused the company’s massive losses. The bonus fiasco continues to plague AIG even after the U.S. sold off its remaining stake in the company last year. In September, Chief Executive Bob Benmosche was forced to apologize for a “poor choice of words” after equating the bonus criticism with the lynching of African-Americans in the Deep South. Fitzpatrick didn’t work in AIG Financial Products, the unit that was at the heart of the bonus flap and the company’s near collapse. But the trial, which would have begun Tuesday, was expected to revisit some of the events at the time of the bailout. In a decision last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger said Fitzpatrick could introduce, at trial, a March 2009 letter by AIG’s CEO at the time, Edward Liddy, to the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, describing the insurer’s intent to slash costs, including through voluntary departures and for-cause terminations. The judge said the letter could be viewed as evidence of “the severe financial constraints under which AIG was operating at the very time when the company undertook an investigation to determine whether it had a basis to terminate plaintiff for cause.” The case is Fitzpatrick et al v. American International Group Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-00142.

651,AIG,UPDATE 1-U.S. Treasury calls for more federal insurance oversight,"By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department’s insurance office called for a bigger federal government role in insurance regulation, including new standards for mortgage insurers, and said state officials should improve oversight of the entire industry. The Federal Insurance Office’s report to Congress on Thursday on ways to revamp U.S. insurance regulation was required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 after taxpayers bailed out massive insurer American International Group during the financial crisis. “In the short term, the U.S. system of insurance regulation can be modernized and improved by a combination of steps by the states and certain actions by the federal government,” the report said. Unlike banks, which can have several federal regulators, U.S. insurance companies are mostly overseen at the state level. The Treasury’s insurance office, which was created by the Dodd-Frank law, is a research group, not a regulator. AIG’s 2008 bailout brought intense criticism on the decentralized system of insurance regulation, including calls to establish a federal agency to oversee the industry. State insurers have countered that AIG did have a federal regulator, the now-defunct Office of Thrift Supervision, which also failed to spot the problems that nearly destroyed the firm. Regulators have since handed considerable oversight of AIG and Prudential Financial, another large insurer, to the U.S. Federal Reserve. They are considering doing the same with MetLife. The insurance office’s report, which took years to compile and had been eagerly awaited by the industry, said federal regulators should not take over all oversight because so many insurance products are tailored to specific locations. But the current hodgepodge system can be inefficient and overly complicated as insurers become more globally active, creating a role for federal officials, the report said. For instance, the private mortgage insurance sector is so entwined with the rest of the housing finance system that it should be overseen at the federal level, the office said. Mortgage insurance is often required for loans with low down payments to compensate lenders or investors if the borrower defaults on the loan. The report said the federal government also could be more involved in efforts to monitor financial stability, work with other agencies to develop auto insurance policies that would apply across state lines for U.S. military personnel, and study the way personal information is used for insurance pricing. States, it said, should develop better coordination for situations when one regulator plans to make decisions related to an insurer’s solvency. “State regulators... are constantly working to improve our national state-based system of insurance regulation,” former Senator Ben Nelson, now chief executive of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said in a statement. The group is made up of state insurance regulators. “While we appreciate FIO’s suggestions for improvement, the states have the ultimate responsibility for implementing regulatory changes,” he said. The states should also come up with some new policies related to resolving failed insurers, monitor the impact of different rate-regulation practices and craft plans to reduce losses from natural disasters, the report said.",12122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-insurance/update-1-u-s-treasury-calls-for-more-federal-insurance-oversight-idUSL1N0JR2AJ20131212

655,AIG,UPDATE 2-AIG seen in talks to sell jet-leasing unit to AerCap,"By Neha Dimri and Tim Hepher Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. insurer American International Group  is in talks to sell its aircraft leasing business to AerCap Holdings NV, a person briefed on the discussions said. AIG, which was nearly wiped out by derivative bets in the financial crash, has been seeking for some time to sell International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) to help repay the costs of a 2008 U.S. government bailout. Netherlands-based AerCap is also in touch with private equity firms and others who may be interested in taking part of the assets of ILFC, which is the world’s second largest aircraft lessor by fleet size, the person said. “AerCap gets new aircraft and private equity for example can manage some of the older aircraft, but this is quite surprising as it is still an enormous portfolio,” said the person, an industry source who asked not to be identified. AerCap, whose shares rose 11.6 percent in New York on Thursday on reports of the talks, declined to comment. “As a company policy, we do not comment on market rumours,” a spokeswoman said in an email. ILFC and AIG also declined to comment. AIG shares rose 1.5 percent on Thursday against a weaker market. Philip Tozer-Pennington, managing editor of Airline Economics magazine which first reported the negotiations, said the move was the latest sign of consolidation in the leasing industry, which has seen several deals involving Asian buyers. “Consolidation is already fast paced in aircraft leasing and the market has a great deal of room for growth left in it yet as those that remain in the market are struggling to cope with the high levels of business.” Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Sumitomo Corp last year bought the aircraft leasing business of Royal Bank of Scotland in a deal worth $7.3 billion as European banks began offloading non-core assets. In December 2012, AIG said it had reached agreement to sell a stake of up to 90 percent of California-based ILFC to a consortium of investors based mainly in China for $4.7 billion, but it has struggled to complete the deal. While in talks with AerCap, AIG has not formally ended its agreement with the Chinese group, Bloomberg News reported. AIG has said it continues to regard the leasing unit as a non-core business and is pursuing other options, including an alternative sale or an initial public offering. Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche said in November that AIG hoped to decide on a sale or an initial public offering of ILFC in the fourth quarter. A combination of ILFC and AerCap would remain second by fleet size to General Electric’s aircraft leasing division GECAS, which has a fleet of 1,700 passenger jets. AerCap has a fleet of 373 aircraft, according to its website. ILFC and GECAS are among the largest buyers of jets from Europe’s Airbus and U.S. planemaker Boeing. Tozer-Pennington said a deal could benefit Boeing as ILFC is seen as overweight in planes from EADS subsidiary Airbus.

Citing people knowledgeable about the talks, the paper said the price would include $3 billion in cash and a minority stake in the Netherlands-based AerCap valued at approximately $2 billion. Reuters reported on Friday that the two companies were in discussions about a sale. AIG had to be bailed out by the U.S. government when derivative bets nearly wiped it out in the global financial crash of 2008, and has been trying for at least four years to sell California-based International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) to help repay the government. If AerCap acquires ILFC, currently the world’s second largest aircraft lessor by fleet size behind only General Electric ‘s Gecas unit, the combination would become the world’s largest aircraft-leasing company. Gecas has a fleet of 1,700 passenger jets. In December 2012, AIG announced that it had reached agreement to sell up to 90 percent of ILFC to a consortium of investors based mainly in China for $4.7 billion, but the deal has never gone through. AIG has long said it regards the leasing unit as a non-core business.",12152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-aercap/aig-to-value-aircraft-leasing-unit-at-5-billion-report-idUSL2N0JU0JI20131215
657,AIG,AIG sells aircraft leasing wing to focus on insurance,"(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said on Monday it will sell its aircraft-leasing business to AerCap Holdings NV (AER.N) for $5.4 billion, after four years of trying to divest its biggest non-insurance business in fits and starts. The insurer, which was nearly wiped out by derivative bets during the financial crisis, put International Lease Finance Corp on the block after receiving a $182 billion government bailout package in 2008. AIG repaid the rest of the money owed to the U.S. Treasury in March, but still wanted sell ILFC as part of its efforts to focus on insurance. As part of the cash and stock deal, AIG will end up holding a nearly 46 percent stake in AerCap for at least nine months after the deal closes. But the move nevertheless rids AIG’s balance sheet of ILFC’s debt and aircraft purchase commitments, and allows the insurer to focus on its property-casualty and life insurance operations. The deal will give AerCap, a Netherlands-based lessor, a fleet of 1,329 aircraft - the second largest after General Electric’s (GE.N) aircraft leasing division GECAS, which owns and services 1,630 aircraft. The deal will result in annual operational cash flow of $3 billion and savings of about $100 million a year by the end of 2015, AerCap Chief Executive Angus Kelly said in a call with analysts. AerCap’s shares rose more than 35 percent following news of the deal and were up 30.5 percent at $32.53 late Monday afternoon. AIG shares edged up 1 percent to $50.23 on the New York Stock Exchange. “It’s a good transaction for AIG,” said Clifford Gallant, an analyst with Nomura Equity Research, a division of Nomura Co Ltd (9716.T). “It gets to retain 46 percent, so they get a future earnings stream from the company. ... It simplifies AIG’s balance sheet, enabling them to do things like buy back stock or have more capital flexibility.” The deal comes almost exactly a year after AIG announced it was selling a 90 percent stake of ILFC to a group of investors based mainly in China for $4.7 billion. That deal valued ILFC at about $5.3 billion. But last spring, the consortium was late with a payment for the business, raising concerns about whether the deal would close. By late summer, AerCap began lining up financing to strike a deal to buy ILFC, according to three people familiar with the situation who are not authorized to speak to the media. Under the terms of the deal, AIG will get $3 billion in cash and 97.56 million new common shares of AerCap, giving the deal a value of $5.4 billion based on AerCap’s closing share price on Friday. The insurer can begin selling its stake in AerCap in stages over a nine- to 15-month period after the deal closes. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter. But while AIG will retain a stake in AerCap for some time, the deal enables the insurer to wipe $21 billion in debt associated with the business off its balance sheet. Net cash proceeds to AIG at closing are expected to be around $2.4 billion. UBS UBSN.VX was the financial adviser to AerCap while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was the financial adviser to AerCap’s board. Citigroup (C.N) was the lead financial adviser to AIG, and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) also advised on the deal, an AIG spokesman said.

659,AIG,US STOCKS-Wall St rebounds but cautious sentiment prevails on Fed,"* Fed meeting in view, investors seek stimulus clarity * CBOE Volatility index VIX up near 16 * Avago to buy LSI for $6.6 bln; AIG to sell unit for $5.4 bln * Indexes up: Dow 0.8 pct, S&P; 0.5 pct, Nasdaq 0.6 pct By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained on Monday, rebounding from their worst week in months as large deals boosted optimism but investors remained cautious ahead of an upcoming Federal Reserve policy meeting. Equities are coming off their biggest weekly decline in nearly four months, a pullback that came on concerns the Fed may begin to wind down the bond-buying stimulus at its two-day policy-setting meeting that ends Wednesday. The CBOE Volatility index VIX, Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge which usually moves inversely to the performance of the S&P; 500, was up 1.3 percent at 15.96. “Implied volatilities increased across asset classes last week as investors priced in a possible taper at this week’s FOMC meeting,” said Mandy Xu, equity derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse, adding that equity volatility gained the most. The stimulus has been a major contributor to the market’s gains this year, and has been expected to keep a floor under stock prices for as long as it continues. Investors have been trying to gauge the timing of when the central bank will start winding down its market-friendly bond purchases, with many market participants expecting the Fed to announce a tapering in March. However, stronger economic data of late, including the November payroll report, led some to believe the tapering could come as soon as at the Fed’s meeting this week. The Fed has said it will slow the program when certain economic indicators meet its growth targets. “Traders should expect lots of volatility and uncertainty as this announcement approaches,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “There is little consensus whether good news is good or bad right now, with the indicators that I watch showing everything from fully bearish to fully bullish.” In M&A; news, Avago Technologies Ltd agreed to buy LSI Corp for $6.6 billion, while American International Group Inc said it would sell its aircraft-leasing business to AerCap Holdings NV in a deal valued at about $5.4 billion. Shares of Avago jumped 9 percent to $49.72 while LSI surged 39 percent to $10.96. AerCap surged 36 percent to $33.98 and AIG rose 1.2 percent to $50.32. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 118.54 points or 0.75 percent, to 15,873.9, the S&P; 500 gained 9.53 points or 0.54 percent, to 1,784.85 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 23.815 points or 0.6 percent, to 4,024.79. The S&P; 500 fell below its 14-day moving average on Wednesday and has not risen above it since, a sign of weak near-term momentum. However, the benchmark index is less than 2 percent below its record closing high, indicating that recent selling has not been panic-driven.

670,AIG,Judge on BofA $8.5 bln settlement case is promoted,"NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The New York judge weighing approval of Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities was promoted on Friday, but is expected to rule on the controversial accord before she takes her new job. Justice Barbara Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who heard nine weeks of testimony about the fairness of one of the biggest settlements stemming from the 2008 financial crisis, was appointed to the state’s Appellate Division, an intermediate appeals court, by Governor Andrew Cuomo. Bank of America had agreed in June 2011 to the $8.5 billion settlement to resolve claims over roughly $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which the bank had bought three years earlier. The settlement was intended to resolve much of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank’s legal liability from Countrywide. It was backed by 22 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Co. But investors led by American International Group Inc  objected, saying there was no proof the payouts were fair, and that Bank of New York Mellon Corp failed to perform its duties as trustee during the negotiations. Kapnick had overseen a so-called Article 77 proceeding, which ended on Nov. 21, to determine whether the settlement should be approved. She has yet to rule. A staff member in Kapnick’s chambers said in an interview after the promotion was announced that “the judge is going to be issuing that decision before she leaves.” David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the New York state court system, said it is unclear when the promotion will take effect, but that state law appeared to allow promomoted judges to decide cases they were already handling that were ready for rulings. Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the institutional investors, said: “New York law permits Judge Kapnick to rule on this matter, and we look forward to her decision.” Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. A Bank of New York Mellon spokesman had no immediate comment. An AIG spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Kapnick, 60, will fill a vacancy on the Appellate Division for the First Department, which encompasses Manhattan and the Bronx. Her promotion does not require voter or legislative approval. The judge was elected to the Supreme Court, which in New York is a trial court, in 2001, and moved to its commercial division in 2008. She graduated from Barnard College in 1975 and Boston University School of Law in 1980. Cuomo on Friday also appointed three trial judges - Colleen Duffy, Hector LaSalle and Joseph Maltese - to fill vacancies in the Appellate Division for the Second Department, which encompasses 10 counties in southeastern New York, including the other New York City boroughs and Long Island. The case is In re: Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.",1172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/bankofamerica-settlement/judge-on-bofa-8-5-bln-settlement-case-is-promoted-idUSL2N0KR1KW20140117
671,AIG,Ex-AIG CEO loses appeal of bailout lawsuit vs. N.Y. Fed,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg lost his appeal Wednesday in a lawsuit accusing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of unlawfully bailing out the insurer at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the New York Fed’s authority to address major threats to the economy justified the dismissal of Delaware breach of fiduciary duty claims by Greenberg’s Starr International Co, which once held a 12 percent AIG stake. Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Circuit Judge John Walker said a contrary ruling would compromise the New York Fed’s authority to take action in “unusual and exigent circumstances,” including “to rescue AIG from bankruptcy at the height of the direst financial crisis in modern times.” He said permitting state law claims such as Greenberg’s to go forward would force the New York Fed to shirk its obligation to act in the public interest, and instead to act in the best interests of corporate shareholders, like the AIG shareholders on whose behalf Starr sued. “In this case,” Walker wrote, “Delaware fiduciary duty law cannot be applied to FRBNY’s rescue activities consistently with adequate protection of the federal interests at stake in stabilizing the national economy.” AIG is based in New York but incorporated in Delaware and was once the world’s largest insurer by market value. Starr had accused the New York Fed of engineering a “backdoor” bailout for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and other Wall Street banks at the expense of AIG shareholders, by forcing the insurer to unwind bets on mortgage debt through hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps. The 2nd Circuit did not address whether the New York Fed exceeded its authority in rescuing AIG, whose $182.3 billion bailout began on September 16, 2008, one day after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt. Wednesday’s decision upheld a November 2012 ruling by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan, who had endorsed broad central bank power to address financial crises. The lawsuit is one of two in which Greenberg, 88, and Starr have accused the government of shortchanging AIG shareholders out of tens of billions of dollars. Greenberg has said the bailout improperly aided banks such as Goldman, Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), and let favored counterparties be repaid in full. He has also said the New York Fed improperly let the U.S. Treasury take a since-divested 79.9 percent AIG stake without allowing a vote by diluted shareholders. The second case is before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., which handles lawsuits seeking money from the government. There, Greenberg and Starr called the AIG bailout an illegal taking that violated the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A trial is scheduled for September 29. Starr’s lawyer David Boies in a statement said the 2nd Circuit decision addressed only a “narrow issue” of state law preemption and did not affect the constitutional claims in the Court of Claims case.

672,AIG,UPDATE 2-Ex-AIG CEO loses appeal of bailout lawsuit vs N.Y. Fed,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Former American International Group Inc Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg lost his appeal Wednesday in a lawsuit accusing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of unlawfully bailing out the insurer at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the New York Fed’s authority to address major threats to the economy justified the dismissal of Delaware breach of fiduciary duty claims by Greenberg’s Starr International Co, which once held a 12 percent AIG stake. Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Circuit Judge John Walker said a contrary ruling would compromise the New York Fed’s authority to take action in “unusual and exigent circumstances,” including “to rescue AIG from bankruptcy at the height of the direst financial crisis in modern times.” He said permitting state law claims such as Greenberg’s to go forward would force the New York Fed to shirk its obligation to act in the public interest, and instead to act in the best interests of corporate shareholders, like the AIG shareholders on whose behalf Starr sued. “In this case,” Walker wrote, “Delaware fiduciary duty law cannot be applied to FRBNY’s rescue activities consistently with adequate protection of the federal interests at stake in stabilizing the national economy.” AIG is based in New York but incorporated in Delaware and was once the world’s largest insurer by market value. Starr had accused the New York Fed of engineering a “backdoor” bailout for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other Wall Street banks at the expense of AIG shareholders, by forcing the insurer to unwind bets on mortgage debt through hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps. The 2nd Circuit did not address whether the New York Fed exceeded its authority in rescuing AIG, whose $182.3 billion bailout began on Sept. 16, 2008, one day after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt. Wednesday’s decision upheld a November 2012 ruling by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan, who had endorsed broad central bank power to address financial crises. The lawsuit is one of two in which Greenberg, 88, and Starr have accused the government of shortchanging AIG shareholders out of tens of billions of dollars. Greenberg has said the bailout improperly aided banks such as Goldman, Deutsche Bank AG and Societe Generale , and let favored counterparties be repaid in full. He has also said the New York Fed improperly let the U.S. Treasury take a since-divested 79.9 percent AIG stake without allowing a vote by diluted shareholders. The second case is before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., which handles lawsuits seeking money from the government. There, Greenberg and Starr called the AIG bailout an illegal taking that violated the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 29. Starr’s lawyer David Boies in a statement said the 2nd Circuit decision addressed only a “narrow issue” of state law preemption and did not affect the constitutional claims in the Court of Claims case. He did not say whether Starr will appeal. The New York Fed and its lawyer John Kiernan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. AIG spokesman Jon Diat declined to comment.

678,AIG,KCG expects to start trading interest rate swaps by year-end,"* KCG reported Q4 a loss of 15 cents a share * Call to end rebates for market makers won’t gain traction-CEO * Firm expects $41 mln on closing of BATS/Direct Edge merger By John McCrank NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Trading firm KCG Holdings Inc , which reported a quarterly loss on Friday due to merger costs, plans to trade interest rate swaps before the year is out, the company’s chief executive said. Interest rate swaps, which allow investors to hedge against interest risk, make up $490 trillion, in notional value, of the $633 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. Much of the swaps market is moving onto new exchanges known as swap execution facilities (SEFs), as required by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, representing an opportunity for trading firms like KCG. The move to SEFs will bring more electronic trading, as opposed to brokers trading between themselves over the phone, to the over-the-counter derivatives market, and is aimed at boosting transparency. “I do believe that transparency in swap trading will be beneficial to all market participants who trade interest rate products,”  KCG chief executive Daniel Coleman said on a call with analysts. “It’s something that we would like to do and something we are focused on.” Under the new rules, swaps must also be centrally cleared, meaning clearing houses back the trades against a default, opening up the market to firms that do not need massive balance sheets to stand behind the trades. The OTC derivatives market came under regulatory pressure in the wake of the financial crisis when risky trading at firms such as insurer American International Group Inc and investment bank Lehman Brothers nearly toppled the financial system. The inability to assess the scale of the market, the identity of contracting parties, or the nature of non-standard contracts, frustrated regulators. More recently, there have been growing calls for an overhaul of U.S. equity market regulation in order to reduce conflicts and complexities in the system. One of the loudest voices as of late has been Jeff Sprecher, who heads IntercontinentalExchange Group, the new owner of the New York Stock Exchange. Sprecher has called for an end to the dominant pricing system in U.S. equities, in which market makers receive trading rebates for posting orders to exchanges for other market participants to trade against. As one of the top U.S. equity market makers, KCG made around $48 million in profit on just under $233 million in market-making revenues in the last quarter. Overall, the firm, which also operates dark pools and provides trading services in multiple asset classes and countries, reported a net loss of $17.4 million, or 15 cents a share, on $322 million in revenues. The loss included $36.5 million in merger and integration costs. The pricing system, known as “maker-taker,” in which the “maker” of the liquidity on the exchange receives a rebate and the “taker” - the buyer of the stock - pays a fee, is “bad for markets,” Sprecher told Reuters last week. He said the system attracts people who quickly jump in an out of markets looking to profit from rebates, rather than actually trade or hold risk. He said the rebates distort stock prices and cause the interests of brokers to be out of sync with their customers. Coleman said that ultimately maker-taker is the way exchanges compete with each other, and that if rebates are removed, exchanges would still compete on taker fees and brokers would still face the conflict of routing one exchange versus another based on fees. “You have the head of a commercial enterprise saying he doesn’t want to compete on fees any more ... so from that point of view, I don’t think that argument is going to gain a lot of traction,” he said. KCG said that at the end of the quarter it received around $10.5 million from Nasdaq OMX Group as part of the exchange operator’s compensation plan for the botched Facebook IPO in May 2012. During the IPO, a glitch in Nasdaq’s system prevented timely order confirmations for market makers, leaving them unsure about their exposure for up to days afterwards. Knight Capital Group, which merged with rival firm Getco last summer to create KCG, recorded a charge of $35.4 million in the second quarter of 2012 related to the Facebook IPO. Knight had its own glitch in August 2012, which led to millions of unintentional orders flooding into the market over a 45-minute period, leaving the firm with a huge position it had to unload at a total loss of $461.1 million. KCG agreed in October to pay a fine of $12 million over the incident. Separately, KCG said it expects to receive $41 million as part of a dividend payment once exchange operators BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge close their merger, which is expected to happen within days. The deal cleared its final regulatory hurdles on Friday. KCG owns stakes in both BATS and Direct Edge.",1312014,http://www.reuters.com/article/knight-results-swaps/kcg-expects-to-start-trading-interest-rate-swaps-by-year-end-idUSL2N0L51VW20140131
679,AIG,"AIG raises dividend as it swings to profit, plans job cuts","(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group (AIG.N) on Thursday raised its dividend and announced more share buybacks as its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations, swinging to a profit compared with a year-earlier loss. The company also said it expects to reduce its global workforce by about 3 percent, a move that analysts said could help the company improve its underwriting profitability. The results take AIG one step further into a turnaround story since it was almost wiped out by its derivative bets during the financial crisis, something that had drawn heavy ire from both lawmakers and taxpayers. The company has repaid the $180 billion bailout it received in 2008. “We have seen that the public negative sentiment is down dramatically,” Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said on CNBC. The company on Thursday raised its dividend by 25 percent to 12.5 cents from 10 cents per share and also authorized a share buyback of up to another $1 billion. “It certainly was a very strong quarter,” said Gloria Vogel, senior equity research analyst at Drexel Hamilton in New York. Even so, she said, the company is still indicating that it is receiving less in premiums than it is paying out in claims. That could change going forward, Vogel said, in part on the workforce reduction that Benmosche detailed in a memo to employees, which was dated Thursday and obtained by Reuters. “With results today, we announced a $265 million severance charge taken at the end of 2013, which we expect will reduce AIG’s global workforce by approximately 3 percent,” Benmosche wrote. AIG shares rose 1.7 percent to $50.42 percent in extended trading. Benmosche said also in the memo that while AIG has “positioned ourselves for continued growth and profitability,” there is a need for more change, including “to cultivate a culture where there is a clearer understanding of roles” and ensuring swift decision-making by the most qualified people. “To accomplish this, in many parts of the organization, we will need to make some changes,” he said. “We know that this will mean some changes in roles and in reporting structure, and that some roles will have to be eliminated.” For the fourth quarter, AIG reported net income of $1.98 billion, or $1.34 per share, compared with a loss of $3.96 billion, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, the company earned $1.70 billion, or $1.15 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In commercial underwriting, net premiums earned rose 5 percent to $5.294 billion from the year-ago quarter, and the combined ratio improved to 107.7 from 130.3. A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims. In consumer underwriting, net premiums earned dipped 7 percent to $3.296 billion, but the combined ratio fell to 103.3 from 111.2 in the year-ago period. Net premiums earned in the company’s property casualty unit were flat at $8.6 billion, while the combined ratio improved to 103.8 from 125.1 in the same quarter of 2012. The combined ratios will improve, “but it’s not going to happen overnight,” Sandler O’Neill & Partners analyst Paul Newsome. “One of their biggest issues is their expense levels as opposed to the underwriting. I think that’s more controllable, but it’s not going to happen overnight.” The company said the pre-tax severance charge of $265 million in the fourth quarter primarily related to AIG Property Casualty as part of efforts to lower expenses. The year-earlier quarter included a net loss of $4.4 billion related to the sale of AIG’s aircraft leasing business and after-tax catastrophe losses of $1.3 billion from superstorm Sandy. The company’s shares closed at $49.59 in regular trade on Thursday.

682,AIG,Greenberg's Starr leads $4.4 billion MultiPlan acquisition,"(Reuters) - Former AIG (AIG.N) boss Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s Starr Investment Holdings LLC said on Monday it had agreed to take over health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc in what is by far its biggest private equity investment to date. Financial terms were not disclosed, but a person familiar with the matter said the deal values MultiPlan at around $4.4 billion. Since its launch in 2012, all of Starr Investment Holdings’ previous private equity deals have been below $1 billion. The deal underscores Greenberg’s reinvention as a prominent dealmaker. The 88-year-old former AIG chief executive and another of his companies, Starr International, owned 12 percent of AIG before its $182 billion rescue that began in 2008. Greenberg claims the rescue was unfair to AIG shareholders and that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York charged an excessive interest rate on its initial loan. He is seeking billions of dollars in damages. Greenberg lost his appeal last month in a lawsuit against the New York Fed. A second lawsuit by Greenberg against the U.S. government is pending before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C. MultiPlan, currently owned by private equity firms BC Partners Ltd and Silver Lake, helps manage the claims process for big health insurers and has a network of over 900,000 healthcare providers. Swiss investment firm Partners Group is the other lead investor in the consortium acquiring MultiPlan, which also includes a number of undisclosed investors. Rather than manage a traditional private equity fund, Starr Investment Holdings reaches out to investors on a deal-by-deal basis to seek their participation. This approach also informs Starr’s investment horizon, which can go beyond the typical five-to-seven-year period that private equity firms tend to hold companies for. “We are duration agnostic, we can invest for a day or invest forever,” Starr Investment Holdings Senior Managing Director Geoffrey Clark said in an interview. The insurance claims services sector has seen robust private equity deal activity in the last few months, including KKR & Co LP’s (KKR.N) $2.4 billion takeover of Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc and $1.1 billion acquisition of Mitchell International Inc and Apax Partners LLP’s roughly $3 billion acquisition of One Call Care Management Inc and Align Networks Inc. BC Partners and Silver Lake bought MultiPlan in 2010 for about $3.1 billion from rival buyout firms Carlyle Group (CG.O) and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe. BC Partners and Silver Lake each invested about $600 million in equity when they acquired MultiPlan, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two private equity firms now stand to make more than two times their money through the sale of MultiPlan, that person added, pointing out that MultiPlan’s cash flow increased by 50 percent since 2010 thanks to operational initiatives undertaken at the company. Starr Investment said the deal had fully committed financing from Barclays Plc and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Goldman, Sachs & Co; RBC Royal Bank; Dean Bradley Osborne; LionTree Advisors LLC; and The Raine Group LLC advised MultiPlan’s owners.

Swiss investment firm Partners Group is the other lead investor in the consortium acquiring MultiPlan, which also includes a number of undisclosed investors. Rather than manage a traditional private equity fund, Starr Investment Holdings reaches out to investors on a deal-by-deal basis to seek their participation. This approach also informs Starr’s investment horizon, which can go beyond the typical five-to-seven-year period that private equity firms tend to hold companies for. “We are duration agnostic, we can invest for a day or invest forever,” Starr Investment Holdings Senior Managing Director Geoffrey Clark said in an interview. The insurance claims services sector has seen robust private equity deal activity in the last few months, including KKR & Co LP’s $2.4 billion takeover of Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc and $1.1 billion acquisition of Mitchell International Inc and Apax Partners LLP’s roughly $3 billion acquisition of One Call Care Management Inc and Align Networks Inc. BC Partners and Silver Lake bought MultiPlan in 2010 for about $3.1 billion from rival buyout firms Carlyle Group  and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe. BC Partners and Silver Lake each invested about $600 million in equity when they acquired MultiPlan, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two private equity firms now stand to make more than two times their money through the sale of MultiPlan, that person added, pointing out that MultiPlan’s cash flow increased by 50 percent since 2010 thanks to operational initiatives undertaken at the company. Starr Investment said the deal had fully committed financing from Barclays Plc and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Goldman, Sachs & Co; RBC Royal Bank; Dean Bradley Osborne; LionTree Advisors LLC; and The Raine Group LLC advised MultiPlan’s owners.",2172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/starrinvestment-acquisition-multiplan/update-2-greenbergs-starr-leads-4-4-bln-multiplan-acquisition-idUSL3N0LM3C720140217

685,AIG,"AIG holding BofA $8.5 billion settlement 'hostage,' investors say","NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N) is holding “hostage” an $8.5 billion deal to compensate investors who bought Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) mortgage securities, supporters of the deal said in court filings ahead of a hearing on Wednesday. The supporters urged the judge overseeing the deal to reject AIG’s efforts to delay its approval, according to documents submitted to the court late on Friday. Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve claims by investors who had bought $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the U.S. housing crisis. The investors said Countrywide, acquired by Bank of America in 2008, misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis. AIG, one of the investors in the mortgage securities, objected to the deal, saying there was no evidence it provided adequate compensation for losses. Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court approved the settlement on January 31, but four days later AIG asked a new judge overseeing the case to delay the decision, saying Kapnick had left issues unresolved. The new judge, Justice Saliann Scarpulla, has called a hearing Wednesday to hear arguments on AIG’s request. “The court should not permit AIG to nullify the judgment and hold the entire settlement hostage indefinitely,” supporters of the deal said in their court filing. Kapnick overruled AIG on the unresolved issues, they said. AIG is seeking to delay the settlement as leverage against Bank of America in another case, the supporters said. In that case, AIG sued Bank of America over $10 billion of securities fraud claims in August 2011, the same day it intervened to object to the $8.5 billion settlement. In a reply filed with the court on Tuesday, AIG’s lawyers said Kapnick had “refused to give any weight” to the idea that AIG was objecting “merely” as a way to benefit its securities fraud claim. Scarpulla should delay approval of the settlement until investors like AIG can find out how the money will be allocated, the reply said. Scarpulla must decide whether to grant AIG’s request to further delay Kapnick’s judgment or enter the judgment into the court record and leave AIG to appeal if it chooses. If Scarpulla grants AIG’s request, AIG should be required to post $1 million a day that the delay is costing other investors, supporters of the deal said. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock (BLK.N)Inc, Allianz SE’s Pimco, (ALVG.DE) and Metlife Inc, (MET.N), and Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), the trustee for the securities, agreed to the settlement with Bank of America. In her ruling on January 31, Kapnick said Bank of New York Mellon was concerned that Countrywide would be unable to pay a future judgment that even approached $8.5 billion, and thought it was reasonable to lock in a one-time payment. Kapnick made one exception in her ruling, withholding her approval from settlement of claims relating to certain loans that had been modified. Bank of New York Mellon should not have settled claims related to mortgages that had been modified without investigating their potential worth, she said. In its latest court filing, Bank of New York Mellon said it would do nothing about those claims until the settlement is finally approved. “There is no decision to be made, by anyone, about any action to take with respect to these claims until it is determined whether the settlement agreement is finally approved and appeals are exhausted,” the bank and investor group said. In its reply Tuesday, AIG disagreed, saying the court should withhold final judgment until the parties resolve the claims related to loan modifications and determine how the settlement will be allocated. Separately on Tuesday, AIG asked a state appeals court for more time to submit briefs in its appeal of Kapnick’s decision to hear the case without a jury. The appeals court is not expected to rule on that request until next month at the earliest.

689,AIG,Greenberg channels Buffett in post-AIG comeback,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Since his ouster from American International Group Inc (AIG.N) in 2005, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg has been quietly building an insurance and investment conglomerate that people close to him describe as a mini version of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). Greenberg’s $4.4 billion acquisition, announced Monday, of health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc is by far the largest in a series of investments carried out through the private investments arm of his insurance and investment firm, C.V. Starr & Co, which was set up by AIG founder Cornelius Vander Starr in 1943. The MultiPlan deal could be the clearest sign yet of how Greenberg, 88, has been working on a Wall Street comeback after spending the last few years dealing with a multitude of lawsuits and investigations while suffering huge losses in the value of his AIG holdings as the insurance giant tottered during the financial crisis. Although Greenberg’s closely held company does not disclose financial details, people familiar with the matter said its private investments arm, Starr Investment Holdings LLC, had more than $3 billion in assets under management. It is tiny compared with Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $283 billion. In the MultiPlan deal, Greenberg deployed some of the same tactics as Buffett - using cash flow from a set of operating companies and assets as well as his relationships to pull off a large deal. “We have a rapidly growing insurance arm, we have a real estate business, and we also have a unit that helps Chinese companies invest in the U.S.,” Greenberg said in an interview. “We are private, we don’t advertise what we are doing, and we will stay private,” added Greenberg, who described the private investments arm as a significant driver of earnings. Greenberg, who - according to Forbes - had a net worth of $3.2 billion around the time he was ousted as AIG boss, last year told talk show host Charlie Rose he had lost around 90 percent of his wealth as a result of AIG’s collapse. AIG shares are still trading at a tiny fraction of their pre-crisis levels. Leading Starr Investment Holdings is Geoff Clark, already a veteran private equity dealmaker at the age of 41. After co-founding Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s (GS.N) private equity group in 1996 and being its co-head until 2004, Clark joined Starr in 2007, at a time when it invested in private equity funds but also made direct private equity investments. He led Starr Investment Holdings as it launched as a dedicated private investments business in 2012 and adopted an investment horizon that can go beyond the typical five-to-seven-year period that buyout firms tend to hold companies before selling them or doing an initial public offering. Rather than manage a traditional private equity fund that raises money from investors and then decides how to invest it, Starr Investment Holdings reaches out to investors on a deal-by-deal basis to seek their participation. Greenberg brought Swiss alternative asset manager Partners Group Holding AG (PGHN.S) and three other investors into the MultiPlan deal. The identity of the other investors, and information about the size of their stakes, was not disclosed but a person familiar with the deal said they included Bill Gross’ Pacific Investment Management Co, the world’s largest bond fund manager. A Pimco spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. “Mr Greenberg was very involved on the Starr side,” Joel Schwartz, Partners Group managing director, said in an interview. “We met with him during the deal, but we really did the transaction with Starr Investment Holdings.” Last year, Starr Investment Holdings brought in Partners Group as a shareholder in home decoration retailer Garden Ridge, a portfolio company of private equity firm AEA Investors LP. Starr, which was already a Garden Ridge investor, invited Partners Group into the deal when some of the other shareholders decided to exit. Greenberg’s links to the insurance world proved crucial to the MultiPlan deal, both in terms of relationships and also understanding MultiPlan’s business and clientele, people who worked on the deal said. MultiPlan Chief Executive Mark Tabak, who Starr and Partners Group plan to keep at the company’s helm, worked for Greenberg between 1993 and 1996 as president of AIG Managed Care. “We have known each other for a long time. He was a very key player, we probably would not have done (the MultiPlan deal) without him and he would not have done it without us,” Greenberg said of Tabak. MultiPlan is the oldest and largest provider of cost management solutions for the U.S. healthcare industry. The company’s cash flow has increased 50 percent since 2010 and Moody’s Investors Service said this week that MultiPlan continues to be in a market with high barriers to entry and solid organic growth. Greenberg had served as AIG chief executive for almost four decades when he was forced to step down amid an investigation by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York Attorney General, into the company’s business practices. The following year, the insurer paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes. Greenberg still faces some New York state charges over allegedly sham transactions, which he vehemently denies doing. Last year, he sued Spitzer for defamation as the former New York state governor was trying to stage his own comeback.

691,AIG,UPDATE 2-BofA $8.5 bln deal to go forward; AIG loses bid to delay,"By Karen Freifeld NEW YORK, Feb 19 (Reuters) - A New York state judge declined to delay court approval of Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities, rejecting a move by American International Group Inc. At a hearing on Wednesday, Justice Saliann Scarpulla of New York State Supreme Court ordered the judgment by her predecessor in the case, Barbara Kapnick, to be officially recorded. “It’s very straightforward,” Scarpulla told lawyers for AIG, which was one of the investors in the mortgage securities. “Judge Kapnick issued the order. ... If you don’t like it, your remedy is to appeal.” Kapnick approved the settlement on Jan. 31, her last day overseeing the case before she was elevated to a state appeals court, and ordered a five-day delay before her approval was officially recorded. AIG on Feb. 4 asked Scarpulla, the new judge on the case, to delay recording of the judgment, saying Kapnick had left some matters unresolved. “Judge Kapnick told me the five-day stay she put in was merely a convenience to the parties,” Scarpulla said on Wednesday. “She had no intention of leaving anything open.” AIG said in a statement it will appeal Kapnick’s decision if necessary. Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve claims by investors who bought mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the U.S. housing crisis. The investors said Countrywide, acquired by Bank of America in 2008, misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc , Allianz SE’s Pimco and Metlife Inc, signed on to the settlement. AIG opposed the deal, saying there was no evidence it provided adequate compensation for losses. “AIG’s announced strategy of imposing indefinite delay was defeated today,” Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group supporting the decision, told Reuters. Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee overseeing the securities, said it was pleased the court will enter the judgment, “which overwhelmingly vindicated the trustee’s actions.” Bank of New York Mellon and other supporters of the deal have accused AIG of holding the settlement “hostage.” In her Jan. 31 ruling, Kapnick said Bank of New York Mellon acted with mostly reasonable judgment in entering into the settlement. She made one exception, withholding approval relating to certain loans that had been modified. She said the trustee should not have settled those claims without investigating their potential worth. AIG said Wednesday it will try to get Kapnick’s decision vacated by pursuing a motion it filed Tuesday to reargue the case before Scarpulla. In the motion, AIG said Kapnick overlooked disputed and unresolved issues, applied the wrong standard to the trustee’s actions and failed to adequately explain her decision. “We are pleased that the court intends to address AIG’s motion for re-argument,” AIG said in its statement. “If necessary, AIG also looks forward to pressing ahead with its appeal at the appropriate time.” Scarpulla said during the hearing she would hear arguments on the motion but did not set a date.

692,AIG,Fitch Upgrades AIG Senior Debt Ratings to 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded American International  Group, Inc.'s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A-' from 'BBB+'. The ratings on  AIG's senior debt obligations are upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. The Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of AIG's rated property/casualty insurance  subsidiaries are affirmed at 'A'. The IFS ratings of the company's U.S. life  insurance subsidiaries led by AGC Life Insurance Company are affirmed at 'A+'. In addition the long-term senior secured ratings of securities issued by ASIF  Global Financing, ASIF II Program and ASIF III Program were revised to 'A+' from  'A' and are also affirmed at 'A+'. The revision brings the long-term senior  secured ratings of these entities in line with AIG Life and Retirement's IFS  ratings, which were previously upgraded on Feb. 14, 2013 and affirmed on Aug. 8,  2013. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of ratings is provided at  the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The holding company upgrade recognizes the continued improvement in the  organization's capital position and debt servicing capabilities. The company's  financial leverage as measured by the ratio of financial debt and preferred  securities to total capital (excluding operating debt and the impact of FAS 115)  declined to 18% at year-end 2013 from 31% at year-end 2010. Fitch's total  financial commitment (TFC) ratio has also improved, to 1.1x at year-end 2013  from 2.5x at year-end 2010. The sale of aircraft leasing subsidiary  International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) to AerCap Holdings N.V. that is  expected to close in second quarter 2014 will further reduce TFC to a pro forma  level of approximately 0.7x.  The upgrade of the IDR and debt ratings is also based on Fitch's view that the  improved earnings and dividend capacity of AIG's Life and Retirement segment can  support the interest and debt service payments of the holding company. The  holding company rating now reflects the application of standard notching between  the holding company IDR and the life operating companies' implied IDR. AIG reported significantly improved profitability in 2013. Net income increased  by over 160% to $9.1 billion, which corresponds with a return on equity of 9.2%.  Pre-tax operating income was $4.8 billion for AIG's Property Casualty segment  and $5.1 billion for Life and Retirement operations in 2013.  Earnings growth at the insurance subsidiaries and the repayment of higher coupon  debt has led to significantly improved interest coverage.  Operating-earnings-based interest coverage on financial debt improved to 6.7x in  2013 from 2.2x in 2012. AIG's ability to meet holding company obligations is  primarily supported by dividend capacity from the insurance subsidiaries. Cash  distributions from subsidiaries totaled $8.7 billion in 2013. The company has  built a strong holding company liquidity position that includes $7.2 billion of  unencumbered cash and investments at year end 2013, and $4.4 billion of  available capacity from credit facilities.  AIG property/casualty subsidiary ratings consider the company's unique market  position in the global insurance market given its absolute size. Lower  catastrophe losses and benefits from recent pricing underwriting and portfolio  repositioning actions led to a decline in the property casualty combined ratio  to 101.3% in 2013 from 108.5% a year earlier. The company's underwriting results  were affected by modest unfavorable reserve development in 2012 and 2013. AIG's  underwriting performance continues to lag large commercial insurer peers.  The ratings of AIG's Life and Retirement subsidiaries are driven by these  entities' strong statutory capital position, more conservative asset allocation  and return to stronger operating profits and earnings stability. The company has  demonstrated that the effects of the previous financial crisis have subsided.  Operating income has improved in 2012 and 2013 as a result of higher fee income  driven by growth in assets under management, continued active spread management,  higher investment income and low levels of surrender activity. These positive  factors are offset somewhat by concerns as to the effect of continued very low  interest rates on product performance and future profitability.  The 'A+' senior secured notes ratings assigned to the securities issued by ASIF  Global Financing, ASIF II Program and ASIF III Program recognizes that the  obligations are secured by a funding agreement with cash flow structures that  enable the trustees to make payments on the notes. Thus the notes are dependent  upon the credit quality of AIG Life and Retirement and are assigned the  insurer's IFS rating. All ratings reflect AIG's success in restructuring and deleveraging efforts over  the last five years. All government support was repaid by AIG in 2012. The  company is now an independent publicly held corporation with an operating focus  on global property/casualty insurance and domestic life insurance and retirement  products. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to future rating upgrades include: --Demonstration of higher and more consistent earnings within Property/Casualty  or Life and Retirement operating segments that translate into average  earnings-based interest coverage above 10.0x. This would correspond with  insurance pre-tax operating earnings of approximately $14 billion;  --Further improvement in AIG's capital structure and leverage metrics that  reduce the company's TFC ratio to below 0.5x; --Continued improvement in the operating earnings of the Life and Retirement  segment which could lead to an upgrade of those subsidiary ratings;  --A shift to modest sustainable breakeven or better underwriting results, with  greater loss reserve stability or reserve redundancies could lead to an upgrade  of property casualty subsidiary IFS ratings. Key triggers that could lead to a future rating downgrade include:  --Increases in financial leverage as measured by financial debt-to-total capital  to a sustained level above 30%, or a material increase in the TFC ratio from  current levels;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries that Fitch views as inconsistent with  that of comparably-rated peers and industry trends; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries, and/or failure to achieve the  above noted capital structure improvements.

693,AIG,AIG's Brazil revenue to soar this year on fast growth plan,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) expects revenue from underwritten premiums in Brazil to rise 40 percent this year, the unit’s top executive said, underpinning fast growth in a market where the U.S. insurer has ambitious expansion plans for the next decade. AIG will pump about $120 million into the unit in Brazil to propel growth in life, property-casualty and high risk corporate insurance, Jaime Calvo, AIG’s chief executive officer in Brazil, said late on Monday. The insurer, the largest in the United States, is forecasting underwritten premiums at $225 million this year, Calvo added. The capital injection is part of a broader strategy that includes acquisitions and which aims to make Brazil one of AIG’s top-five markets by 2017. Calvo said the company expects to almost double staff to 700 employees within three years; currently AIG’s Brazilian operations are not even among the group’s top-20 performers. “Our plan is one of accelerated growth. It implies organic growth of course, but it includes acquisitions too,” Calvo, a Maxico-born company veteran, said. “The secular process of household income gains in Brazil will naturally lead to more demand for insurance services and products.” Brazil’s insurance market, with its rapid growth in demand, is the target of foreign interest. Brazilians spend less than a 10th of the amount Britons or Americans do on insurance products and, as the middle class in Latin America’s biggest country grows, insurers are luring new clients by transforming traditional, costlier policies into cheaper products. According to Susep, Brazil’s watchdog for the insurance sector, premiums rose 18 percent in the first 11 months of 2013. AIG’s strategy in Brazil does not only aim at seeking rapid market share gains in some segments but also to achieve high returns, Calvo added. The company’s biggest bet is on retail insurance products, starting with auto insurance, allowing the so-called consumer lines to represent about 75 percent of AIG’s portfolio in Brazil, from 25 percent currently. In the case of the local auto insurance market, an increase in the size of Brazil’s fleet coupled with healthy pricing dynamics is bolstering growth in premiums. Partnerships with insurance brokers and even commercial banks could help AIG fend off the shortcomings of having small scale in distribution of its products, Calvo noted. In addition, the highest interest rates in more than two years could help improve financial income at insurance companies in Brazil, while marginally fanning competition in the auto insurance segment. Still, according to Calvo, there are no signs of any player trying to expand market share by lowering prices yet. Despite the company’s appetite for potential acquisitions in Brazil, AIG is reluctantly analyzing Itaú’s plans to sell its high-risk corporate insurance portfolio. Itaú put the unit up for sale late last month in a bid to deploy capital more efficiently in coming years. Analysts say the sale could fetch about 1 billion reais ($426.48 million) for Itaú. Yet, Calvo said that the portfolio itself does not look attractive without an effective distribution network. “An outright purchase just for the sake of it does not interest us,” Calvo said of the deal. The process to dispose of the high-risk insurance portfolio is in preliminary stages, Itaú executives said last month. The sale comes after infrastructure projects related to hosting the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016 got off to a late start, and the government auctioned rights to operate roads, railways and ports a year later than expected.

694,AIG,U.S. Senator Collins says bill would tweak capital rules for insurers,"WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. senator who backed tougher capital rules for nonbank financial firms said on Tuesday that regulators misread how that requirement applied to insurance companies, and she has proposed new legislation to clear up the confusion. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, introduced an amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street oversight law that said large nonbank firms should meet leverage limits that are at least as stringent as the rules that banks follow. Insurance companies have since complained that they are structured differently than banks and already meet leverage requirements imposed by state regulators, so they should not have to follow the same capital rules. Officials with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which now regulates American International Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc, have questioned whether Dodd-Frank allows them to tailor the rules for insurers. Collins told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the Fed has flexibility to tailor its rules. She introduced a bill on Monday that she said would make that clear. “My legislation would ... clarify that, in establishing minimum capital requirements for holding companies on a consolidated basis, the Federal Reserve is not required to include insurers so long as the insurers are engaged in activities regulated as insurance at the state level,” Collins said in remarks prepared for the hearing. Senators Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who called the hearing, and Mike Johanns, a Republican, introduced legislation in 2013 to address the same issue. That bill has not yet been considered by the banking panel. The squabble stems from the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when AIG nearly collapsed and had to be rescued by U.S. officials. Reform advocates said nonbank financial companies had never been held to the same leverage and other rules that big U.S. banks had to meet. The Dodd-Frank law allowed regulators to subject nonbank firms deemed “too big to fail” to bank-like rules. AIG, Prudential and General Electric Co’s finance arm have been named already, and insurer MetLife Inc is being considered for heightened scrutiny. Insurance executives, their state regulators, many lawmakers and some Fed officials all have said insurers are not subject to runs on the business in the way banks are in a crisis and do not hold the same types of assets. Collins, who is not a member of the banking panel but was asked to testify about her amendment, said she would work with the committee to give the Fed more flexibility as long as “we not take action that would diminish taxpayer protections.”",3112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-insurance/u-s-senator-collins-says-bill-would-tweak-capital-rules-for-insurers-idUSL2N0M80WS20140311

697,AIG,UPDATE 1-N.Y. regulators say MetLife to pay $60 mln for violations,"(Adds AIG comment) By Karen Freifeld NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife will pay $60 million because two subsidiaries solicited insurance business in New York without a license, New York authorities said on Monday. Investigations by the state’s Department of Financial Services and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office found that MetLife subsidiaries ALICO and DelAm, bought from AIG in 2010, misrepresented their business activities to regulators. An investigation is ongoing into violations by AIG  and its subsidiaries on conduct before the MetLife purchase, Benjamin Lawsky, the state’s top financial regulator, said in a statement. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement that the two subsidiaries used Manhattan-based staff to solicit insurance business even though neither company was licensed to do so in New York. Metlife will pay a $50 million fine to Lawsky’s agency. Another $10 million will go to the Manhattan District Attorney’s office as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. AIG disagrees that the conduct violates the law, according to a statement from the company. “A New York license is required only where a foreign insurer issues policies covering New Yorkers,” the statement said, adding there was no evidence anyone was harmed.

698,AIG,AIG sues NY regulator over probe of insurance marketing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc on Thursday sued New York regulators to force them to back off a threatened costly enforcement proceeding over possible violations of state law by a former unit. AIG’s lawsuit against the New York State Department of Financial Services and its superintendent, Benjamin Lawsky, is unusual, with an investigation target trying to stop any action. The dispute centers on American Life Insurance Co, better known as ALICO, and another former AIG unit known as DelAm. MetLife Inc, another insurer, both bought units from AIG in 2010. Earlier this week New York regulators said MetLife would pay $60 million because those two subsidiaries solicited insurance business in New York without a license. The Department of Financial Services added that a probe into possible violations by AIG and other units before the 2010 MetLife purchase was ongoing. In its complaint, AIG said New York officials have threatened to begin administrative proceedings and other actions in which they would seek “substantial monetary penalties” from AIG over ALICO’s activities. AIG said Lawsky’s activity violated its rights to due process and other provisions of the U.S. Constitution, and was an “unprecedented attempt” to expand his regulatory authority. The Department of Financial Services said it would respond in court. “AIG may not want to cooperate with our probe, but they are not above the law - no matter how big or powerful they may be,” Matt Anderson, a spokesman for Lawsky, said on Thursday. AIG last year repaid the last of what grew into a $182.3 billion federal bailout related to the financial crisis.

701,AIG,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg must face judge he called biased,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former AIG chief Maurice “Hank” Greenberg will have to defend himself against claims of accounting fraud in a non-jury trial conducted by a judge he tried to remove for alleged bias. Justice Charles Ramos of New York state court on Tuesday ruled against Greenberg’s demand for a jury to hear the civil case brought by the New York attorney general. Earlier this month, a New York appeals court rejected Greenberg’s attempt to remove Ramos from the long-running case. Greenberg claimed Ramos was biased against him and could not preside over a fair trial. Ramos ruled from the bench in the latest legal wrangling in the 2005 case that accuses Greenberg and the insurer’s former chief financial officer, Howard Smith, of orchestrating sham transactions at the insurer to hide its financial condition. A spokeswoman for Greenberg’s lawyer, David Boies, declined to comment on losing the bid for a jury. Attorney Vincent Sama, who represents Smith, who also sought a jury trial, said he may appeal the ruling. Ramos also heard arguments by the executives’ lawyers on their motions to dismiss the case. Boies said the lawsuit could not be pursued because Schneiderman no longer had “a viable remedy.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who inherited the case, was forced to drop his claims for as much as $6 billion in damages last year after a class action settlement between AIG shareholders and the executives and others over the allegedly improper accounting. The attorney general is now seeking “ill-gotten gains” from Greenberg’s compensation, according to attorney David Ellenhorn, who represents Schneiderman. He also wants to bar the executives from serving as officers or directors of public companies and from participating in the securities business. Boies argued that Greenberg, 88, has no intention of engaging in the securities business or in acting as a director or officer of a public company. Greenberg is the chairman and chief executive of the privately held C.V. Starr & Co, which owns Starr Principal Holdings, a registered security adviser. “He is controlling a company that is in the securities business,” Ellenhorn said. Boies said Greenberg didn’t participate in the management of Starr Principal Holdings or its investment activity. “That’s nice, but it’s not the whole picture,” Ramos said. “It sounds as if he’s a control person...it opens the door to that influence.” Still, Ramos did not rule on whether the lawsuit, which was originally brought by former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer, should proceed to trial. Greenberg led AIG for nearly four decades before he was ousted in 2005. The next year, AIG paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes into its business practices.

703,AIG,US STOCKS-Wall St ends up as ISM data upbeat; Apple above $600,"* Services sector grows in April, fastest pace in 8 months * JPMorgan leads banks lower after trading revenue warning * Apple shares close above $600 for the first time since Oct. 26, 2012 * Dow up 0.1 pct, S&P; up 0.2 pct, Nasdaq up 0.3 pct   (Updates close with latest volume, AIG down after the bell) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly higher as data showed strength in the services sector and Apple shares rose above $600 for the first time since late 2012. Limiting the day’s gains, however, were concerns over an escalation of tensions between Ukraine and pro-Russia separatists. Ukrainian forces were ambushed by separatists, triggering heavy fighting on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Slaviansk, a day after a Ukrainian police station in Odessa was stormed. The Institute for Supply Management’s services sector index hit the fastest pace in eight months in April, topping expectations. It was the latest report to offer upbeat news on the economy after an unusually harsh winter. “The ISM services came out and showed pretty good growth, and that obviously brought back some buyers,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. Apple shares, up 1.4 percent at $600.96, led both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq higher. Late in the session, the stock broke above $600, and it closed above the level for the first time since Oct. 26, 2012. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.66 points or 0.11 percent, to 16,530.55, the S&P; 500 gained 3.52 points or 0.19 percent, to 1,884.66 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 14.158 points or 0.34 percent, to 4,138.055. Short-term upward trendlines were tested in the S&P; 500 and the Dow but not broken, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, suggesting the uptrend is not over. Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac gained after activist investor William Ackman recommended the shares of mortgage finance giants during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York. Fannie was up 3 percent at $4.10 while Freddie  was up 6.3 percent at $4.23. On the downside, shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 2.4 percent to $54.22, the biggest drag on the S&P; 500.

704,AIG,"AIG's income from premiums fall, shares down","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) posted a 27 percent fall in quarterly income, hurt by a drop in earnings from premiums and higher disaster losses in its core property and casualty insurance business. The company’s shares fell as much as 3 percent in extended trading on Monday. The U.S. insurer is in the middle of a turnaround after almost collapsing under the weight of soured derivative bets during the 2008 financial crisis. It has since repaid the $180 billion in bailout funds it received in 2008 and has focused on its core insurance business. Net premiums earned in its property casualty unit fell 4 percent to $8.23 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, AIG said on Monday. After-tax operating income from the company’s insurance operations fell 11 percent to $2.65 billion, while the combined ratio worsened to 101.2 from 97.3 in the same quarter of 2013. A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims. The company said results were impacted by disaster losses of $262 million, compared with $41 million in the year-ago period. AIG’s net income fell 27 percent to $1.61 billion, or $1.09 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, from $2.2 billion, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier.

American International Group shares fell 2.3 percent to $51.54, a day after posting a 27 percent drop in quarterly income. The financial sector saw the biggest decline, with the S&P; financial index down 0.8 percent. Among early decliners in the technology sector was Twitter , which slumped nearly 10 percent to $35.01 after the expiration of a six-month “lock-up” period that had restricted the sale of about 82 percent of its outstanding equity. Athenahealth Inc shares slumped 11 percent to $111.88, a day after hedge fund manager David Einhorn said his Greenlight Capital was betting against the company.

The Russell 2000 of small-cap companies was down 0.6 percent. Underperforming the broader market, the Russell 2000 closed down 0.2 percent on Monday, but for the quarter, the index is up 8.3 percent. “Small-caps have underperformed other indexes over the past month, and (Monday) morning’s sell-off marked the sixth time that this major support level has been tested since the beginning of April,” said Bryan Sapp, senior trading analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. “Should this moving average give way to downside price action, it would be a major warning sign for stocks over the intermediate term,” he said. Office Depot Inc raised its forecast for full-year adjusted operating income and said it would close at least 400 stores in the United States over two years, sending the office supply retailer’s shares up about 17 percent to $4.85. Twitter’s share price rout came in heavy trading, with more than 43 million shares changing hands so far, compared to its 10-day average below 16 million. A sustained sell-off would place greater pressure on a stock already at all-time lows since April 29, when the company’s quarterly results showed sagging usage metrics. Twitter has comfortably hit its revenue targets in the two quarters since it went public on Nov. 7. But rapidly mounting concerns about user growth and engagement levels has wiped out more than $18 billion of market value - half the company’s market capitalization - since its market debut.

The sale also marks AIG’s exit from its last non-core business, just a few years after sour derivative bets nearly wiped out the company. While the insurer has paid back a U.S. bailout and even reinstituted a dividend since the crisis, it is now a smaller, more narrowly focused company than before. AIG received $3.0 billion of cash and 97,560,976 newly issued AerCap common shares, according to an AIG statement, for a total value of about $7.6 billion based on AerCap’s closing price per share of $47.01 on Tuesday. Net cash proceeds to AIG were approximately $2.4 billion after the settlement of intercompany loans, the statement added. AIG said in December 2012 that it had reached a deal to sell up to 90 percent of ILFC to a group of investors based mainly in China for $4.7 billion, but the deal never went through. Netherlands-based AerCap buys aircraft and rents them to airlines.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Monday found no showing that the bank, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and other officials had intended to mislead shareholders and acted in a “highly unreasonable” manner by not disclosing the lawsuit before it was filed. AIG sued Bank of America on August 8, 2011 over alleged losses on more than $28 billion of mortgage-backed securities that the insurer had bought from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units. Bank of America shares fell 20.3 percent on the day the lawsuit was filed. Major U.S. stock indexes fell more than 5 percent that day, the first trading session after Standard & Poor’s took away the United States’ triple-A credit rating. Camcorp Interests Ltd, a Houston-based investment firm, claimed that the bank knew of AIG’s claims as early as February 2011 and should have revealed them at that time. But the 2nd Circuit said “the much more compelling conclusion” is that the bank found no disclosure was necessary in light of “information already in the marketplace, the aggregate disclosure of (Bank of America’s) findings, and the lack of any definitive regulatory requirement requiring the disclosure of a possible lawsuit of indeterminate amount.” Monday’s decision upheld a November 2013 ruling by U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan.

718,AIG,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg loses bid to end New York lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state judge has rejected a request by Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the former American International Group Inc chief executive officer, to dismiss a long-running civil  lawsuit by the state’s attorney general. Greenberg, now 89, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith were accused in the 2005 case of engineering sham transactions, including with the General Re Corp reinsurance unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, to make AIG’s financial health look better. This alleged accounting fraud led to a $3.9 billion restatement, which predated the insurer’s $182.3 billion federal bailout stemming from the 2008 financial crisis. David Boies, a lawyer for Greenberg, said his client plans to appeal. Vincent Sama, a lawyer for Smith, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Justice Charles Ramos of the Manhattan state supreme court on Wednesday rejected the defendants’ arguments that state law barred Attorney General Eric Schneiderman from seeking to recoup some of their pay, and ban them from the securities industry and from serving as officers or directors of public companies. The judge also said arguments that the defendants “pose no threat to the New York public” because they do not lead public companies or plan to publicly sell securities involve issues of fact to be resolved at a trial, which would not have a jury. “The issues remaining in this action must be tried,” Ramos wrote. The lawsuit was first brought by Eliot Spitzer, then the state’s attorney general, and has been continued by his successors, Andrew Cuomo and now Schneiderman. Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said: “We look forward to moving toward a trial that will finally offer the opportunity to hold Mr. Greenberg accountable for his alleged role in a massive fraud.” Last June, New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, also let the case go forward, even though Schneiderman had earlier in the year dropped damages claims worth a potential $6 billion. “We have no difficulty in concluding that, in this civil case, there is evidence sufficient for trial that both Greenberg and Smith participated in a fraud,” the appeals court wrote. Greenberg now runs privately held C.V. Starr & Co. Buffett was not implicated in wrongdoing. The case is People v Greenberg, et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 401720/2005.

720,AIG,"Exclusive: Fed hires official to oversee AIG, Prudential","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has hired a former state insurance commissioner to help it oversee non-bank financial firms that a council of regulators identified for tougher scrutiny last year. Thomas Sullivan, who led the Connecticut Insurance Department from 2007 through 2010 and later worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL], told Reuters he starts as a senior adviser on June 9. Sullivan will help fill a critical expertise gap at the Fed, which has more experience regulating Wall Street banks and less of a track record with major insurers and other non-bank financial firms. “I’m excited and anxious to start next Monday,” Sullivan said. Barbara Hagenbaugh, a Fed spokeswoman, confirmed the hire but did not provide further detail. The Fed received authority to regulate insurers Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N) in 2013 after a group of regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council decided those firms were so big their failure would destabilize financial markets. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the U.S. government stepped in to stabilize AIG with a taxpayer-funded bailout that eventually topped $180 billion. General Electric Co’s (GE.N) finance arm also was dubbed “systemically important.” Insurance companies and their backers in the U.S. Congress have complained about the Fed’s lack of direct experience with insurers and said the Fed should not seek to impose bank-like restrictions on them. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers earlier this year that the Fed recognized that banks and insurance companies differ in some ways and was working to craft capital rules that would reflect those differences. Sullivan, who was active in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), according to a biography on Connecticut’s insurance department website, said he would be part of the Fed’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation. “Tom’s strong regulatory experience, comprehension of the insurance sector, and thorough understanding of America’s national system of state-based insurance regulation will be a tremendous asset to the board on both domestic and international issues,” NAIC president Adam Hamm said in a statement.

722,AIG,UPDATE 2-Insurer AIG names Peter Hancock as CEO,"* Benmosche retires after 5 years at the helm * Will now take up advisory role at AIG * Hancock headed company’s property-casualty business   (Adds details, analyst comments) By Avik Das June 10 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc  said Peter Hancock would succeed Robert Benmosche as chief executive and president, effective Sept. 1. Hancock joined AIG in 2010 and has headed the company’s property-casualty business since March 2011. Before joining AIG, he was vice chairman of KeyCorp  and a former chief financial officer at JPMorgan Chase & Co . The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Hancock and Jay Wintrob, who leads AIG’s life-insurance and retirement business, would be the leading candidates for the CEO post after Benmosche retired in September. BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski said Hancock’s banking experience would help AIG deal with SIFI (systemically important financial institutions) and the U.S. government, and his appointment “should provide no hiccups to the company.” Sebaski, who has a five-star rating on StarMine due to the accuracy of his estimates, also identified AIG’s property-casualty business as needing “more corrective action” and said Hancock’s experience in this area would be “probably beneficial” for the company. Retiring CEO Benmosche, who has been with AIG since 2009, is credited with steering the company through the financial crisis. During his tenure, AIG fully repaid the $182.3 billion government bailout it received in 2008 to stave off bankruptcy. Benmosche, who was diagnosed with cancer in late 2010, was CEO of MetLife Inc from 1998 to 2006. He initially planned to retire from AIG in 2012, but later expressed his desire to carry on. Soon after becoming the fourth person to hold the CEO post at AIG since June 2008, Benmosche reversed course on the company’s strategy in an attempt to turn around its fortunes. He stopped the sales of assets at throwaway prices, tried to boost employee morale and took on AIG’s critics, including government officials. Sebaski said that under Benmosche’s leadership, AIG had moved from “great uncertainty” in 2009 to re-establish itself as a market leader in its core businesses. In February, AIG raised its quarterly dividend by 25 percent, to 12.5 cents per share. With Benmosche at the helm, the insurer’s stock has more than doubled to Tuesday’s close of $55.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Benmosche will now take up an advisory role at AIG, the company said in a statement.

723,AIG,"MOVES- AIG, Evercore, Santander, HSBC, Rockefeller","(Adds New York Stock Exchange, Insurance Europe, Investec Asset Finance, KPMG, BNY Mellon, updates HSBC) June 11 (Reuters) - The following financial services industry appointments and departures were announced on Wednesday. To inform us of other job changes, email to moves@thomsonreuters.com. The insurer said Peter Hancock would succeed Robert Benmosche as chief executive and president, effective Sept. 1. Hancock joined AIG in 2010 and has headed the company’s property-casualty business since March 2011. The boutique investment bank named Randy Crath as a senior managing director in its oil and gas group, providing advice to energy companies on purchase or sale of international exploration and production assets. Prior to this, Crath was a managing director at Scotia Waterous, where he has advised on more than $20 billion of transactions for companies including Chevron Corp, Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec). Crath will be based in Houston, Texas. The British arm of the Spain-based bank appointed a former UK regulator as director of financial crime and intelligence. Santander UK said Sharon Campbell would take on the new role from July 1. The bank has named Georges Elhedery as head of global banking and markets for the Middle East and North Africa region, effective immediately. Elhedery had already been handling much of that remit since the previous banking and markets head, Mohammad al-Tuwaijri, was promoted to chief executive of MENA in July last year. ID:nL5N0OS40G] The bank also said Deborah Hazell, currently CEO for HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc, and regional head, North America, HSBC Global Asset Management, had assumed responsibility for Latin America with immediate effect. Now she will oversees HSBC Global Asset Management’s operations in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, in addition to the U.S. and Canada. Hazell joined HSBC in New York in 2011 after more than two decades in the asset management industry. The investment manager named Neil Craig as a senior vice-president for investment products and services to institutional clients and investment consultants. Craig was a managing director at Attalus Capital, a fund-of-hedge funds operator, where he handled new business development focusing on western North American and Canadian institutional markets. New York Stock Exchange executive Lou Pastina, who leads the Big Board’s cash equity market operations, is set to leave the company as part of its integration with Intercontinental Exchange Inc, according sources familiar with the matter. The European insurance and reinsurance federation said it extended the mandate of Sergio Balbinot as president of Insurance Europe for a further year. The federation said the mandate of Balbinot, who is the group chief insurance officer and deputy group CEO of insurance company Generali Group, Italy, was due to expire at the end of a three-year period. The renewal was voted on at the federation’s general assembly in Malta on Wednesday. The UK-based provider of asset and loan finance said it appointed Jane Mantell as head of portfolio risk. The company said Mantell would be responsible for establishing a model-based framework for decision-making, capital and provisioning. Mantell joins from consultancy firm Insight Plus. The audit, tax and advisory services firm said it named John Gimigliano as principal in charge of the federal legislative and regulatory services group of the company’s  Washington National Tax practice. Gimigliano succeeds Hank Gutman, who is assuming other responsibilities within the firm. Prior to joining KPMG, Gimigliano served as senior tax counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives’ committee on ways and means and as staff director for its subcommittee on select revenue measures. The investment management firm said it appointed Don Quattrucci as executive director for business development for BNY Mellon Wealth Management. Quattrucci will help drive BNY Mellon Wealth Management’s overall sales strategy and oversee the firm’s growth initiative. Quattrucci will be based in Boston and report to wealth management CEO Larry Hughes. He has been with the company for 20 years and worked in the capital markets group before moving to wealth management as a senior portfolio manager.

724,AIG,"TRLPC: Oak Hill, AIG launch mid-market lending platform","NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Management and insurer American International Group (AIG) have teamed up to establish Varagon Capital Partners, an asset manager and direct origination platform focused on lending to middle market companies. Varagon is an independent firm jointly owned by AIG and partners of Oak Hill, Chief Executive Officer Walter Owens told Thomson Reuters LPC in a phone interview. Varagon launched with an initial $1.5 billion investment commitment from AIG. The joint venture comes as institutional investors and alternative asset managers, including private equity firms, are increasingly expanding into the middle market lending space with new direct lending and credit investment platforms. Other institutional investors are gaining exposure through mandated separately managed accounts, the formation of business development companies or traditional loan funds. “Varagon combines a true direct origination and risk management platform in the commercial banking tradition with the fundraising and portfolio management capabilities of an asset manager,” said Owens, who prior to taking the helm at Varagon, held leadership positions at GE Capital, CIT Bank, and TD Bank. Varagon will lend to companies with between $10 million and $75 million of Ebitda, focusing primarily on borrowers backed by private equity sponsors. But the team’s industry heads will also evaluate opportunities to invest in non-sponsored businesses. The firm will make loans up to $350 million, typically holding from $20 million to $100 million of the deal with the remainder being syndicated to a lender group. “Our investor is a risk adjusted return investor, which allows the firm to provide products up and down the capital structure, and to do it in size,” said Owens. “They see the value in each product on a risk adjusted basis.” As such Varagon will invest across the capital structure, offering borrowers a range of options including first-lien credit facilities, unitranche and second-lien loans, as well as mezzanine financing. “As a buy and hold investor with a core focus on credit discipline we are excited to partner with Varagon,” said AIG Deputy Chief Investment Officer Brian Schrieber. “We believe that by applying strong credit discipline, middle market loans offer compelling risk adjusted returns. Varagon’s experienced management team brings both fundamental credit expertise and strong industry relationships that we expect will produce high quality, directly originated investment opportunities,” he added. With interest rates expected to remain persistently low in the near term, alternative capital providers are likely to see sustained institutional appetite from investors aiming to generate higher risk adjusted returns through diversified fixed income portfolio allocations. At the same time, as banks face regulatory constraints designed to limit leveraged lending activity, non-traditional lenders are poised to step in to fill the funding gap for borrowers. In addition to the commitment from AIG, Varagon is also targeting other institutional investors seeking middle market credit exposure, including insurance companies, pension funds, family offices, foundations and endowments. Varagon’s twelve person team is based in New York.

725,AIG,Fitch Expects to Rate AIG's New Sr. Unsecured Notes 'BBB+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a rating of 'BBB+' to  American International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) $1.0 billion issuance of 2.3% senior  notes due 2019 and $1.5 billion of 4.5% senior notes due 2044.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The new issue rating is equivalent to the ratings on AIG's existing senior debt.  Proceeds from the issue will be used for general corporate purposes. The new  issuance will marginally affect the company's financial leverage as the company  has recently redeemed approximately $2 billion of outstanding debt. Consolidated  debt was also significantly reduced by completion of the sale of aircraft  leasing subsidiary, International Lease financing corporation (ILFC) on May 14,  2014. Fitch estimates that AIG's ratio of financial debt to total capital will  be approximately 19% following the new issuance and consolidated debt to total  capital will be approximately 31%. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to future rating upgrades include: --Demonstration of higher and more consistent earnings within Property/Casualty  or Life and Retirement operating segments that translate into average  earnings-based interest coverage above 10.0x. This would correspond with  insurance pre-tax operating earnings of approximately $14 billion; --Further improvement in AIG's capital structure and leverage metrics that  reduce the company's TFC ratio to below 0.5x; --Continued improvement in the operating earnings of the Life and Retirement  segment which could lead to an upgrade of those subsidiary ratings;  --A shift to modest sustainable breakeven or better underwriting results, with  greater loss reserve stability or reserve redundancies could lead to an upgrade  of property casualty subsidiary IFS ratings.  Key triggers that could lead to a future rating downgrade include:  --Increases in financial leverage as measured by financial debt-to-total capital  to a sustained level above 30%, or a material increase in the TFC ratio from  current levels;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries that Fitch views as inconsistent with  that of comparably-rated peers and industry trends; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries, and/or failure to achieve the  above noted capital structure improvements.  Fitch has assigned the following ratings:  --USD 1.0 billion of 2.3% senior unsecured notes due July 16, 2019 'BBB+';  --USD 1.5 billion of 4.5% senior unsecured notes due July 16, 2044 'BBB+'.

726,AIG,BofA pays AIG $650 million to settle mortgage disputes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) agreed to pay the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) $650 million to settle long-running legal disputes over defective mortgage-backed securities that the bank sold in the run-up to the financial crisis.  The settlement which the parties announced on Wednesday ends securities fraud litigation brought by AIG against the bank.  It also removes the biggest obstacle to the bank’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender Bank of America acquired in July 2008. AIG agreed to dismiss litigation in New York and California that accused the bank of fraudulently causing billions of dollars in losses by selling it shoddy mortgage securities. It originally sought $10 billion of damages in the New York case.  For the past three years, AIG has also led opponents of Bank of America’s $8.5 billion settlement in June 2011 with institutional investors to resolve claims that Countrywide misrepresented the quality of home loans underlying $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities it issued before the housing crisis. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pimco and Metlife Inc (MET.N) had agreed to the settlement, with the Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) serving as trustee.   AIG claimed the settlement undervalued its claims, and had been appealing January’s approval by Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court of the bulk of the settlement.  In agreeing to drop its appeal, AIG said it will accept a pro rata share of whatever investors recover. A group of funds known as Triaxx and a pension fund for Chicago police remain as objectors. A spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon declined to comment. A lawyer for Triaxx declined to comment, while a lawyer for the Chicago pension fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bank of America said it had set aside reserves by June 30 for the $650 million settlement, which also resolves three actions it brought to collect mortgage insurance proceeds from AIG’s United Guaranty unit on loans it had originated and serviced. The cases are American International Group Inc et al v. Maiden Lane II LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-00951; American International Group Inc et al v.

728,AIG,RPT-BofA pays AIG $650 million to settle mortgage disputes,"(Fixes paragraph formatting) By Karen Freifeld NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Bank of America agreed to pay American International Group Inc $650 million to settle long-running legal disputes over defective mortgage-backed securities sold in the run-up to the financial crisis. The deal, which the parties announced early Wednesday, ends securities fraud litigation that the insurer brought against Bank of America. It also removes the biggest obstacle to the bank’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities issued by Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender Bank of America acquired in 2008. AIG will file notices dismissing its litigation accusing the bank of causing billions of dollars in losses by selling it shoddy mortgage securities. The litigation is pending in New York and California. For the past three years, AIG led opponents in holding up court approval of a settlement Bank of America reached in June 2011 with institutional investors to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims over $174 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the housing crisis. The investors said Countrywide had misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc , Allianz SE’s Pimco and Metlife Inc, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee for the securities, agreed to the settlement. AIG claimed there was no evidence that the deal provided adequate compensation for losses. Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court gave the go-ahead for the bulk of the settlement in January, withholding her approval only from settlement of claims involving certain loans that had been modified. But AIG appealed Kapnick’s decision. As part of the agreement, AIG agreed to withdraw its objection. In a release on Wednesday morning, the insurer said it would receive its pro rata share of whatever is ultimately paid out to investors in connection with that settlement. A group of funds known as the Triaxx entities and the Chicago Police pension fund remain as objectors. The $650 million settlement was covered by litigation reserves as of June 30, Bank of America said.

731,AIG,China's sovereign fund CIC in talks to buy aircraft lessor Avolon-sources,"NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - China’s $653 billion sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp (CIC), is in talks to buy Dublin-based aircraft leasing firm Avolon for $4 billion to $5 billion including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. CIC is teamed up with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a state-owned aerospace and defense company, in its bid for Avolon, which provides aircraft leasing and lease management services to airlines and aircraft investors, one of the people said. The buyer group has been working on a potential acquisition of Avolon for the past several months but any deal is still months away, the people said on Monday, asking not to be named because the discussions are confidential. Private equity-owned Avolon is estimated to have an equity value of around $2.5 billion, the people said. Including debt, the proposed deal could have an enterprise value of $4 billion to $5 billion, they added. The discussions with CIC come as Avolon is simultaneously pursuing an initial public offering, in a bet that yield-hungry investors eyeing growing demand for air travel would sustain a recent boom in aircraft finance. CIC’s interest underscores strong demand for aircraft assets from Asian buyers, at a time when the region has become the world’s fastest growing market as Asian airlines tap into the spending power of travelers. China, one of the world’s biggest buyers of aircraft, is playing a bigger part in the global aviation industry as its airlines seek to cater to the nation’s growing number of business and leisure travelers. Another Chinese consortium made an unsuccessful bid in 2012 to buy aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) from U.S. insurance giant American International Group. That proposal deal fell apart, and AIG ended up selling ILFC to AerCap Holdings NV in December. Avolon, which is backed by private equity firms Cinven Ltd, CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Oak Hill Capital Partners, as well as Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, has been working with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase on a potential sale or IPO. Representatives for CIC and AVIC could not be immediately reached for comment. Avolon, Cinven and Oak Hill did not respond to requests for comment. CVC declined to comment. China Business News reported on Friday that CIC is teaming up with AVIC to bid for Avolon in a deal worth some 12 billion euros ($16 billion). Avolon has raised $7.2 billion in capital since its launch in May 2010. It has a fleet of more than 190 aircraft serving 46 customers in 27 countries. Avolon’s focus is on young and fuel-efficient single-aisle aircraft made by Boeing Co and Airbus Group NV. In 2013, it delivered a total of 34 aircraft to its customers valued at more than $2 billion. CIC, whose previous high-profile investments included taking a 10 percent stake in Britain’s Heathrow Airport Holdings in 2012 for 450 million pounds ($756.5 million), has not announced any deals of note in the past year as it underwent a leadership reshuffle.

733,AIG,Exclusive: AIG boosting Washington lobbying effort as hiatus prompted by crisis ends,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group (AIG.N) is ramping up its lobbying team in Washington, almost six years after it halted such efforts following its rescue by the U.S. government during the financial crisis. Many large companies deploy a handful of staff to provide access to Capitol Hill and the White House, but AIG has employed no officially registered lobbyists since 2009. Some of its government relations positions in Washington, which companies typically use to influence policymaking by regulators and other government officials, have been left vacant. Yet in May of this year, Lauren Scott started working as AIG’s director for international regulatory and government affairs in Washington, according to her LinkedIn profile. She was previously a director of international and insurance regulation at the American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group. That follows the arrival in February of Mary Frances Monroe - a former Federal Reserve supervisor who worked for a Washington consultancy firm - as AIG’s head of international regulatory in February, also according to LinkedIn. Scott and Monroe did not respond to requests for comment. AIG declined to comment. The lobbying build-up comes at a critical time for the insurer, which has been subject to new supervision by the Federal Reserve after it was designated as a “systemically important” firm by a top U.S. regulatory panel. It is not clear whether the two will officially register as lobbyists, something that anyone spending more than 20 percent of their working hours on influencing senior U.S. policymakers needs to do. It is also unclear how much of their work is domestic, and how much focused on international lobbying. Monroe worked as a registered lobbyist in a previous position, but Scott did not, according to official records.      The company said in October 2008 it would stop lobbying. It had faced public criticism when it continued to spend heavily to influence lawmakers despite receiving a $182 billion bailout that gave the government a majority stake, and because it continued to pay staff big bonuses. The company, which says it has customers in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions, almost collapsed when a little-known London unit, AIG Financial Products, racked up colossal losses through complex derivative transactions it had engaged in. But it is now slowly returning to normal, and has repaid the bailout funds to the government. AIG’s shares still linger at a fraction of where they were before the crisis, but it has resolved litigation and streamlined the business, and the company’s second-quarter profit beat expectations earlier this month.     The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which brings together all the key U.S. financial regulators and is chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, has designated AIG and one other insurer, Prudential (PRU.N), as systemically important, and is considering doing the same with MetLife Inc (MET.N). While AIG did not fight its designation, the insurance industry is trying to convince Congress to ease a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that applies strict bank capital standards to “systemically important” insurers. They argue the bank-specific approach is a bad fit for insurers’ distinct business model. AIG spent $11 million on lobbying Congress in both 2007 and 2008 - putting it among top spenders of that period, along with other major companies such as General Electric (GE.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) - but it quickly pulled back after that, and it did not spend at all in either 2010 or 2011, official records show. In 2012, it started spending again — paying $120,000 for the services of law firm Patton Boggs when AIG was selling a majority stake in one of its units. In 2013, it spent $140,000, and so far this year $80,000 with the same firm, now called Squire Patton Boggs, or with Ernst & Young, according to the Senate lobbying database.  Its Political Action Committee, or PAC - a fund to donate to election campaigns - donated $337,358 in 2008, with politicians on both sides of the aisle benefiting, but the organization has  been dormant after 2010. However, AIG in a recent job advertisement was looking to hire someone to perform “day-to-day AIG PAC activities”, to coordinate with fundraising committees for candidates, and to “assist with planning AIG PAC events” - a sign that it may be planning to make political donations again.

737,AIG,"UPDATE 1-AIG, philanthropist trade lawsuits over 'life settlements' deal","(Recasts with countersuit filed by Coventry against AIG, response from AIG) By Joseph Ax NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - An American International Group Inc unit and a philanthropist traded lawsuits on Friday over a partnership gone sour involving billions of dollars in life insurance policies sold by elderly individuals in exchange for cash. AIG’s Lavastone Capital said in a lawsuit filed Friday in New York federal court that it had paid Coventry First of Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, more than $1 billion since 2006 to help it acquire the policies, known as “life settlements.” Coventry, whose chief executive is Philadelphia philanthropist Alan Buerger, is the “leader and creator” of the life settlement industry, according to its website. Investors who acquire a policy cover the premiums until the individual’s death and then collect the payout. Rather than identifying appropriate policies and selling them to Lavastone at the elderly individuals’ asking price, the lawsuit claimed, Coventry used a network of shell companies to artificially inflate the prices to Lavastone. The fraud cost Lavastone more than $150 million, the lawsuit said. “Thus, defendants’ behavior is no different than an auction house that knows a bidder’s maximum price ceiling and then uses ‘shill bidders’ associated with the auction house to fraudulently inflate the price to that bidder’s maximum bid,” the lawsuit said. It called Coventry and CEO Buerger “scam artists.” In a countersuit filed in New York state court a few hours later, Coventry accused Lavastone of breaching its exclusive contract with Coventry by allowing an affiliate to purchase life settlements from other businesses. The lawsuit also claimed Lavastone “concocted” fraud allegations to escape contractual provisions that limit its ability to resell certain policies, which Coventry estimated could cost AIG $700 million. “Their lawsuit is simply meant to get leverage to get rid of the contract provisions,” Buerger said in an interview. Coventry asked a judge to award it more than $100 million and declare that Lavastone is not entitled to its own damages. An AIG spokeswoman called the Coventry lawsuit “a baseless attempt to distract attention from the fraudulent and illegal scheme that AIG alleged in its complaint.” Lavastone accused Coventry of engaging in racketeering, fraud, conspiracy, breach of contract and other violations. The lawsuit also noted two previous civil fraud actions against Coventry brought by the New York Attorney General’s office and Florida’s insurance regulator, both of which have been settled. Besides Coventry, the lawsuit names several other business entities as well as Buerger and several family members. Lavastone spent about $6.5 billion over a decade to acquire nearly 7,000 life settlements with a face value of $20 billion, its lawsuit said. AIG has since wound down its life settlement business, the lawsuit said. The Buergers are well-known philanthropists in Philadelphia who donated $50 million to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia last year. The federal case is Lavastone Capital LLC v.

741,AIG,"Six years after AIG bailout, trial asks: was it legal?","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the more unusual trials to come out of the 2008 financial crisis is set to begin on Monday, when a federal judge will consider whether the U.S. government’s rescue of American International Group Inc (AIG.N) was, in fact, legal.  In a case that explores the limits on U.S. government power in responding to major financial crises, the trial is expected to revisit in detail the New York Federal Reserve’s September 2008 decision to extend a bailout package to AIG as the insurance giant was minutes from bankruptcy. The AIG bailout, on the heels of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, preceded the “too big to fail” auto and bank bailouts the federal government undertook during a U.S. financial crisis underpinned by faulty mortgage lending. The major players in that drama will be back on the Washington stage during the six-week trial: Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry “Hank” Paulson. A lawyer for the insurance giant’s former chief executive, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, was expected to argue that the government unlawfully sought to punish AIG shareholders with excessively harsh terms. Greenberg’s lawyers have said in court papers the bailout “offer” from the New York Fed to provide AIG an $85 billion loan in exchange for high interest rates and a nearly 80 percent stake in the company amounted to unconstitutional theft from AIG shareholders. Greenberg, through his Starr International Co, was AIG’s largest shareholder at the time. Starr filed lawsuit, to considerable public scorn, in November 2011.

But U.S. Judge Thomas Wheeler last month rejected the United States’ bid to dismiss the lawsuit, which seeks as much $50 billion in damages, saying that the case involved “complex financial and economic issues” that deserved analysis.

The other is whether the government was allowed to condition its first $85 billion loan on an equity stake in the company.

742,AIG,"UPDATE 2-Six years after AIG bailout, trial asks: was it legal?","(Adds details from lawyers’ opening statements, background on case) By Aruna Viswanatha WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - One of the more unusual trials to come out of the 2008 financial crisis began on Monday in front of a federal judge who is considering whether the U.S. government’s rescue of American International Group Inc  was, in fact, legal. In a case that explores the limits on U.S. government power in responding to major financial crises, the six-week trial is expected to revisit in detail the New York Federal Reserve’s September 2008 decision to extend a bailout package to AIG as the insurance giant was minutes from bankruptcy. The AIG bailout, on the heels of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, preceded the “too big to fail” auto and bank bailouts the federal government undertook during a U.S. financial crisis underpinned by faulty mortgage lending. The major players in that drama will be back on the Washington stage: former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and former Treasury secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry “Hank” Paulson are expected to testify. On Monday, a lawyer for a company owned by the insurance company’s former chief executive, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, set the scene by arguing that the government unlawfully sought to punish AIG shareholders with excessively harsh terms. There is “no precedent” and “no justification” for the New York Fed to demand a nearly 80 percent stake in the company in addition to a high interest rate for an $85 billion loan to AIG, star trial lawyer David Boies said in his opening remarks. The New York Fed cannot “ask for a benefit the agency is not authorized to demand,” Boies said. Greenberg, through his Starr International Co, was AIG’s largest shareholder at the time. Starr filed a lawsuit, to considerable public scorn, in November 2011. Government lawyers have defended the actions as appropriate, pointing out that the deal had been approved by the AIG board, as the company faced no other alternative to bankruptcy. On Monday a lawyer from the U.S. Department of Justice, Kenneth Dintzer, said AIG received assistance only because of the potential global consequences of the company filing for bankruptcy, and that the loan terms made sense given market conditions. “The goal was not to save AIG, it was to save the world from AIG,” Dintzer said. The trial is unfolding before U.S. Judge Thomas Wheeler, who last month rejected the United States’ bid to dismiss the lawsuit. He said the case, which seeks as much $50 billion in damages, involved “complex financial and economic issues” that deserved analysis. The case is before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which mainly deals with lawsuits from people arguing they are owed money by the U.S. government. The case poses two central questions. One is whether the government literally took $35 billion worth in AIG shares, and effectively paid only $500,000 for them. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prevents private property from being taken for public use without just compensation. The other is whether the government was allowed to condition its first $85 billion loan on an equity stake in the company. Starr’s lawyers have argued that the Federal Reserve Act does not allow the government to demand a stake in the company in exchange for the loan. On Monday Boies, who represented former Vice President Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court during the contested 2000 presidential election, said AIG’s treatment was not in line with assistance the New York Fed offered other financial institutions. Citigroup Inc, for example, received loans at a much lower interest rate without having to provide equity as collateral, he said, even though the government later accused the company of fraud in its mortgage securities business that fueled the crisis. “They say Citibank is the fraudster ... yet AIG is the only company they single out for punishment,” Boies said. Dintzer, the government’s lawyer, said the bailout in the end raised the value of AIG shares, and that policymakers had to consider “moral hazard” concerns when calculating its terms. “Shrinking a benefit to shareholders is not punishment, it is a benefit,” Dintzer said. AIG finished repaying the full $182.3 billion bailout in December 2012, leaving taxpayers with a profit of nearly $23 billion. Greenberg, 89, led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster. The trial’s first witness, Federal Reserve general counsel Scott Alvarez, took the stand on Monday morning, and was expected to continue testifying later in the afternoon.

744,AIG,"China's CIC, AVIC end talks to acquire Avolon-sources","Oct 1 (Reuters) - China Investment Corp (CIC) and AVIC Capital Co Ltd have ended talks to acquire Avolon Holdings Ltd, making it likely that the aircraft leasing company will pursue an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter. CIC, China’s sovereign wealth fund, and AVIC, a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense company, were in talks to acquire Avolon for between $4 billion and $5 billion, Reuters reported in August. AVIC subsequently confirmed the discussions, cautioning there was uncertainty over the potential deal. Avolon registered with financial regulators in June for an IPO in the United States. The sources said this week that the unsuccessful talks with the Chinese parties made the IPO the most realistic alternative for Avolon’s private equity owners to cash out on their investment. The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Avolon declined to comment, while CIC and AVIC could not immediately reached for comment. Avolon, which is backed by private equity firms Cinven Ltd, CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Oak Hill Capital Partners, as well as Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte, has been working with JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc on the IPO. Dublin-based Avalon provides aircraft leasing and lease management services to airlines and aircraft investors. It has a fleet of more than 200 aircraft serving 48 customers in 27 countries. Its customers include American Airlines Group Inc, Air France KLM SA and Ryanair Holdings Pc. It is not the first time that Chinese interest in such a company failed to lead to a deal. A Chinese consortium made an unsuccessful bid in 2012 to buy aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) from U.S. insurance giant American International Group Inc. That proposal deal fell apart and AIG ended up selling ILFC to AerCap Holdings NV. Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd , Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd and Japan’s Orix Corp were among the parties exploring bids for another Dublin-based lessor, Awas, that is owned by British private equity firm Terra Firma, Reuters reported last month.

745,AIG,Companies sign secret tax deals with Luxembourg: report,"(Reuters) - More than 300 companies, including PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, AIG Inc (AIG.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), secured secret deals from Luxembourg to slash their tax bills, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) reported, quoting leaked documents. The companies appear to have channeled hundreds of billions of dollars through Luxembourg and saved billions of dollars in taxes, the group of investigative journalists said, based on a review of nearly 28,000 pages of confidential documents.  The leaked documents reviewed by ICIJ journalists include hundreds of private tax rulings – known as comfort letters – that Luxembourg provides to corporations seeking favorable tax treatment. Luxembourg officials denied any “sweetheart deals” in its tax system. “The Luxembourg system of taxation is competitive – there is nothing unfair or unethical about it,” ICIJ quoted Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, as saying in an interview. Pepsi, AIG and Deutsche Bank were not immediately available for comment.    EU state aid regulators are investigating Amazon’s (AMZN.O) tax deals with Luxembourg, saying the arrangements could have underestimated the U.S. online retailer’s profits and given it an unfair advantage, Reuters reported in October.

746,AIG,Luxembourg tax storm hits new EU chief Juncker,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A storm of outrage over Luxembourg’s role in helping global companies avoid tax plunged its former leader into controversy in his first week running the European Commission, the EU body that polices tax abuses. Jean-Claude Juncker, 59, who took over as president of the EU executive after more than two decades as finance minister and prime minister of the tiny Grand Duchy, pulled out of a speaking engagement on Thursday. He repeated through a spokesman a remark made the previous day denying a conflict of interest and saying he would not hinder existing EU investigations of Luxembourg. And for all the sharp words from political opponents to his left, there seemed little threat to his five-year mandate. Many critics focused instead on calls for both Juncker and his successor in Luxembourg to follow through on commitments to change and to promote a level playing field for taxes in Europe and worldwide. Controversy over the role of Luxembourg (population half a million) as a low-tax conduit for corporate cash has long been a feature of Juncker’s political career. Some weeks ago, the Commission of his predecessor began investigations of tax deals struck there by web retailer Amazon and Italian carmaker Fiat. Ireland and Malta are also under scrutiny by EU antitrust investigators for possibly having offered some companies competitive advantages through sweetheart tax deals. However, the publication of documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists indicated more than 300 companies had secret deals to slash global tax bills - and that has turned up the heat on Luxembourg, and on Juncker “These revelations are a major blow to the credibility of new Commission president Junker and his capacity to act for the public interest,” said Sven Giegold, finance spokesman for the Greens in the European Parliament, who called Juncker “directly complicit in this mass corporate tax avoidance”. “The Commission must now set out a comprehensive action plan against tax dumping,” Giegold added. “Only by doing so can Juncker begin the path to redemption and try and dispel the doubts about his conflict of interest.” The chief Commission spokesman recalled Juncker’s words on Wednesday - “The Commission will do its work. I will refrain from intervening.” He also noted Juncker had committed himself to seeking a common EU framework for corporate taxation when he was campaigning for his job during May’s EU parliament election. The new competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, was pursuing inquiries into Luxembourg and may open further investigations, spokesman Margaritis Schinas said during nearly an hour of news conference questions on Juncker’s position.  “Mrs. Vestager will push this through to the end,” he said, adding that Juncker himself was “relaxed” amid the controversy. Vestager said that her office had yet to take a view on the legality of Luxembourg’s tax deals but vowed to “enforce state aid control in fair and justified manner”. Schinas characterized the examination of Luxembourg’s use of tax policy to bolster its economy as “typical” of investigations into a variety of governments’ use of incentives for industry. In some cases, those incentives were deemed illegal “state aid”.  Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who succeeded Juncker a year ago, said his country had not broken any rules and it was not alone in allowing tax schemes for big companies. [ID:nL6N0SW3V9]      Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna told reporters in Brussels that Luxembourg would work with other states to level the tax playing field: “The moment that there is a recognition in the international community that fiscal matters must be equitable and the information should be shared, then Luxembourg would have no problem going in the direction of more transparency.” He offered a defense of Juncker, saying it was wrong to single out “one politician for a particular period of time”. However, Britain’s euro-skeptical UK Independence Party did not miss the opportunity to target the new Commission chief personally, calling the tax affair “more proof that the EU elite protect their friends in high corporate places”. But more significant for Juncker’s ability to weather the storm may be a statement from his center-left opponent for the job, Martin Schulz, the speaker of the European Parliament: “I am confident that the European Commission will check the cases with regard to potential breaches of EU law and will take all appropriate actions swiftly and if necessary,” Schulz said. “What worries me most is the fact that the reported practices were manifestly legally possible,” the German Social Democrat said. “This reality means that we need to urge the member states to work with us to end systematic tax evasion practices in Europe, be it in Luxemburg or any other country.” ",11062014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-luxembourg-tax/luxembourg-tax-storm-hits-new-eu-chief-juncker-idUSKBN0IP30L20141106
747,AIG,UPDATE 3-Former AIG head Benmosche dies; led insurer after bailout,"(Adds family details and career history) By Luciana Lopez and Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Robert Benmosche, who took the helm of insurer American International Group after a massive government bailout at the height of the financial crisis, died on Friday at 70 after a battle with lung cancer. Benmosche is credited with steering AIG through the turbulent period following its near collapse and rescue by the U.S. government. During his tenure, which started in August 2009, AIG fully repaid the $182.3 billion government bailout it received in 2008 to stave off bankruptcy. Benmosche, who stepped down in September 2014, weathered intense scrutiny and was sharp-tongued at times, referring to federal officials as “those crazies down in Washington.” Critics often likened the former CEO, who also tangled with  then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo over bonuses paid to AIG staff after the bailout, to a bull in a china shop. “I can be - I can break things,” he said in an interview at his villa in Croatia in August 2009, when asked about his sometimes pugnacious manner shortly after taking the AIG job. That was about 11 months after the insurer was brought to its knees because of a unit that sold credit-default swap contracts on risky securities, as well as other investments in subprime mortgage-backed securities. Benmosche also often defended AIG employees from public criticism of the company and its role in the financial crisis, which helped trigger the worst recession in the United States in 70 years. “A lot of (employees) feel hurt, embarrassed, a lot of people have lived in fear because of what I call lynch mobs with pitchforks,” he said in the Reuters interview. That defense of AIG employees won him praise from his workers. After Benmosche was diagnosed with cancer in late 2010, employees would tear up when discussing his illness. “Bob was a brilliant man who brought tremendous leadership, energy, passion, and tenacity to his job. At AIG, we will honor his legacy by continuing to focus on integrity and performance. He will be deeply missed,” said Robert S. Miller, chairman of AIG’s board of directors. Benmosche was CEO of MetLife Inc from 1998 to 2006. He came out of retirement to lead AIG, which announced his death in a statement on Friday. Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, who built AIG into a global financial-services powerhouse during nearly 40 years at its helm, told Reuters on Friday that he had recommended Benmosche to the U.S. government when it was looking for a new chief. “He was a good man, strong, knowledgeable and honorable - everything we look for in a CEO,” said Greenberg, who was chair of AIG from 1967 to 2005, before being forced out. Benmosche said an AIG failure could be devastating for the United States and other countries. “Some of us need to come out of retirement - who have done this before - to help deal with the crisis,” Benmosche said to Reuters in 2009. “If I sit here, I just felt that there are going to be continuing problems. I felt I had some of the skills necessary to fix the problems of AIG in particular and it made sense to come back.” Benmosche, who had undergone treatment for lung cancer since 2010, announced his intention to leave AIG in June of last year. He did so in September, and was succeeded as president and CEO by Peter Hancock. Benmosche, who died at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, is survived by his wife Denise, three children, three siblings, and six grandchildren. The Brooklyn-born Benmosche prided himself on a reputation for toughness. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Alfred University in Alfred, New York, later serving in Korea as a lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps.

750,AIG,Fitch Revises AIG's Rating Outlook to Positive; Affirms 'A-' IDR,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed American International  Group, Inc.'s ratings, including the long-term IDR at 'A-'. Fitch has also  affirmed the ratings on AIG's senior debt obligations at 'BBB+'. Additionally,  Fitch has affirmed the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of AIG's rated  property/casualty insurance subsidiaries at 'A' and the IFS ratings of the  company's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries led by AGC Life Insurance Company at  'A+'.  Lastly, Fitch has revised AIG's Rating Outlook to Positive from Stable. A  complete list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  The Outlook revision to Positive reflects the improvement in AIG's capital  position and debt servicing capabilities over the past several years. Fitch  believes AIG's leverage metrics are now on par with higher rated peers. Improved  earnings within the insurance operations and reductions in interest expense have  led to better GAAP earnings-based interest coverage. Continued earnings  stability and coverage improvement are key factors considering towards future  rating upgrade actions. The ratings reflect AIG's long term success in restructuring and deleveraging  efforts. AIG is now an independent publicly held corporation with an operating  focus on global property/casualty insurance, domestic life insurance and  retirement products, and mortgage guaranty insurance. The 2014 sale of aircraft  leasing subsidiary International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) was a major  step in exiting non-insurance operations. AIG's financial leverage as measured by the ratio of financial debt and  preferred securities to total capital (excluding operating debt and the impact  of FAS 115) declined to 16% at year-end 2014 from 31% at year-end 2010. Fitch's  total financial commitment (TFC) ratio has also improved, to 0.5x at year-end  2014 from 2.5x at year-end 2010.  AIG's GAAP earnings-based interest coverage improved to 9.0x in 2014 from 6.7x  in 2013. Recent refinancing of higher cost debt with long term lower coupon  obligations will reduce interest expense further in 2015. AIG's ability to meet holding company obligations is primarily supported by  dividend capacity from the insurance subsidiaries. Cash distributions from  subsidiaries totaled $8.3 billion in 2014. The company has built a strong  holding company liquidity position that includes $6.9 billion of unencumbered  cash and investments at year end 2014, and $4.5 billion of available capacity  from credit and contingent liquidity facilities.  AIG property casualty subsidiary ratings consider the company's unique market  position in the global insurance market given its absolute size, underwriting  capabilities, and consolidated capital adequacy that is comparable to higher  rated peers. AIG's property casualty subsidiaries financial strength benefits  from the improvements in capital strength and liquidity of the parent holding  company.  Lower catastrophe losses and benefits from recent pricing underwriting and  portfolio repositioning actions led to profitability improvement in the last two  years for property casualty operations. Still, the GAAP property casualty  combined ratio of 102.2% in 2014 and 101.1% in 2013 is weaker than large  commercial insurer peers. Modest unfavorable annual loss reserve development  continues to affect AIG's performance.   The ratings of AIG's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are driven by these  entities' strong statutory capital position; leading market share in key lines  of business; diversification of revenues from insurance premiums, spread  business and fees; and solid operating profits and earnings stability.  Fitch expects the life subsidiaries' year-end 2014 RBC ratio will remain above  the company's long-term target range of between 425% to 470% as well as the  agency's median guideline for the current rating category. Additionally AIG's  operating and asset leverage metrics compare favorably to peers. Since 2012, AIG's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries have consistently generated  in excess of $4 billion in pre-tax operating earnings. Pretax operating income  declined modestly by 5% to $4.7 billion in 2014. This reflects lower returns on  alternative assets, higher general operating expenses and increases in  policyholder benefit reserves partially offset by higher fee income from VAs,  stable value wrap business and group retirement products driven by growth in  assets under management.  Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, AIG is  considered a systematically important financial institution (SIFI). Though  ultimate regulatory capital standards for SIFI's are still being formulated, AIG  now operates under a more rigorous compliance and governance framework that  entails greater disclosure and documentation requirements, as well as completion  of various regulatory stress-testing analyses. Completing these processes have  influenced the organization's overall risk management efforts and may help to  reduce future volatility in earnings and capital.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in GAAP earnings-based interest coverage to 10x or above; --No material changes in AIG's capital structure including maintenance of  financial leverage and total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio at current  levels as well as risk-based capital at the company's insurance subsidiaries; --Stable to improving overall operating earnings.  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade in the ratings of AIG's  property/casualty subsidiaries include:  --A shift to sustainable underwriting profitability, with greater loss reserve  stability or reserve redundancies.

751,AIG,Fitch Rates AIG's New Sr. Unsecured Notes 'BBB+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings assigns a rating of 'BBB+' to American  International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) new issuance of approximately $350 million  4.35% senior notes due 2045.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  This new issue is rated equivalent to the ratings of AIG's existing senior debt  and was sold in the Taiwan market. Proceeds from the issue will be used for  general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of existing debt.  AIG's financial leverage ratio continued to decline to 16.5% at yearend 2014  from 18.2% at yearend 2013. The company's consolidated outstanding debt fell  significantly in 2014 due to the retirement of hybrid debt, significant  reductions in operating debt and the elimination of debt related to the  completed sale of the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) aircraft  leasing operations in May 2014.  Lower interest costs on recently issued debt and recent stable earnings for  AIG's property/casualty and life & retirement operations have fostered an  improvement in interest coverage levels. AIG's interest coverage ratio improved  to 9.0x in 2014 from 6.7x in 2013. This new debt issuance follows $2 billion of new debt issued in January 2015 by  AIG. Financial leverage is not anticipated to rise materially in 2015 from this  new issuance as AIG has approximately $2.1 billion of financial and operating  debt maturing in 2015. Fitch affirmed the ratings of AIG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with  a Positive Outlook on March 2, 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in GAAP earnings-based interest coverage to 10x or above; --No material changes in AIG's capital structure including maintenance of  financial leverage and total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio at current  levels as well as risk-based capital at the company's insurance subsidiaries; --Stable to improving overall operating earnings.  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade in the ratings of AIG's  property/casualty subsidiaries include:  --A shift to sustainable underwriting profitability, with greater loss reserve  stability or reserve redundancies. Key triggers that could lead to a return to a Stable Outlook include:  --Increase in financial leverage to above 20%, or an increase in the TFC ratio  to above 0.7x;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries. Fitch assigns the following rating:  --USD350 million of 4.35% senior unsecured notes due 2045 'BBB+'.  Fitch currently rates the AIG entities as follows:  American International Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Various senior unsecured note issues 'BBB+'; --USD250 million of 2.375% subordinated notes due Aug. 24, 2015 'BBB'; --EUR61.8 million of 6.797% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2017 'BBB+'; --GBP537 million of 6.765% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2017 'BBB+'; --USD1 billion of 2.3% senior unsecured notes due July 16, 2019 'BBB+';  --USD1 billion of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due Aug. 15, 2020 'BBB+'; --USD1.286 billion of 6.4% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 15, 2020 'BBB+'; --USD1.5 billion of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due June 2022 'BBB+'; --USD1 billion of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due Feb. 15, 2024 'BBB+'; --USD256.161 million of 6.820% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2037 'BBB+'; --EUR56.6 million of 8.00% series A-7 junior subordinated debentures due May 22,  2038 'BBB-'; --USD 2.25 billion of 4.5% senior unsecured notes due July 16, 2044 'BBB+'; --USD2,832.3 billion of 8.175% series A-6 junior subordinated debentures due May  15, 2058 'BBB-'; --GBP172.6 million of 5.75% series A-2 junior subordinated debentures due March  15, 2067 'BBB-'; --EUR356.2 million of 4.875% series A-3 junior subordinated debentures due March  15, 2067 'BBB-'; --GBP84.1 million of 8.625% series A-8 junior subordinated debentures due May  22, 2068 'BBB-'; --USD496.2 million of 6.25% series A-1 junior subordinated debentures due March  15, 2087 'BBB-'; --USD113.2 million of 5.60% senior unsecured notes due July 31, 2097 'BBB+'.

752,AIG,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg in last-ditch bid to avoid trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a last-ditch effort to avoid trial, former American International Group Inc Chairman Maurice “Hank” Greenberg is seeking permission to ask New York’s highest court to throw out the accounting fraud case against him. Greenberg, who turns 90 next month, failed last week to persuade a mid-level state appeals court to dismiss the 2005 lawsuit, now led by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. On Tuesday, Greenberg’s lawyers asked that court for permission to appeal its unanimous decision to the top state court, the Court of Appeals. Schneiderman wants Greenberg to forfeit millions of dollars in alleged ill-gotten bonuses from AIG, which he led for nearly four decades, and banned from the securities industry and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Greenberg made his request the day before closing arguments are expected in the federal Court of Claims in Washington, D.C., in a separate lawsuit claiming the government shortchanged his Starr International insurance company, largest shareholder in AIG when it was bailed out in 2008. In the state case against Greenberg, the Court of Appeals needs to decide whether the law allows Schneiderman to seek the penalties he wants, his lawyers argued. Greenberg was released from claims by AIG, which paid the bonuses, they pointed out. “Leaving these legal issues unresolved undermines New York’s status as a financial capital,” Greenberg’s lawyers said. Greenberg’s co-defendant, former AIG chief financial officer Howard Smith, joined the motion to the Appellate Division, First Judicial Department in Manhattan. The state is also seeking Smith’s bonus money and to ban him from certain roles. As an alternative, the executives requested an opportunity to reargue the case to the mid-level appeals court. Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said the attorney general would oppose the latest effort to delay the trial. He later added that Justice Charles Ramos of Manhattan state Supreme Court on Tuesday set June 25 as the trial date. Greenberg and Smith are accused of trying to hide losses at AIG through fraudulent transactions, including with a reinsurance unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc . Schneiderman has pursued the case despite dropping claims for as much as $6 billion in damages in the wake of a class action settlement. He wants to recoup roughly $55 million of bonuses and interest covering the 2000-2005 period when the fraud allegedly took place.

756,AIG,"U.S bailout of AIG in 2008 was 'punitive,' ex-CEO's lawyer says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government was “punitive” in its bailout of American International Group Inc in 2008, a lawyer for the company’s former chief executive argued during closing arguments of a trial that may impact how much flexibility regulators will have when they respond to future financial crises. Former AIG Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, who was in court on Wednesday for the first time during the trial, is seeking to convince a federal judge that the U.S. government’s rescue terms for the New York-based insurance giant to save it from bankruptcy cheated its shareholders. “They were punitive to AIG because someone had to be a political scapegoat,” Greenberg’s lawyer, star litigator David Boies, said on Wednesday in his closing arguments, which followed six weeks of testimony last fall. He said the government had singled out AIG and tried to “demonize” the company. Greenberg, 89, through his Starr International Co, was AIG’s largest shareholder with a 12 percent stake before the bailout in September 2008. AIG’s problems stemmed from insurance it wrote on billions of dollars worth of shoddy mortgage securities. Greenberg sued the U.S. government in 2011, arguing that the New York Federal Reserve’s initial $85 billion loan package, which carried an interest rate of 14 percent and a nearly 80 percent U.S. stake in AIG, was an illegal takeover from shareholders. Lawyers for the U.S. government countered that the bailout, which ultimately rose to $182.3 billion, raised the value of AIG shares and that policymakers had to consider “moral hazard” concerns when calculating its terms. “If the Fed had wanted to harm AIG in some way, all it had to do was nothing,” Justice Department lawyer Kenneth Dintzer said, insisting that the government stepped in because the private sector deemed such a loan “too risky.” AIG finished repaying the bailout in December 2012, leaving taxpayers with a nearly $23 billion profit. On Tuesday, Greenberg made a last-ditch effort to avoid trial in a lawsuit brought against him by New York state which accuses him and Howard Smith, a former AIG financial officer, of accounting fraud at AIG from 2000 to 2005. Greenberg, who led AIG for almost four decades until 2005, is seeking as much as $50 billion in damages on behalf of AIG shareholders. The suit won class-action status two years ago.

758,AIG,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg in last-ditch bid to avoid trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a last-ditch effort to avoid trial, former American International Group Inc Chairman Maurice “Hank” Greenberg is seeking permission to ask New York’s highest court to throw out the accounting fraud case against him. Greenberg, who turns 90 next month, failed last week to persuade a mid-level state appeals court to dismiss the 2005 lawsuit, now led by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. On Tuesday, Greenberg’s lawyers asked that court for permission to appeal its unanimous decision to the top state court, the Court of Appeals. Schneiderman wants Greenberg to forfeit millions of dollars in alleged ill-gotten bonuses from AIG, which he led for nearly four decades, and banned from the securities industry and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Greenberg made his request the day before closing arguments are expected in the federal Court of Claims in Washington, D.C., in a separate lawsuit claiming the government shortchanged his Starr International insurance company, largest shareholder in AIG when it was bailed out in 2008. In the state case against Greenberg, the Court of Appeals needs to decide whether the law allows Schneiderman to seek the penalties he wants, his lawyers argued. Greenberg was released from claims by AIG, which paid the bonuses, they pointed out. “Leaving these legal issues unresolved undermines New York’s status as a financial capital,” Greenberg’s lawyers said.  Greenberg’s co-defendant, former AIG chief financial officer Howard Smith, joined the motion to the Appellate Division, First Judicial Department in Manhattan. The state is also seeking Smith’s bonus money and to ban him from certain roles. As an alternative, the executives requested an opportunity to reargue the case to the mid-level appeals court.  Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said the attorney general would oppose the latest effort to delay the trial.  He later added that Justice Charles Ramos of Manhattan state Supreme Court on Tuesday set June 25 as the trial date. Greenberg and Smith are accused of trying to hide losses at AIG through fraudulent transactions, including with a reinsurance unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Schneiderman has pursued the case despite dropping claims for as much as $6 billion in damages in the wake of a class action settlement.  He wants to recoup roughly $55 million of bonuses and interest covering the 2000-2005 period when the fraud allegedly took place.

759,AIG,"U.S bailout of AIG in 2008 was 'punitive,' ex-CEO's lawyer says","WASHINGTON, April 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. government was “punitive” in its bailout of American International Group Inc in 2008, a lawyer for the company’s former chief executive argued during closing arguments of a trial that may impact how much flexibility regulators will have when they respond to future financial crises. Former AIG Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, who was in court on Wednesday for the first time during the trial, is seeking to convince a federal judge that the U.S. government’s rescue terms for the New York-based insurance giant to save it from bankruptcy cheated its shareholders. “They were punitive to AIG because someone had to be a political scapegoat,” Greenberg’s lawyer, star litigator David Boies, said on Wednesday in his closing arguments, which followed six weeks of testimony last fall. He said the government had singled out AIG and tried to “demonize” the company. Greenberg, 89, through his Starr International Co, was AIG’s largest shareholder with a 12 percent stake before the bailout in September 2008. AIG’s problems stemmed from insurance it wrote on billions of dollars worth of shoddy mortgage securities. Greenberg sued the U.S. government in 2011, arguing that the New York Federal Reserve’s initial $85 billion loan package, which carried an interest rate of 14 percent and a nearly 80 percent U.S. stake in AIG, was an illegal takeover from shareholders.

760,AIG,AIG in $40 mln accord over crisis-era retirement plan losses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc  has reached a $40 million settlement of claims it should not have let employees invest their retirement savings in company stock as the insurer headed into the 2008 financial crisis, which nearly caused its collapse. The preliminary settlement was filed on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, which must approve the accord. It resolves claims that AIG caused the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of retirement savings by imprudently offering company stock as an investment option in retirement plans such as the AIG Incentive Savings Plan and the American General Agents’ and Managers’ Thrift Plan. Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the settlement one of the largest under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, stemming from the financial crisis. AIG denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Its insurance carriers are expected to fund the settlement. AIG reached a $960 million settlement of shareholder litigation related to the crisis last August. Once the largest U.S. insurer by market value, AIG narrowly avoided collapse after making bad bets on mortgage debt through hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps. Huge losses led to a bailout that began in Sept. 2008, which at one point gave the government a 92 percent stake, and caused AIG’s share price to bottom at around 35 cents in March 2009.

AIG finished repaying the bailout in 2012, leaving U.S. taxpayers with a nearly $23 billion profit.

Former AIG CEO Greenberg, through his company Starr International Co, sued the U.S. government in 2011, arguing the terms of the initial $85 billion loan package were unduly onerous, including an almost 80 percent U.S. stake in AIG. Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of Greenberg on the issue of law, but Greenberg had sought as much as $50 billion in damages on behalf of Starr and about 270,000 other shareholders.

776,AIG,Ex-AIG CEO Greenberg says will appeal bailout ruling,"WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - Former American International Group chief executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg will appeal a U.S. judge’s ruling that awarded him and other shareholders no damages over the company’s 2008 bailout, his company Starr International Co said in a statement on Tuesday. Judge Thomas Wheeler of the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C. on Monday sided with Greenberg on a key legal claim, but refused Starr International’s request for up to $50 billion in damages on behalf of Starr and about 270,000 other shareholders. Starr, which was AIG’s largest shareholder at the time of the bailout with a 12 percent stake, said in a statement it will ask an appeals court to “confirm that the government is not entitled to keep billions of dollars of citizens’ money in its pocket.” Greenberg sued the U.S. government in 2011 arguing federal officials acted illegally in the initial $85 billion loan package to the stricken company, which included an interest rate of 14 percent and taking a nearly 80 percent stake. But Judge Wheeler wrote in his decision that no compensation was owed as without the government’s intervention, AIG would have filed for bankruptcy. Greenberg, who was ousted from AIG in 2005 after almost four decades at the helm, is due shortly to face trial in a separate lawsuit brought against him by New York state, which accuses him and Howard Smith, a former AIG financial officer, of accounting fraud at AIG from 2000 to 2005.

The appellate division, a mid-level New York state court, on Thursday granted Greenberg’s request to appeal its April 16 ruling that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman could pursue his bid to ban Greenberg from the securities industry, impose an officer and director ban, and recoup bonuses. Greenberg, 90, was sued in 2005 by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for arranging fraudulent transactions at AIG that boosted the insurer’s loss reserves by $500 million. Schneiderman later inherited the lawsuit, but was forced to drop damages claims as high as $6 billion. Greenberg has called the remaining case a waste of taxpayer money, after he and other defendants reached a $115 million settlement with shareholders that won court approval in 2013. Schneiderman has said his lawsuit is needed to help ensure that executives who commit fraud are held publicly accountable. The April 16 ruling was 5-0. Greenberg and co-defendant Howard Smith, a former AIG chief financial officer, did not have an automatic right to appeal. Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, declined to comment.

The case is separate from an appeal by Greenberg’s Starr International Co to a judge’s ruling on Monday over the federal government’s 2008 bailout of AIG.

780,AIG,"AIG profit beats estimates, boosts buyback by $5 bln","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, reported a quarterly operating profit that breezed past analysts’ estimates, and boosted its share buyback by up to $5 billion. Shares of the company, which more than doubled its quarterly dividend, were slightly higher in volatile after-market trading on Monday. The results were primarily driven by investments in one of China’s biggest insurers and earnings from the insurer’s stake in aircraft lessor AerCap, but lower underwriting at most of its units caused concern. S&P; Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said AIG only beat because of income from a company it had essentially taken off its balance sheet.     AIG, which has been trying to exit AerCap Holdings NV (AER.N), sold most of its 46 percent stake in the world’s largest independent aircraft leasing company in June. Pretax earnings from AerCap more than doubled to $127 million in the second quarter ended June, helping push AIG’s operating income after tax to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share. AIG, which traces its roots to a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People’s Insurance Group of China Ltd (1339.HK) and its subsidiary, PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd (2328.HK). Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.22 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Underwriting income fell in all of the company’s units, except retirement insurance. “I found the insurance underwriting results fairly disappointing across the board and I’m hoping they don’t portend a broader-based weakness,” analyst Seifert said. Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent to $1.19 billion at the commercial property and casualty insurance business, traditionally AIG’s forte, as the unit struggled with plummeting rates.  Industry rates for commercial property and casualty insurance fell for the third quarter in a row, according to a survey published last month by the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers. AIG also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N), which vies with AIG for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit as catastrophe losses halved. The combined ratio at AIG’s property and casualty unit inched up during the quarter to 98.8 percent from 96.5 percent.  A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. AIG raised its quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share. The company’s shares closed at $64.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The iPhone maker’s shares fell as much as 4.4 percent to $113.25, slipping firmly below their 200-day daily moving average, a key technical level closely watched by traders. The stock was also the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes.

Netflix, on the other hand, was on a tear. Its stock surged as much as 9.1 percent to a record high of $122.79, valuing the company well above $50 billion. Earnings reports on Tuesday were a mixed bag. With a bulk of the S&P; 500 companies having reported results, investors are taking to the sidelines ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs data. The report is seen critical for the market as it is expected to provide clues on the timing of a rate hike. The U.S. economy is expected to have created 223,000 new jobs in July, on par with June, according to economists polled by Reuters. “Given the importance of such a big number, investors are taking a wait-and-see approach,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. Wall Street ended lower on Monday as tumbling oil prices dragged energy shares to a three-year low and factory data from China raised concerns about the world’s second-biggest economy.

The iPhone maker’s shares fell as much as 4.4 percent to $113.25, slipping firmly below their 200-day daily moving average, a key technical level closely watched by traders. The stock was also the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes. While there was no clear trigger for the selloff, traders said worries over China slowdown and skepticism over demand for iPhone 6s were likely to keep the stock under pressure. With a bulk of the S&P; 500 companies having reported results, investors are taking to the sidelines ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs data. The report is shaping up to be critical for the market as it can provide clues on the timing of a rate hike. The U.S. economy created 225,000 new jobs in July, according to economists polled by Reuters. “Given the importance of such a big numbers, investors are taking a wait-and-see approach,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. Wall Street ended lower on Monday as tumbling oil prices dragged energy shares to a three-year low and factory data from China raised concerns about the world’s second-biggest economy. In the United States, consumer spending recorded its smallest gain in four months, while the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector slowed in July.

The Fed, which has kept interest rates near zero for nearly a decade, has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy.

789,AIG,"AIG profit beats estimates, boosts buyback by $5 billion","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, reported a quarterly operating profit that breezed past analysts’ estimates, and boosted its share buyback by up to $5 billion. Shares of the company, which more than doubled its quarterly dividend, were slightly higher in volatile after-market trading on Monday. The results were primarily driven by investments in one of China’s biggest insurers and earnings from the insurer’s stake in aircraft lessor AerCap, but lower underwriting at most of its units caused concern. S&P; Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said AIG only beat because of income from a company it had essentially taken off its balance sheet.     AIG, which has been trying to exit AerCap Holdings NV (AER.N), sold most of its 46 percent stake in the world’s largest independent aircraft leasing company in June. Pretax earnings from AerCap more than doubled to $127 million in the second quarter ended June, helping push AIG’s operating income after tax to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share. AIG, which traces its roots to a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People’s Insurance Group of China Ltd (1339.HK) and its subsidiary, PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd (2328.HK). Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.22 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Underwriting income fell in all of the company’s units, except retirement insurance. “I found the insurance underwriting results fairly disappointing across the board and I’m hoping they don’t portend a broader-based weakness,” analyst Seifert said. Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent to $1.19 billion at the commercial property and casualty insurance business, traditionally AIG’s forte, as the unit struggled with plummeting rates.  Industry rates for commercial property and casualty insurance fell for the third quarter in a row, according to a survey published last month by the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers. AIG also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N), which vies with AIG for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit as catastrophe losses halved. The combined ratio at AIG’s property and casualty unit inched up during the quarter to 98.8 percent from 96.5 percent.  A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. AIG raised its quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share. The company’s shares closed at $64.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.

790,AIG,U.S. government appeals judge's ruling over 2008 AIG bailout,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States filed an appeal on Wednesday against a U.S. judge’s ruling in June that sided with former American International Group chief executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg on a legal claim over the company’s 2008 bailout. A judge in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C. found that the U.S. Federal Reserve exceeded its authority in the insurer’s bailout, and the government had been expected to appeal in order to preserve a robust shield against legal challenges to their responses in future financial crises. Greenberg had sought up to $50 billion in damages, but was not awarded a penny after Judge Thomas Wheeler also found that without the government’s intervention, AIG would have filed for bankruptcy. The government is appealing to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Starr International Co, which was AIG’s largest shareholder at the time of the bailout, has also appealed. It argued for damages and a reversal on other claims dismissed by Wheeler. Greenberg, 90, was ousted from AIG in 2005 after almost four decades at the helm. Through his firm, Starr International Co, Greenberg sued the U.S. government in 2011. He argued federal officials acted illegally in the initial $85 billion loan package to the stricken company.

793,AIG,AIG seeking $1.76 billion in 'life settlements' trial in New York,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An American International Group Inc (AIG.N) unit on Thursday asked a federal judge to order a Pennsylvania firm to pay it $1.76 billion in damages for allegedly overcharging for life insurance policies acquired from elderly individuals. At the outset of a trial in Manhattan federal court, a lawyer for AIG’s Lavastone Capital accused Coventry First of artificially inflating the price of about 300 such policies, known as “life settlements,” and using a network of subsidiaries to conceal the markups. “This is a racketeering scheme so audacious it would make the mob blush,” Randy Mastro said in his opening statement. But Heidi Hubbard, a lawyer for Coventry, said AIG had been aware that Coventry was selling certain policies at a gain and never objected. “There is no fraud if the people handling this business on a day-to-day basis understand and accept the practice that AIG is now challenging,” she said. Investors who acquire the policies on the secondary market pay the premiums and then collect the payout when the individuals die. Coventry, founded by Philadelphia philanthropist Alan Buerger, is the “leader and creator” of the life settlement industry, according to its website. AIG bought nearly 7,000 life settlements from Coventry with a total face value of $20 billion. Coventry caused Lavastone to pay more than $150 million in hidden markups and fee overcharges, including broker’s fees it did not incur, Mastro said. But Hubbard said Coventry had a “reasonable belief” that its agreement with AIG did not preclude it from acquiring some policies and then selling them to AIG at a profit, and that AIG executives understood that. AIG said it is already entitled to more than $250 million in damages, including interest, based on pretrial rulings from Rakoff that found Coventry liable on certain breach of contract claims. AIG is also seeking to have Coventry disgorge all of the fees it collected, including legitimate payments for undisputed policies, as well as to impose triple damages under the civil racketeering statute. AIG stopped acquiring life settlements in 2011, although it continues to hold about 5,000 policies, regulatory filings show. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff is overseeing the trial without a jury.

796,AIG,"U.S. court rejects AIG, Bank of NY Mellon tax credit appeals","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday rejected efforts by American International Group Inc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign tax credits that the Internal Revenue Service did not allow. By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York dismissed arguments that the federal government, through the IRS, tried to tax both companies twice by denying them credits on taxes paid to foreign governments. Circuit Judge Denny Chin said the transactions at issue were “most appropriately characterized as shams” under applicable law, known as the “economic substance” doctrine, because they were taken to avoid taxes, and appeared to offer little or no potential for financial gain. AIG declined to comment. Bank of New York Mellon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Both companies are based in New York. U.S. law lets companies take credits for income taxes paid to foreign governments. The IRS has called foreign tax credit abuse among its top compliance concerns for big companies. AIG had sought $48.2 million of credits for 1997, following several cross-border transactions in which the insurer borrowed $1.6 billion and reinvested it at higher rates, ostensibly to make a profit, court papers show. Chin, however, said AIG’s calculation of $168.8 million of pre-tax profit over the life of the transactions did not take into account various taxes paid and tax credits claimed, and that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the transactions accomplished little. Meanwhile, court papers show that Bank of New York Mellon had sought $200 million of credits for 2001 and 2002 tied to a Barclays Plc product known as STARS, in which it obtained a low-rate $1.5 billion loan whose proceeds it reinvested at higher rates. Chin, however, said the “circular cash flow” arising from STARS suggested that the bank entered the “extremely convoluted” arrangement to maximize U.S. and U.K. tax benefits. Wednesday’s decision upheld rulings denying tax credits to AIG by U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton, and to Bank of New York Mellon by former U.S. Tax Court Judge Diane Kroupa.

800,AIG,AIG wins narrowing of shareholder lawsuits over 2008 bailout,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday narrowed several lawsuits against American International Group Inc  by shareholders who opted out of the $970.5 million class-action settlement that she approved in March over the insurer’s 2008 bailout. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan dismissed claims that she said were brought too late against AIG in the six “opt-out” lawsuits, which were filed between November 2011 and February 2015. She rejected the argument by plaintiffs that the filing of the shareholder class action gave them more time to pursue their own claims, without running afoul of statutes of limitation. Swain also dismissed claims brought under state common law. The six lawsuits did not all raise the same claims against AIG, which is based in New York. AIG spokesman Jon Diat said: “We are pleased with the decision.” As in the class action, opt-out shareholders claimed that AIG misled them about its subprime mortgage exposure and the risks that the insurer took in credit default swaps, culminating in $182.3 billion of federal bailouts. The shareholders include the Kuwait Investment Authority, the Teachers Retirement System of the State of Illinois, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Ltd, the University of California, and various General Electric and Lord Abbett investment funds. Plaintiffs often file opt-out lawsuits if they believe they can recover more by suing individually rather than in a class. Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer for the Kuwait fund, said Swain’s decision “has no effect on our client,” which filed the earliest of the opt-out lawsuits. Lawyers for the other plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Other defendants who won dismissals of various claims include former AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan; Joseph Cassano, who oversaw the CDS portfolio; and various executives and board members.

801,AIG,AIG wins narrowing of shareholder lawsuits over 2008 bailout,"NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday narrowed several lawsuits against American International Group Inc by shareholders who opted out of the $970.5 million class-action settlement that she approved in March over the insurer’s 2008 bailout. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan dismissed claims that she said were brought too late against AIG in the six “opt-out” lawsuits, which were filed between November 2011 and February 2015. She rejected the argument by plaintiffs that the filing of the shareholder class action gave them more time to pursue their own claims, without running afoul of statutes of limitation. Swain also dismissed claims brought under state common law. The six lawsuits did not all raise the same claims against AIG, which is based in New York. AIG spokesman Jon Diat said: “We are pleased with the decision.” As in the class action, opt-out shareholders claimed that AIG misled them about its subprime mortgage exposure and the risks that the insurer took in credit default swaps, culminating in $182.3 billion of federal bailouts. The shareholders include the Kuwait Investment Authority, the Teachers Retirement System of the State of Illinois, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Ltd, the University of California, and various General Electric and Lord Abbett investment funds. Plaintiffs often file opt-out lawsuits if they believe they can recover more by suing individually rather than in a class. Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer for the Kuwait fund, said Swain’s decision “has no effect on our client,” which filed the earliest of the opt-out lawsuits. Lawyers for the other plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Other defendants who won dismissals of various claims include former AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan; Joseph Cassano, who oversaw the CDS portfolio; and various executives and board members. The bailouts left taxpayers with a nearly 80 percent stake in AIG, which the government later sold off, resulting in a $22.7 billion return. The cases are all in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. They are Kuwait Investment Authority v.

802,AIG,Fitch Expects to Rate AIG's New Sr. Unsecured Notes 'BBB+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a rating of 'BBB+'  to American International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) $420 million issuance of 4.9%  senior notes due 2045. Proceeds from this new issue will be used for general  corporate purposes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS This new issue is rated equivalent to the ratings of AIG's existing senior debt,  and was sold in the Taiwan market. AIG completed offerings of 30-year notes in  Taiwan in March 2015 ($350 million) and July 2015 ($290 million). Financial leverage as measured by the ratio of financial debt and preferred  securities to total capital (excluding operating debt and the impact of FAS 115)  was 17.5% at June 30, 2015, up from 16.5% at year-end 2014. Pro forma financial  leverage adjusting for the new issuance, the July 2015 repurchase of $3.4  billion of AIG parent debt, and prior third-quarter 2015 issuances of $2.79  billion of senior debt is 17.5%.  Fitch affirmed the ratings of AIG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with  a Positive Outlook on Sept. 1, 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in GAAP earnings-based interest coverage to 10x or above; --No material changes in AIG's capital structure, including maintenance of  financial leverage and total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio at current  levels as well as risk-based capital at the company's insurance subsidiaries; --Stable-to-improving overall operating earnings.  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade to the ratings of AIG's  property/casualty subsidiaries include:  --A shift to sustainable underwriting profitability, with greater loss reserve  stability or reserve redundancies. Key triggers that could lead to a return to a Stable Outlook include:  --Increase in financial leverage to above 20%, or an increase in the TFC ratio  to above 0.7x from 0.5 currently;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch expects to assign the following rating:  --USD420 million of 4.9% senior unsecured notes due Sept. 25, 2045 'BBB+'.

804,AIG,UPDATE 4-AIG to sell unit to Arch Capital for $3.4 bln,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc said on Monday it would sell its mortgage-guaranty unit to Arch Capital Group Ltd for about $3.4 billion. AIG, the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, said it would get $2.2 billion in cash, $250 million in Arch Capital’s perpetual preferred stock and $975 million in non-voting common-equivalent preferred stock from the sale of United Guaranty Corp. The Wall Street Journal first reported AIG’s deal with Bermuda-based Arch Capital earlier on Monday, citing sources. AIG said in January it would spin off the mortgage insurance unit, cut jobs and sell its broker-dealer network as part of a sweeping overhaul promised to shareholders to fend off activist investor Carl Icahn. Later in March, United Guaranty filed for an initial public offering of up to $100 million with U.S. regulators. Icahn, whose representative secured a board seat at AIG earlier this year, has been pushing the insurer to split itself into three smaller companies. The billionaire saw it as a way for the company to shed its designation as a systemically important financial institution, which would free the company from having to comply with stricter capital requirements. The insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly operating profit earlier this month, driven by lower costs and strong underwriting. Shares of Arch Capital and AIG were unchanged in after-market trading on Monday. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC advised AIG on the deal. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP was its legal adviser. Arch’s financial adviser was Credit Suisse Group AG, with Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP and Clyde & Co acting as legal counsel.

835,AIG,AIG joins list of finance firms looking at moving some UK operations,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. insurer AIG (AIG.N) may move its European headquarters from London to another European Union country because of Britain’s vote to leave the EU, the head of the AIG’s European and UK operations said at an industry conference on Tuesday. AIG joins a growing list of finance industry companies that have said they may have to shift some operations to continental Europe to maintain links to customers after Brexit. Speaking at the same conference, trade minister Mark Garnier said the government was listening to the financial industry’s concerns over Brexit. “We will aim to limit uncertainty surrounding business,” Garnier said. “The government fully understands the implications of Brexit for the financial services industry,” Garnier told insurance trade body ABI’s annual conference. Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain fear losing access to the EU’s single market, and a damaging “cliff edge” effect of leaving the bloc if there are no transitional arrangements ahead of any new trading terms agreed with the EU. Anthony Baldwin, chief executive of AIG’s European and UK arms, said the group might decide in the coming year to move its European head office from London to an EU country after Brexit, though it would still maintain a big London hub. AIG has around 2,500 staff in Britain. Baldwin told reporters on the sidelines of the conference he was looking at half a dozen locations, including Dublin, though the impact on staffing would not be material if the headquarters moved out of London. “At a certain point in time you have to pull the trigger in the absence of any clarity on where negotiations are going with the transition period,” Baldwin told the conference. “We will always continue to have a big London hub but we might have a European headquarters elsewhere,” he said. Baldwin said AIG has experience of moving operations after shifting its European head office from Paris to London five years ago. About a couple of hundred jobs were moved. “We know what it takes,” Baldwin said, adding the process had taken around 18 months. The Lloyd’s of London insurance market, underwriters Hiscox (HSX.L) and Beazley BEZG.L, and motor insurer Admiral (ADML.L) have also said they might shift operations from London to centers like Dublin. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said the insurance industry should not moan about the Brexit vote, but instead engage with politicians to find a way forward and minimize risks to the sector. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will start formal divorce talks with the EU by the end of March. “That timetable has not changed,” Garnier said.

839,AIG,U.S. Supreme Court rejects AIG ex-CEO Hank Greenberg's appeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected former American International Group CEO Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s bid to escape civil fraud charges in New York accusing him of orchestrating sham transactions at the insurer. The justices left in place a June ruling by the New York Court of Appeals that his trial on charges brought by the New York Attorney General’s Office could proceed. The non-jury trial of Greenberg, 91, started in September. He has already testified in his own defense. But the parties agreed at the end of November to put the trial on hold until January while they enter into mediation aimed at resolving the case.  Greenberg’s lawyers declined to comment on the Supreme Court action. A spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had no immediate comment. Greenberg led the New York-based insurance giant for four decades before he was ousted in 2005. The following year, AIG (AIG.N) paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes into its business practices. He has asserted that the case should have been over in 2013 when a $115 million settlement with AIG shareholders over  improper accounting received court approval. New York was forced to drop its damages claims because of that decision. Justice Charles Ramos of New York state court in Manhattan is presiding over Greenberg’s trial, and in September began directly questioning Greenberg. The appeals court also ruled in June that the state could seek to recoup from Greenberg and co-defendant Howard Smith, AIG’s former chief financial officer, tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and interest covering the 2000-2005 period when the alleged fraud occurred. More than $55 million may be at stake. In addition, the court said the state could seek to ban Greenberg and Smith from the securities industry and from serving as officers or directors of public companies. Greenberg currently is chairman and CEO of CV Starr & Co, a private insurance company. Smith is its vice chairman of finance. AIG was rescued by the U.S. government in September 2008 to stave off bankruptcy after the company ran up billions of dollars in losses stemming from insurance it wrote on shoddy mortgage securities. The case was brought under the Martin Act, the 1921 New York law that former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer revived in the early 2000s to go after major financial institutions. In November, Schneiderman raised concerns that President-elect Donald Trump would seek to weaken the state law. At issue are two transactions, the first concerning General Re, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. The suit claims Greenberg orchestrated a $500 million transaction that boosted loss reserves without transferring risk. The second transaction, with Capco Reinsurance Co, allegedly hid a $210 million underwriting loss in an auto-warranty program.

841,AIG,FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show,"(Adds more models, details) Jan 9 (Reuters) - Global automakers kicked off 2017 displaying a wide array of future vehicles at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage. Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14. * Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company’s U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan’s response to U.S. consumers’ growing preference for SUVs of all sizes. * Kia Motors Co Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017. * Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand’s “flagship” model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX. * BMW 5-series. BMW AG has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept. * Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation’s grandchildren, Honda Motor Co  debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year. * Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available. * Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co highlighted two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee. * Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years got a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction. * Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. Daimler AG’s  mainstream brand has redesigned its mid-size E Class Coupe. It also showed a facelifted version of the GLA compact crossover, as well as a redesigned Smart Electric Drive. * Audi Q8. Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG showed a concept of a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. It is also unveiling a facelifted version of its SQ5 mid-size SUV and redesigned A5 cabriolet. * Volkswagen Tiguan. The mid-size Tiguan crossover utility vehicle has been redesigned. VW is also displaying yet another revival of its classic Microbus, this time as a battery-powered electric concept called I.D. Buzz. * Infiniti QX50. Nissan’s luxury brand is showing a concept version of its redesigned QX50 mid-size SUV. * GMC Terrain. The brand’s compact SUV gets its first major redesign, sharing major components with the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox.

843,AIG,AIG to pay Buffett's Berkshire about $10 bln in insurance deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc  has agreed to pay roughly $10.2 billion to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc to take on many long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it has already written. The reinsurance transaction covers “long-tail” exposures, which are liabilities that emerge long after policies are issued, from excess casualty, workers compensation and other AIG policies issued before last year. Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co unit, led by Buffett’s reinsurance chief Ajit Jain, will take on 80 percent of net losses in excess of the first $25 billion, with a maximum liability of $20 billion. AIG said the payment comprises $9.8 billion plus interest since Jan. 1, 2016, and will be made by June 30. The transaction helps AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock lower risk at his New York-based insurer, which has reduced exposures and shed businesses since its 2008 federal bailout, and frees up capital for share buybacks. “This decisive step enables us to focus firmly on the future,” with “additional risk capacity to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders,” Hancock said in a statement. For Buffett, the transaction boosts how much his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate can invest, including stocks and whole companies. Berkshire’s float, which helps fund growth and reflects the premiums collected upfront before claims are paid, totaled $91 billion on Sept. 30. In a research note, Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said the transaction’s long-term economics should be “attractive” for Berkshire. But Gelb and UBS analyst Brian Meredith said the transaction may signal lingering problems in AIG’s portfolio, even after a $3.6 billion charge in late 2015. “This announcement indicates that there may be more pain left,” wrote Meredith, who rates AIG “neutral.” Gelb rates it “overweight.” Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.

844,AIG,AIG to pay Buffett's Berkshire about $10 billion in insurance deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) has agreed to pay roughly $10.2 billion to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) to take on many long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it has already written. The reinsurance transaction covers “long-tail” exposures, which are liabilities that emerge long after policies are issued, from excess casualty, workers compensation and other AIG policies issued before last year. Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co unit, led by Buffett’s reinsurance chief Ajit Jain, will take on 80 percent of net losses in excess of the first $25 billion, with a maximum liability of $20 billion. AIG said the payment comprises $9.8 billion plus interest since Jan. 1, 2016, and will be made by June 30. The transaction helps AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock lower risk at his New York-based insurer, which has reduced exposures and shed businesses since its 2008 federal bailout, and frees up capital for share buybacks. “This decisive step enables us to focus firmly on the future,” with “additional risk capacity to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders,” Hancock said in a statement. For Buffett, the transaction boosts how much his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate can invest, including stocks and whole companies. Berkshire’s float, which helps fund growth and reflects the premiums collected upfront before claims are paid, totaled $91 billion on Sept. 30. In a research note, Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said the transaction’s long-term economics should be “attractive” for Berkshire. But Gelb and UBS analyst Brian Meredith said the transaction may signal lingering problems in AIG’s portfolio, even after a $3.6 billion charge in late 2015. “This announcement indicates that there may be more pain left,” wrote Meredith, who rates AIG “neutral.” Gelb rates it “overweight.” Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.

848,AIG,"After 12 years, ex-AIG chief Greenberg settles accounting fraud case","(Reuters) - Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) chief executive, has reached a settlement that ends his 12-year battle with the New York attorney general’s office, which accused him of orchestrating sham transactions at the insurer.   “After over a decade of delays, deflections and denials by Mr. Greenberg, we are pleased that Mr. Greenberg has finally admitted to his role in these fraudulent transactions,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. Greenberg, 91, will pay about $9 million and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith will pay about $900,000 to settle charges first brought in 2005 by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The former executives were accused of overseeing a $500 million transaction with General Re, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), that boosted AIG loss reserves. They were also faulted for a transaction with Capco Reinsurance Co that converted a $210 million underwriting loss from an automotive warranty program into an investment loss. “I knew these facts at the time I initiated, participated in and approved these two transactions,” Greenberg said in a statement. Smith also admitted he knew the facts when he participated in and approved the transactions. David Boies, a lawyer for Greenberg, in a statement said the attorney general had no evidence that Greenberg was aware at the time he approved the transactions that there was anything improper, “let alone that Mr. Greenberg was aware of any fraud.” Greenberg’s and Smith’s payments reflect some performance bonuses they received from 2001 to 2004, Schneiderman said. Friday’s settlement was negotiated with the help of mediator Kenneth Feinberg and averts having to restart a non-jury trial that began in September. That trial was put on hold in November to allow for mediation. The settlement marks a quiet end to a case that began around the time of Greenberg’s ouster from New York-based AIG, which he had led for nearly four decades. Schneiderman was forced to drop a $6 billion damages claim after a class action settlement over the accounting won court approval in 2013. Greenberg and other defendants paid $115 million to shareholders in that accord. But the attorney general pressed ahead, saying it would help ensure public accountability for those accused of fraud. Though he had sought to ban Greenberg and Smith from the securities industry and from serving as officers and directors of public companies, no bans are part of the settlement. Boies told Reuters in September that Greenberg nearly settled the New York case in 2008 with a $100 million gift to charity, but that year’s global financial crisis caused the value of Greenberg’s AIG stock holdings to plummet. In 2009, Greenberg and Smith settled U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges over AIG’s accounting, with Greenberg paying $15 million and Smith $1.5 million. AIG, for its part, agreed in 2006 to pay $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes into its business practices. Greenberg is now chairman and CEO of Starr & Co., a private insurance company. Smith is its vice chairman of finance. ",2102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-greenberg-aig-case/after-12-years-ex-aig-chief-greenberg-settles-accounting-fraud-case-idUSKBN15P2OK

850,AIG,"Ex-AIG CEO Greenberg admits to accounting fraud, settles lawsuit","Feb 10 (Reuters) - Former American International Group Inc  Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg admitted to his involvement in two fraudulent reinsurance deals as part of a settlement of an accounting fraud lawsuit, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Friday. The lawsuit was brought in 2005 after AIG said it had engaged in certain improper reinsurance transactions, while Greenberg was CEO and Howard Smith was chief financial officer, that fundamentally misrepresented the insurer’s finances between 2000 and 2004. “After over a decade of delays, deflections, and denials by Mr. Greenberg, we are pleased that Mr. Greenberg has finally admitted to his role in these fraudulent transactions and will personally pay $9 million to the State of New York,” Schneiderman said in a statement. Greenberg and Smith also agreed to return the multi-million dollar bonuses they received while the frauds were on AIG’s books, Schneiderman said. The two former executives of AIG were asked stand trial for orchestrating sham transactions by New York’s top court in June last year. The court had ruled at the time that the state could seek to recoup from Greenberg and Smith tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and interest.

The company also raised its share buyback program by up to $3.5 billion on Tuesday.  AIG’s net loss widened to $3.04 billion, or $2.96 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.84 billion, or $1.50 per share, a year earlier. The fourth quarter included a $5.6 billion, or $3.56 per share, impact from prior year adverse reserve development. AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock said that the adverse reserve development cover reduces the risk of further reserve additions in some of the most volatile lines. “... we responded definitively to emerging severity trends that we believe are materially impacting the overall U.S. casualty market,” he said in a statement. AIG agreed last month to pay about $10.2 billion to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) to take on many long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it has already written. The New York-based insurer had then said it would take a charge related to the deal in the fourth quarter.  On an operating basis, the company reported a loss of $2.72 per share. Total general operating expenses fell 9.6 percent to $2.48 billion. The insurer is looking to cut its gross general operating expenses by $1.6 billion by the end of 2017.

853,AIG,Fitch Affirms AIG's Ratings; Assigns Negative Outlook,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all ratings of American  International Group, Inc. (AIG), including the 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR),  'A' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating of the property/casualty (P&C;)  insurance subsidiaries, which have also been removed from Rating Watch Negative.  The 'A+' ratings of the life insurance subsidiaries are affirmed. The Rating  Outlook is Negative for all ratings. KEY RATING DRIVERS The parent company and P&C; subsidiary ratings were placed on Rating Watch  Negative in January 2017 following an announcement by AIG that material adverse  development from U.S. commercial insurance segments would be reported in 4Q16  results and that the company had entered into an adverse reserve development  reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company (NICO). The agreement  provides $20 billion of coverage for longer tail U.S. commercial lines reserves  from 2015 and prior, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2016.  AIG reported $5.5 billion of 4Q16 unfavorable development, leading to a net loss  of $849 million for full year 2016, compared with $2.2 billion of net income in  2015. The rating affirmations primarily reflect that despite the net loss in 2016, AIG  has maintained holding company and subsidiary capital levels within previous  rating guidelines. Also, while 2016 interest coverage ratios are down sharply to  approximately 3.1x, significant resources are available for servicing holding  company debt, including $8.4 billion in parent company liquidity at yearend  2016.  The Negative Rating Outlook largely reflects continued uncertainty regarding  AIG's ability to meet profitability targets for 2017 expressed as part of the  company's strategic plan. An increase in recent accident year (AY) loss ratios  from the fourth quarter charge reveal further weakness in underwriting and  reserve quality, and indicate that greater improvement than previously  anticipated is necessary to return to adequate underwriting profitability. AIG's capital plan to return at least $25 billion of capital to shareholders  through 2017 appears to be on track. AIG's financial leverage ratio, excluding  the effect of FAS 115 was approximately 23% at year-end 2016. Capitalization  remains strong at both the property casualty and life subsidiaries.  From a profitability perspective, AIG has taken significant actions in the last  12 months to change the operating risk profile and improve profitability,  including non-core operation divestitures, reinsurance purchases, expense  reductions and property/casualty underwriting initiatives. Results of many of  these actions will take some time to fully materialize. However, the Consumer  Insurance segment reported an approximate 31% improvement in 2016 after-tax  operating earnings.  Overall, operating performance for AIG's life insurance subsidiaries has  generally been stronger and more stable than its property casualty subsidiaries.  In 2016, pre-tax operating income increased 11% in the core life and retirement  segments, largely driven by a higher net positive impact from actuarial  assumption updates. The company is executing on a plan to improve returns by  narrowing its distribution and product focus as well as reducing its exposure to  hedge funds, which should improve the quality and stability of earnings going  forward. AIG reported total adverse development on P&C; business of $5.8 billion in 2016,  following $4.2 billion in 2015. This reserve experience is a sharp outlier to  peers as most large underwriters have reported net favorable development over  this time span. A substantial portion of calendar year 2016 reserve development  is in recent underwriting periods as the 2015 accident year loss ratio in  Commercial Insurance is now 6 points higher than initial estimates. Commercial insurance remains a primary source of uncertainty. Efforts to improve  commercial insurance results and reduce volatility are reflected in an 18%  reduction in commercial lines written premiums in 2016 as well as recent  reinsurance transactions that include a reduction in the retention for the  company-wide property catastrophe reinsurance program to $1.5 billion from $3  billion previously. Initial reserves ceded in the NICO cover are $12.8 billion for consideration of  approximately $9.8 billion, plus a modest interest component. The reinsurance  agreement has $7.2 billion of limit remaining against future adverse development  in covered segments.  Over the longer term, the success of AIG's profit improvement plan and  maintaining capital adequacy corresponding to subsequent changes in operating  risk profile will greatly influence future rating levels. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Further reserve development within the NICO cover that approaches exhaustion  of available limits and/or material development in the 2016 accident year; --A failure to move towards underwriting profits in commercial insurance; --Increase in financial leverage to above 25%, or an increase in the TFC ratio  to above 0.7x; --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 4.5x annual interest  on financial debt; --Sharp deterioration in the company's domestic life insurance subsidiaries'  profitability trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios or Prism scores at either the  domestic life insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries. Key triggers that could lead to a return to a Stable Outlook: --Demonstration of greater loss reserve stability or reserve redundancies,  particularly within the 2016 accident year; --Successful completion of pending strategic actions and greater certainty that  the corporate and operating structure is in place for the longer term, and  further meaningful restructuring actions are unlikely; --A shift to sustainable property/casualty segment underwriting profitability,  and execution of targeted near term expense reduction plans; --Stability and modest profit improvements within Life and Retirement Segments;  --While achieving the above, maintenance of financial leverage and risk-based  capital at the company's insurance subsidiaries remaining within newly revised  targeted levels.

854,AIG,"AIG posts bigger loss, adds $3.5 bln to buyback program","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, reported a bigger quarterly loss, as company recorded a $5.6 billion (4.49 billion pounds) charge related to measures to reduce reserve additions. The company also raised its share buyback program by up to $3.5 billion on Tuesday.  AIG’s net loss widened to $3.04 billion, or $2.96 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.84 billion, or $1.50 per share, a year earlier. The fourth quarter included a $5.6 billion, or $3.56 per share, impact from prior year adverse reserve development. AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock said that the adverse reserve development cover reduces the risk of further reserve additions in some of the most volatile lines. “... we responded definitively to emerging severity trends that we believe are materially impacting the overall U.S. casualty market,” he said in a statement. AIG agreed last month to pay about $10.2 billion to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) to take on many long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it has already written. The New York-based insurer had then said it would take a charge related to the deal in the fourth quarter.  On an operating basis, the company reported a loss of $2.72 per share. Total general operating expenses fell 9.6 percent to $2.48 billion. The insurer is looking to cut its gross general operating expenses by $1.6 billion by the end of 2017.

858,AIG,AIG reaches $50 mln pact to sell Vermont ski slope,"Feb 21 (Reuters) - Insurance giant American International Group Inc has reached a deal to sell one of its lesser-known assets: a northern Vermont ski slope. Vail Resorts Inc, a Brookfield, Colorado-based company that runs mountain resorts, has signed a $50 million agreement to buy the ski operations of Stowe Mountain Resort from AIG’s real-estate business, the resort company said on Monday. The deal, subject to review by the state of Vermont, includes everything from lift ticket offices to facilities for ski and snowboard lessons. It is AIG’s latest move in a strategy to sell off assets that do not align with its core insurance businesses. AIG, the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, will continue to own other resort properties in the area and development rights, it said in a press release. They include the tony Stowe Mountain Lodge, a luxury 312-room hotel, and the Stowe Mountain Club, an all-seasons club whose services include a 21,000-square foot spa, gourmet dining, and slope-side valet parking, according to the club’s website. The ski-slope deal follows a disappointing 2016 fourth-quarter for AIG, which last week reported a $3 billion loss. AIG is in the middle of an ambitious two-year turnaround plan, which followed pressure from billionaire activist investors Carl Icahn and John Paulson to split up the company because of poor performance. Selling off non-core assets, like Stowe, and cutting expenses will help return $25 billion to shareholders, the insurer has said.

861,AIG,AIG sees uncertainty in 'too-big-to-fail' label for insurers: filing,"(Reuters) - Insurance giant American International Group sees “considerable uncertainty” about U.S. regulations that deem non-bank financial institutions as being too big to fail, given the recent change in White House administrations, according to a filing. The “appropriateness and federal regulation” of non-bank too-big-to-fail institutions may also be questioned, AIG wrote in its 2016 annual filing. AIG is among a small number of insurers deemed by the U.S. government as being systemically important to the economy. The label, which comes from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, subjects certain insurers and banks to tougher supervision and capital requirements. AIG’s near-collapse in 2008 and its $182 billion bailout by the U.S. government led to its inclusion in the Federal Reserve’s list of “systemically important financial institutions,” known as SIFIs. The election of President Donald Trump has led to speculation in the financial services industry and on Wall Street that the label and the requirements it imposes could be abolished. Trump’s campaign promises included dismantling the Dodd-Frank law, which was passed in the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis. On Feb. 3, Trump ordered a review of Dodd-Frank reforms. Trump has said his administration expects “to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank,” although the scope of Trump’s plans is unclear. Tax reform, which Trump has also discussed, could affect AIG as well, the insurer said in its filing.  A change in the U.S. corporate tax rate could reduce the values of its deferred tax assets and investments in tax-exempt securities, AIG said. Other changes, such as the way foreign taxes can be credited against U.S. taxes, and how insurance companies calculate and deduct reserves for tax purposes, could increase AIG’s tax expense and reduce earnings, the insurer said.

AIG said on Wednesday it would keep its main European headquarters in London and open a subsidiary in Luxembourg, which along with Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin is touting itself as an alternative base for firms wishing to retain access to the EU after Brexit. “This ... ensures AIG is positioned for whatever form the UK’s exit from the EU ultimately takes,” Anthony Baldwin, Chief Executive of AIG Europe said in a statement.     Major banks have said they plan to set up EU subsidiaries to continue to be able to sell their services across the bloc, but few have announced concrete decisions.

AIG has previously said it was also looking at Dublin as a possible EU hub and insurer Hiscox (HSX.L) has said it will choose between Luxembourg and Malta.  Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest speciality insurance market, is due to pick a location for its EU subsidiary by the end of March, with Dublin and Luxembourg on its shortlist.

The switch would involve “changes at senior leadership level”, she added, without giving more details. AIG currently has a branch in Luxembourg with a staff of three. Eighty-eight insurance companies and 216 reinsurance firms have a presence in Luxembourg, according to financial development agency Luxembourg for Finance. “Over the coming months, we expect more companies to follow in the footsteps of both AIG and M&G;, whether in the insurance sector, asset management, banking industry or in the fintech space,” Nicolas Mackel, CEO of Luxembourg for Finance said.

875,AIG,"AIG CEO to resign after dismal earnings, successor unclear","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said on Thursday its Chief Executive Peter Hancock will step down, a decision he made after poor financial performance frustrated shareholders and the insurer’s board of directors. Hancock, 58, will remain as CEO until a successor is named. In a joint statement, neither he nor Chairman Douglas Steenland gave any clues as to who might replace him. “Without wholehearted shareholder support for my continued leadership, a protracted period of uncertainty could undermine the progress we have made and damage the interests of our policyholders, employees, regulators, debtholders, and shareholders,” Hancock said. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who is AIG’s fourth-largest investor, cheered Hancock’s departure: “We fully support the actions taken today by the board of AIG,” he tweeted. AIG’s shares were down 0.4 percent to $63.21 on Thursday at the close of trading in New York. The stock trades at less than 85 percent of the stated value of AIG’s assets. When Icahn first began acquiring his stake in 2015, he advocated splitting up AIG into three parts. The insurer instead embarked on a two-year turnaround plan developed by Hancock, which intended to return $25 billion to shareholders. Last year, AIG returned a total of $13.1 billion of capital to shareholders, the company said. The board is still committed to that plan, Steenland said. According to AIG’s 2016 proxy filing, Hancock could receive an exit package of $20.4 million or $31.5 million, depending on whether the board determines his reason for leaving was “good.” Many longtime AIG executives who would have been obvious internal candidates for CEO have left since Hancock took the helm in 2014. Analysts have floated several names of external possibilities since AIG stunned Wall Street with a surprisingly wide fourth-quarter loss on Feb. 14. Among them are John Doyle, who spent decades at AIG before leaving to oversee the brokerage business at insurer Marsh & McLennan.  Brian Duperreault, who oversaw the turnaround of Marsh & McLennan after the 2008 financial crisis and is now CEO of Hamilton Insurance Group is also a possibility, as is Daniel Glaser, the current CEO of Marsh & McLennan, and Constantine Iordanou, CEO of insurer Arch Capital Group Ltd. These executives either declined to comment or could not immediately be reached. Several AIG board members also have insurance industry leadership experience.  What is important, analysts said, is that the next CEO has a firm grasp on AIG’s troubles in property and casualty insurance which have weighed heavily on results. “We’ve seen a few examples in the insurance world of similarly large organizations that were similarly distressed that were able to turn themselves around,” said Meyer Shields, who covers AIG shares at Keefer, Bruyette & Woods. “I think it is fair to say that there are people out there who could do this job.” The incoming CEO will be AIG’s sixth in 12 years and will be tasked with carrying out the insurer’s plan to continue shedding assets and reducing risk exposure some nine years after receiving a $182 billion government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. Although Hancock resisted calls to break up AIG, he did complete or announce 17 deals to shrink the company by $13 billion worth of assets in total. AIG’s overall balance sheet was $498 billion at year-end, less than half its size at the end of 2007. Shrinking the balance sheet is important for AIG, which is currently labeled a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, by the U.S. government. Icahn’s breakup calls were intended to rid AIG of that designation, which forces it to hold more capital and undergo tougher regulatory supervision. Icahn has a 4.7 percent stake in the company. Samuel Merksamer, who represents Icahn on AIG’s board and several others, exited the activist investor’s firm in December. Merksamer, however, continues to serve as Ichan’s representative. Hedge fund billionaire John Paulson also holds AIG shares and a board seat, though he has been shedding some of the stake. Directors were frustrated by AIG’s stunning fourth-quarter loss, which was the result of under-reserving, and the second surprise charge in a row, people familiar with the matter said.

878,AIG,"US STOCKS-Wall St flat with focus on jobs report, rate meeting","* ECB stands pat on interest rates; dovish on guidance * U.S. jobless claims rose to 243,000 last week - report * AIG rises after CEO Hancock says to resign * Dow up 0.04 pct, S&P; up 0.02 pct, Nasdaq down 0.09 pct   (Updates to open) By Yashaswini Swamynathan March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened little changed on Thursday as investors held off from making big bets ahead of Friday’s jobs data that could boost the chances of an interest rate hike next week. U.S. crude prices pared losses after hitting a four-month low of $48.79 before the open, following a record rise in inventories. The S&P; 500 energy index was down 0.8 percent, trading at its lowest level since November. The European Central Bank kept its policy stance unchanged and remained dovish on its outlook ahead of key elections in France and the Netherlands and as a surge in inflation that is expected to be temporary. Investors are squarely focused on Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which is likely to feed into Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates at its meeting on March 14-15. “I think we are headed for another defensive day, based on climbing yields, falling oil prices and tomorrow’s employment number, which will be another confirmation that the Fed may be more aggressive in raising rates than previously expected,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Worries over Wall Street valuations and unusually hawkish comments from Fed officials have led a post-election rally to lose steam in recent days. The S&P; 500 has closed lower for the past three days, setting it up for the first weekly decline in seven weeks. “The market is priced to perfection, so any disappointment  is not going to be well received,” Cardillo said. Thursday also marks the eighth anniversary of the second longest bull market run of the index. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 7.98 points, or 0.04 percent, at 20,863.71, the S&P; 500 was up 0.45 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,363.43. The Nasdaq Composite was down 5.36 points, or 0.09 percent, at 5,832.19. Apple, which has been trading close to record highs, was off 0.9 percent and kept the tech-heavy index in the red. A Labor Department report on Thursday showed the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose to 243,000 last week, but remained below 300,000 for the 105th week, pointing to a healthy labor market. Seven, of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 0.4 percent increase in financials. Almost all big U.S. bank stocks were up about 0.5 percent. American International Group was up 1.7 percent at $64.50 after Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock said he would resign. Shares of e.l.f Beauty jumped 16 percent to $29.55 following the cosmetics maker’s better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,511 to 1,067. On the Nasdaq, 1,111 issues rose and 1,052 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed two new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 12 new highs and 13 new lows.

884,AIG,AIG executives meet analysts to push resiliency message,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) executives have been meeting with investors and analysts to build confidence in the insurer and its turnaround plan amid uncertainty over a replacement for outgoing Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock. Chief Financial Officer Sid Sankaran, commercial insurance head Robert Schimek and consumer insurance head Kevin Hogan held one meeting with a group of Wall Street analysts on Thursday to field questions about AIG’s disappointing fourth-quarter results and its two-year restructuring plan, attendees said. That followed several  meetings Sankaran and investor relations staff organized with shareholders since AIG said on March 9 that Hancock plans to resign, a spokeswoman said.During the meetings, executives tried to drive home a message of financial resilience, telling participants that AIG was on target to meet its goals for 2017, in the second half of its turnaround plan, analysts said in reports on Friday. They added that the company also said its reserves were sufficient. A big reserve addition led AIG to report a surprisingly large fourth-quarter loss on Feb. 14, jolting investors and leading to Hancock’s planned departure. A successor has not yet been announced, though several names have been cited by media reports and analysts. The board has pledged to find a new CEO quickly. At the two-hour gathering on Thursday, which drew analysts from at least seven sell-side firms, the CEO question “definitely was in the air,” Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome said on Friday. However, several analysts said Sankaran, Schimek and Hogan demurred when asked about the succession process. Newsome said he thought a replacement will probably take months rather than weeks.  “During the meeting it appeared as if potential CEO candidates were not meeting with the C-suite, which was a bit surprising to us, and perhaps leads us to believe that an internal candidate is unlikely,” Macquarie analyst Amit Kumar said in note to clients.

887,AIG,"AIG morale could spook talent, curb turnaround plan: UBS report","(Reuters) - A morale crisis at American International Group Inc could prevent the U.S. insurance company from keeping and hiring the talent it needs to propel it through its financial turnaround, UBS said in an analysis on Monday.  AIG ranked last through March 21 among 10 insurers rated by their own employees in categories ranging from career opportunities to business outlook, according to a UBS analysis of data from Glassdoor Inc, which runs a careers website and database of millions of company reviews.      An AIG spokesman declined to comment. Last year, AIG ranked last in seven of 10 categories rated by Glassdoor users, including employees and agents. Factors also include compensation, senior management and cultural values.  AIG, which announced on March 9 that its chief executive, Peter Hancock, would be stepping down, has ranked at or near  the bottom of the group in all categories since 2012, wrote UBS analyst Brian Meredith in a report to UBS customers.  The morale slump could threaten a two-year turnaround plan put in place at AIG after billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn became AIG’s fourth-largest investor in 2015, Meredith said. AIG is midway through the plan, which involves divesting businesses, cutting costs and ultimately returning $25 billion to shareholders.  A $5.6 billion addition to reserves to cover future claims led AIG to report an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss on Feb. 14, jolting investors and leading to Hancock’s planned departure. Hancock’s successor has not yet been announced, though several names have been cited by analysts and in media reports. The board has pledged to find a new CEO quickly.      The data is an indication of AIG’s challenges in “retaining and hiring underwriting talent” in its commercial property and casualty businesses during the last several years, wrote Meredith.  Dim views of AIG among employees and agents signal “the challenges that AIG continues to face in retaining and hiring talent it needs” to boost and maintain its commercial property and casualty insurance businesses, said Meredith.  The UBS analysis involved about 6,300 reviews posted on Glassdoor that UBS identified as being from employees of large property and casualty insurers, including Travelers Cos Inc and The Hartford. More than 1,400 of the 6,300 reviews were from AIG employees. CNA Insurance has scored the highest ratings so far in 2017, while Travelers ranked the highest last year, according to UBS.

890,AIG,"AIG morale could spook talent, curb turnaround plan -UBS report","(Reuters) - A morale crisis at American International Group Inc could prevent the U.S. insurance company from keeping and hiring the talent it needs to propel it through its financial turnaround, UBS said in an analysis on Monday.  AIG ranked last through March 21 among 10 insurers rated by their own employees in categories ranging from career opportunities to business outlook, according to a UBS analysis of data from Glassdoor Inc, which runs a careers website and database of millions of company reviews.      An AIG spokesman declined to comment. Last year, AIG ranked last in seven of 10 categories rated by Glassdoor users, including employees and agents. Factors also include compensation, senior management and cultural values.  AIG, which announced on March 9 that its chief executive, Peter Hancock, would be stepping down, has ranked at or near  the bottom of the group in all categories since 2012, wrote UBS analyst Brian Meredith in a report to UBS customers.  The morale slump could threaten a two-year turnaround plan put in place at AIG after billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn became AIG’s fourth-largest investor in 2015, Meredith said. AIG is midway through the plan, which involves divesting businesses, cutting costs and ultimately returning $25 billion to shareholders.  A $5.6 billion addition to reserves to cover future claims led AIG to report an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss on Feb. 14, jolting investors and leading to Hancock’s planned departure. Hancock’s successor has not yet been announced, though several names have been cited by analysts and in media reports. The board has pledged to find a new CEO quickly.      The data is an indication of AIG’s challenges in “retaining and hiring underwriting talent” in its commercial property and casualty businesses during the last several years, wrote Meredith.  Dim views of AIG among employees and agents signal “the challenges that AIG continues to face in retaining and hiring talent it needs” to boost and maintain its commercial property and casualty insurance businesses, said Meredith.  The UBS analysis involved about 6,300 reviews posted on Glassdoor that UBS identified as being from employees of large property and casualty insurers, including Travelers Cos Inc and The Hartford. More than 1,400 of the 6,300 reviews were from AIG employees. CNA Insurance has scored the highest ratings so far in 2017, while Travelers ranked the highest last year, according to UBS.

891,AIG,AIG board denies CEO 2016 cash bonus after dismal earnings,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) board of directors declined to award Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock a cash bonus for his work last year, after the company’s dismal financial performance roiled shareholders, according to a proxy filing on Thursday. Hancock, however, will still receive a total of nearly $9.6 million in 2016 compensation, according to the filing. The figure includes his $1.6 million base salary, longer-term incentive pay in stock worth $7.8 million and additional funds. The stock incentive starts to pay out in 2019. His total compensation for 2016 fell 23 percent from 2015, the filings show. The insurance company’s board also re-nominated Samuel Merksamer, who represents billionaire Carl Icahn, to serve on the board for another term. Merksamer, who last year left the activist investor’s firm, Icahn Capital, a unit of Icahn Enterprises LP, will continue as Icahn’s representative, according to the proxy filing. AIG’s board also disclosed in the filing that hedge fund manager John Paulson is leaving the board because of “other time commitments.” Paulson owned 4.55 million AIG shares as of March 15, according to the filing. The proxy filing comes at a tumultuous time for the U.S. insurance company. AIG announced last month that Hancock, 58, would step down, after a poor fourth quarter frustrated shareholders and the insurer’s board of directors. Hancock will stay on as chief executive until the board finds a successor, the company has said. Icahn, AIG’s fourth-largest investor, began acquiring his stake in the insurance firm in 2015. He advocated splitting AIG into three parts. The company instead embarked on a two-year turnaround plan developed by Hancock, which intended to return $25 billion to shareholders. Last year, AIG returned a total of $13.1 billion of capital to shareholders, the company said. While Hancock must forego a 2016 cash bonus, other AIG executives will receive bonuses of $680,000 or more, representing 40 percent of possible target amounts, according to the filing.

Indeed, analysts and investors say they want to know more about the succession plans of AIG, which reports its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.  Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock said on March 9 he would depart once the board found a replacement, citing a lack of confidence among directors and investors. But AIG has said little about the board’s progress since then. Chairman Douglas Steenland has said AIG’s board remains committed to the existing turnaround effort.  “The board and management team believe strongly that we are on the right strategic path,” he said in a letter to shareholders last month.  Nonetheless, analysts doubt that a new chief executive would carry out Hancock’s strategy. “We need to know” about the impending choice of CEO, said Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome. “The lack of a CEO puts the strategy for the company completely in play. There’s a very large chance that with a different CEO, you are going to have a change in the strategy, despite what the board says.” An AIG spokeswoman declined to comment. Hancock’s resignation plans were announced shortly after AIG reported an unexpectedly deep loss on Feb. 14, after the company underestimated the value of claims it would have to pay for a variety of insurance products. Wall Street analysts are forecasting brighter results when AIG reports this week. They expect $1.1 billion in quarterly profit, or $1.08 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters data, a 37 percent increase from a year earlier. “The bad fourth quarter sets them up for a better start to this year,” said Andrew Kohl, a portfolio manager at Alpine Woods Capital, who owns about 4,000 AIG shares in the financial services fund he oversees. Kohl, who sold some AIG stock in January as the insurer’s financial difficulties mounted, started to wade back in following media reports that Brian Duperreault, the current head of Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd, was among those being considered as AIG’s new CEO.  An AIG spokesman said the company does not comment on speculation or rumor. Several of AIG’s largest investors, including Capital Research Global Investors, The Vanguard Group and State Street Global Advisors, would not comment for this story.  But some, including funds overseen by American Funds, T. Rowe Price, FFAmerican Beacon and Invesco, have been buying AIG shares in recent weeks, according to data provided by Lipper. Even so, as of Monday’s close, the stock was down 2.9 percent since Hancock announced his planned departure. In the year to date, AIG shares have dropped 5.7 percent compared with a 6.7 percent rise in the benchmark S&P; 500 stock index. Hancock’s troubles began in 2015, when billionaire activists Carl Icahn and John Paulson began building stakes and later acquired board seats. Icahn, who is AIG's fourth-largest investor, wanted the insurer to split into three parts. Instead, Hancock embarked on a two-year turnaround plan that involved cutting costs and selling chunks of the company, with the aim of returning $25 billion to shareholders. (reut.rs/1kp8P4I) Hancock achieved $14.3 billion of that goal from the start of 2016 through Feb. 14. Experts have said it would be challenging to find someone capable who would want Hancock’s job, given the company’s recent performance, and its board and financial difficulties in the broader insurance sector. Though rising interest rates have helped insurers’ profits, extreme weather claims, lower premiums and weak sales could weigh on results in the near-term, analysts said.  Still, some investors were hopeful that AIG would improve its bottomline, quickly. “You can’t predict the weather,” said Kohl, “but you can control other aspects of your business.” (This version of the story has been refiled to correct to Woods from Wood in thirteenth paragraph) ",5022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aig-results/aigs-investors-awaiting-ceo-plan-uneasy-ahead-of-results-idUSKBN17Y0DI

AIG reported operating earnings of $1.37 billion, or $1.36 per share, compared with $765 million, or 64 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  That easily beat Wall Street’s average estimate of $1.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its shares rose 2 percent after hours to $62.90.  The New York-based insurer, which is the largest U.S. underwriter of commercial property and casualty policies, also said its board authorized an additional $2.5 billion in share repurchases, putting the company closer to its goal of returning $25 billion of capital to investors by year-end.  That is a central part of a two-year turnaround plan underway at AIG, which has been the target of activist investors led by billionaire Carl Icahn.

The results mark a rebound from a surprisingly wide loss in the fourth quarter, which stunned investors and AIG’s board, triggering the resignation of Chief Executive Peter Hancock. Hancock said on March 9 he would depart once the board found a replacement.

905,AIG,"U.S. insurance profits hit by lower premiums, bad weather","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. insurance industry is suffering from lower property-casualty premiums, bad weather claims and interest rates that are still too low to move the needle, according to earnings reports by some of the largest players this week. Although MetLife Inc, Prudential Financial Inc, American International Group Inc and Allstate Corp each handily beat expectations for first-quarter profits, some of their underlying businesses showed signs of weakness. Across the industry, insurers had to pay out higher claims for catastrophes due to extreme weather conditions. A single hailstorm in Texas cost Allstate over $250 million during the quarter, Chief Executive Tom Wilson said in an interview. Cyclone Debbie, a tropical storm near Australia, also hurt some insurers. Travelers Companies Inc cited a variety of weather issues for its 11 percent decline in quarterly profit when reporting results last month. UBS analysts cut full-year estimates for several companies through 2018 this week, citing margins that were “generally deteriorating.” Unusual items also weighed on results. MetLife’s bottom line was hurt by a $602 million net loss on its derivatives portfolio, as well as higher legal costs and higher effective taxes in Japan. Profits at AIG were crimped by a change in UK regulations regarding certain bodily injury claims. A restructuring at MetLife and a turnaround effort at AIG are uniquely affecting their businesses as well. MetLife plans to spin off a retail business called Brighthouse Financial, pending regulatory approval. AIG has been divesting chunks of its operation to return capital to shareholders. Despite the lumpiness in results, analysts and insurance executives are hopeful that a continued rise in interest rates, combined with cost-cutting efforts and better business practices, will bolster profits going forward. AIG, for instance, reported lower but more profitable net premiums written in all three of its major business units. Although the price of individual premiums is generally not falling, many insurers are writing fewer policies as they become more selective about the risks they take on. Another bright spot: insurers said their investment portfolios performed well because of gains on alternative investments, such as hedge funds, venture capital and private equity. “Financial markets are better today than they were a year ago,” Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome said in an interview.

906,AIG,Ex-AIG CEO Greenberg loses appeal over 2008 bailout,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court threw out a ruling that the U.S. government illegally bailed out insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) during the 2008 financial crisis, in a defeat for former chief executive officer Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington said Greenberg’s Starr International Co had no legal right to challenge the bailout because that right belonged to AIG, which chose not to sue. Tuesday’s decision by a three-judge panel was a victory for the government in a lawsuit testing its power to bail out companies, including those deemed “too big to fail.” David Boies, Starr’s lawyer, said “we respectfully disagree” with the decision and they would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Department of Justice had no immediate comment. AIG was rescued in September 2008 after running up huge losses from insurance on shoddy mortgage securities. Starr said the government harmed shareholders through an unconstitutional “exaction,” by taking a 79.9 percent stake in the stricken insurer in exchange for a high-interest $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  “While punitive measures against a corporation may ultimately be borne by its shareholders, a finding that those measures targeted shareholders directly is a wholly different matter,” Chief Judge Sharon Prost wrote for the appeals court. “The alleged injuries to Starr are merely incidental to injuries to AIG, and any remedy would go to AIG, not Starr,” she added. Starr had been New York-based AIG’s largest shareholder, with a 12 percent stake. It sought more than $40 billion of damages for shareholders. In June 2015, Court of Federal Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler agreed with Starr that the New York Fed overstepped its authority in arranging the $85 billion loan, but he refused to award damages because AIG would have gone bankrupt without it. The judge also rejected damages for a subsequent reverse stock split. Wheeler ruled after a trial featuring testimony from former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, and former Treasury secretaries Henry “Hank” Paulson and Tim Geithner. Greenberg appealed Wheeler’s damages ruling. The government appealed his standing and exaction rulings. Dennis Kelleher, CEO of nonprofit Better Markets, in an interview welcomed the decision, saying the case may help regulators address future financial system shocks “without worrying about courts second-guessing them years later.” AIG’s bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion but was repaid, leaving taxpayers with nearly $23 billion of profit. Greenberg, 92, led AIG for nearly four decades before being ousted in March 2005. The case is Starr International Co v U.S., Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 2015-5103, 2015-5133.

Starr said the government harmed shareholders through an unconstitutional “exaction,” by taking a 79.9 percent stake in the stricken insurer in exchange for a high-interest $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  “While punitive measures against a corporation may ultimately be borne by its shareholders, a finding that those measures targeted shareholders directly is a wholly different matter,” Chief Judge Sharon Prost wrote for the appeals court. “The alleged injuries to Starr are merely incidental to injuries to AIG, and any remedy would go to AIG, not Starr,” she added. Starr had been New York-based AIG’s largest shareholder, with a 12 percent stake. It sought more than $40 billion of damages for shareholders. In June 2015, Court of Federal Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler agreed with Starr that the New York Fed overstepped its authority in arranging the $85 billion loan, but he refused to award damages because AIG would have gone bankrupt without it. The judge also rejected damages for a subsequent reverse stock split. Wheeler ruled after a trial featuring testimony from former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, and former Treasury secretaries Henry “Hank” Paulson and Tim Geithner. Greenberg appealed Wheeler’s damages ruling. The government appealed his standing and exaction rulings. Dennis Kelleher, CEO of nonprofit Better Markets, in an interview welcomed the decision, saying the case may help regulators address future financial system shocks “without worrying about courts second-guessing them years later.” AIG’s bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion but was repaid, leaving taxpayers with nearly $23 billion of profit. Greenberg, 92, led AIG for nearly four decades before being ousted in March 2005. The case is Starr International Co v U.S., Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 2015-5103, 2015-5133.

908,AIG,Ex-AIG CEO Greenberg loses appeal over 2008 bailout,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court threw out a ruling that the U.S. government illegally bailed out insurer American International Group Inc during the 2008 financial crisis, in a defeat for former chief executive officer Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington said on Tuesday that Greenberg’s Starr International Co lacked standing to challenge the bailout because that right belonged to AIG, which chose not to sue. Greenberg’s lawsuit is one of the main challenges to federal authority to bail out companies, including those deemed “too big to fail.” AIG was rescued in September 2008 after running up huge losses from insurance on shoddy mortgage securities. Starr accused the government of harming existing AIG shareholders through an unconstitutional “exaction,” by taking a 79.9 percent stake in the stricken insurer in exchange for an $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “While punitive measures against a corporation may ultimately be borne by its shareholders, a finding that those measures targeted shareholders directly is a wholly different matter,” Chief Judge Sharon Prost wrote for a three-judge panel. “The alleged injuries to Starr are merely incidental to injuries to AIG.” David Boies, a lawyer for Starr, was not immediately available for comment. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Starr had been New York-based AIG’s largest shareholder, with a 12 percent stake, and sought more than $40 billion of damages for itself and other shareholders. In June 2015, Court of Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler agreed with Starr that the New York Fed overstepped its authority in arranging the $85 billion loan, but he refused to award damages because AIG would have gone bankrupt without it. The judge also rejected damages for a subsequent reverse stock split.

The government appealed his standing and exaction rulings. Dennis Kelleher, CEO of nonprofit Better Markets, said AIG would not exist without the bailout, and Tuesday’s decision “prevents taxpayers from being victimized yet again.” AIG’s bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion but was repaid, leaving taxpayers with nearly $23 billion of profit. Greenberg, 92, led AIG for nearly four decades before being ousted in March 2005.

915,AIG,AIG lures industry veteran Duperreault as CEO with sweet package,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc on Monday named an insurance industry veteran as its new chief executive officer, luring him from the firm he started with a lucrative financial package that includes buying a big piece of his company. In hiring Brian Duperreault, who is 70, AIG is giving into the demands of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, AIG’s fourth largest shareholder, who has been pushing for changes at the insurer. Duperreault’s appointment caps more than two months of uncertainty for shareholders after outgoing CEO Peter Hancock announced in March he would step down, citing a lack of confidence from the board and investors. “Very pleased the AIG board is finally making some of the much-needed changes we’ve been advocating the last 18 months,” Icahn tweeted. AIG’s shares were up 0.7 percent at $61.42 in afternoon trading. AIG said it will pay as much as $40 million to free Duperreault from a noncompete agreement with Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd, the firm he founded and ran, in addition to a $16 million annual pay package. AIG also agreed to buy Hamilton’s U.S. business, a technology-driven group of insurance companies, for $110 million, and create a partnership with an affiliate of quantitative investment firm Two Sigma to expand its data mining and analytics. A growing number of insurers are embracing data mining to help price products more effectively and better assess and manage risks. Last year, AIG, Hamilton and Two Sigma collectively invested in Attune, a startup that helps insurance brokers and agents quickly offer quotes and finalize policies for small commercial businesses. Its technology relies on public data, like whether a restaurant passed health inspections, as well as Two Sigma’s private data. “Putting data science and technology to work in our industry has been on my agenda for some time,” Duperreault said in a statement. AIG announced a partnership with Hamilton’s reinsurance business as well. The companies described it as a deal that could spark “material premium growth” for Hamilton Re, and provide AIG with a fresh source of reinsurance capital. Bermuda-born Duperreault spent many years at AIG earlier in his career, becoming a protégé of former longtime CEO Hank Greenberg. After leaving AIG in 1994, Duperreault built a reputation as an expert in growing small companies and righting troubled ones. He built ACE Group Inc from a small outfit to a global operation, then launched a successful turnaround as president and CEO at Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc before founding Hamilton. Duperreault’s age suggests he may only stay at AIG for three to five years, several recruiters said in interviews. The company is nearly three-quarters through a turnaround plan that he will guide to completion while grooming a successor, they said. “Brian is uniquely qualified to lead AIG at this important time,” Douglas Steenland, chairman of AIG’s board, said in a statement. “He is a hands-on leader who has consistently delivered strong bottom-line results.” AIG’s turnaround plan was intended to trim the New York-based insurer through divestitures, improve its financial performance and return $25 billion in capital to shareholders. The company has already put more than $18 billion toward that goal, and its board authorized another $2.5 billion stock repurchase plan last month. Hancock, the previous CEO, developed the plan partly in response to demands from Icahn, who had wanted to split the company into three parts. AIG reported poor fourth-quarter results in February, prompting Hancock to step down, and analysts and investors wondered whether the breakup idea was under consideration again. However, at an event on Monday for investors, Duperreault said it is off the table. “I didn’t come here to break the company up,” he said. “I came here to grow it.” Duperreault’s appointment could test whether possible internal candidates for the CEO job will stay. The most prominent was Rob Schimek, CEO of AIG’s commercial insurance unit, who joined the company in 2005 as its chief financial officer. Industry sources describe Schimek, age 52, as capable and accomplished, though he lacks Duperreault’s turnaround experience. During his time at AIG, he has been credited with helping ink reinsurance pacts with Swiss Re AG and Berkshire Hathaway Inc to offset long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies. A spokesman for Schimek was not immediately available to comment. Analysts are now bracing for a management shakeup. “We expect the incoming CEO to announce further changes in management ranks, especially in the corporate finance and commercial lines areas,” JPMorgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar wrote in a report on Monday.

918,AIG,"European, Asian companies short on cyber insurance before ransomware attack","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many companies outside the United States may not have cover for a recent computer-system attack, leaving them potentially with millions of dollars of losses because there has been relatively little take-up of cyber insurance, insurers say. A massive ransomware worm caused damage across the globe over the weekend, stopping car factories, hospitals, shops and schools, amid fears it could wreck fresh havoc on Monday when employees return to work. Cybersecurity experts said the spread of the virus dubbed WannaCry - “ransomware” which locked up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries - had slowed, but the respite might only be brief. The overall cost of getting businesses going again could run into the billions of dollars, with companies in Europe, including Russia, and Asia particularly vulnerable.  Nearly nine out 10 cyber insurance policies in the world are in the United States, according to Kevin Kalinich, global head of Aon Plc’s cyber risk practice. The annual premium market stands at $2.5-$3 billion.  The biggest reason for the larger penetration in the United States, says Bob Parisi, U.S. cyber product leader for insurance broker Marsh, “is that the U.S. has been living with state breach notification laws for the past 10 years.”  The greater transparency created an incentive for U.S. companies to get insurance to compensate for damage from incidents they were required to report. An upcoming European Union directive is expected to have the same impact there. Companies that were not prepared for WannaCry can expect to rack up business interruption costs that far exceed a ransomware payment, said Kalinich. “If you’re a hospital that turned away patients, if you’re a global delivery company that can’t send package, or a telecom company in Spain, Russia or China, the financial statement impact from the business interruption is much larger than the $300 ransomware,” he said. Organizations hit by the attacks, which lock up computer systems until the victims pay a ransom, included Britain’s National Health Service, French car manufacturer Renault, and Spain’s Telefonica. Sources close to Telefonica said the company had insurance to cover the attacks but it was too soon to estimate the economic impact. Renault and the NHS did not respond to requests for comment. West Coast cyber risk modeling firm Cyence estimated the average individual ransom cost from Friday’s attacks at $300, and the total economic costs from interruption to business at $4 billion.  The U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, a non-profit research institute that advises governments and businesses on the costs of cyber attacks, estimated more modest total losses. They were likely to range in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and unlikely to exceed $1 billion, the group forecast.  A typical cyber insurance policy will protect companies against extortion like ransomware attacks, which insurers say have spiked in the past 18 months. It would cover the investigation costs and also pay the ransom, according to Parisi.  But there are caveats. Companies that did not download a Microsoft patch issued in March to protect users from vulnerabilities may be out of luck, since many cyber policies exclude coverage in such an instance. Companies using pirated software are also unlikely eligible for an insurance payout, Kalinich said. Most cyber insurance policies cover breaches of up to $50 million, with much of the losses related to the interruption of the firms’ business, Parisi said. Some policies can cover losses for as much as $500-600 million. Cyber insurance policies also typically cover the cost of notifying those whose data has been breached, hiring a PR agency to address reputational damage and arranging credit monitoring for those affected, as well as potential legal suits. It is a high-margin business. Insurer Sciemus, for example, has previously said it charges around $100,000 for $10 million in data breach insurance and as much as seven times that to cover attacks causing physical damage.  Other providers include Allianz, AIG, Chubb and Zurich as well as Lloyds’ of London insurers such as Beazley and Hiscox. DEMAND TO RISE     Even before the weekend attacks, demand in Europe was expected to rise after an EU directive is implemented in mid-2018 requiring companies to notify authorities of a data breach. With strong competition and uncertainty as to how many of the losses over the weekend were insured, the impact on insurance premiums, however, may be muted. Insurers are likely to more carefully scrutinize risks they take on as well as how they word policies and exclusions, Kalinich said. “They will want to pick the companies that are most prepared,” Kalinich said. Other firms might be eligible for coverage, but more exclusions may apply, he said. For example, insurers may seek to deny coverage if companies pay the ransom without contacting their insurers first, he said. “There are really important intricacies. You could end up losing a couple million dollars.” ",5152017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-insurance/european-asian-companies-short-on-cyber-insurance-before-ransomware-attack-idUSKCN18B00H

Duperreault, age 70, is the founder and chief executive officer of Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd in Bermuda, and is seen as a short-to-medium term replacement for outgoing CEO Peter Hancock, who announced plans to depart in March after the insurer’s fourth-quarter loss stunned investors and AIG’s board. He may only stay at AIG for 3 to 5 years to finish an ongoing turnaround effort and groom a successor, several recruiters said in interviews. “Brian is uniquely qualified to lead AIG at this important time,” Douglas Steenland, chairman of AIG’s board said in a statement. “He is a hands-on leader who has consistently delivered strong bottom-line results,” Steenland said. The company’s shares were up 1.7 percent at $62.01 in premarket trading on Monday. AIG is nearly three-quarters of the way through a turnaround plan developed by Hancock, who intended to slim the New York-based insurer through divestitures, improve its financial performance and return $25 billion worth of capital to shareholders. Although AIG’s poor fourth-quarter performance was a tipping point for many investors, including billionaire activist Carl Icahn, the company has since bounced back. Its first-quarter operating profit beat expectations, helped by investment returns and cost cuts. AIG’s board has also authorized an additional $2.5 billion in share repurchases, putting the company closer to its capital return target. Since announcing the goal, AIG has spent more than $18 billion on stock buybacks and dividends. Duperreault is described by many in the insurance business as the industry’s “elder statesman.” After moving up the ranks at AIG early in his career, he left in 1994 to build ACE Group Inc from a small outfit to a global operation. Duperreault, who took charge of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc in 2008, launched a successful turnaround effort at the company, which had been struggling with reputational issues and lost business after then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer alleged that it had rigged bids for insurance contracts. Marsh paid an $850 million civil penalty in 2005 to settle the claims. However, Duperreault’s appointment as AIG’s head could test whether those seen as possible internal candidates for the CEO job will stay on board to help achieve Duperreault’s goals. The most prominent was Rob Schimek, CEO of AIG’s commercial insurance unit, who joined the company in 2005 as its chief financial officer. Industry sources describe Schimek, age 52, as capable and accomplished, though he lacks Duperreault’s turnaround experience. During his time at AIG, he has been credited with helping ink reinsurance pacts with Swiss Re AG and Berkshire Hathaway Inc to offset long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies.

926,AIG,Companies use kidnap insurance to guard against ransomware attacks,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Companies without cyber insurance are dusting off policies covering kidnap, ransom and extortion in the world’s political hotspots to recoup losses caused by ransomware viruses such as “WannaCry”, insurers say. Cyber insurance can be expensive to buy and is not widely used outside the United States, with one insurer previously describing the cost as $100,000 for $10 million in data breach insurance. Some companies do not even consider it because they do not think they are targets. The kidnap policies, known as K&R; coverage, are typically used by multinational companies looking to protect their staff in areas where violence related to oil and mining operations is common, such as parts of Africa and Latin America. Companies could also tap them to cover losses following the WannaCry attack, which used malicious software, known as ransomware, to lock up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, and demand payments to free them up. Pay-outs on K&R; for ransomware attacks may be lower and the policies less suitable than those offered by traditional cyber insurance, insurers say. “There will be some creative forensic lawyers who will be looking at policies,” said Patrick Gage, chief underwriting officer at CNA Hardy, a specialist commercial insurer, in London. He added, however, that given that K&R; policies are geared towards a threat to lives, “our absolute preference is that people buy specific cover, rather than relying on insurance coverage that is not specific”. American International Group Inc (AIG.N), Hiscox Ltd (HSX.L) and the Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N) have been receiving ransomware claims from some customers with K&R; policies as ransomware attacks become more common, the companies said. The insurers declined to comment on total claims, citing confidentiality and client security concerns. “We are seeing claims (over the past 18 months) but not a huge uptick,” a Hiscox spokeswoman said. “These are within expectations and entirely manageable.” She declined to say whether the firm had seen any such claims from the WannaCry attacks though Tom Harvey, an expert in cyber risk management at catastrophe modeling firm RMS, said  “insurers with kidnap and ransom books will want to look closely at their policy wordings to see whether they are exposed.” A sharp rise in ransomware attacks in the past 18 months has driven companies to use K&R; policies to cover some of their damages if they do not have direct cyber coverage or cannot meet initial cyber policy deductible costs, insurers said. Symantec Corp, (SYMC.O), a cyber security firm based in Mountain View in California, observed over 460,000 ransomware attempts in 2016, up 36 percent from 2015, the company said. The average payment demand ballooned from $294 to $1,077, a 266 percent increase. But as the threat mounts, K&R; insurers are at risk from steeper claims than they had anticipated. They are responding by making changes to their policies, which were not designed around ransomware, insurance brokers said. Most of the computers affected by WannaCry were outside the United States, where companies have been slow to buy cyber insurance. Nearly 90 percent of the world’s annual cyber insurance premium of $2.5-3 billion comes from the U.S. market, according to insurance broker Aon Plc (AON.N). Global companies typically buy K&R; policies without ransomware in mind. But instances of high-tech hacks and online ransom demands can hit a company’s business more than an executive being held hostage. “If your CFO (chief financial officer) gets kidnapped, the company is going to continue to function,” said Bob Parisi, cyber product leader for insurance broker Marsh, a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. (MMC.N) “If you get a piece of malware in the system, you might have two factories that stop working. The actual damage is probably greater.” The K&R; policies, which typically do not have deductibles, cover the ransom payments as well as crisis response services, including getting in touch with criminal and regulatory authorities, said Kevin Kalinich, global head of Aon’s cyber risk practice. Still, K&R; policies may provide only a quick fix since they were not designed for ransomware. Companies can add coverage for business interruption, but the upper limits for pay-outs are usually lower than for a cyber policy, insurers say. K&R; insurers have been adapting to ransomware-related claims - some are modernizing coverage by setting up Bitcoin accounts for clients to speed up ransom payments, brokers said. But insurers are mindful of their own risks. Some have added deductibles, said Anthony Dagostino, head of global cyber risk at Willis Towers Watson PLC (WLTW.O) advisory and brokerage. AIG has reduced business interruption coverage for K&R; policies to a $1 million maximum for cyber extortion events. “Insurers didn’t anticipate there would be this much ransomware activity,” said Tracie Grella, global head of cyber risk insurance at AIG.

AIG’s stock ticked up after A.M. Best issued its rating, ending the day up 1.3 percent.

934,AIG,AIG teams with IBM to use blockchain for 'smart' insurance policy,"June 14 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc has partnered with International Business Machines Corp to develop a “smart” insurance policy that uses blockchain to manage complex international coverage, the companies said on Wednesday. AIG and IBM completed a pilot of a so-called “smart contract” multi-national policy for Standard Chartered Bank PLC which the companies said is the first of its kind using blockchain’s digital ledger technology. The Standard Chartered policy uses blockchain to facilitate sharing of real-time information for a main policy written in the United Kingdom, where the bank is headquartered, and three local policies in the United States, Singapore and Kenya. Big banks, investors and other financial institutions have invested millions of dollars in blockchain, hoping it could make transactions faster, easier and more secure. IBM has been partnering with leading companies in various industries, including Danish transport company Maersk , to create blockchain-based products that can streamline complex international dealings across sectors. Blockchain technology, which powers the digital currency bitcoin, enables data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets or transactions across all industries. Multinational insurance coverage is often cumbersome because of a maze of international regulations, paperwork, and payment terms. “There’s a lot of back and forth and it’s all through email chains going around the world, instead of a centralized system,” Carol Barton, President of AIG Multinational said in an interview. A master policy is typically issued in the country where a company is headquartered, while affiliates often need coverage in other countries that impose varying rules, documentation, and payment terms. The real-time system allows companies, their units, and insurers, among others, to simultaneously share all data and documents about the policies, the companies said. It also notifies all of those involved about payments. The territories selected for Standard Chartered’s coverage each introduced a level of complexity for testing the technology, IBM said. For example, a Kenya regulation, known as “cash before cover,” requires policyholders to pay for their coverage before it is valid.

941,AIG,"AIG CEO may reduce buybacks, focus on acquisitions","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) new chief executive Brian Duperreault said on Wednesday the company would likely slow the pace of share buybacks and instead spend on acquisitions. “I’d love to find great additions to the company. I think the important thing is that we look at companies that can make us better,” Duperreault told reporters in an interview after the company’s annual general meeting in New York. To meet the objective, AIG would slow the pace and frequency of share buybacks, which have been part of the company’s two-year turnaround plan launched last year by former CEO Peter Hancock. AIG’s goals under the plan have included returning $25 billion of capital to investors by year-end. AIG, which has been the target of activist investors led by billionaire Carl Icahn, has returned $18.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks since announcing the plan. “The likelihood we can continue the pace of share buybacks is low because there are other things I can use the money on,” Duperreault said. “My job is to figure out what’s the best use of the capital and I want a balance,” Duperreault said. AIG named Duperreault, 70, as its CEO in May, selecting a protege of former CEO Hank Greenberg and an industry veteran known for his turnaround expertise. The company’s shareholders on Wednesday approved 2016 compensation for executives, including former CEO Hancock, who said on March 9 that he would depart once the board found a replacement, citing a lack of confidence among directors and investors. Shareholders voted to award Hancock a total compensation of $9.58 million, including a $1.6 million base salary, longer-term incentive pay in stock worth more than $7.8 million and additional funds. Hancock was not awarded a cash bonus for his work last year, after the company’s dismal financial performance roiled shareholders. AIG, the largest U.S. underwriter of commercial property and casualty policies, reported a better-than-expected first-quarter operating profit in May, helped by investment returns and cost cuts. Duperreault plans to look for acquisitions and business opportunities that would boost AIG’s underwriting strengths and revenues, he said. While some of AIG’s businesses have potential to increase, there is less chance of growth in AIG’s commercial business, Duperreault said.  The so-called “middle market,” or medium-sized companies, could provide some opportunities, Duperreault said.

AIG, which has been the target of activist investors led by billionaire Carl Icahn, has returned $18.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks since announcing the plan. “The likelihood we can continue the pace of share buybacks is low because there are other things I can use the money on,” Duperreault said. “My job is to figure out what’s the best use of the capital and I want a balance,” Duperreault said. AIG named Duperreault, 70, as its CEO in May, selecting a protege of former CEO Hank Greenberg and an industry veteran known for his turnaround expertise. The company’s shareholders on Wednesday approved 2016 compensation for executives, including former CEO Hancock, who said on March 9 that he would depart once the board found a replacement, citing a lack of confidence among directors and investors. Shareholders voted to award Hancock a total compensation of $9.58 million, including a $1.6 million base salary, longer-term incentive pay in stock worth more than $7.8 million and additional funds. Hancock was not awarded a cash bonus for his work last year, after the company’s dismal financial performance roiled shareholders. AIG, the largest U.S. underwriter of commercial property and casualty policies, reported a better-than-expected first-quarter operating profit in May, helped by investment returns and cost cuts. Duperreault plans to look for acquisitions and business opportunities that would boost AIG’s underwriting strengths and revenues, he said. While some of AIG’s businesses have potential to increase, there is less chance of growth in AIG’s commercial business, Duperreault said.  The so-called “middle market,” or medium-sized companies, could provide some opportunities, Duperreault said.

Icahn, AIG’s third-largest investor, wants the insurer’s new CEO Brian Duperreault to have an opportunity to boost AIG’s return on equity, the person said.

961,AIG,Senators concerned Icahn is influencing regulators on AIG,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. Democratic senators are raising questions about President Donald Trump’s special adviser, Carl Icahn, asking in a letter on Thursday if the activist investor is attempting to persuade the government to lift its “too big to fail” tag from insurer American International Group. On Friday, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, comprising the chiefs of U.S. financial regulatory agencies, will discuss AIG’s designation as a “systemically important financial institution,” commonly known as one that is “too big to fail.” In an agenda for the meeting, the council did not say which institution it will discuss.  However, there are only two non-banks designated as so large and interconnected that they would ruin the financial system if they failed - AIG and Prudential Insurance (PRU.N). The labels trigger stricter oversight and greater capital requirements. Trump has ordered a review of the designation process, currently at the heart of a lawsuit involving MetLife Inc. (MET.N), which many expect will lead his administration to rescind the current designations to try to lighten regulation it considers burdensome.  In a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse said Icahn has retained “his massive business interests” while advising Trump on regulation, including his sizable investment in AIG (AIG.N).  AIG company received a $182 billion taxpayer bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, which prompted Congress to call for the designations of non-banks in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law as systemically important. Icahn owned a 4.95 percent stake in AIG as of March 31. Concerned about compliance costs, Icahn had publicly pressed AIG to shrink, and tried to convince the FSOC that AIG no longer qualified for the label. Recently though, after AIG sold some assets and appointed a new chief executive, Icahn has not pushed the issue further.      Senators Warren and Whitehouse also noted Icahn met with one current FSOC member, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton, after Clayton was nominated for the position. “Given Mr. Icahn’s recent modification of his position on the breakup of AIG, and his past interactions with administration officials, we write to seek assurances that Mr. Icahn has not provided input on or received information on the pending FSOC decision on AIG’s SIFI status,” they said. The two senators asked about any FSOC measures to ensure  individuals with an interest in its decisions do not inappropriately influence its members. They also asked if any members are subject to recusal on AIG because of interactions with Icahn, and about any staff-level conversations regarding Icahn’s investments. AIG declined to comment, and the White House and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.

962,AIG,UPDATE 1-AIA Group posts 42 pct increase in first-half new business,"(Reuters) - AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK), the world’s third-largest life insurer by market value, posted a 42 percent surge in new business for the first half of the year, helped by robust sales growth in its main markets, Hong Kong and China. AIA’s value of new business, which measures expected profits from new premiums and is a key gauge for future growth, surged to $1.75 billion in the half-yearly period that ends in May, up from $1.26 billion a year ago, the company said. The insurer’s operating profit after tax rose 16 percent in the first half to $2.26 billion, up from $1.96 billion in the year-ago period, AIA said in a statement to the stock exchange on Friday. China and Hong Kong together account for about half of new business growth globally at AIA, founded in Shanghai nearly 100 years ago and the first foreign insurer to be granted a license in China.    AIA, which listed in Hong Kong in 2010 after a spin-off from bailed-out U.S. insurer AIG, said Hong Kong delivered new business growth of 54 percent from the year-ago period to $828 million in first half of 2017.    The company’s China business posted growth of 65 percent in new business, to $434 million.Besides China and Hong Kong, the insurer does  business  in Asia in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea.    Asia is a battleground for insurers such as AIA, Sun Life Financial (SLF.TO) and a host of local players attracted by the region’s lower insurance penetration levels and faster growth rates for insurance premiums than in the Western markets.

Senators Warren and Whitehouse also noted Icahn met with one current FSOC member, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton, after Clayton was nominated for the position. “Given Mr. Icahn’s recent modification of his position on the breakup of AIG, and his past interactions with administration officials, we write to seek assurances that Mr. Icahn has not provided input on or received information on the pending FSOC decision on AIG’s SIFI status,” they said. The two senators asked about any FSOC measures to ensure  individuals with an interest in its decisions do not inappropriately influence its members. They also asked if any members are subject to recusal on AIG because of interactions with Icahn, and about any staff-level conversations regarding Icahn’s investments. AIG declined to comment, and the White House and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.

Operating earnings attributable to AIG was $1.45 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with $1.31 billion, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier. Pre-tax operating profit in the company’s consumer insurance business rose 33 percent to $1.26 billion, helped by improved underwriting, cost cuts and stable earnings from retirement businesses.  The results come at a time when AIG’s new chief executive, Brian Duperreault, looks to bolster its businesses through acquisitions, while slowing the pace of share buybacks under its two-year turnaround plan.    Duperreault, a protégé of former CEO Hank Greenberg and an industry veteran known for his turnaround expertise, was named to the top job in May, replacing Peter Hancock. “While market conditions remain challenging, we are committed to disciplined underwriting and are focused on investing in profitable growth,” Duperreault said. Expenses fell 15.6 percent to $2.18 billion, helped by the sale of United Guaranty Corp and AIG Advisor Group. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who is the insurer’s third-largest investor, had pushed for a major overhaul of the company, calling for its breakup to shed its designation as a non-bank systematically important financial institution.

972,AIG,Greater China cyber insurance demand set to soar after WannaCry attack -AIG,"HONG KONG, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Demand for cyber insurance from firms in Greater China and elsewhere in Asia is poised to soar, based on enquiries received after the “WannaCry ransomware” attack earlier this year, executives at American International Group Inc said. The American insurer saw an 87 percent jump in enquiries for cyber insurance policies in May compared to April for Greater China including Hong Kong as a direct result of the WannaCry attack, while the global increase was 38 percent, they said. “The big increase means the organizations are aware they really need protection,” Cynthia Sze, head of an AIG business in Greater China that provides solutions to companies dealing with cyber breaches, told reporters. AIG executives declined to give details on numbers or say how many of the enquiries actually resulted in policy sales. The self-replicating WannaCry malware in May infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries. A typical cyber insurance policy can protect companies against extortion like ransomware attacks. It could also cover the investigation costs and pay the ransom. In Hong Kong, which is dominated by small and medium sized enterprises, the impact of a cyber attack could be severe as cyber threats are not a priority given the limited resources of SMEs, said Sze. Citing Hong Kong police statistics, Sze said computer security incident reports have grown to about 6,000 last year from 1,500 in 2009. Financial losses resulting from such incidents jumped from HK$45 million ($5.76 million) to HK$2.3 billion over the same period, she said. Hong Kong police did not immediately respond to a request for comment to confirm the numbers. “WannaCry has really changed the dynamics. We used to tap large multinational companies that understood where the exposure was. Now we are really talking about mid-market and SMEs,” said Jason Kelly, AIG’s head of liabilities and financial lines for Greater China, Australasia and South Korea. The global market for cyber insurance is worth $2 billion, with 30 percent of middle to large firms purchasing cyber insurance protection, according to AIG. The insurer has also seen an average annual growth rate of 20 to 25 percent in cyber insurance policies over the past three years worldwide, said Kelly. Insurance companies have been cautiously entering the cyber insurance market as they look for growth amid stiff competition and potential exposure to cyber breaches. According to Kelly, the annual damage from hackers to the global economy reached about $400 billion in 2015.

973,AIG,UPDATE 2-AIG shops $2 bln death benefits portfolio -sources,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc wants to sell a $2 billion portfolio of life settlements that would pay out when sick or elderly customers die, two people familiar with the matter said. AIG, the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, is working with investment bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc to unload the assets, said the sources, who were not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly. Apollo Global Management LLC is looking at buying at least some of the policies, one of the sources said. Parties including Blackstone Group LP have purchased similar life settlements, or “death benefits” from AIG in previous transactions, the people said. AIG declined to comment on the potential sale, which pertains to old assets the insurer is trying to sell or wind down. However, AIG spokesman Kenneth Juarez said the company is committed to its core life insurance business. “We are making investments to grow it by collaborating with our distribution partners and strengthening our service platforms, resulting in increased sales,” he said. “In the U.S., our total sales are at the highest level achieved since 2008.” Representatives for Goldman, Apollo and Blackstone declined to comment. Large private equity firms like Apollo have carved out a niche business in acquiring death benefits, typically sold by terminally ill or elderly customers who need cash. Investors try to buy the policies at a price that is less than the payouts they would receive when the customers die. The potential sale comes as AIG nears the end of a years-long divestiture spree of businesses around the globe that has cut its balance sheet by more than half since 2007. Its new chief executive officer, Brian Duperreault, is focused on growing core commercial and consumer businesses, but there is still a small pocket of “legacy” assets that AIG is trying to sell or wind down, which includes the life settlements. AIG already sold a $1.4 billion death benefits portfolio at a loss of $89 million, and valued remaining assets at $2.1 billion as of June 30. AIG also sold a Japanese life insurance subsidiary in April, an Asian mortgage insurance business in July and is in the process of completing a sale of certain operations in Latin America.

977,AIG,"AIG returns to pre-bailout paydays for CEO, top executives","NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) new Chief Executive Brian Duperreault has pledged to revive the insurer’s glory days of top talent, underwriting discipline and fat profit margins. One thing he has already brought back: big pay packages. As he rejoined AIG in May, the 70-year-old insurance industry veteran received bigger awards than any of his predecessors since Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the man who built the company into a behemoth and left under a cloud in 2005. Duperreault quickly hired as his deputy Peter Zaffino, a former colleague at broker Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc (MMC.N), with a lucrative sign-on bonus, as well as a senior executive to head technology initiatives.  Shareholders are banking that these costly personnel moves will pay off, after watching AIG stock underperform rivals and the broader market for nearly a decade. “He (Duperreault) comes with a visible long-term track record in terms of inspiring the operations and leading the personnel,” said Mac Sykes, an analyst at investment firm Gabelli & Co, which owned about $58 million worth of AIG shares as of June 30. “It’s what AIG needs at this point.” Sykes and others said they have no issue with Duperreault’s handsome pay package, as long as he performs. “We didn’t react in a negative way, especially because they’re going to make a lot more money if they execute,” said a portfolio manager whose fund owns a large AIG stake, but was not authorized to speak about it publicly. In addition to a $16 million annual package for 2017, Duperreault received $12 million in cash for shares he forfeited from Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd, an insurance company he co-founded and led in his native Bermuda. On top of that he got options to buy up to 1.5 million AIG shares dependent on the share price hitting certain targets over the next seven years. AIG also agreed to pay Hamilton $40 million to get Duperreault out of a noncompete agreement and bought the company’s U.S. unit for $110 million. Excluding the sign-on award, Duperreault’s annual package is similar in size and structure to what CEOs of major rivals Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and MetLife Inc (MET.N) received for 2016. AIG spokeswoman Cindy Leggett-Flynn declined to comment on Duperreault’s compensation or the other payments required to bring him on board.     But there can be risks to big pay packages if they do not properly incentivize executives, pay consultants said. AIG learned that the hard way when it nearly collapsed in 2008 due to massive exposure to derivatives based on plunging property prices, and needed a $182 billion taxpayer-funded bailout by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury. After that, AIG withheld awards from some executives for inappropriate risk-taking, and paid its new CEO a nominal $1 salary in 2008. The company kept a lid on CEO pay throughout the period it was supported by the U.S. government, which ended in 2013. For a graphic showing AIG CEO pay since 2004, click on tmsnrt.rs/2fSflV9 Corporate governance experts said they were most concerned about the structure of Duperreault’s longer-term stock option awards. To cash in the maximum number of his stock options, he must raise AIG’s stock price by $30, or about 50 percent of its current value, within the next seven years and it must stay at that level for 20 consecutive trading days. The earliest he could exercise all his options, if the share price hits certain levels, would be three years.  That could encourage aggressive risk-taking for short-term profits that ultimately harm the company, some experts said. Duperreault’s options could vest more quickly than it may take for long-term risks he takes on to become apparent, said Adam Kolasinski, an executive compensation expert who teaches finance at Texas A&M; University. “If I were a board member, I would be very happy to grant a pay package even more generous than this one, provided it created good incentives,” said Kolasinski. “I am afraid this one does not.” Recruiters, consultants and industry sources said AIG had little choice but to spend a small fortune to get Duperreault to leave a firm where he was comfortable and well paid, to take a difficult job that few wanted. His predecessor, Peter Hancock, left under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who was unhappy at dismal results and a static share price. Revamping AIG will require all Duperreault’s leadership skills and insurance know-how. He spent more than 20 years at AIG at the start of his career before transforming ACE Ltd into a global insurance powerhouse, revamping a troubled Marsh & McLennan and co-founding Hamilton before returning to AIG as CEO. “How many people can step into that job?” asked David Larcker, director of the Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “It’s a pretty small set.” Duperreault is the first AIG CEO in a decade to focus on growth and investment rather than divestitures and cost-cutting in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Investors are hoping this is the right approach, given AIG’s sluggish share price growth since the crisis. AIG’s stock closed at $60.78 on Friday, down 7 percent this year, compared to a 9 percent rise in the S&P; 500 index. The stock must hit $90.99 for Duperreault to exercise the maximum number of his stock options over the next seven years, a challenge Wall Street is ready to see him take on. “I’d rather see a package like this on the entry than a golden parachute on the exit,” said Jeff Wilson, an equity analyst at Scharf Investments LLC, which owned about $186 million in  AIG stock as of June 30.

For a graphic showing AIG CEO pay since 2004, click on tmsnrt.rs/2fSflV9 Corporate governance experts said they were most concerned about the structure of Duperreault’s longer-term stock option awards. To cash in the maximum number of his stock options, he must raise AIG’s stock price by $30, or about 50 percent of its current value, within the next seven years and it must stay at that level for 20 consecutive trading days. The earliest he could exercise all his options, if the share price hits certain levels, would be three years. That could encourage aggressive risk-taking for short-term profits that ultimately harm the company, some experts said. Duperreault’s options could vest more quickly than it may take for long-term risks he takes on to become apparent, said Adam Kolasinski, an executive compensation expert who teaches finance at Texas A&M; University. “If I were a board member, I would be very happy to grant a pay package even more generous than this one, provided it created good incentives,” said Kolasinski. “I am afraid this one does not.” Recruiters, consultants and industry sources said AIG had little choice but to spend a small fortune to get Duperreault to leave a firm where he was comfortable and well paid, to take a difficult job that few wanted. His predecessor, Peter Hancock, left under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who was unhappy at dismal results and a static share price. Revamping AIG will require all Duperreault’s leadership skills and insurance know-how. He spent more than 20 years at AIG at the start of his career before transforming ACE Ltd into a global insurance powerhouse, revamping a troubled Marsh & McLennan and co-founding Hamilton before returning to AIG as CEO. “How many people can step into that job?” asked David Larcker, director of the Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “It’s a pretty small set.” Duperreault is the first AIG CEO in a decade to focus on growth and investment rather than divestitures and cost-cutting in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Investors are hoping this is the right approach, given AIG’s sluggish share price growth since the crisis. AIG’s stock closed at $60.78 on Friday, down 7 percent this year, compared to a 9 percent rise in the S&P; 500 index. The stock must hit $90.99 for Duperreault to exercise the maximum number of his stock options over the next seven years, a challenge Wall Street is ready to see him take on. “I’d rather see a package like this on the entry than a golden parachute on the exit,” said Jeff Wilson, an equity analyst at Scharf Investments LLC, which owned about $186 million in  AIG stock as of June 30.

983,AIG,Ex-AIG chief Greenberg can pursue Spitzer defamation lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, former chief executive of American International Group Inc, may pursue large parts of his defamation lawsuit against former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a New York state appeals court ruled. Wednesday’s decision by the Appellate Division in Brooklyn, New York came seven months after Greenberg, 92, reached a $9 million settlement with Eric Schneiderman, the current state attorney general, of civil accounting fraud charges first brought by Spitzer in 2005. The complaint “adequately stated that Spitzer acted with actual malice” in criticizing Greenberg, hoping to damage Greenberg’s reputation and career while bolstering his own, Justice Cheryl Chambers wrote for a four-judge panel. Greenberg and Spitzer were appealing a June 2014 lower court ruling letting Greenberg pursue part of his case. The appeals court restored some claims that Greenberg brought against his longtime nemesis. “I look forward to proving the truthfulness of all the statements I have made about Hank Greenberg’s behavior as CEO of AIG,” Spitzer said in an email. “A decade of legal obstructionism by Greenberg will not obscure the facts.” David Boies, Greenberg’s longtime lawyer, said in an email: “We are, of course, pleased with the appellate court’s decision, which will now permit Mr. Greenberg’s claims to proceed to trial,” The lawsuit arose from statements Spitzer made in television interviews in 2012 and a book, “Protecting Capitalism Case By Case,” in 2013. Greenberg said Spitzer falsely implicated him in fraud at AIG, and suggested he was “removed” or “thrown out” by the insurer’s board because of his role, among other allegations. The appeals court said Spitzer’s background as attorney general could have left people “less skeptical” and “more willing” to believe him, including when he told then-CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo that “Hank Greenberg at AIG committed fraud. The record on that is indisputable.” It said the lower court judge erred in dismissing claims over statements tying Greenberg’s 2005 exit from AIG to fraud there, citing a lack of evidence of such a link. AIG in 2006 paid $1.64 billion to settle regulatory probes of its business practices. Two years later, it received what became a $182.3 billion federal bailout. In May, a federal appeals court said Greenberg’s Starr International Co, a big AIG shareholder, had no legal right to challenge that bailout. Starr had sought more than $40 billion of damages for shareholders. After serving as attorney general, Spitzer was New York’s governor for 15 months.

986,AIG,"AIG to restructure into three new units, marking CEO's first big move","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said on Monday it will reorganize into three new units and will no longer have separate commercial and consumer businesses, marking the first major strategic move by new Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault.  Under the new structure, AIG will have a general insurance business, a life and retirement unit and a stand-alone technology unit. Two of those businesses will be led by longtime colleagues Duperreault recruited to AIG in July. The shakeup marks Duperreault’s first major restructuring action after taking the helm of the company in May. Former CEO Peter Hancock stepped down, citing a lack of confidence from the board and investors. Widely seen as a turnaround expert, Duperreault, 70, has said he wants to grow AIG’s businesses. The insurer’s stock has underperformed rivals and the broader market for almost a decade since its near collapse and $182 billion taxpayer-funded bailout during the financial crisis in 2008. AIG shares rose 0.5 percent on Monday, closing at $61.01. For his leadership team, Duperreault selected Peter Zaffino to be CEO of AIG’s general insurance unit. Formerly head of Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc’s (MMC.N) brokerage business, he was previously Duperreault’s choice as AIG’s chief operating officer. Kevin Hogan will head the new life and retirement unit. An AIG veteran, he most recently ran the consumer insurance unit.  Seraina Macia will be CEO of the technology unit, AIG said. She is the former head of Hamilton USA, North American arm of Duperreault’s former company, Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd.  AIG agreed to buy Hamilton USA for $110 million in May. The insurer also named a new general counsel, Lucy Fato, on Sept. 5. Rob Schimek, CEO of AIG’s commercial unit, will leave the company at the end of October, AIG said. “I could not be more proud of what this company has accomplished over the last 12 years, from navigating the financial crisis and winning back the confidence of our partners and clients, to focusing on innovations that have outpaced the market,” Schimek wrote in an memo to AIG employees. The restructuring “better aligns with how investors actually prefer to analyze AIG,” said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Duperreault’s changes place a greater focus on product underwriting rather than on AIG’s relationships to clients, said Credit Suisse analyst Ryan Tunis in a note. AIG still needs more hires with commercial underwriting expertise, Tunis said. AIG said it expects its year-end financial reporting to reflect the new structure, which will also be aligned with its incentive and performance management plans. The insurer has been trying to convince U.S. regulators to shed its “systemically important financial institution” label, which triggers stricter oversight and greater capital requirements. AIG received the label after the bailout by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury during the financial crisis. Since then, AIG has sold dozens of businesses, including two Asian life insurance operations and one of the world’s biggest aircraft leasing businesses.  It recently sold a mortgage-insurance unit. It remains the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada.

988,AIG,"Wall St. declines on tech selloff, North Korea concern","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street dipped on Monday, as a selloff in technology shares  weighed heavily on the Nasdaq, while the most recent statement from North Korea’s to Washington added to a cautious tone. North Korea’s foreign minister said President Donald Trump had declared war on the country and it reserved the right to take countermeasures, including shooting down U.S. bombers even if they are not in its airspace. The White House disputed the declaration, calling the suggestion “absurd.” The comments buoyed safe-haven assets, those that are favored by investors in times of crisis, with gold XAU= up 1 percent and the Japanese yen strengthened 0.26 percent versus the greenback at 111.71 per dollar.  “The North Korea narrative is not going away and the longer it remains part of the conversation, the more negative it becomes,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.   The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a widely followed measure of market anxiety, hit a 2-week high of 11.21 and was last up 0.63 points at 10.22.     Tech names such as Facebook (FB.O), off 4.5 percent, Microsoft (MSFT.O), down 1.55 percent, and Apple (AAPL.O), off 0.88 percent, were among the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P; 500 index. Apple shares flirted with correction territory following a report that the company had told suppliers to scale back shipments of parts for its upcoming iPhone X.   “There has been some disappointment in the reception of Apple’s latest iPhone release, and that is driving some concern and that is bleeding through to the supply-chain names,” said Kenny.  The S&P; technology index .SPLRCT slid 1.42 percent, its worst daily performance in five weeks. The index remains the best performing of the 11 major S&P; sectors this year, however, with a rise of nearly 23 percent. The losses in tech were offset somewhat by a sharp climb in the energy sector, which gained 1.47 percent. The sector notched its sixteenth gain in the last 18 sessions. Oil prices hit a more than two-year high after major producers said the global market was on its way towards rebalancing, while Turkey threatened to cut oil flows from Iraq’s Kurdistan region toward its ports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 53.84 points, or 0.24 percent, to 22,295.75, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 5.56 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,496.66 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 56.33 points, or 0.88 percent, to 6,370.59. Genuine Parts (GPC.N) shares jumped 5.96 percent as the best performer on the S&P; 500 after the car parts distributor said it would enter the European market with a deal to buy peer Alliance Automotive Group for about $2 billion. Allergan (AGN.N) was up 3.40 percent after the drugmaker authorized a $2 billion buyback of its shares. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) means AIG - which received a $182 billion U.S. government bailout during the 2007-09 global financial crisis - no longer needs to adhere to a stricter regulatory regime, including holding extra capital. “The Council has worked diligently to thoroughly reevaluate whether AIG poses a risk to financial stability,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “This action demonstrates our commitment to act decisively to remove any designation if a company does not pose a threat to financial stability.” (Reporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",9292017,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-fsoc/u-s-regulatory-council-votes-to-remove-aigs-systemically-risky-label-idUSL2N1MA0QX
993,AIG,U.S. regulatory council votes to take AIG off 'systemically risky' list,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A panel of U.S. financial regulators voted on Friday to release American International Group (AIG.N) from stricter government oversight, marking the insurance giant’s rehabilitation since a massive bailout during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.   The U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) determined that AIG - which received a $182 billion U.S. government bailout - is no longer critical to the health of the global financial system after shedding billions of dollars in assets. The decision reflects the changing tone towards financial regulation under Republican President Donald Trump, who in April ordered a review of how FSOC determines which companies are systemically risky as part his broader pledge to ease post-crisis rules. “The Council has worked diligently to thoroughly reevaluate whether AIG poses a risk to financial stability,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  “This action demonstrates our commitment to act decisively to remove any designation if a company does not pose a threat to financial stability.” The move frees AIG from stricter federal oversight, including tougher capital rules. The company’s shares rose 1 percent in after-hours trading. AIG’s huge pile of credit derivatives helped spark the global financial crisis, and the company quickly became a focus of public outrage when employee bonuses were paid after the government bailout in September 2008. The labeling of major financial institutions as  systemically important had its roots in AIG’s rescue, which came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book.  Worried the insurance giant was “too big to fail,” the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system. The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012, with a profit of $22.7 billion, according to AIG. Since the crisis, AIG, which remains the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, has sold dozens of businesses, including two Asian life insurance operations and one of the world’s biggest aircraft leasing businesses. It  recently sold a mortgage-insurance unit.  “The Council’s decision reflects the substantial and successful de-risking that AIG’s employees have achieved since 2008,” AIG President and CEO Brian Duperreault said in a statement.    “The company is committed to continued vigilant risk management and to working closely with our numerous regulators to enable a strong AIG to continue to serve our clients.” The FSOC, which comprises the heads of financial regulators across the government, requires a two-thirds majority to agree to remove a company’s designation as a “systemically important financial institution” or SIFI.  With four appointees of President Barack Obama still holding FSOC seats, the regulatory panel did not move to remove the label when it last met. On Friday, however, the panel managed to secure the vote of one of these Obama appointees - Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, according to the Treasury statement. The remaining three Obama appointees voted against while four Trump appointees voted in favor. By law, all banks with over $50 billion in assets are automatically considered SIFIs, while the FSOC can apply the label to nonbanks on a case-by-case basis. The panel only once before has removed a SIFI designation with GE Capital in 2016.  Th FSOC’s decision on Friday left Prudential (PRU.N) as the only remaining nonbank “systemically important financial institution”. In a statement late on Friday, Prudential said it was encouraged by FSOC’s move and would consider its options while contesting its designation through the review process. “Prudential has long maintained that we do not meet the standard for designation,” it said. “With today’s action, now only one company is subjected to duplicative oversight—creating an unbalanced playing field and illustrating the arbitrary nature of individual designations.”  A third insurance company, Metlife(MET.N), had also received the SIFI label, but mounted a legal challenge against the decision. A federal court ruled in the company’s favor. That decision was appealed by the government under President Barack Obama and remains pending in an appeals court.

994,AIG,UPDATE 3-U.S. regulatory council votes to take AIG off 'systemically risky' list,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A panel of U.S. financial regulators voted on Friday to release American International Group (AIG.N) from stricter government oversight, marking the insurance giant’s rehabilitation since a massive bailout during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.   The U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) determined that AIG - which received a $182 billion U.S. government bailout - is no longer critical to the health of the global financial system after shedding billions of dollars in assets. The decision reflects the changing tone towards financial regulation under Republican President Donald Trump, who in April ordered a review of how FSOC determines which companies are systemically risky as part his broader pledge to ease post-crisis rules. “The Council has worked diligently to thoroughly reevaluate whether AIG poses a risk to financial stability,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  “This action demonstrates our commitment to act decisively to remove any designation if a company does not pose a threat to financial stability.” The move frees AIG from stricter federal oversight, including tougher capital rules. The company’s shares rose 1 percent in after-hours trading. AIG’s huge pile of credit derivatives helped spark the global financial crisis, and the company quickly became a focus of public outrage when employee bonuses were paid after the government bailout in September 2008. The labeling of major financial institutions as  systemically important had its roots in AIG’s rescue, which came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book.  Worried the insurance giant was “too big to fail,” the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system. The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012, with a profit of $22.7 billion, according to AIG. Since the crisis, AIG, which remains the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, has sold dozens of businesses, including two Asian life insurance operations and one of the world’s biggest aircraft leasing businesses. It  recently sold a mortgage-insurance unit.  “The Council’s decision reflects the substantial and successful de-risking that AIG’s employees have achieved since 2008,” AIG President and CEO Brian Duperreault said in a statement.    “The company is committed to continued vigilant risk management and to working closely with our numerous regulators to enable a strong AIG to continue to serve our clients.” The FSOC, which comprises the heads of financial regulators across the government, requires a two-thirds majority to agree to remove a company’s designation as a “systemically important financial institution” or SIFI.  With four appointees of President Barack Obama still holding FSOC seats, the regulatory panel did not move to remove the label when it last met. On Friday, however, the panel managed to secure the vote of one of these Obama appointees - Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, according to the Treasury statement. The remaining three Obama appointees voted against while four Trump appointees voted in favor. By law, all banks with over $50 billion in assets are automatically considered SIFIs, while the FSOC can apply the label to nonbanks on a case-by-case basis. The panel only once before has removed a SIFI designation with GE Capital in 2016.  Th FSOC’s decision on Friday left Prudential (PRU.N) as the only remaining nonbank “systemically important financial institution”. In a statement late on Friday, Prudential said it was encouraged by FSOC’s move and would consider its options while contesting its designation through the review process. “Prudential has long maintained that we do not meet the standard for designation,” it said. “With today’s action, now only one company is subjected to duplicative oversight—creating an unbalanced playing field and illustrating the arbitrary nature of individual designations.”  A third insurance company, Metlife(MET.N), had also received the SIFI label, but mounted a legal challenge against the decision. A federal court ruled in the company’s favor. That decision was appealed by the government under President Barack Obama and remains pending in an appeals court. FSOC’s move to strip AIG of the label was criticized by public advocacy groups that said it would allow the company to return to its risky pre-crisis behavior. “It is an historic mistake and a slap in the face to the tens of millions of Americans who suffered and continue to suffer from the devastating 2008 financial crash,” Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets, said in a statement.

997,AIG,Britain plans new sukuk deal; Brexit may boost Islamic finance,"* Sukuk may boost UK Islamic finance in focus on non-EU business * New sukuk could raise 1 bln stg - consultant * AIG, Lloyd’s looking to expand in Islamic insurance By Bernardo Vizcaino and Carolyn Cohn LONDON/SYDNEY, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Britain plans to reissue Islamic bonds in 2019, a government official told Reuters, in a sign the country’s exit from the European Union may accelerate plans to develop an Islamic finance industry. In 2014, Britain became the first Western country to issue an Islamic bond or sukuk, raising 200 million pounds ($268 million) from a five-year deal that was 10 times oversubscribed. British government officials said at the time this was a one-off transaction rather than part of a regular programme. But a Treasury spokesperson said the UK government now planned to reissue the bonds when they mature in 2019. “The UK is the leading Western centre for Islamic finance and the government is committed to ensuring the future success of the sector,” the Treasury spokesperson said. Brexit could threaten London’s dominance as a financial centre by potentially making it more difficult for London-based companies to sell products across the EU. A Reuters survey showed around 10,000 finance jobs may shift out of Britain or be created overseas in the next few years because of Brexit, with Frankfurt and Paris benefiting most. Bilal Khan, co-chairman and partner at London-based Islamic finance consultancy Dome Advisory, said developing Islamic finance was one way to counteract this, by strengthening London’s ties with Southeast Asia and the Gulf, the world’s two top centres for Islamic banking. “Brexit has increased the government’s interest in Islamic finance. Because of Brexit, the UK is keen to build economic links with non-EU countries,” said Khan, who also serves as a senior advisor to a parliamentary group on Islamic finance. He said a second sovereign sukuk issue by Britain might be expanded to raise as much as 1 billion pounds. Islamic finance follows religious principles such as bans on gambling and outright speculation, with interest-bearing products deemed off-limits. There are more than 20 firms in Britain that offer sharia-compliant financial products, the most of any other Western country. This includes five Islamic banks: Gatehouse Bank, Qatari-owned Al Rayan Bank, Bank of London and the Middle East , Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and a unit of Qatar Islamic Bank. Issuance of sukuk globally stands at around $342 billion. On the London Stock Exchange there are 65 sukuk listed totalling $48 billion, making it a major listing centre. Within the EU, Luxembourg also issued a sovereign sukuk in 2014, becoming the first AAA-rated government to issue a euro-denominated Islamic bond. In April, Britain’s central bank took a step towards developing an Islamic money market, saying it would create sharia-compliant liquidity tools for use by Islamic banks. This would help the UK’s domestic Islamic banks, but none of them were hired for the sale of Britain’s debut sukuk and there is no indication this might change, Harris Irfan, Managing Director of Cordoba Capital, said. “The City and the UK economy will need a new killer product in the Islamic finance space to really compete again.” The industry might have to look beyond traditional areas such as real estate to something more fundamental such as investment into the UK mid-market, something Islamic finance has not cracked yet, Irfan said, referring to mid-market companies. Richard Segal, analyst at Manulife Asset Management, said government upheavals following the Brexit vote last year might make it harder to develop the Islamic bond market. “(The sukuk) was an interesting experiment, but without a natural target market. When (George) Osborne was running the Treasury, there was scope for these kinds of experiments ... but nowadays priorities and personalities are different.” There are also Islamic finance opportunities in the insurance business. This year insurer AIG, working with London-based Cobalt Underwriting, introduced its first sharia-compliant mergers and acquisitions insurance policy in the Middle East. The policy covered a deal by a private equity fund of an asset in the United Arab Emirates, Mark Storrie, AIG’s emerging markets M&A; manager, said. Kaan Yardimci, executive for international market development at the Lloyd’s of London insurance market, told an industry briefing last month that London should seek a range of opportunities in Islamic insurance and reinsurance. “We already have a number of syndicates that have an Islamic insurance capability. We simply do not think this is enough. We want Lloyd’s to punch in line with its weight in the global insurance market.” (Editing by Andrew Torchia and Jane Merriman)",10022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/islamic-finance-britain/britain-plans-new-sukuk-deal-brexit-may-boost-islamic-finance-idUSL5N1M10AQ

999,AIG,Fed's Yellen says AIG's threat to stability is reduced after downsizing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) poses less of a threat to financial stability because it shrank its assets by more than $500 billion, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Monday in explaining why she voted in favor of releasing the company from stricter oversight. Her comments and others published by regulators on Monday shed light on a process financial firms say is too opaque and unaccountable, indicating big banks and insurers will have to downsize dramatically if they are to shake off the “systemically risky” label. The comments also expose ongoing divisions among financial regulators over how to determine if a company is systemically risky a decade since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis began. The U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) said on Friday that AIG - which received a $182 billion U.S. government bailout during the crisis - is no longer critical to the health of the U.S. financial system. “Since the financial crisis, AIG has largely sold off or wound down its capital markets businesses, and has become a smaller firm that poses less of a threat to financial stability,” Yellen said in the statement. “The possibility of de-designation provides an incentive for designated firms to significantly reduce their systemic footprint,” she added.

1006,AIG,Ending AIG's systemic-risk status raises questions on stability body's role,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - A recent decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to rescind the systemically important financial institution designation of insurer AIG(here) signals more than a change in perception of riskiness of that particular firm, but raises questions about the future of the council created under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Currently, only Prudential still remains a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, out of the four non-bank institutions (AIG, Prudential, MetLife, and General Electric) that were initially designated as such by the intergovernmental council, also known as FSOC MetLife, having won a legal battle to remove its own SIFI designation in 2016 is currently entangled in a legal battle with the council over an appeals process. Without a non-bank SIFI entity to oversee, the FSOC may soon become an ineffective regulatory body, devoid of one of its primary authorities, namely, to monitor and reduce systemic risk in the financial system. “The council has worked diligently to thoroughly reevaluate whether AIG poses a risk to financial stability,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after FSOC decided to remove AIG’s SIFI designation. “This action demonstrates our commitment to act decisively to remove any designation if a company does not pose a threat to financial stability,” he added. AIG’s collapse after becoming a major player in credit default swaps was a significant trigger of the 2008 financial crisis, and it received a $182 billion U.S. government bailout.  The FSOC decision means that AIG — despite its gigantic size — will, from now on, be primarily supervised by state insurance regulators. And while AIG has reduced its systemic risk footprint by shrinking itself through numerous divestitures, and improving its capitalization since being designated as a SIFI, it remains a major, globally connected insurance company with total assets of half a trillion dollars. The decision to remove AIG’s SIFI designation came amid political pressure. The move is in line with President Donald Trump’s deregulatory policy. The president ordered a review of FSOC’s SIFI designation process in April 2017, essentially questioning the validity of its past decision-making mechanism on the matter. It also follows a “de-sification” trend that started before Trump took office, when GE Capital successfully shed the label in June 2016. The company completely revamped its operations — selling more than $200 billion in lending assets in the process, shifting to a more digital-oriented business model, and revising its funding.  However, while the council’s vote to rescind GE Capital’s SIFI designation was unanimous, its votes fell along more partisan lines in the case of AIG, with the exception of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who sided with the five regulators recently appointed by the Trump Administration. As such, the council barely reached the minimum 6-3 vote, a two-thirds majority, required to remove a SIFI designation. Critically, the FSOC representative for state insurance regulators, which provide primary regulation for the insurance industry, has only a non-voting seat on the council. The basis of FSOC’s decision — whether it was politically motivated or taken based on an objective evaluation of AIG’s risk profile — may only become clear when the council decides on designating another non-bank entity as a SIFI in the future.  FSOC came into being in the wake of the financial crisis with the goal of identifying emerging risks in the financial system –and measuring their magnitude. It has the power to designate non-banks it deemed as systemically important, for stricter prudential oversight, addressing the moral hazard problem by eliminating expectations that the government will bail out a firm.  To date, the council, which comprises 10 voting members from regulatory entities together and is chaired by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, remains the only governmental entity with the power and duty to analyze and regulate systemically significant non-bank financial institutions.  In contrast to banks, where any entity with more than $50 billion assets under management automatically is deemed systemically important, non-banks are examined on a case-by-case basis.  The designation as a SIFI entails adherence to enhanced prudential standards, including stringent reporting standards, additional capital, detailed recovery and resolution plans, credit exposure limits, and liquidity stress tests. The council has been criticized, most sharply in March, by Republican senators(here). They have said the council has shortcomings in metrics and analytical frameworks in evaluating firms for the SIFI designation, lacks transparency in the process, and has failed to provide a clear roadmap for designated SIFI firms to remove the label. Insurance industry groups, which have been promoting an “activities-based approach” rather than “institution-based approach” to risk oversight, welcomed the decision.  “Designating a handful of insurance companies as SIFIs and subjecting them to bank-like federal regulations and capital requirement does nothing to reduce true systemic risk and instead drives up the cost of financial protection products and services,” said David A. Sampson, president and CEO of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI) in a statement. “The overwhelming consensus among insurance experts is that traditional insurance activities are not systemically risky,” he added. If MetLife’s business decisions in the wake of its removal of SIFI designation serve as an indication, however, the FSOC decision may have unintended consequences of increasing systemic riskiness in the sector.  MetLife has followed an aggressive share-repurchase strategy since then, eventually intending to buy a total of $3 billion in stock.  AIG’s top brass did not wait for the official removal of the SIFI label to reveal its ambitions, when its CEO Brian Duperreault at the firm’s annual meeting in June hinted at company’s plans to expand through acquisitions.

1008,AIG,"UPDATE 1-AIA Group's new business climbs 20 pct helped by China, Hong Kong","(Reuters) - AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK), the world’s third-largest life insurer by market value, clocked a 20 percent increase in new business in the third quarter aided by strong sales in its main markets of China and Hong Kong. China and Hong Kong together account for about half of new business growth globally at AIA, originally founded in Shanghai nearly 100 years ago and the first foreign insurer to be granted a license in China. AIA said the value of new business, which measures expected profits from new premiums and is a key gauge for future growth, rose to $824 million in the quarter, just ahead of an average estimate of $813 million from three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares in AIA were, however, down 2.3 percent in Hong Kong morning trade, bucking the broader rising market. The stock has gained as much as 32 percent in the last three quarters.     The Hong Kong insurer last month agreed to buy the insurance unit of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) for $3.1 billion, in the biggest Asian buyout of an Australian financial firm. The acquisition will help AIA, which had free surplus cash of nearly $11 billion as of end May, diversify its main markets with Hong Kong and China together accounting for about half of new business growth now at the insurer. The insurer’s regional business presence also includes Thailand Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea. AIA, which listed in Hong Kong in 2010 after a spin-off from bailed-out U.S. insurer AIG, said China continued to be the insurer’s fastest growing business in the third quarter while Hong Kong delivered double-digit new business growth. Asia is a battleground for insurers such as AIA, Sun Life Financial (SLF.TO) and a host of local players attracted by the region’s lower insurance penetration levels and faster growth rates for insurance premiums than in the Western markets.

1010,AIG,AIG to include cyber coverage to commercial casualty insurance," NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said it would include cyber coverage to its commercial casualty insurance during the first quarter of 2018, a move that would boost rates but make it clearer how customers are covered if they are the victim of a security breach.  The change is part of the insurance giant's effort to shift from issuing policies that do not specify whether cyber losses are covered, said Tracie Grella, AIG's Global Head of Cyber Risk Insurance, while on the sidelines of a cyber risk conference in New York on Thursday.  AIG is in the process of reviewing all types of coverage it offers to gauge its exposure to cyber risk, Grella said.  Cyber coverage is a mounting concern for companies worldwide as hackers increasingly take aim at their technology systems.  In September, Equifax Inc (EFX.N), a provider of consumer credit scores, disclosed that cyber criminals had breached its systems between mid-May and late July and stolen the sensitive information of 145.5 million people. The hack is among the largest to occur.  Many commercial insurers offer stand-alone cyber coverage, separate from other property and casualty policies, but cyber coverage is not yet a standard addition to most other policies.  But insurers are also struggling to estimate their potential exposure to cyber-related losses amid mounting cyber risks and interest in cyber insurance.  Information from AIG’s review of existing policies will help the insurer better understand the insurer’s overall exposure, Grella told risk managers and insurers at a conference organized by Advisen Ltd, an insurance industry data and technology provider.  AIG unveiled a property policy in April that specifically includes cyber coverage, Grella said.  Adding cyber coverage to other types of policies will mean higher rates, Grella said. “When you buy affirmative cyber coverage, you should be paying for it,” Grella said.

1012,AIG,AIG sues Disney to avoid paying 'pink slime' settlement costs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) on Thursday sued Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to avoid having to reimburse the parent of ABC News for part of a settlement of a meat producer’s defamation lawsuit over a product that critics call “pink slime.” In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, AIG Specialty Insurance Co urged a judge to reject Disney’s $25 million reimbursement demand, related to its larger June 28 settlement with Beef Products Inc (BPI), under an insurance policy that excluded coverage for claims alleging malice. Thursday’s lawsuit stemmed from BPI’s lawsuit against ABC and reporter Jim Avila over reports in March and April 2012. According to the privately held South Dakota company, these reports falsely implied that BPI’s “lean, finely textured beef” was not safe, nutritious or even meat. AIG said in its lawsuit that Disney’s policy covered some defamation claims, but only if the company had first found an outside lawyer to say the statements it planned to broadcast were acceptable. The New York-based insurer accused Disney of trying to “create coverage where none exists.” AIG filed its lawsuit nine days after Burbank, California-based Disney sued the insurer in Los Angeles federal court, seeking to send the dispute into arbitration. Lawyers for Disney in the Los Angeles case did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. ABC and BPI did not disclose terms of their settlement, which ended a jury trial. But in an Aug. 8 regulatory filing, Disney said it had incurred $177 million of costs, in addition to what insurance covered, to settle litigation during the second quarter. Several media reports have said the BPI settlement was for a larger amount. BPI had said ABC’s reports forced it to close plants and lay off several hundred workers. It had sought $1.9 billion of damages, which could have been tripled to $5.7 billion under a South Dakota “food products disparagement” law.

1018,AIG,"AIG swings to quarterly loss, adds $836 million to reserves","NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as the insurer booked huge catastrophe losses, and said it had set aside $836 million to meet losses related to prior-year accident claims. Hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years have been an ongoing issue for AIG, and its shares were down 2.3 percent at $63.51 in extended trading after it reported third-quarter results. The New York-based company is one of the largest U.S. commercial insurers. In February, AIG also posted a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss, largely due to a $5.6 billion reserve charge to cover possible future claims related to long-term risks on U.S. commercial insurance policies it had already written. AIG agreed in January to pay about $10 billion to a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) to take on the bulk of the risk associated with those policies. The Berkshire deal followed a $3.6 billion increase to reserves chalked up by AIG in the last quarter of 2015. Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, widely hailed in the industry as a turnaround expert, took charge of AIG in May. He replaced Peter Hancock, who said in March that he would step down after the insurer’s financial performance frustrated shareholders and the insurer’s board of directors. AIG conducts quarterly reviews of reserves for its various lines. In August, AIG Chief Financial Officer Sid Sankaran said the insurer had boosted the number of reviews it conducted during the second quarter, compared to the previous year. The insurer reviewed about $16 billion in total reserves, in challenging areas such as medical malpractice and environmental, Sankaran said at the time. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the insurer recorded pre-tax catastrophe losses of $3 billion related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, in line with previously disclosed estimates. Insurers and reinsurers across United States had issued profit warnings after the storms tore into parts of the country and ravaged several Caribbean islands. AIG swung to a net loss of $1.74 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $462 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. Operating loss was $1.22 per share compared with an operating profit of $1.01 per share in the year-ago period. Analysts had expected a loss of 79 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating expenses fell 15.3 percent to $2.15 billion, partly cushioning the blow from catastrophe losses. S&P; Global Ratings said AIG’s “weak results” did not immediately affect the insurer’s ratings.  S&P; analysts cautioned that underwriting performance had declined in the quarter, however. They also said an earlier decision by Duperrealt to halt guidance to shareholders about possible future earnings “may imply a longer timeframe to meaningfully turn around the commercial insurance business.” ",11022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aig-results/aig-swings-to-quarterly-loss-adds-836-million-to-reserves-idUSKBN1D22RB

1023,AIG,AIG's $836 million reserve boost surprises investors; shares sink,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) shares sank 4.5 percent on Friday as investors reacted to a surprise $836 million boost to the insurance giant’s reserves, related to prior-year accident claims. AIG posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as the insurer booked huge catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The storms coincided with AIG’s review of reserves across various U.S. and European lines, leading to the $836 million charge. The New York-based company is one of the largest U.S. commercial insurers. Hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years have been an ongoing issue for AIG, which boosted reserves by $5.6 billion for similar reasons in February and $3.6 billion in 2015. The development on Thursday caught analysts and investors off guard.  “It wasn’t in my earnings estimate that they were going to have that reserve charge,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome. Shares were down 4.5 percent at $62 in morning trading. The charge also signals that AIG’s efforts in recent years to improve its underwriting were inadequate because it stems from policies the company wrote in 2016 and 2017, Newsome said. AIG conducts quarterly reviews of reserves for its various lines. The company increased the number of those reviews during the second quarter. “[T]his was our first chance to really view the 2016 accident year where we made many changes to our underwriting processes and tools,” AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said during a call with analysts on Friday. “The 2016 accident year is still very green, but we saw greater-than-expected claim emergence this quarter and decided to be more cautious on the 2016 and 2017 accident years,” Duperreault said. AIG is putting changes into place to reduce the volatility of its performance, which include pursuing double-digit rate increases and bolstering reinsurance, executives told analysts on a call on Friday. The insurer is also establishing specialized units for some businesses that are now spread throughout the company, including Lexington Insurance Company, its specialty lines insurer. The move will improve consistency and results, executives said. ",11032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aig-results/aigs-836-million-reserve-boost-surprises-investors-shares-sink-idUSKBN1D31RK
1024,AIG,Apple juices Wall St. as indexes climb for another week,"(Reuters) - A surge in shares of heavyweight Apple helped push up major Wall Street indexes on Friday, as investors also assessed a mixed U.S. labor market report. The S&P; 500 and Dow industrials recorded their eighth consecutive weeks of gains, while the Nasdaq posted its sixth straight up week, as equities have climbed to record highs. Shares of Apple (AAPL.O), the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, rose 2.6 percent as shoppers streamed into the company’s stores to buy its latest iPhone. Apple also gave a better-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping season. U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, the Labor Department said. But wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will continue to undershoot the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target. “It kind of confirms this Goldilocks-type scenario where it’s steady growth with really not a lot of inflationary pressure,” said Michael Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 22.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,539.19, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 7.99 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,587.84 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 49.49 points, or 0.74 percent, to 6,764.44. Apple was easily the biggest individual boost to the three indexes. The stock also helped boost the tech sector .SPLRCT, which climbed 0.9 percent and led all major S&P; 500 groups. “This is obviously the carry-over effect from Apple having a good quarter and a tremendous outlook,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. All three indexes rose in a week that saw a series of significant events, including the nomination of a new Fed chair and the long-awaited unveiling of a tax-cut bill from U.S. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans. In other corporate news, Qualcomm (QCOM.O) shares surged 12.7 percent after reports that Broadcom (AVGO.O) is exploring a deal to buy the smartphone chip maker. Broadcom shares rose 5.4 percent. Aetna (AET.N) shares rose 2.7 percent after Reuters reported U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS.N) and the health insurer are working toward finalizing merger terms and announcing a deal as early as December. CVS shares fell 0.2 percent. Third-quarter corporate reports also have continued at a heavy pace. With more than 400 of S&P; 500 companies having reported, earnings for the quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared to an expectation of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. American International Group (AIG.N) shares sank 4.6 percent as investors reacted to a surprise $836 million boost to the insurance giant’s reserves.

1025,AIG,"UPDATE 3-Hurricanes, earthquake drag down 3rd-qtr profit at Buffett's Berkshire","(Reuters) - Bad weather hurt Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in the third quarter, as insurance losses tied to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and an earthquake in Mexico contributed to a 43 percent drop in profit. Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year. Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad. Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term. Overall net income fell to $4.07 billion, or $2,473 per Class A share (BRKa.N), from $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier. That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF. A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent. Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September. Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it. Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year. The Class A shares closed Friday down $2,963.99, or 1 percent, at $280,470.01, while Class B shares (BRKb.N) fell $1.34, or 0.7 percent, to $187.27. Both were about 2 percent below their Oct. 24 record highs. FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002. It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis. But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion. Other insurers and reinsurers, such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S), also suffered larger quarterly storm losses, and like Berkshire are hoping to boost rates. Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest. Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies. Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3. Berkshire also owns shares in dozens of companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), and has a 26.7 percent stake in food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).

1026,AIG,US STOCKS-Apple juices Wall St as indexes climb for another week,"(Reuters) - A surge in shares of heavyweight Apple helped push up major Wall Street indexes on Friday, as investors also assessed a mixed U.S. labor market report. The S&P; 500 and Dow industrials recorded their eighth consecutive weeks of gains, while the Nasdaq posted its sixth straight up week, as equities have climbed to record highs. Shares of Apple (AAPL.O), the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, rose 2.6 percent as shoppers streamed into the company’s stores to buy its latest iPhone. Apple also gave a better-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping season. U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, the Labor Department said. But wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will continue to undershoot the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target. “It kind of confirms this Goldilocks-type scenario where it’s steady growth with really not a lot of inflationary pressure,” said Michael Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 22.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,539.19, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 7.99 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,587.84 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 49.49 points, or 0.74 percent, to 6,764.44. Apple was easily the biggest individual boost to the three indexes. The stock also helped boost the tech sector .SPLRCT, which climbed 0.9 percent and led all major S&P; 500 groups. “This is obviously the carry-over effect from Apple having a good quarter and a tremendous outlook,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. All three indexes rose in a week that saw a series of significant events, including the nomination of a new Fed chair and the long-awaited unveiling of a tax-cut bill from U.S. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans. In other corporate news, Qualcomm (QCOM.O) shares surged 12.7 percent after reports that Broadcom (AVGO.O) is exploring a deal to buy the smartphone chip maker. Broadcom shares rose 5.4 percent. Aetna (AET.N) shares rose 2.7 percent after Reuters reported U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS.N) and the health insurer are working toward finalizing merger terms and announcing a deal as early as December. CVS shares fell 0.2 percent. Third-quarter corporate reports also have continued at a heavy pace. With more than 400 of S&P; 500 companies having reported, earnings for the quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared to an expectation of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. American International Group (AIG.N) shares sank 4.6 percent as investors reacted to a surprise $836 million boost to the insurance giant’s reserves.

1028,AIG,AIG's $836 mln reserve boost surprises investors; shares sink,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) shares sank 4.5 percent on Friday as investors reacted to a surprise $836 million boost to the insurance giant’s reserves, related to prior-year accident claims. AIG posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as the insurer booked huge catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The storms coincided with AIG’s review of reserves across various U.S. and European lines, leading to the $836 million charge. The New York-based company is one of the largest U.S. commercial insurers. Hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years have been an ongoing issue for AIG, which boosted reserves by $5.6 billion for similar reasons in February and $3.6 billion in 2015. The development on Thursday caught analysts and investors off guard.  “It wasn’t in my earnings estimate that they were going to have that reserve charge,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome. Shares were down 4.5 percent at $62 in morning trading. The charge also signals that AIG’s efforts in recent years to improve its underwriting were inadequate because it stems from policies the company wrote in 2016 and 2017, Newsome said. AIG conducts quarterly reviews of reserves for its various lines. The company increased the number of those reviews during the second quarter. “[T]his was our first chance to really view the 2016 accident year where we made many changes to our underwriting processes and tools,” AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said during a call with analysts on Friday. “The 2016 accident year is still very green, but we saw greater-than-expected claim emergence this quarter and decided to be more cautious on the 2016 and 2017 accident years,” Duperreault said. AIG is putting changes into place to reduce the volatility of its performance, which include pursuing double-digit rate increases and bolstering reinsurance, executives told analysts on a call on Friday. The insurer is also establishing specialized units for some businesses that are now spread throughout the company, including Lexington Insurance Company, its specialty lines insurer. The move will improve consistency and results, executives said. ",11032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/aig-results/aigs-836-mln-reserve-boost-surprises-investors-shares-sink-idUSL2N1N90ZA

1035,AIG,Fitch Rates AIG's New Senior Notes 'BBB+'; Outlook Remains Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings assigns a rating of 'BBB+' to American International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) new offering of senior notes, and affirms all outstanding ratings including the 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR), 'A' (Strong) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating of the property/casualty (P&C;) insurance subsidiaries and 'A+' (Strong) IFS rating of the life insurance subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Negative. The new issuance consists of $400 million 4.45% senior unsecured, zero coupon callable notes issued in Taipei that mature in 2047 and rank pari passu with the existing senior unsecured debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings affirmation follows the announcement of a net loss of $1.7 billion in third quarter 2017 relating to approximately $3 billion in total reported losses from natural catastrophes and $837 million of Commercial Insurance adverse loss reserve development. Fitch revised AIG's Rating Outlook to Negative in February 2017 following large 2016 loss reserve charges and a full year GAAP net loss of $849 million, tied largely to adverse loss experience in the Commercial Insurance segment that indicated a need for greater improvement than previously anticipated in commercial lines experience to generate an underwriting profit. Fitch's affirmation of the ratings reflects its expectation that the volatility in Commercial results will decline over the next 12 months and the segment will move towards an underwriting profit. AIG's P&C; subsidiaries' ratings consider the company's unique market position in the global insurance market given its absolute size, underwriting capabilities, and consolidated capital adequacy that is comparable to higher rated peers. The ratings of AIG's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are driven by these entities' strong statutory capital position, leading market share in key lines of business, and diversification of revenues from insurance premiums, spread business and fees. The hiring of Brian Duperreault in May 2017 as CEO led to a re-evaluation of the prior strategic plan. Several structural and operational changes in Commercial Insurance have commenced to reduce inherent volatility and promote underwriting profitability. Return of capital through share repurchases are anticipated to sharply decline, with a renewed emphasis on deploying earnings into the existing business and new growth opportunities. Continued Commercial segment underwriting actions led to a 15% decline in segment net written premiums in the first nine months of 2017. The segment combined ratio was 133.9% at nine months 2017, which includes approximately 27 points for catastrophe losses, and compares with 133.1% in the full-year 2016. Reserve increases reported in the third quarter were largely in the 2016 accident year. AIG has approximately $6.9 billion of coverage remaining for future adverse development in covered segments for accident year 2015 and prior from the retroactive reinsurance treaty purchased in early 2017. Overall, operating performance for AIG's life insurance subsidiaries is stronger and more stable than the property casualty subsidiaries. In the first nine months of 2017, the core Life and Retirement segments produced after-tax operating earnings of approximately $1.9 billion, a 20% increase from the same period in 2016, largely reflecting improved expense efficiencies and profitable growth in life insurance business. Fitch views AIG Life's diversification and strong business positions as key ratings strengths, though the company does have exposure to legacy underperforming businesses. Over recent years, AIG Life narrowed its distribution and product focus, and is now focused on reducing its expenses, while enhancing its digital experience and underwriting in order to improve the quality and stability of earnings going forward. AIG's interest coverage ratio was 3.9x in the first nine months of 2017 compared with 3.1x in the full-year 2016. Significant holding company resources remain available for debt servicing including $6.7 billion in parent company liquidity at Sept. 30, 2017. The company's financial leverage ratio, excluding the effect of FAS 115 was 25% at Sept. 30, 2017. Capitalization remains strong at both the property casualty and life subsidiaries, demonstrated by Prism capital-model scores of ""Strong"" in 2016. AIG's life and P&C; RBC ratios were 509% and 206%, respectively, at year-end 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key sensitivities that could lead to a downgrade include: --Further reserve development within the NICO cover for 2015 and prior long tail reserves that approaches exhaustion of available limits and/or further material development in the 2016 or 2017 accident years; --A failure to move towards underwriting profits in commercial insurance; --Increase in financial leverage to above 28%, or an increase in the TFC ratio to above 0.7x; --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 4.5x annual interest on financial debt; --Sharp deterioration in the Consumer Insurance segment's profitability trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios or Prism scores at either the domestic life insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries. Key sensitivities that could lead to a return to a Stable Outlook, which Fitch expects to review over the next six to 12 months include: --Demonstration of greater loss reserve stability or reserve redundancies, particularly within the 2016 and 2017 accident years; --A shift to sustainable property/casualty segment underwriting profitability. --Continued stability in the company's Consumer Insurance segment; --Maintaining capitalization metrics, including RBC ratios and Prism scores, for the company's insurance subsidiaries near current levels.

1041,AIG,AIG launches new cyber threat analysis to gauge companies' risks,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) has ramped up its analysis for insuring against cyber attacks, using a system that scores a company’s risk of having a breach along with safeguards it has in place, the insurer said on Tuesday. AIG’s underwriters have been using the computerized analysis since November, which combines information from a new insurance application designed for the process and data about current cyber threats to generate scores on various related factors, said Tracie Grella, AIG’s global head of Cyber Risk Insurance, in an interview.  The analysis scores companies on the degree to which a cyber attack may affect their businesses and the potential costs of various cyber incidents, among other issues, according to a sample report seen by Reuters. Cyber coverage is a mounting concern worldwide as hackers increasingly target companies’ technology systems. Insurers are also struggling to estimate their potential exposure as cyber risks and interest in coverage increase. In October, AIG said it would review all coverage types to better gauge its exposure to cyber risk. Other policies, such as for property and commercial vehicles, are often silent on whether cyber events are covered, leaving insurers without a clear picture of their total financial exposure. AIG on Tuesday also announced a partnership with cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike Inc and Darktrace to launch CyberMatics, a service that verifies information AIG receives from customers’ cyber security tools.  The service uses artificial intelligence, or the ability of machines to carry out tasks normally associated with human intelligence, to look inside an insured company’s network for strengths and vulnerabilities, said Darktrace Chief Executive Nicole Eagan in an interview.     “They may be good at identifying spear phishing attacks but not internal threats,” said Eagan, referring to email attacks against organizations and individuals in which perpetrators try to gain access to sensitive information. Companies need not use the service, but those who do may be able to negotiate more favorable policy terms, Grella said. AIG’s new analysis does not change cyber insurance rates, but could affect how it calculates a company’s premium because of added insights it has into risks and mitigation efforts, Grella said. AIG’s analysis also generates cyber-risk reports for customers that include the same information its underwriters use. Companies can also compare their scores with those for their industries.

1046,AIG,AIG to buy reinsurer Validus for $5.56 billion,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) on Monday said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) for $5.56 billion in cash, ending a long period of retrenchment for AIG as new Chief Executive Brian Duperreault plots an expansionist path. Duperreault initiated the deal to buy Bermuda-based Validus, which comes four months after U.S. regulators said AIG was no longer “too big to fail,” a designation that carries more stringent government oversight and capital requirements. AIG has dramatically shrunk since the New York-based insurer’s near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis. Bermuda’s insurance industry is familiar turf for Duperreault, who was born there and founded and ran the Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd before heading to AIG. Validus has four parts, spanning reinsurance, U.S. specialty lines, asset management and a Lloyd’s of London underwriter. AIG said the deal would boost AIG’s earnings per share and return on equity but did not provide details on cost cuts or projected returns. “The deal is not predicated on cost cuts or synergies. In fact, it’s the opposite,” Duperreault said in an interview. “The deal hinges around that it puts us in businesses that we are not in now.” AIG’s $68 per share offer represents a 45.5 percent premium to Validus’ Friday close. “It’s well worth the price and we’ll get our money’s worth out of it,” Duperreault said. “I’ve thought this through.”    Shares of Validus were trading at $67.32, close to the offer price, in afternoon trade. AIG shares were down nearly 1 percent. The acquisition is AIG’s largest since the financial crisis, when the insurer received a $182 billion bailout, based on the U.S. government’s belief that an AIG failure would cause more damage to the economy than using public money to keep it afloat, a concept known as “too big to fail.” AIG paid off its last debt to the U.S. government at the end of 2012. The deal marks AIG’s reentry into the Lloyd’s insurance market, where underwriters get access to a wide variety of international insurance and reinsurance business, often in complex or hard-to-cover areas, which can be risky but also offers more profit potential. “I was really thrilled to see the news,” Lloyd’s of London Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale said in an interview. “We are delighted to have any of these big reputable players as part of Lloyd’s.” AIG’s deal will also expand its reach in other areas such as the reinsurance market at a time when the insurer, like its rivals, is facing stiff pricing pressure. Validus Re, a major Validus business, sells property-casualty reinsurance for disasters such as hurricanes. Other Validus businesses include AlphaCat, which manages $3.2 billion on behalf of clients who invest in insurance-linked securities products, a repackaging of insurance risk as debt that is often linked to natural catastrophes.  The deal will also add crop insurance to AIG’s product lineup. “I particularly like the reinsurance business as additive to what we do. There are a lot pieces to this company that fit us like a glove,” Duperreault said on a conference call with analysts. Reinsurers play an important role in the financial industry by assuming risks that are either too large or too unpredictable for their insurance clients to take on their own. “We would be buyers (of AIG) as we focus on the accretion from this transaction, the strong underlying margins VR brings and the fact that AIG will still have excess capital after this deal is done,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Elyse Greenspan said in a note. AIG revenue fell in three of the past four quarters and the company has been plagued by losses related to prior-year accident claims.  Duperreault, who replaced Peter Hancock last year, is seen as a turnaround expert and has promised to streamline AIG’s operations and boost profitability. As his first major restructuring action since taking over, Duperreault reorganized AIG into three new units. The new structure is expected to reflect in the company’s fourth-quarter results on Feb. 8. The Validus deal is expected to close in mid-2018. Citigroup Global Markets Inc, Perella Weinberg Partners LP and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP advised AIG. Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP represented Perella as financial advisor to AIG in this transaction. Validus was advised by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

1054,AIG,"AIG posts $6.7 billion loss on tax reform, catastrophes","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) posted a $6.7 billion fourth-quarter loss on Thursday as the U.S. insurer booked a big charge related to U.S. tax reform and losses from global catastrophes.     Excluding one-time items, adjusted fourth-quarter earnings were $526 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with an adjusted loss of $2.8 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same period a year earlier.     Analysts were expecting earnings of 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.      AIG booked $762 million of catastrophe losses during the quarter, largely from wildfires that raged through California and caused significant damage to homes and businesses. The quarter also reflected a “modest” reserve boost to cover future claims, driven by losses in its international commercial businesses.      AIG’s general insurance business posted just $13 million in adjusted pretax income, compared with a $4.9 billion loss in the year-ago quarter, which was affected by a review that caused AIG to significantly boost reserves.      The insurer’s life and retirement business was also affected by a re-evaluation of its underlying method of predicting losses. The business booked a $90 million charge, primarily due to what AIG called a “modernization” of actuarial systems and models.     That business’ adjusted pretax income fell 10 percent to $782 million from $866 million in the year-ago quarter.    Overall, AIG’s bottom line was mostly hurt by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, posting $6.7 billion worth of charges related to the new tax law.  U.S. tax reform has caused many financial services companies to book big one-time losses for earnings held overseas and also for an accounting oddity related to losses booked during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, even though lower corporate tax rates will help them in the long run.     Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who has been in the role for less than a year, AIG has been looking to acquire businesses and restructure itself to boost results, with a particular focus on technology.  The insurer now has three units, including a general insurance business, a life and retirement unit and a standalone technology unit.     In its announcement on Thursday, AIG said it had recently formed a Bermuda-based legal entity named DSA Reinsurance Company. The entity’s main purpose is to reinsure old policies the company has on its books, many of which have been contributing to losses.

1056,AIG,"AIG posts $6.7 billion loss on tax reform, catastrophes","(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) posted a $6.7 billion fourth-quarter loss on Thursday as the U.S. insurer booked a big charge related to U.S. tax reform and losses from global catastrophes.     Excluding one-time items, adjusted fourth-quarter earnings were $526 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with an adjusted loss of $2.8 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same period a year earlier.     Analysts were expecting earnings of 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.      AIG booked $762 million of catastrophe losses during the quarter, largely from wildfires that raged through California and caused significant damage to homes and businesses. The quarter also reflected a “modest” reserve boost to cover future claims, driven by losses in its international commercial businesses.      AIG’s general insurance business posted just $13 million in adjusted pretax income, compared with a $4.9 billion loss in the year-ago quarter, which was affected by a review that caused AIG to significantly boost reserves.      The insurer’s life and retirement business was also affected by a re-evaluation of its underlying method of predicting losses. The business booked a $90 million charge, primarily due to what AIG called a “modernization” of actuarial systems and models.     That business’ adjusted pretax income fell 10 percent to $782 million from $866 million in the year-ago quarter.    Overall, AIG’s bottom line was mostly hurt by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, posting $6.7 billion worth of charges related to the new tax law.  U.S. tax reform has caused many financial services companies to book big one-time losses for earnings held overseas and also for an accounting oddity related to losses booked during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, even though lower corporate tax rates will help them in the long run.     Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who has been in the role for less than a year, AIG has been looking to acquire businesses and restructure itself to boost results, with a particular focus on technology.  The insurer now has three units, including a general insurance business, a life and retirement unit and a standalone technology unit.     In its announcement on Thursday, AIG said it had recently formed a Bermuda-based legal entity named DSA Reinsurance Company. The entity’s main purpose is to reinsure old policies the company has on its books, many of which have been contributing to losses.     Last month, AIG also agreed to purchase reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) for $5.6 billion in a bid to expand its offerings and improve underwriting tools.

The move is part of a strategy by AIG Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault to grow the insurance giant and expand its global reach.  AIG’s agreement with Expedia marks its second travel insurance deal in five months. In October, the insurer said it had reached an agreement to sell travel insurance to United Airlines (UAL.N) customers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. In January, AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) for $5.56 billion in cash, ending a long period of retrenchment for the insurer, which had dramatically shrunk since its near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis. Travel insurance is seen by industry sources as a low-risk business and steady revenue generator. But insurers need scale for it to significantly boost their bottom lines, said Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome.  “It’s almost certainly not a material change, but it’s a really nice feather in (AIG’s) cap,” Newsome said of the Expedia deal. “It’s nice to have a high-profile transaction that maybe adds some confidence to people looking at AIG.” The latest deal gives U.S. Expedia customers the option to buy AIG travel insurance when booking flights, hotels, travel packages and cruises on Expedia sites, including Expedia.com, CheapTickets, Orbitz and Travelocity.

1076,AIG,Supreme Court rejects AIG ex-CEO Greenberg's bailout challenge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a defeat to former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) CEO Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, refusing to hear an appeal he led arguing that the federal government illegally bailed out the insurer during the 2008 financial crisis at the expense of shareholders. The justices left in place a 2017 ruling by a federal appeals court in Washington that Greenberg’s Starr International Co had no legal right to challenge the bailout because that right belonged to AIG, which chose not to sue. Greenberg, 92, led AIG for nearly four decades before being ousted in March 2005. The New York-based insurance powerhouse was rescued by the U.S. government in September 2008 to stave off bankruptcy after the company ran up huge losses from insurance on shoddy mortgage securities. Starr’s attorney David Boies expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court’s action. “Starr established that the disproportionate and unfair treatment of AIG’s shareholders in 2008 was not authorized by the applicable statutes and that the government had exceeded its authority by taking control of AIG and using it to bail out other financial institutions, which were found to have engaged in more risky practices,” Boies said in a statement.  Starr, an insurance and investment business that had been one of AIG’s largest shareholders, sued in 2011 on behalf of itself and other shareholders alleging the government illegally took a 79.9 percent stake in the company in exchange for a $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The shareholders’ rights were diminished in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of due process under the law, Starr claimed, seeking more than $40 billion in damages. A lower court ruled in Starr’s favor, but declined to award damages since the shareholders’ stock would have been worthless without the government loan. The bailout actually helped the plaintiff, that court said.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out that ruling, finding that only AIG, and not Starr as a shareholder, had legal standing to bring claims that the bailout was unlawful. AIG’s board of directors decided not to file such a suit.  AIG’s bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion but was repaid, leaving taxpayers with nearly $23 billion in profit. Starr appealed to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump’s administration urged the justices not to take up the appeal.

The justices left in place a 2017 ruling by a federal appeals court in Washington that Greenberg’s Starr International Co had no legal right to challenge the bailout because that right belonged to AIG, which chose not to sue.

1080,AIG,AIG paid new CEO Duperreault $43.1 million in 2017: filing,"BOSTON (Reuters) - American International Group (AIG.N) paid its new chief executive Brian Duperreault $43.1 million last year, a securities filing showed on Tuesday. AIG, which during the financial crisis faced questions over the compensation of former leader Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, had previously outlined the components of Duperreault’s pay but not the total figure. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million after rejoining AIG in May, according to the company’s annual proxy filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc (MET.N) CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), according to the latest proxy filings by those companies. Duperreault, 70, had worked for AIG until 1994 and rejoined it from a Bermuda company he founded, Hamilton Insurance Group. As CEO he replaced Peter Hancock, who stepped down under pressure. Hancock received $24.2 million last year including a $5 million cash award “for his service through the transition” to the new CEO, according to the filing. Duperreault’s payout could indicate investor angst at high CEO pay has faded with rising markets. At last year’s AIG annual meeting, about 98 percent of votes cast by investors were in favor of the 2016 compensation for top executives, the company’s filing states. While Duperreault’s compensation will be up for another advisory vote at its annual meeting on May 9, some investors have previously said they would approve of the pay so long as he performs.

1090,AIG,"UPDATE 1-AXA prices U.S. arm's IPO at $24-27/per share, launches bonds","PARIS (Reuters) - French insurer AXA (AXAF.PA) on Thursday priced the forthcoming initial public offering (IPO) of its U.S. division at $24-27 per share, in a deal that could value the part of the business being listed on the market at $3.5 billion. AXA said in a regulatory filing that it would offer 137.25 million shares in its U.S arm AXA Equitable Holdings Inc at $25.50, with that price representing the mid-point in the indicative price range of the IPO. AXA also announced the launch of around $750 million bonds, mandatorily exchangeable into AXA Equitable Holdings shares. AXA Equitable Holdings is one of America’s oldest life insurers, with roots going back to 1859 in New York. AXA acquired the business in 1992 and it is targeting a second-quarter IPO of its U.S. division. The flotation, in which AXA is listing roughly a quarter of its U.S. division, could value the full 100 percent of the U.S. entity at roughly $14 billion. AXA, which is Europe’s second-biggest insurer by market capitalization behind Allianz (ALVG.DE), has said that the proceeds from its IPO deal will help finance its earlier acquisition of insurer XL Group (XL.N). “Thus, with XL financing increasingly secure, we expect this to de-risk AXA’s stock,” wrote analysts at brokerage Jefferies. Jefferies kept a “buy” rating on AXA shares. AXA announced its $15 billion acquisition of XL in March to create a world leader in property and casualty insurance. Insurers have been turning to takeovers to strengthen their businesses as they face tougher regulation and falling returns from financial market investments, with American International Group (AIG.N) also buying reinsurer Validus (VR.N) for around $5.6 billion earlier this year.

1093,AIG,"AIG profit falls 21 percent on catastrophe costs, lower yields","May 2 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc reported a 21 percent decline in first-quarter profit on Wednesday, due to higher catastrophe and bad weather claims, as well as weaker investment income. The insurer posted $938 million, or $1.01 per share, in net income for the first quarter, down from $1.2 billion, or $1.18 per share in the same period a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, its earnings were $963 million, or $1.04 per share, compared with $1.37 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.27, on average, per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, after lowering their estimates by about 6 percent since last June. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. Mudslides in California, winter storms across the United States and an earthquake in Papua New Guinea contributed to $376 million worth of catastrophe losses in AIG’s general insurance business during the quarter. Those costs slashed the unit’s quarterly adjusted pretax income by more than half, to $510 million from $1.1 billion in the year-earlier period, and drove its expense and loss ratios higher. In AIG’s life and retirement business, adjusted pretax income fell 1 percent to $892 million. The insurer attributed that decline to lower-yielding assets. The results mark the end of three full quarters for AIG under Chief Executive Officer Brian Duppereault, who took charge of AIG last May, vowing to grow the company and boost revenues. He has since been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits. But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line, and AIG’s stock is down 10 percent since Duperreault’s arrival on May 14, 2017. In after-hours trading, AIG shares were 1.9 percent lower at $53.82.

1097,AIG,Investors not convinced by AIG strategy; shares drop 6 percent,"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) executives on Thursday defended their strategy for transforming the company, saying some key improvements would take hold by year-end, but failed to convince investors as shares slid more than 6 percent. The New York-based insurer reported a 21 percent decline in first-quarter profit on Wednesday, due to higher catastrophe and bad weather claims, as well as weaker investment income. “We do expect to deliver an underwriting profit by the end of this year,” said AIG Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault in a call with analysts on Thursday. Duperreault took charge of AIG nearly a year ago, promising to grow the company and boost revenues. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.  But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line. The stock is down nearly 16 percent since Duperreault’s arrival in May 2017. AIG’s shares were trading at $51.36 on Thursday afternoon after a morning slump during which share were down more than 9 percent. “Given the results from some other commercial lines insurers in the quarter everyone was expecting a stronger number from AIG, especially in North American commercial business,” said Elyse Greenspan, a Wells Fargo Securities LLC analyst, in an interview. The unit has been a “consistent area of focus” for AIG and one which the insurer’s former management team was unable to fix, Greenspan said. AIG’s changes to underwriting practices will take some time to show up in the company’s income statement, said Peter Zaffino, chief executive of AIG’s general insurance unit, during the call. But a combination of managing expenses and improving ratios of losses to premiums will contribute to AIG’s year-end financial performance, Zaffino said. The company is also making changes to excess casualty business, trying to shed certain risky bets such as being the lead insurer for initial public offerings and professional liabilities, Duperreault said. AIG also reported on Wednesday that it had released $104 million in reserves from its general insurance unit, the first such development since 2016. The measure alleviated some investor angst, Greenspan said, after the insurer had to set aside funds in 2016 and 2017 to cover possible future claims.

The unit has been a “consistent area of focus” for AIG and one which the insurer’s former management team was unable to fix, Greenspan said. AIG’s changes to underwriting practices will take some time to show up in the company’s income statement, said Peter Zaffino, chief executive of AIG’s general insurance unit, during the call. But a combination of managing expenses and improving ratios of losses to premiums will contribute to AIG’s year-end financial performance, Zaffino said. The company is also making changes to excess casualty business, trying to shed certain risky bets such as being the lead insurer for initial public offerings and professional liabilities, Duperreault said. AIG also reported on Wednesday that it had released $104 million in reserves from its general insurance unit, the first such development since 2016. The measure alleviated some investor angst, Greenspan said, after the insurer had to set aside funds in 2016 and 2017 to cover possible future claims.

1099,AIG,AIG shares slide 8 pct as execs fail to boost investor confidence over profit plunge,"May 3 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc executives on Thursday defended their strategy for transforming the company, saying some key improvements would take hold by year-end, but failed to convince investors as shares slid more than 8 percent. The New York-based insurer reported a 21 percent decline in first-quarter profit on Wednesday, due to higher catastrophe and bad weather claims, as well as weaker investment income. “We do expect to deliver an underwriting profit by the end of this year,” said AIG chief executive officer Brian Duperreault in a call with analysts on Thursday. Duperreault took charge of AIG nearly a year ago, promising to grow the company and boost revenues. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits. But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line and AIG’s shares were trading at $50.38 early on Thursday afternoon. AIG’s changes to underwriting practices will take some time to show in the company’s income statement, said Peter Zaffino, chief executive of AIG’s general insurance unit, during the call. But a combination of managing expenses and improving ratios of losses to premiums will contribute to AIG’s year-end financial performance, Zaffino said.

1101,AIG,Investor Carl Icahn sells stake in AIG: sources,"(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has sold his stake in American International Group Inc (AIG.N), ending a more than two-year association with one of the largest U.S. property and casualty insurers, according to a person familiar with the matter. The activist investor started accumulating AIG shares in 2015 and became its third largest investor with a 4.76 percent stake as of the end of 2017. But Icahn began planning to sell that stake last year as it became evident that AIG would name Brian Duperreault, an industry veteran who would oppose demands to break up the company, as its new CEO, said a second person familiar with the matter. Both people spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Icahn exited AIG when the company’s stock changed hands at a price between $60 and $65 - levels last seen in February, one of the sources said. At $65 per AIG share, Icahn’s stake would have been worth $2.78 billion, according to Reuters’ calculations. It was not immediately known how much Icahn made from the AIG investment. AIG shares fell nearly 1 percent to $52.30 in morning trade on Monday. Icahn Enterprises (IEP.O) did not immediately respond to a request for comment and AIG declined to comment. In the company’s first quarter investor presentation released last week, AIG was not included on a list of significant holdings. Its presentation for the fourth quarter of 2017 had shown AIG as the largest of five significant holdings. In keeping with his aggressive activist investment strategy, Icahn had publicly pressed AIG to shrink and threatened a proxy fight with the company’s management. The insurer was forced to embark on a two-year turnaround plan developed by former Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock, which intended to return $25 billion to shareholders. The company also sold some assets and hired Duperreault, spurring Icahn to back off on his demand to break up the company. In March, AIG said Samuel Merksamer, a representative of Icahn on the company’s board, would not seek re-election. On Wednesday, AIG shareholders will vote on a $43.1 million 2017 compensation package for Duperreault, who has vowed to grow the company by making acquisitions and boosting revenues.

1105,AIG,AIG shareholders approve $43 million pay package for CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said shareholders approved a $43.1 million pay package for 2017 for Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault during the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. A nonbinding resolution to endorse the executive compensation passed with a majority of votes cast, Chairman Doug Steenland announced, adding that further details would be released later in the day.  Influential proxy advisory firms International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to reject the resolution, saying the pay package did not align with AIG’s performance. AIG’s stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May. The company’s pay arrangements include $24.2 million for former CEO Peter Hancock, who stepped down last year under pressure, with a $5 million cash award “for his service through the transition” to Duperreault, according to its annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March. It is unusual for both advisory firms to recommend voting against pay measures for the same company. ISS recommended votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said. Glass Lewis gave AIG’s compensation package a letter grade of “F.” “Overall, the company paid significantly more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,” the report said. ISS said one-time awards to Duperreault when he joined the company, including a $12 million cash bonus, were not tied to performance. AIG declined to comment on the proxy recommendations. AIG’s board compensation committee “believes this award properly motivates Mr. Duperreault to create sustainable, profitable growth for AIG, aligning his interests with those of our shareholders,” the proxy filing states. Some investors have said they would approve of Duperreault’s pay so long as he performs. Duperreault has vowed to help the company expand and boost revenue. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase a focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.  AIG is preparing to finalize its acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N). But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line. In March, AIG said it paid Duperreault $43.1 million last year, according to the proxy filing. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million. That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc (MET.N) CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), according to proxy filings by those companies.

1107,AIG,AIG shareholders set to vote on pay package for new CEO,"NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc faces an uphill climb to convince shareholders to approve a $43.1 million pay package for Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault during the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. Two influential proxy advisory firms, International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, have advised shareholders to reject the package in the non-binding vote, saying it did not align with AIG’s performance. AIG’s stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May.

ISS recommends votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said. That could sway shareholders, corporate governance experts said. “It seems that investors do react to these recommendations,” Jill Brown, a management professor at Waltham, Massachusetts-based Bentley University, said in an email. Brown pointed to a March non-binding vote by Walt Disney Co shareholders, who rejected a $48.5 million executive compensation plan for Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger by a 52 percent majority. Both proxy advisory firms had advised against Iger’s package. Glass Lewis gave AIG’s package a letter grade of “F.” “Overall, the company paid significantly more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,” the report said.
