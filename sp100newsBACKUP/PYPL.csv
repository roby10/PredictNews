3,PYPL,Visa: Consumers using it online finish transactions more than those using PayPal,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Visa Inc said on Monday online shoppers using its payment service are 17 percentage points more likely to complete their purchases than those using PayPal. Visa Checkout, which allows shoppers to store their payment information without having to re-enter it every time they make a purchase online, said 66 percent of its enrolled customers completed their transactions after putting items in their shopping cart compared to 49 percent of PayPal Holdings Inc’s Express Checkout customers. The data was collated for Visa by retail analytics firm ComScore Inc.  PayPal’s online payment service offers a similar convenience by allowing customers to log into their accounts on a merchant’s website.  Retailers and payment industry experts have often blamed the high rates of unfinished online transactions, after shoppers add items to their shopping carts, on the tiring process of re-entering payment information every time one makes a purchase. Online payment checkout services which are available on a retailer’s website make the payment process easier for customers. It also gives the service provider a slice of every transaction online; the space has recently attracted companies including Apple Inc and Amazon Inc. “What has become more and more pronounced is as the size of the screen gets smaller, whether it’s a tablet, mobile or a watch, the less likely it becomes a consumer will finish his purchase,” Sam Shrauger, senior vice president of Visa’s digital solutions, told Reuters.  This is because entering numbers and letters on small keyboards while holding your credit card in your hand is inconvenient and prone to mistakes. Shrauger said 60 percent of shoppers using a computer finish their transactions compared to 45 percent of tablet users and 20 percent of mobile shoppers largely due to the hassle of entering shipping and payment data.

8,PYPL,"PayPal expands One Touch program to new markets in Europe, Australia","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc said on Tuesday it would expand its One Touch payments product to 13 new markets in Europe and Australia, bringing a simpler check-out to online shoppers and merchants.  PayPal, which separated from eBay Inc last month, is a formidable player in the fast-growing payments industry, which has attracted new entrants like Apple Inc.  The company said “millions” of consumers had already enabled One Touch to make payments on desktops and through mobile apps in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada and that half of the world’s top 100 online retailers were already using the program.  Existing PayPal users can opt-in to use One Touch once and then no longer be required to re-enter their billing and shipping information into shopping apps or websites that support PayPal in their checkouts. Merchants that already accept PayPal will see One Touch automatically enabled, PayPal said. A smoother shopping experience is crucial to online retailers as they often blame the high rates of unfinished or abandoned online sales on the tiring process of re-entering payment information. PayPal said more than half of e-commerce shopping sessions are taking place on mobile but said that only around 10 to 15 percent of purchases occur on mobile devices.  “If consumers can’t check out in one touch or tap and instead have to do data entry on their mobile device they’re far less likely to complete the transaction,” Bill Ready, PayPal’s senior vice president, said in an emailed response to Reuters. “With One Touch, we’re bridging that gap and creating better buying experiences for consumers, which in turn means higher conversions for merchants.” PayPal said the One Touch program had led to 50 percent or greater improvement in conversion rates and said it planned to eventually launch One Touch to all markets in which PayPal exists. The company, which has more than 169 million customer accounts worldwide, processed 4 billion payments last year totaling $235 billion.

12,PYPL,PayPal says makes $1 billion in small-business loans in first two years,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), the online payment processor, said on Tuesday its small-business lending program has processed $1 billion in loans in the first two years of its launch and more than doubled loan growth in that span.  PayPal Working Capital is extending short-term loans totaling more than $100 million per month, or $3 million per day, to a mix of sellers on eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and standalone small- to medium-sized merchants, the company said at a payments conference in Las Vegas. PayPal separated from eBay earlier this year, and Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman has stated he is looking to use PayPal’s size to offer affordable financial services widely. The biggest challenge for a small business is getting access to credit and about 90 percent of businesses to which PayPal extends credit come back for a repeat loan, Steve Allocca, PayPal vice president and general manager, global credit, told Reuters.

14,PYPL,"PayPal's China, Europe transaction volumes hit by strong dollar","(Reuters) - Payment processor PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), spun off from eBay Inc (EBAY.O) reported quarterly revenue slightly below analysts’ expectations as a strong dollar hurt its transaction volumes in China and Europe. Shares of PayPal, which listed for the second time on the Nasdaq in July, fell 5.6 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. PayPal’s third-quarter revenue rose about 14 percent to $2.26 billion, nearly half of which came from markets outside the United States.  Excluding the impact of a strong dollar, revenue rose 19 percent, but missed the average analyst estimate of $2.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “I think that the foreign exchange impact has been larger than expected,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst James Friedman said. PayPal said it expected the dollar to have a bigger impact on its 2015 revenue than previously anticipated. The company forecast a growth of 15-18 percent in full-year revenue, excluding the impact of a strong dollar. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria also attributed the fall in PayPal’s shares to likely high investor expectations after strong results from eBay. PayPal said growth in its international total payment volumes was hurt somewhat because of weakness in China and Europe.  “When Americans buy in China or Europeans buy in the United States, PayPal makes the highest rates. So when the dollar is strong, that weakens demand from Europe and supply from China,” Luria said. PayPal has also been facing fierce competition from payment processing startups such as Stripe Inc and Square Inc as well as Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) Apple Pay in a market it helped create. Square, headed by Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, filed for an initial public offering this month.  PayPal’s transaction margin fell to 62.3 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 63.1 percent, a year earlier.  Active accounts increased 10 percent to 173 million, while total payment volume rose 20 percent to $69.74 billion. The company’s mobile transactions rose 38 percent to 345 million. PayPal’s net income increased 28.6 percent to $301 million, or 25 cents per share. Excluding items, the company earned 31 cents per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of 29 cents.

The filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Icahn sold his stake of 46.3 million shares in eBay and reported the same number of shares in PayPal, which completed its spinoff from eBay in mid-July. Icahn, whose PayPal stake as of Sept. 30 amounted to 3.8 percent of the company, had pushed for eBay to spin off PayPal last year and has board representation at PayPal through Icahn Capital managing director Jonathan Christodoro. Icahn eventually backed off from his push for the spinoff in April of last year. But eBay directors and executives shifted their stance on the split in June of last year after a six-month internal study of the payments landscape. Icahn, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management change, also showed that he took a 1.36 million share stake in American International Group Inc  during the third quarter, ahead of publicly pressuring the insurer to split into three companies. In a letter to AIG CEO Peter Hancock in late October, Icahn blasted AIG as “too big to succeed,” a riff on the popular “too big to fail” phrase that emerged from the financial crisis. The size of Icahn’s AIG position had not been previously disclosed, and Icahn may have increased the stake by the time he tweeted that he owned a “large” position in the company on Oct. 28.

Icahn, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management change, also showed that he took a 1.36 million share stake in American International Group Inc (AIG.N) during the third quarter, ahead of publicly pressuring the insurer to split into three companies.  In a letter to AIG CEO Peter Hancock in late October, Icahn blasted AIG as “too big to succeed,” a riff on the popular “too big to fail” phrase that emerged from the financial crisis. The size of Icahn’s AIG position had not been previously disclosed, and Icahn may have increased the stake by the time he tweeted that he owned a “large” position in the company on Oct. 28.   Icahn was not immediately available for comment.  ",11172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-investments-funds-icahn/icahn-exits-ebay-stake-opts-for-paypal-after-spinoff-idUSKCN0T52SP20151117
20,PYPL,"Factbox: Netflix, PayPal become hedge fund darlings in third quarter","(Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund management firms, including Soros Fund Management LLC and Viking Global Investors, placed new bets on Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) while Tiger Global Management increased its stake in the video streaming company during the third quarter, regulatory filings showed on Monday. Viking bought 4.5 million shares while Tiger Global upped its stake by 15.43 million shares to 18 million. Soros said it owned 317,534 Netflix shares worth $32.79 million as of Sept. 30. Investors appear to be moving into Netflix as a hedge against the cable television industry, which is facing increasing threats to revenue as consumers switch to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, a trend known as “cord cutting.”  Electronic payments provider PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) was also a stock darling in the July to September period. Baupost Group LLC took a new stake of 10.9 million shares while Soros took a 4.43 million share stake worth $137.5 million in PayPal. Billionaire investor activist Carl Icahn showed that he sold his entire stake in e-commerce company eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in the third quarter while also reporting a position in PayPal The actions were revealed in quarterly disclosures of hedge fund manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They are of great interest to investors wanting to know what savvy traders are buying and selling. The disclosures are backward-looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as investment opportunities. The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm’s stock holdings. The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing stakes in the third quarter. Baupost Group took a new stake of 2.45 million shares.  Scott Ferguson’s Sachem Head Capital Management took a new position in the specialty pharmaceutical company, buying 3.3 million shares. Baupost Group took a new stake of 52.27 mln shares Viking cut its position, selling 3.6 million shares to own 2.5 million at the end of the quarter. Blue Ridge adds to its position with 610,000 shares, raising its holdings to 2.4 million shares. Tiger Global increased its stake by 2.45 mln shares to 3.19 million shares in the online retailer while Soros took a 77,877 share stake worth $39.9 million. Alex Denner’s Sarissa Capital Management cut its stake in the biotech company, selling 118,000 shares to own 200,000 shares. Viking took a new position in the semiconductor company, buying 23.5 million shares. David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital Inc increased its share stake in shares of automaker GM by 11.3 percent to 16.3 million shares.  HealthCor Management liquidated its position in the specialty pharmaceutical company, selling 3.2 million shares. Baupost Group cut its stake in the semiconductor company by 18.7 million shares, leaving it at 1 million shares. HealthCor took a new stake in the drug giant, which makes Viagra, buying 2.7 million shares. Viking bought into the Israeli pharmaceutical company with 8.9 million shares. Marcato Capital Management bought 2 million shares in the rental company, establishing a new position in the stock the firm had owned previously a few years ago. Canyon Capital Advisors bought 1.9 million shares in the internet firm, raising its holding to 5.7 million shares. Tiger Global sold its entire stake of 3.58 mln class A shares in the online real estate firm.

21,PYPL,"PayPal boosts maternity leave, sick time for U.S. employees","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Electronic payment company PayPal Holdings Inc said on Thursday it will increase its paid maternity and sick leave programs and offer time off for U.S. employees to volunteer and care for ill family members. Beginning Jan. 1, expectant mothers will receive eight weeks of maternity leave at full pay, an increase from 80 percent. They can also take eight weeks of paid bonding leave for a total of 16 weeks. Fathers, same-sex spouses and domestic partners also are eligible for the new bonding benefit. The company also will provide eight weeks of paid family care leave so workers can assist a seriously ill spouse, child or parent, 40 hours of sick time each year and up to five paid days for volunteering. Marcia Morales-Jaffe, PayPal’s chief people officer, said the changes are designed to promote healthy living and to give the company’s nearly 10,000 U.S. employees more control over their lives. “These programs include taking time to celebrate a birth or adoption, to care for a seriously ill family member or simply to take a couple of days rest when needed,” she said in a blog post.    California-based PayPal is the latest in a list of companies that have enhanced benefits for employees. Earlier this month, global technology giant eBay Inc increased its maternity pay for new mothers from 10 weeks at 80 percent pay to 24 weeks at full pay. New dads were also offered 12 weeks off at full pay. Video streaming company Netflix Inc, Microsoft Corp, software company Adobe Systems Inc  and Facebook also have revealed enhanced benefit programs. The United States lags behind other developed countries in the amount of leave given to employees. Only 21 percent of U.S. employers offer paid maternity and 17 percent have programs for paternity leave, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.

23,PYPL,"PayPal's revenue beats Street view on higher transactions, customers","(Reuters) - Payment processor PayPal Holdings Inc on Wednesday reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as new customer additions and payment processing volumes surged, and it announced a buyback of $2 billion of its stock. PayPal said it expects 2016 full-year earnings of $1.09 to $1.14 per share, and revenue growth of 16-19 percent on a currency neutral basis. It expects currency fluctuations to impact net revenue by 3 percentage points during the year. Shares of PayPal, which completed its spin-off from eBay Inc in July, rose 6.4 percent to $33.66 in extended trade. PayPal acquired more customers in the fourth quarter than any quarter in the company’s history, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said on an earnings conference call. “It’s becoming increasingly evident that payments is a hard business to crack,” he said. “While many others are attempting to play in this space, PayPal continues to gain market share.” PayPal said its active account base rose by 6.6 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, and that it ended the year with 179 million active customer accounts. That was more than the 177.3 million accounts analysts on average had estimated, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. PayPal said total payment volume grew more than 23 percent to $81.52 billion. The company processed 1.4 billion payment transactions, more than analysts’ estimate of 1.37 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said the company’s share buyback program was a reminder of the strength of its free cash flow. PayPal ended the year with $5.7 billion in cash reserves.  The company said it processed 450 payments per second on Cyber Monday, the highest in its history in 2015. Schulman said the company will continue to look for ways to monetize its peer-to-peer payment application Venmo, that is popular with younger consumers. In 2015, Venmo more than tripled its growth rate and processed $7.5 billion in payments.  PayPal also plans to expand its mobile wallet One Touch to 100 new countries in the next six months. One Touch, which is currently available in 23 countries, allows online shoppers to pay for purchases without re-entering payment information every time they shop online.

The digital payment company’s protest is the first by a major business after North Carolina became the first state last month to enact a measure requiring people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.  The law, which overturned a Charlotte city ordinance, was widely interpreted as an attack on LGBT rights. State lawmakers also voted to prohibit local governments from enacting anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. “The new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal’s mission and culture,” Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said in a statement.

37,PYPL,"As Australian banks snub remitters, digital players emerge","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Digital money transfer companies including PayPal Holdings are rushing to grab a share of Australia’s $35 billion remittance market, hoping to plug a vacuum left by the major domestic banks’ exit from the space last year.  U.S.-listed PayPal intends to roll out its online remitting platform Xoom into Australia soon, senior executives told Reuters, while U.K.-based WorldRemit in April said it had chosen Australia as its Asia-Pacific base.  Australia is a fast-growing market for foreign money transfer operators thanks to a large migrant population with financial links to China, India, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans and the Pacific Islands. One in four Australians has migrated from overseas, government data shows.  “This industry is belatedly moving online. Regulation and technology are driving this change,” said Ismail Ahmed, founder of WorldRemit, which is also expanding in New Zealand. The entry of global digital payments players comes amid growing concern in Australia that the industry was drifting underground, after the major banks closed the accounts of money transfer businesses due to compliance risks. Accounting for about 80 percent of Australia’s banking activity, the country’s four major lenders felt particularly exposed to what regulators have identified as a high-risk sector for criminal activity like money laundering and terrorist financing, including transfers to militant groups like Islamic State. But the international scale and reputation of major digital players means they are better placed to manage the regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny than smaller agents who previously dominated the sector, industry players say. Ahmed said he was scouting for acquisitions of niche players to further expand in Australia, already WorldRemit’s second-biggest market for outbound remittances. New Zealand, with a similar migrant population to Australia’s, is World Remit’s fastest-growing country for outbound transfers. PayPal began making significant inroads into Australia after receiving a licence to hold funds on behalf of customers, although it cannot perform traditional banking services. It can also send money to under-developed countries with poor banking and mobile penetration. “In some markets home delivery is important and in those markets we do offer home delivery, where a courier will show up, ring your doorbell and give you an envelope with cash,” said John Kunze, vice president of PayPal-owned Xoom. While customers can use their bank accounts to transfer money overseas, it can be expensive and time-consuming. Australian banks charge up to A$30 ($22.94) per transfer, compared with A$5-A$8 charged by remitters.  The banks’ mobile applications are clunky compared with the simple interfaces offered by remittance newcomers like InstaRem or WorldRemit. Xoom’s Kunze said that while scale was a big advantage for PayPal, it came with a “mandate to run compliance, consumer protection and a safe business”.  “So we have to keep moving the ball forward on this as we grow,” he said.  Global digital players are well aware that any breach of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules could undermine their significant investment in the sector.  “Online money transfer businesses have the benefit of being able to track where money has come from and where it is going to,” Australian Bankers’ Association Chief Executive Steven Munchenberg said.  “It is still important, however, that they operate within an appropriate regulatory framework.”  ($1 = 1.3079 Australian dollars) ",5022016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-remittances-fintech/as-australian-banks-snub-remitters-digital-players-emerge-idUSKCN0XT22W

39,PYPL,RPT-Financial tech startups compete for overlooked U.S. immigrant market,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - For two decades, Noe Sanchez sent money from California to his father in Mexico City through storefront outlets of traditional remittance firms such as Western Union. Now he grabs his smartphone and uses Remitly, one of several new competing mobile apps promoting cheap and quick international transfers. Sanchez quickly got over his initial unease of sending money through an unfamiliar company. “If it goes badly, I’ll cancel it and try another,” said Sanchez, a 44-year-old Mexican technical support professional in Oakland. Founded in 2011 and backed by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos’s venture capital arm, Remitly is among a vanguard of financial technology, or fintech, companies targeting what they view as an underserved immigrant market - traditionally disregarded as high-risk and low-margin. The upstart firms - along with expanding digital and mobile options from Western Union Co (WU.N) and MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) - are helping immigrants deepen their roots in the United States at a time when incendiary anti-immigration rhetoric dominates national politics. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump recently attacked remittances from illegal immigrants as a form of “welfare” for Mexicans. Trump threatened to impound such money transfers unless Mexico agreed to pay up to $10 billion for his proposed wall on the southern U.S. border. Many emerging companies in the fast-growing fintech sector, by contrast, view financial services for immigrants as an untapped source of revenue. They include remittance apps, such as Remitly, TransferWise and Xoom - an early player bought last year by PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) for $890 million - along with companies such as Lendup and Oportun, which lend to high-risk borrowers. “We’re part of a community of companies that is helping (immigrant) customers understand the landscape of financial services” in the U.S., said Raul Vazquez, chief executive of Oportun. It remains unclear whether Trump’s campaign attacks represent a real threat to the remittance industry. He proposes regulating remittance firms through U.S. anti-terrorism laws that now apply to banks and other financial institutions. The plan has been criticized in part because of the difficulty in differentiating between the transfers of legal and illegal immigrants. “Good luck with that,” U.S. President Barack Obama quipped, reacting to Trump’s proposal at a recent news conference. Trump’s campaign did not respond to request for comment from Reuters. Many financial technology companies expect a continuing boom in cross-border transfers and other financial services for U.S. immigrants. According to the World Bank, remittances to Mexico totaled nearly $25 billion in 2015, their highest level since 2008. Globally, nearly $600 billion is transferred each year.  The World Bank reported that 700 million people opened bank accounts globally between 2011 and 2014 – making them more likely to use financial technology – and about 2 billion more people remained unbanked, representing huge growth potential. Immigrant communities increasingly access financial services through phones. Thirteen percent of Latinos in the U.S. are dependent on smartphones as their only source of internet access, compared to just 4 percent of white people, according to a 2015 Pew study. Those trends play into the strategy of remittance apps like Remitly and Xoom. Many other financial tech firms are private and not required to share financial results, but some claim fast growth in customers or revenue when releasing selective data. Remitly said it transferred five times the amount of money in the first quarter of 2016 as it did in the same period a year earlier. The company said it recently surpassed $1 billion in annual transfers. Western Union, a $9.36-billion public company, acknowledged new threats in its 2015 annual report.  “We are seeing increased competition from, and increased market acceptance of, electronic, mobile, and Internet-based money transfer services,” the company told investors.  In a statement to Reuters, the company said the transfer industry is teeming with new players and that competition had contributed to falling prices. Western Union’s digital money transfer sales reached about $300 million in 2015, and the company expects online and mobile transfers to be a “major driver of overall remittance market growth,” it said. Arjan Schutte, the CEO of fintech investor Core Innovation Capital, said he’d seen more than 100 different business plans for companies wanting to disrupt Western Union or Moneygram, but that’s “not nearly enough relative to the market opportunity.”    Smaller financial technology companies can be flexible in crafting creative solutions to serve customers on the margins, said Lisa McFarland, an executive vice president at Ingo Money, which charges between 1 and 4 percent to deposit paychecks through a mobile app. McFarland previously worked at Visa Inc (V.N) setting up prepaid products for the immigrant market. She said more established financial companies have long struggled to serve lower-income markets because of high development costs and low profit margins. “The problems have to be solved, in many cases, in unique ways,” she said. “That’s what opens the door to technology players.” Oportun and Lendup, for instance, use their own underwriting formulas rather than traditional credit scores to underwrite risky borrowers, and they offer declining interest rates over time for those who pay reliably. The alternative online lending sector as a whole has faced new scrutiny in recent months in the wake of scandals at industry leader Lending Club.  But Lendup says its customer base of half a million borrowers is growing at 15 percent per month. The company says it can charge less than traditional payday lenders because of its underwriting software and because it saves money by not opening physical branches. “If the work is lower margin, technology has a real opportunity to allow you to reach that profitability,” said Leslie Payne, who runs public affairs at Lendup. “Once you reach scale, the economics can work out.” ",5242016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-tech/rpt-financial-tech-startups-compete-for-overlooked-u-s-immigrant-market-idUSL2N18L042

57,PYPL,Alibaba's $60 bln finance arm seeks growth before IPO - sources,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors gearing up for the initial public offering of Ant Financial, the $60 billion online finance arm spun off by e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA.N), will have to wait until at least late 2017 as the business puts growth first, sources say. Sources with knowledge of the plans said Ant Financial, whose anchor business is Alipay, China’s largest online payments service, is focusing on expanding its existing 450 million-strong army of daily users, adding merchants and customers. One of the sources said that, as of last month, Ant had yet to contact Chinese regulators to start the lengthy listing process and join a queue of more than 700 companies waiting to list. An Ant spokeswoman said the group had not set a timetable or location for its listing, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not comment. In addition to online payments, Ant Financial also offers services from wealth management to credit scoring, micro lending and insurance. Alibaba Group set up Alipay in 2004 in the PayPal (PYPL.O) mould, to help Chinese buyers shop online, and later spun it off ahead of its own listing in 2014. At its last fundraising round in April, Ant’s valuation topped $60 billion - just short of the market value of Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N). Its listing has been among the most keenly awaited of recent years. It reshuffled top management at the weekend, which Alibaba founder and Chairman Jack Ma said on Tuesday in Bangkok signaled a listing was in prospect at some point. “We will be looking at an IPO in the next few years; we are not yet sure where we will list or when exactly,” Ma said. The sources, however, said Ant intends to list both in mainland China and Hong Kong. The two applications could be simultaneous, though a shorter waiting time could also mean that Hong Kong-listed H shares could come to market first, the sources said. “Unicorn” start-ups - those worth more than $1 billion - are often short on cash, but not Ant Financial. It raised $4.5 billion in a record funding round in April, backed by China’s sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and a subsidiary of China Construction Bank (0939.HK). It also turns a significant profit. New York-listed Alibaba does not have a direct stake in Ant, due to Beijing’s restrictions on foreign companies owning Chinese financial institutions, but it has a 37.5 percent profit-sharing agreement. According to Alibaba filings, Ant paid it $56 million in royalty and software technology service fees in the June quarter. For growth, Ant is concentrating on expanding a user base that already outnumbers the population of Western Europe, growing in China and abroad, where it has focused on partnerships and also wants to capture spending by Chinese tourists when they travel. In 2015, Chinese tourists spent $215 billion overseas, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Earlier this year, Ant hired Goldman Sachs executive Douglas Feagin to lead the push abroad. None of the sources elaborated on how long the growth plan to boost customer and merchant numbers could take, the possible impact on profits, or whether there were specific targets to hit before the group considers itself ready to list. “This is for long-term growth but will impact short-term financial results,” one of the sources said of the growth push. The sources said Ant’s management wants to ensure an IPO is followed by growth for its shareholders - new and old. Current shareholders include large state-owned institutions: China Life Insurance (601628.SS) (2628.HK), China Post Group -  parent of Postal Savings Bank of China - and a unit of China Development Bank. “There is no firm plan for next year ... But the company has lots of cash, and (raising funds) won’t be the only factor driving the IPO,” said one of the sources. Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of the group’s growth, particularly for its Yu’e Bao money market fund, which will have to maintain attractive rates even as the economy slows. In new markets like India, Ant’s partner, payment group PayTM, is also grappling with fickle consumers, while making inroads in a giant and largely untapped market.  A key complication for Ant’s listing is former parent, Alibaba. Alibaba’s current profit-sharing agreement stipulates it could take up to 33 percent of equity in a listing - but that could hit regulatory hurdles designed to keep financial institutions domestically owned. Alibaba, registered in the Cayman Islands and listed in New York, is considered foreign. The sources said discussions to address that issue had begun with regulators. But for now, it’s growing so fast that its headquarters in Hangzhou, southwest of Shanghai, is bursting at the seams, with rows of employees tightly packed under banners with kung fu sayings beloved of founder Ma. A new headquarters is due in early 2017. ",10112016,http://www.reuters.com/article/alibaba-antfinancial-ipo/alibabas-60-bln-finance-arm-seeks-growth-before-ipo-sources-idUSL8N1C236H

68,PYPL,"PayPal outlook muted on mobile competition, currency trends","(Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) offered a subdued outlook on Thursday, as it faced unpredictable currency fluctuations and an increasingly competitive digital payments market. The payments processor predicted its first-quarter revenue would be roughly in line with analyst expectations, with flat to slightly better operating margins for the full year. PayPal gave the guidance in reporting a 17 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue that mirrored Wall Street expectations. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said fourth-quarter results were hurt by currency movements, and he expected those pressures to continue throughout the year. Paypal stock fell 2.4 percent in after hours trading to $40.49.  Chief Executive Dan Schulman said competition is heating up in mobile payments, and investing in PayPal’s own offerings has become “increasingly important” to gain an advantage over rivals. “Payments are rapidly digitizing,” he said. “Mobile is redefining the face of retail.” The San Jose, California-based company’s earnings report came on the same day Ant Financial Services, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N)  said it would acquire U.S. money-transfer company MoneyGram, in a deal that is expected to shake up the international payments landscape. Ant, the world’s largest financial-technology company, has been expanding at home and overseas as it prepares for a planned initial public offering later this year. Meanwhile, in the United States, PayPal is facing rivals such as Zelle, a soon-to-be-launched platform backed by a consortium of large banks. Technology firms such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc’s GOOGLE.O Google are also looking to capture new customers through payments and money transfer services. To fend off competition, PayPal has been expanding its network of strategic partnerships and launching or acquiring new services. In January it announced an agreement with credit-card issuer Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) to make it easier for PayPal customers to use Discover’s product. It also recently partnered with Citigroup Inc. (C.N) and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), which represents thousands of financial institutions. PayPal is also trying to improve its core offering by adding features like One Touch, which allows customers to pay with a single click. It now has more than 5 million active merchant accounts offering the tool. PayPal has been available since the late-1990s, and for a long time was linked with e-commerce firm eBay Inc (EBAY.O) - giving it more brand familiarity and a much larger customer base than newcomers. But its growth is slower than startups like Venmo, which first started being used in 2009. During the quarter, PayPal’s mobile payments rose 53 percent, to $31 billion. Payment volumes at Venmo, a mobile peer-to-peer payment platform popular with younger costumers surged 126 percent to $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter. PayPal’s total payments volume rose 22 percent to $99 billion. Active customer accounts rose 10 percent to 197 million, beating research firm FactSet StreetAccount’s estimate of 196.5 million. Schulman said growth in mobile payments and new customer accounts helped boost fourth-quarter revenue to $3 billion, up 17 percent compared with a year earlier, the same as what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected. The company expects first-quarter revenue to land in a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.95 billion, on average. Net income rose to $390 million, or 32 cents per share, from $367 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 42 cents per share. PayPal operates in many geographic markets around the globe, with half of its revenue coming from overseas. It tries to hedge against currency-related losses using financial instruments. But in the fourth-quarter, declines in the euro and Australian dollar hurt PayPal’s results, Rainey said. The company expects more pain this year as it adjusts its currency positions, especially in the first half, he added. PayPal is on its second stint as a public company after separating from eBay in 2015.

70,PYPL,Negative effective of currency rates on company results fall in third quarter,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Currency market fluctuations in the third quarter of 2016 had the smallest negative impact on North American companies’ financial results since 2014, FIREapps said in a report on Monday. The companies that quantified an exchange-rate effect reported a negative impact totaling $6.81 billion, the smallest for any quarter since the third quarter of 2014, when the effect was $4.00 billion, according to FIREapps, a currency risk consulting firm. While the firm does not estimate the effect on future results, U.S. corporate reports on the fourth quarter already are showing signs of a stronger impact from U.S. dollar strength. Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N) said on Friday its quarterly sales were hurt by a strong dollar, and PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) also said currency fluctuations hit fourth-quarter results. The U.S. dollar index .DXY rose 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter, while it was down 0.7 percent in the third quarter of 2016. The number of North American companies citing a negative impact from currency fluctuations in the third quarter was 218, below the prior three quarters’ average of 307 companies, the FIREapps report showed.  U.S. multinationals’ foreign currency earnings are worth less in dollars when the dollar is stronger. Nearly half of U.S. S&P; 500 companies’ sales come from overseas, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices data.

71,PYPL,Consumer Reports to consider cyber security in product reviews,"March 6 (Reuters) - Consumer Reports, an influential U.S. non-profit group that conducts extensive reviews of cars, kitchen appliances and other goods, is gearing up to start considering cyber security and privacy safeguards when scoring products. The group, which issues scores that rank products it reviews, said on Monday it had collaborated with several outside organizations to develop methodologies for studying how easily a product can be hacked and how well customer data is secured. Consumer Reports will gradually implement the new methodologies, starting with test projects that evaluate small numbers of products, Maria Rerecich, the organization’s director of electronics testing, said in a phone interview. “This is a complicated area. There is going to be a lot of refinement to get this right,” Rerecich said. The effort follows a surge in cyber attacks leveraging easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities in webcams, routers, digital video recorders and other connected devices, which are sometimes collectively referred to as the internet of things. “Personal cyber security and privacy is a big deal for everyone. This is urgently needed,” said Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist who is a director at Consumer Reports. In one high-profile October attack, hackers used a piece of software known as Mirai to cripple an internet infrastructure provider, blocking access to PayPal, Spotify, Twitter and dozens of other websites for hours. Another attack in November shut off internet access to some 900,000 Deutsche Telekom customers. Security researchers have said the attacks are likely to continue because there is little incentive for manufacturers to spend on securing connected devices. “We need to shed light that this industry really hasn’t been caring about the build quality and software safety,” said Peiter Zatko, a well-known hacker who is director of Cyber Independent Testing Lab, one of the groups that helped Consumer Reports establish the standards. The first draft of the standards are available online at thedigitalstandard.org. Issues covered in the draft include reviewing whether software is built using best security practices, studying how much information is collected about a consumer and checking whether companies delete all user data when an account is terminated.

78,PYPL,Need cash? Azimo lets recipients sort out money transfer headaches,"BERLIN (Reuters) - UK-based online money transfer firm Azimo is turning the process of sending remittances on its head by allowing mobile phone and computer users to send cash to any mobile phone number via text message, leaving it up to the recipient to claim the money. The new feature, which was introduced on Tuesday, eliminates the need for senders to remember the account details or bank IBAN numbers in order to transfer money to recipients, a stumbling block that has complicated existing money transfers. Indian mobile ecommerce site Paytm also operates a similar feature. Paytm is owned by One97 Communications and has proved to be hugely popular since the country’s government demonitized all old 500 ($7.70) and 1000 rupee banknotes in November. Azimo, a UK-regulated firm, allows phone or computer users in 28 Eurozone countries to transfer money to around 190 countries. It is mainly used by immigrants to send money home to relatives in emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, West Africa, South Asia, the Philippines and Latin America. Azimo’s ‘request’ function brings recipients into the process for the first time and is made possible by the recent proliferation of smartphones in emerging markets, something not possible when the London-based company launched in 2012. “People on the receiving end in emerging markets now have smartphones, so they can be in charge. They can have more control in requesting the cash, receiving the cash,” Michael Kent, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, told Reuters in a phone interview. “This is built for the way customers on both sides of a remittance work today.” Azimo users can choose one of their phone contacts to send money. Recipients receive a text message with a link to download the Azimo app and claim the money. They can then link the app to a financial account or go to a local kiosk to claim their money. The company also is introducing the money request feature in the United States and Canada and will roll the service out across globally in the course of the year. Azimo says it has more than 1 million senders and receivers using its apps. It competes with other online remittance firms including WorldRemit and CurrencyFair, as well as kiosk-base money transfer giants such as Western Union and MoneyGram, which also now offer online money transfers services. The market has heated up in recent years as U.S. web-based payments player PayPal acquired remittance app Xoom and Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], an affiliate of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba has sought to buy MoneyGram, but faces U.S. regulatory challenges over national security concerns. Azimo has raised around $47 million (38 million pounds) in venture funding over the past five years. Kent said the company was fully funded until at least 2018.

Earnings were back in the spotlight, a day after the Trump administration unveiled its tax reform priorities without details on how the reform would be paid for, raising questions on whether deficit hawks in Congress would support it. Comcast rose 2.1 percent to $39.59 after touching a record high of $40.62 as strong subscriber growth brought a forecast-beating profit. Overall profits of S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Most folks were expecting a build in earnings acceleration and that’s what we’ve got. Despite all the economic and geopolitical noise, ultimately the market has been responding to improving earnings,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. He said a premium has been built into stock prices on bets of tax reform and other policies expected from the Trump administration, so “when that is in question you see a sideways action.” U.S. businesses would mostly benefit if President Donald Trump’s plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas becomes law. But the economic benefits and the timing of a possible bill remain in question. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.24 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,981.33, the S&P; 500 gained 1.32 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,388.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.71 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,048.94. Technology stocks will be the focus after the bell with heavyweights Microsoft and Alphabet reporting results. Intuit rose 8.5 percent to $125.63 after it reported consumer tax-season results and reiterated its quarter and full-year forecast. PayPal shares hit a record high a day after it raised its earnings outlook and reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Sportswear maker Under Armour shares jumped 9.9 percent to $21.67 after it posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Energy was the biggest decliner among the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors, falling 1.1 percent on the back of a 0.9 percent decline in U.S. crude futures. American Airlines dropped 5.2 percent to $43.98. The company said it had offered a mid-contract pay increase for pilots and flight attendants that JPMorgan analysts called “a wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups.” Indexes ticked up but declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1.03-to-1 while on Nasdaq a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 76 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 180 new highs and 45 new lows. About 7.11 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

93,PYPL,U.S. banks launching answer to peer-to-peer payment app Venmo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. banking industry is about to launch its answer to the popular mobile payments app Venmo, in what is likely to be the biggest change in years in how individuals exchange funds digitally. Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. They plan to announce details of the launch on Monday, and expect another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year. The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly - known as person-to-person payments - with a few taps on their smartphones. That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing. Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said. “By coming together to offer Zelle, we are providing a large majority of Americans with a safe, fast and easy way to move money,” said Bill Wallace, head of digital at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets. JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) will be the first to plug into Zelle. The network is the product of an industry consortium called Early Warning Services LLC, whose seven owners have more than 86 million U.S. mobile banking customers. Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work. In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks. In addition to Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) all offer payment platforms that allow individuals to send money to each other. The banks want to leap over those sleek but scattered offerings by connecting their critical mass of account holders through a single network. “Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers,” said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning. “Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks.” Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. And despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks. The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates. “We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to,” said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at U.S. Bank. Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash. Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. As more banks connect and more customers use the service, sending cash to another individual will simply involve knowing the person’s mobile phone number or email address. Later this year, individuals with accounts at banks not connected with Zelle will be able to use its real-time features by downloading an app and pairing it with a Visa Inc (V.N) or Mastercard Inc (MA.N) debit account. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing “QuickPay with Zelle” on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away. ",6122017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-payments-zelle/u-s-banks-launching-answer-to-peer-to-peer-payment-app-venmo-idUSL1N1J31IR
94,PYPL,PayPal invests in online lender LendUp,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc has invested in LendUp, a San Francisco-based startup that offers loans online to consumers who have been traditionally overlooked by banks because they are considered too risky.  LendUp said it had secured a strategic investment from the payments company on Wednesday. It did not disclose terms of the deal. PayPal confirmed in a statement that it had made an investment. LendUp also said that Carrie Dolan, the former chief financial officer of online lender LendingClub and treasurer of Charles Schwab Corp, has been appointed as an adviser to its board of directors.  Founded in 2012, LendUp is among the cohort of young tech-savvy companies that automate parts of the lending process to make it cheaper and faster to provide loans to consumers and small businesses online. It seeks to differentiate itself by offering products that it believes can help consumers with low credit scores and volatile incomes achieve financial health. LendUp’s chief executive, Sasha Orloff, said in an interview that the company was planning to use new injection of cash to expand its customer base and was also exploring ways it could work with PayPal. “Dan Schulman has been very vocal about supporting the underserved,” Orloff said, referring to PayPal’s chief executive. PayPal has been expanding partnerships and acquiring new services to gain advantage over rivals in a highly competitive digital payments market. LendUp describes its first product, LendUp Ladder, as an alternative to traditional payday loans. It carries a flat fee and allows users to borrow more if they earn points by paying back their loans on time or watching financial education videos. It also offers a credit card that does not require a security deposit.    The company, however, has been the subject of regulatory actions over its business practices. Last September the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered LendUp to pay $3.6 million in fines and refunds to customers over lending practices that took place from 2012 to 2014. The same month, the company agreed to pay $2.7 million in a settlement with the California Department of Business Oversight over allegations of illegal fees and violations of payday and installment lending laws. Orloff said that in its early days the company did not have the “team in place to understand the complexities of the financial services space,” but has since built up its legal and compliance team.

104,PYPL,"PayPal raises 2017 forecasts on growth in users, payment volumes","(Reuters) - Digital payments company PayPal Holdings Inc raised its earnings outlook on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results, driven by growth in users and transaction volumes. The San Jose, California-based company beat Wall Street expectations for both profit and revenue in the second quarter, and raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share, from $1.74 per share to $1.79 per share. PayPal shares rose 2.9 percent to $60.50 in after-hours trading. Since separating from eBay Inc in 2015, PayPal has been signing more partnerships and making acquisitions in a bid to gain an edge over rivals in the highly competitive digital payments market. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman pointed to efforts PayPal has made to improve the customer experience, especially on mobile devices, and deals it has inked with Chinese digital services provider Baidu Inc and No. 2 U.S. lender Bank of America Corp to expand its customer base. Earlier this month PayPal also struck deals with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Apple Inc. The company added 6.5 million accounts in the second quarter, up 80 percent from the year-ago period. It was the highest quarterly growth in three years. The company processed $1.8 billion in total payment volumes, up 23 percent from the second quarter of 2016.

PayPal is maintaining a goal to get customers to use its service twice a week, on average, something Schulman said is “within our reach.” For the second quarter, it reported adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

108,PYPL,China's Baidu enters strategic partnership with Paypal to tap Chinese tourists,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Baidu Inc said on Friday that it has entered a strategic agreement with PayPal Holdings Inc to tap overseas merchants as Chinese tech companies ramp up the fight for overseas payment partnerships.  Under the agreement, Baidu’s payment platform, Baidu Wallet, will be accepted by roughly 17 million PayPal merchants globally, the Chinese firm said in a statement on Thursday. “Partnering with PayPal on technology and product innovation will provide Baidu users with the ultimate cross-border consumer experience,” said Baidu senior vice president Guang Zhu. The deal comes as China’s top payment firms, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd affiliate Ant Financial and Tencent Holdings Ltd, are making aggressive moves to expand their payment networks overseas. This year Ant Financial entered a $1.2 billion bid for U.S. remittance firm MoneyGram International Inc, a deal that has attracted scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers who say it could threaten national security. Ant has also purchased stakes in half a dozen payment firms across Asia as part of a plan to expand its finance business outside of China.  Tencent’s WeChat Pay has also inked a series of partnerships with global payment firms and earlier this month said it has applied directly for a Malaysian payments license. PayPal, which reported better-than-expected results on Thursday, entered into new partnerships with Apple Inc and Bank of America this month. It has also targeted Southeast Asian markets recently through local partnerships, but earlier attempts to enter the Chinese market directly have been unsuccessful due to tight regulation and strong local players. PayPal will work with Baidu’s financial services group under the new agreement to target cross-border payments between Chinese consumers and online businesses based outside of China. Baidu Wallet has roughly 100 million users, and still trails behind Tencent’s WeChat and Ant Financial’s Alipay in terms of users and global reach.

Under the agreement, Baidu’s payment platform, Baidu Wallet, will be accepted by roughly 17 million PayPal merchants globally, the Chinese firm said in a statement on Thursday. “Partnering with PayPal on technology and product innovation will provide Baidu users with the ultimate cross-border consumer experience,” said Baidu senior vice president Guang Zhu. The deal comes as China’s top payment firms, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd affiliate Ant Financial and Tencent Holdings Ltd, are making aggressive moves to expand their payment networks overseas. This year Ant Financial entered a $1.2 billion bid for U.S. remittance firm MoneyGram International Inc, a deal that has attracted scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers who say it could threaten national security. Ant has also purchased stakes in half a dozen payment firms across Asia as part of a plan to expand its finance business outside of China.  Tencent’s WeChat Pay has also inked a series of partnerships with global payment firms and earlier this month said it has applied directly for a Malaysian payments license. PayPal, which reported better-than-expected results on Thursday, entered into new partnerships with Apple Inc and Bank of America this month. It has also targeted Southeast Asian markets recently through local partnerships, but earlier attempts to enter the Chinese market directly have been unsuccessful due to tight regulation and strong local players. PayPal will work with Baidu’s financial services group under the new agreement to target cross-border payments between Chinese consumers and online businesses based outside of China. Baidu Wallet has roughly 100 million users, and still trails behind Tencent’s WeChat and Ant Financial’s Alipay in terms of users and global reach.

110,PYPL,PayPal to expand lending offering with acquisition,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Payments firm PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) has agreed to acquire online lending company Swift Financial in a bid to expand its business that provides working capital to merchants.  The acquisition will allow PayPal to offer loans to the larger businesses that process payments through its platform and better provide credit to firms that are not yet users of its services, the company said on Thursday.  San Jose, California–based PayPal did not disclose terms of the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval. Founded in 2006, Delaware-based Swift Financial extends credit to businesses through loans and advances. PayPal has been offering short-term loans to its smaller merchants through a division called PayPal Working Capital since 2013. It uses data on the payments it processes for its merchants to assess their credit-worthiness.  The company has lent more than $3 billion to 115,000 small businesses in loans of up to $125,000 since inception. The deal will enable PayPal to start offering term loans of up to $500,000 to its larger merchants and take advantage of Swift Financial’s data capabilities to lend to companies that may not be long-time users of its services.  “This is an area where customers have been asking for more,” Darrell Esch, vice president and commercial officer of global credit at PayPal, said in an interview.  Since breaking off from eBay Inc in 2015, PayPal has been expanding partnerships and acquiring new services to gain advantage over rivals in a highly competitive digital payments market. Online lending, which took off after banks retreated from offering loans to small businesses and consumers in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, takes advantage of digital technologies to offer loans at lower costs.  Online lenders say they are better at servicing new types of e-commerce companies because their business models may not fit the established underwriting parameters used by traditional financial institutions such as banks. Linda Lightman, chief executive of an online luxury consignment business she started from her home 17 years ago and a long-time PayPal user, secured a loan from it in June as the payments company launched its first loan product for larger businesses with Swift Financial. “With a bank it is a much more elongated experience,” Lightman told Reuters. “For PayPal it was a day. They understand our business to begin with.” ",8102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-m-a-swiftfinancial/paypal-to-expand-lending-offering-with-acquisition-idUSKBN1AQ1JM

113,PYPL,U.S. banks move to broaden reach of Zelle instant payments app,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A consortium of U.S. banks is taking another step next week to attract a critical mass of users to their Zelle network, a rival to PayPal’s Venmo for handling instant payments between individuals with smartphones. Starting on Tuesday, the group said it would offer a Zelle payments app for Apple and Android phones for individuals to send and receive funds through U.S. Visa and Mastercard bank debit card accounts, regardless of whether their bank or credit union had plugged into the network. Until now Zelle had only been available on phones and tablets through bank and credit union apps that 13 financial institutions started rolling out in June. At least 17 more have contracted to join Zelle, but are not yet fully connected, according to Early Warning Services, which is owned by a group of big banks and operates the network. “It is more likely that you will be able to send and receive payments with your friends and family with the expansion of the network,” Lou Anne Alexander, group president for payments at Early Warning said in an interview. Banks already connected through Early Warning have a huge base of customers who could use Zelle. The banks handled 100 million instant payments, worth $33.6 billion (£25.46 billion) in the first half of 2017, mostly before the Zelle name appeared, according to Early Warning. In the same period, Venmo, an upstart bought by PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) and better known than Zelle, reported moving $14.8 billion. The banks started teaming up in instant payments more than six years ago, but have picked up their pace because Venmo’s volume is doubling annually and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is adding tools for payments between users of its devices.   Sarah Grotta, a payments expert at Mercator Advisory Group, said Zelle needs an app that works well for people with accounts outside of the connected banks. The new app would ideally let them quickly send, and confirm, payments with only an email address or mobile phone number, as people do with Venmo, she said. “They have to have a great experience, too, for this to take off,” said Grotta. “It still very much a work in progress.” Alexander said Zelle has had “growing pains,” most of which involved first-time users. For example, sending to someone who has not registered an account can result in delays until Early Warning checks for fraud.

116,PYPL,PayPal rolls out Venmo payments to its U.S. retailers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) said more than two million U.S. retailers will be able to accept payments through its mobile app Venmo starting this week, seeking to broaden its reach with a brand that has been a hit with young people. Venmo, which has been part of PayPal since 2013, is one of the most popular mobile applications to make person-to-person payments in the United States. It processed $8 billion (£6 billion) in payments in the second quarter of this year. Venmo users will be able to use their app balance or linked cards and bank account to shop on the mobile sites of almost all merchants that accept payments with PayPal, including retailers such as Foot Locker, Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU.O) and Forever 21. Paypal started slowly introducing the ability to pay select businesses with Venmo early last year. “At Venmo from the very early days our vision was to always let you use it for whatever you want to buy,” Ben Mills, head of product, at Venmo, said in an interview.  The company will be charging merchants fees for processing Venmo payments, Mills said, adding that the service’s ease of use could help increase their sales, he added. Over the coming months Venmo users will also be able to transfer money instantly from Venmo to their bank accounts for a $0.25 fee per transfer.  At the moment Venmo immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. San Jose, California-based PayPal has been expanding its services to gain advantage over rivals in the digital payments market, particularly in P2P payments, where competition has intensified. This year a consortium of some of the largest banks in the United States launched Zelle, a network that allows their customers to send money to each other instantly on their smartphones.  PayPal also said that retail purchases using Venmo will be covered by its purchase protection scheme, where customers may get refunds if they do not receive a product or it is different than described.

118,PYPL,"PayPal tops profit estimates, lifts target on mobile payments growth","(Reuters) - Sharp growth in mobile payments led PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) to report a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and lift its guidance for earnings through the rest of the year. The San Jose, California-based payments company has been working hard in recent years to expand its reach to new customers through partnerships and acquisitions, particularly in mobile payments. Those deals are clearly starting to bear fruit, analysts said. “It was just a very strong quarter across the board,” said A.B. Mendez, an analyst and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors. PayPal shares were up 3.9 percent at $69.89 in after-hours trading following the results. Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from a company that mostly processed transactions for its parent to a payments giant that handles money transfers between other companies and customers, as well as friends, roommates, overseas relatives and small businesses. It has partnered with household names like Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype, and acquired startups like online lender Swift Financial and remittances company Xoom. It also owns Venmo, the mobile payments app that is popular with young adults, and still handles transactions for eBay. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman characterized the third quarter as possibly the best since its split from eBay and said PayPal is on the hunt for more acquisitions. “We have very strong balance sheet, and it’s a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward,” he said. The company’s adjusted profit rose 32 percent during the third quarter to $560 million, or 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $3.24 billion. PayPal lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share from $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share. It expects 50 cents to 52 cents per share in earnings during the fourth quarter, compared with an average analyst estimate of 51 cents. Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space. Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion. Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes. Earlier this week, PayPal said it would soon allow more than 2 million merchant customers to start accepting payments through the platform.

133,PYPL,"Wall Street ticks up, lifted by Verizon, chipmakers","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday, with Verizon boosting the telecoms sector after the stock got an upgrade, while a deal in semiconductors lifted high-performing tech shares. With no major earnings or economic data scheduled this week, trading volumes were thin and expected to get even quieter leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and an early market close on Friday. Overall trading volume was the lightest in a month. Verizon (VZ.N) boosted the telecom services sector of the S&P; 500 with a 1.7 percent advance to $46.20 after a Wells Fargo note highlighted the stock’s valuation and said it is “an attractive yield play.” Telecoms .SPLRCL are down 17 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent advance on the S&P; 500. “There’s a bounce in telecoms, which have been the worst group so far this year,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago. “There’s always a chance that something disrupts the apple cart, but there’s very little news and a lot of people focusing on the football games and the turkey dinner,” he said, referring to the staples of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Cavium (CAVM.O) touched a record high of $84.41 after larger rival Marvell (MRVL.O) said it would buy the company for about $6 billion.

Small cap stocks on the Russell 2000  rose 0.7 percent, outperforming the large-cap indexes. Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) shares slid after reports the U.S. Justice Department will sue to prevent AT&T; (T.N) from buying Time Warner. Time Warner ended down 1.1 percent at $87.71.  Health stocks .SPXHC were weighed by a 2.0-percent drop in Merck (MRK.N) to $54.10 and a 0.8 percent fall in Bristol-Myers (BMY.N) after Roche (ROG.S) announced positive trial results for a competing cancer drug.

135,PYPL,PayPal purchase protection doesn't shield from lawsuits: German court,"KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s highest court ruled on Wednesday that PayPal’s purchase protection scheme does not shield customers from being sued for the price of items they bought online even if PayPal had granted them a refund. Under PayPal’s scheme, customers may get their money back  if they do not receive a product they ordered and paid for via its platform or if the goods are different than described. The German court’s ruling relates to two separate suits in which customers had demanded and received a refund of money they had paid for online purchases, in one case a smartphone and in the other a band saw. In both cases, PayPal had transferred the money back from the sellers to the customers. But the court said on Wednesday that the sellers still had a right to pursue payment of the purchase price, even after money had been refunded, because PayPal’s policies stated that its purchase protection scheme did not affect the contractual rights of the buyer and seller. It also said that PayPal’s purchase protection only involved a “simplified test” that could not ensure the interests of both parties were sufficiently met. PayPal said it would await details behind the court’s ruling before taking any action.

146,PYPL,EBay investors cheer move to ditch PayPal as main payments partner,"(Reuters) - Shares of eBay (EBAY.O) hit an all-time high on Thursday after the e-commerce platform unveiled a plan to take more control of customer payments from long-standing partner PayPal, a move analysts said would help it compete better with Amazon. Dutch fintech company Adyen will become eBay’s primary payments processor under the plan, which seeks to have more transactions conducted directly on eBay’s sites. Analysts said that might bring in more revenue for eBay while lowering costs, adding to optimism from a strong holiday quarter for the e-commerce company. “Moving away from PayPal (PYPL.O), lowering the costs of selling products on the marketplace makes eBay a more significant competitor because it lowers the relative cost versus others including Amazon (AMZN.O),” said D.A. Davidson & Co’s analyst Tom Forte. EBay is adapting to the likes of online crafts retailer Etsy Inc’s (ETSY.O) model by taking control of the payment process on its marketplaces from PayPal, Forte added. “But to be clear, there will always be a place for PayPal on eBay — it just will be less prominent,” said Forte. Some analysts said they were surprised by eBay’s estimate of the benefits from taking payments intermediary service in-house. The company said it would add $500 million to operating profit after the PayPal deal expires in mid-2020. Transactions through eBay account for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal, whose shares sank more than 8 percent in response on Thursday. PayPal might be able to fill the hole created by eBay thanks to its strong growth rate, although that is not certain at this point, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said. EBay’s backing for Adyen could turn the smaller payment processor into a “much more robust competitor” to PayPal over time, Palmer added. Other analysts, however, said PayPal, which has been eBay’s preferred provider for the past 15 years and will remain a payment page option on the platform for the foreseeable future, had the scale to ride out the blow. “Over time, given the recent agreements with Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N), PayPal will be able to scale and expand margins,” Wedbush Securities analysts said in a client note.

148,PYPL,PayPal's shares fall after eBay announces new payment partner,"(Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc’s (PYPL.O) shares fell as much as 12 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after former parent company eBay Inc (EBAY.O) said it had signed up a new primary payment processor. EBay said it will start processing payments globally using Dutch payments company Adyen, allowing its users to remain on the eBay website when checking out.  PayPal said eBay shoppers will still be able to select PayPal as a form of payment until at least July 2023. The news from eBay came as PayPal reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates but gave a disappointing outlook for the first quarter. PayPal shares initially fell 5 percent after the release of the quarterly results. The chief executive officer of PayPal, Dan Schulman, said on a call with analysts that the changing relationship with eBay was very “manageable” and that it was in line with PayPal’s new strategy.  EBay accounts for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal.  PayPal was spun out of eBay in 2015 and has since been working to transform itself from a company that mainly processed payments for its parent company to one that processes payments for other large companies and their customers, as well as for individuals paying family and friends.  PayPal’s new strategic direction has led to partnerships with numerous large financial institutions and big technology companies including Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). San Jose, California-based PayPal forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of 52 cents to 54 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  PayPal expects revenue for the full year of $15 billion to $15.25 billion. Analysts had been forecasting $15.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  PayPal’s focus on partnerships and acquisitions have been paying off with growth in payment volumes and users. The company processed $131 billion in payments in the fourth quarter, up 32 percent from a year earlier, and added 8.7 million active customers. PayPal has been looking to freshen its brand and deepen usage with younger customers through its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo. Venmo processed around $35 billion in payments in 2017, up 97 percent.  PayPal’s net income rose to $620 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $390 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 55 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 52 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue climbed to $3.74 billion from $2.98 billion. The results included a net tax expense of $180 million connected to the recent U.S. tax reform, the company said.

Analysts said that might bring in more revenue for eBay while lowering costs, adding to optimism from a strong holiday quarter for the company. “There is no denying eBay has got its groove back and a series of shrewd moves by management has the company reinvigorated and well positioned for future growth,” Tom Forte, analyst at brokerage D.A. Davidson & Co wrote in a note. Some analysts said they were surprised by eBay’s estimate of the benefits from taking payments intermediary service in-house. The company said it would add $500 million to operating profit after the PayPal deal expires in mid-2020. Transactions through eBay account for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal, whose shares sank more than 7 percent in response on Thursday. Other analysts, however, said PayPal, which has been eBay’s preferred provider for the past 15 years and will remain a payment page option on the platform for the foreseeable future, had the scale to ride out the blow. “Over time, given the recent agreements with Visa and MasterCard, PayPal will be able to scale and expand margins,” Wedbush Securities analyst said.

150,PYPL,UPDATE 2-PayPal's shares fall after eBay announces new payment partner,"(Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc’s (PYPL.O) shares fell as much as 12 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after former parent company eBay Inc (EBAY.O) said it had signed up a new primary payment processor. EBay said it will start processing payments globally using Dutch payments company Adyen, allowing its users to remain on the eBay website when checking out.  PayPal said eBay shoppers will still be able to select PayPal as a form of payment until at least July 2023. The news from eBay came as PayPal reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates but gave a disappointing outlook for the first quarter. PayPal shares initially fell 5 percent after the release of the quarterly results. The chief executive officer of PayPal, Dan Schulman, said on a call with analysts that the changing relationship with eBay was very “manageable” and that it was in line with PayPal’s new strategy.  EBay accounts for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal.  PayPal was spun out of eBay in 2015 and has since been working to transform itself from a company that mainly processed payments for its parent company to one that processes payments for other large companies and their customers, as well as for individuals paying family and friends.  PayPal’s new strategic direction has led to partnerships with numerous large financial institutions and big technology companies including Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). San Jose, California-based PayPal forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of 52 cents to 54 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  PayPal expects revenue for the full year of $15 billion to $15.25 billion. Analysts had been forecasting $15.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  PayPal’s focus on partnerships and acquisitions have been paying off with growth in payment volumes and users. The company processed $131 billion in payments in the fourth quarter, up 32 percent from a year earlier, and added 8.7 million active customers. PayPal has been looking to freshen its brand and deepen usage with younger customers through its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo. Venmo processed around $35 billion in payments in 2017, up 97 percent.  PayPal’s net income rose to $620 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $390 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 55 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 52 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue climbed to $3.74 billion from $2.98 billion. The results included a net tax expense of $180 million connected to the recent U.S. tax reform, the company said.

152,PYPL,PayPal settles U.S. charges over alleged Venmo disclosure failure: FTC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), parent of peer-to-peer payments app Venmo, has settled U.S. charges it failed to give critical disclosures to users regarding privacy and the availability of funds transferred into a Venmo account, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday. The FTC said in a statement that the alleged actions violated federal law aimed at protecting consumer information and that as part of the proposed settlement Venmo must submit to third-party reviews of its compliance with privacy rules for 10 years, among other actions. PayPal was not required to pay any money as part of the settlement.  The FTC said that Venmo would sometimes notify users that deposits had been made to their Venmo accounts and could be transferred to their banks. But, at times, when users tried to make that transfer, Venmo either froze the account and sometimes reversed the payment. This meant that some users were unable to pay bills and suffered financial hardship, the FTC said. The agency also alleged that Venmo at times misrepresented what actions were needed to keep transactions private, resulting in disclosures that users did not want, the FTC said. PayPal head of corporate communications Amanda Miller said the alleged problems occurred before PayPal bought Venmo in 2013. “We are pleased to conclude this process with the FTC in a cooperative way,” Miller said in a statement. “As a core part of PayPal’s and Venmo’s business and operations, we’ve taken steps to significantly strengthen our privacy and data security practices.” ",2272018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-usa-ftc/paypal-settles-u-s-charges-over-alleged-venmo-disclosure-failure-ftc-idUSKCN1GB2EY

156,PYPL,"UPDATE 5-China's Ant ups fundraising target, valuation could hit $150 bln -sources","HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Ant Financial Services Group is in talks with investors to boost its fundraising target to at least $8 billion, which could see its valuation jumping to about $150 billion, people with knowledge of the plan said. Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings is likely to be the lead investor in the latest round of equity raising by the company, controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma, three people said. Reuters reported in February that Ant, owner of China’s top online payment platform Alipay, was planning to raise up to $5 billion, which could value the firm at more than $100 billion. The fundraising plan comes ahead of an expected stock market flotation, though Ant has neither set a timetable for the initial public offering nor has it chosen any location for the same. One of the people said Ant could end up raising between $8 billion and $10 billion as a result of strong investor demand. All the people spoke to Reuters on the condition that they not be named as the fundraising details were confidential. Ant and Temasek declined to comment. Alibaba did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. A pre-IPO round is an increasingly common move by sought-after Chinese companies to establish valuations and widen their investor base ahead of going public. A $150 billion valuation would make Ant one of the biggest public flotations ever, dwarfing this year’s launch of Spotify and Dropbox. It would compare to the $104 billion float of Facebook six years ago or Alibaba’s own $168 billion valuation in 2014. Ant’s last fundraising in April 2016 valued the company, seen by some analysts as one of the most valuable Alibaba assets due to its unique position in Chinese e-commerce, at about $60 billion. Shares in e-commerce giant Alibaba rose 4.3 percent in New York on Tuesday. Alibaba said in February it was taking a 33 percent stake in Ant, replacing the previous system where it received 37.5 percent of Ant’s pre-tax profit, in what was viewed as an important step ahead of any IPO. “Part of the increase in valuation might be because the new investors have received extra features,” said Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida. “But part of the increase is because the company is continuing to live up to expectations, and is becoming an even more important player in China’s mobile payment space.” Temasek has expanded its tech investments in the last few years and recent deals include Chinese facial recognition technology developer SenseTime Group and Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Ant was  planning to raise $9 billion in its planned round of funding, potentially valuing the company at $150 billion. The WSJ said it was expected to list on both domestic and overseas exchanges, in line with speculation that it would list in both Hong Kong and New York. Appetite among U.S. investors has been strong this year for tech sector debuts by Dropbox, Spotify and Zscaler, easing concerns raised by the fall in Snap Inc’s shares last year. Alibaba set up Alipay in 2004, modeling the business on PayPal, to help Chinese buyers shop online, and in 2011 controversially spun it off and rebranded the payment processor into Ant Financial three years later.  After becoming a dominant payments company in China, Ant Financial focused on international markets by buying a stake in Indian payment firm Paytm and Thai financial technology firm Ascend Money.  Its attempt to buy U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International was, however, blocked at the start of this year by U.S. officials on national security grounds, a blow to Ma who had promised President Donald Trump that he would create 1 million U.S. jobs. Current shareholders in Ant include large state-owned institutions such as China Life Insurance and China Post Group, parent of Postal Savings Bank of China.

158,PYPL,"EXPLAINER-Ant Financial's $150 bln valuation, and the big recent bump-up","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Financial’s rapid climb to become the world’s biggest super unicorn valued by some investors at around $150 billion showcases investor enthusiasm for the biggest Chinese tech companies and also how quickly valuations can shift. Just two months ago, bankers and investors were tentatively talking of a figure closer to $100 billion.  Ant’s biggest and best-known business is Alipay, the biggest player in China’s $17 trillion online payments market. Ant also sells wealth management products and offers small loans and credit scores, among other ventures. Jack Ma, founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N) controls Ant. Analysts at Barclays estimate that online payments accounted for 55 per cent of Ant’s $8.9 billion revenue last year, but they expect that to fall to one-third by 2021 as the company focuses on encouraging its 600 million customers to use more of its other, higher-margin services. At a valuation of around $150 billion, Ant will trail only the big four state-controlled banks and insurer Ping An among financial-focused firms in China. It will also be about 50 percent more valuable than Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Much of the rapid rise in its valuation is being attributed to the company’s disclosure of additional performance data, which although by no means its full financials, included some 2017 full-year figures that showed faster-than-expected growth. That helped investors and analysts tweak their financial models.  Ant’s status as one of the biggest tech groups in China is also boosting demand.  “It’s not very often to get a chance to invest in super unicorns like Ant, even in China where you’ve seen a tech boom for years,” said one existing investor in Ant. “If you miss this one, you don’t know when the next one comes.”  Robert Kapito, co-founder of U.S. asset manager BlackRock, this week described himself as “shocked” at Ant’s likely valuation but many analysts are not blinking.  Barclays analysts this month valued the company at $155 billion, based on multiplying their estimate of Ant’s 2019 net operating profit less adjusted tax (NOPLAT) by what they said was its conservative price/earnings ratio of 28.  NOPLAT is often used by analysts to measure companies’ operating efficiency because it strips out the impact of interest payments and other financing costs. Other groups have used alternative means of valuing Ant. Jefferies analysts, who believe up to 70 per cent of Ant’s 2017 business came from online payments, used Paypal (PYPL.O) as a comparison and valued Ant at $133 billion, equivalent to seven times their estimate for its 2019 sales - in line with the multiple implied by PayPal’s share price.  Based on traditional price-earnings measures, $150 billion implies a price 71 times Ant’s 2017 pre-tax profits or 85 times its net profits, assuming a tax rate of 16 per cent - the average paid by Alibaba in recent years. Ant does not disclose actual profits and its pre-tax earnings of 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) are calculated from disclosures in filings by Alibaba, which is set to become Ant’s one-third owner soon.  Alibaba itself trades at 43 times last year’s profits as does rival Tencent (0700.HK), home of Alipay rival WeChat Pay. Ant, expected to go public in the next two years, has vowed to reach 2 billion users worldwide in the next decade and it has been investing overseas, buying a stake in Indian payment firm Paytm and Thai financial technology firm Ascend Money, among others. “Ant has taken a very strategic view of international expansion - with highly-targeted investments, joint ventures, and partnerships across the region,” said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific Fintech leader at EY. “While mainland China remains core, I wouldn’t underestimate the potential upside of their international endeavors.” But it could be China itself that causes Ant problems. While Alipay holds 54 per cent of the country’s fast-growing mobile payments market, WeChat Pay holds 38.2 per cent, according to Jefferies. Both are keen to increase their dominance.  Beijing also has a history of unexpected rule changes which can derail business plans. Last year regulators suddenly took steps to rein in the online lending market - a key growth engine for Ant - as part of its wider crackdown on easy credit.  “These things that Ant is doing are quite innovative and new. They may work this year, but stop working next year, depending on China’s regulations,” said a Hong Kong-based equity analyst with a Japanese asset manager. “It’s hard to analyze their value.” ",4182018,http://www.reuters.com/article/antfinancial-valuation/explainer-ant-financials-150-bln-valuation-and-the-big-recent-bump-up-idUSL3N1RT23U

The pair aim to allow Barclays customers in the United States and Britain to use their PayPal accounts on the bank’s online and mobile phone-based platforms while Barclays products will be used in PayPal accounts. The move comes amid mounting concerns from bank industry executives that big technology companies such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) in the U.S. or China’s Alibaba (BABA.K) could come to dominate the $1.8 trillion global payments industry. With their ever-expanding customer bases and nimbler platforms, the tech companies could supplant the banks as the face of an industry that accounts for 34 percent of all banking revenues, according to consultancy McKinsey. The announcement from Barclays shows one route traditional lenders are taking, to try and collaborate with large technology companies rather than compete. Amazon and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) are exploring offering a checking account together in the U.S., according to media reports in March, while those two firms plus Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) are mulling a collaboration on healthcare payments. Barclays and PayPal made clear that they are still discussing possible ways the companies’ services could be combined. “By joining forces, we can make it much easier for people to manage their money and payments,” Barclays UK Chief Executive Ashok Vaswani said in the bank’s statement.

162,PYPL,"UPDATE 2-PayPal quarterly profit beats estimates, shares rise","(Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) on Wednesday reported first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates as the payment processor benefited from higher volumes of mobile payments and strong merchant services business.  PayPal processed $132 billion in payments in the first quarter of 2018, up 32 percent from a year earlier.  Mobile payment volumes were up 52 percent in the quarter to $49 billion, while merchant services payment volumes grew 30 percent and accounted for 87 percent of total payment volumes.  Shares of the company, which closed down 1.7 percent, rose 3.3 pct to $76.43 after the bell. “Overall we believe this was a solid quarter for PayPal,” Josh Olson, a senior analyst at Edward Jones Research, said in a note. “As the digital payments leader, we see PayPal benefiting from the fast-growing industry.”   Since separating from online marketplace eBay in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from mostly processing transactions for its parent company to offering an array of global digital payment services.

The company has sought to grow through acquisitions and partnerships with large banks and technology firms including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N),  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and  Facebook Inc (FB.O).
