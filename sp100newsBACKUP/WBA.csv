6,WBA,Walgreens Boots CEO expects to do more deals in U.S.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Stefano Pessina, the billionaire investor who engineered the deal that created pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA.O), said he could imagine doing more deals in the United States as the healthcare system is shaken up by Obamacare. “The next big one will probably be in the U.S. because it is such a big market. It is a fascinating market,” Pessina, acting chief executive of Walgreens Boots, told the Retail Week Live conference. “It is similar to what we had in Europe 20 years ago because the intervention of the government changes all the rules.” The Democratic-backed Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, aims to help millions of Americans without health insurance obtain coverage. There has been speculation that Walgreens’ smaller rival Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), which is acquiring full service benefit management company Envision Pharmaceutical for $2 billion, could itself be an attractive acquisition target, with Walgreens having expressed interest in buying it in the past. Walgreens last year bought the 55 percent it did not already own of Alliance Boots in a cash and share deal worth about $15 billion to create a chain with more than 11,000 stores in 10 countries. Pessina, along with private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR), took Alliance Boots private in 2007 and he then gained a large stake in Walgreens following its acquisition of 45 percent of Alliance Boots in 2012. Walgreens’ full takeover of Alliance Boots attracted attention after it pulled a plan to move its domicile overseas, following fierce criticism of such tax-cutting deals at home. An Italian national who resides in Monaco, Pessina said on Thursday that Boots’ commitment to the British high street was undimmed despite the Walgreens deal. “My passion, my dedication to this country are completely unchanged,” he said. “Boots is part of the British establishment and will continue to be part of the British establishment.” A small group of demonstrators dressed as doctors protested outside Thursday’s conference venue accusing Boots of failing to pay its fair share of British taxes.  Alliance Boots has said it conducts its business and organizes its tax affairs strictly in compliance with all applicable law and observes the highest standard of good ethics. Pessina said he was convinced the pharmacy and beauty store business would survive the boom in ecommerce. “People will come to the pharmacy because they want the advice,” he said.

8,WBA,UPDATE 2-GNC Holdings settles herbal supplements dispute with NY Attorney General,"* GNC starts selling herbal supplements in New York * NY AG test also confirms GNC’s products meet FDA guidelines * GNC agrees to tests that exceed FDA requirements * Probe into Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Target products ongoing * GNC shares up as much as 8 pct   (Adds Walgreens response in paragraph 13, updates share price) March 30 (Reuters) - GNC Holdings Inc said it restored certain herbal supplements to its stores in New York after reaching an agreement with the state’s attorney general that its products complied with the Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines. GNC also agreed to adopt testing standards for herbal supplements that exceed FDA requirements, a first in the United States, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The end of a dispute that started on Feb. 2 sent the company’s shares up as much as 8 percent to a 52-week high of $49.65 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The company did not have to pay any monetary damages, just implement reforms, Elizabeth DeBold, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s office said. GNC was one of four retailers that halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by Schneiderman as DNA tests failed to detect plant materials that the companies claimed were a part of their supplements. Both internal and independent third-party tests had proved that GNC’s “products are safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements”, the company said in a statement on Monday. GNC had said earlier that tests showed its products contained all herbal extracts listed on labels, and on Monday the company said it had restarted selling its Herbal Plus products. A study commissioned by the Attorney General to determine the presence or absence of the DNA of certain plants in some herbal supplements also found GNC’s products were within prescribed FDA guidelines, Schneiderman’s statement said. GNC will start DNA barcoding within 18 months to confirm the authenticity of all plants used as sources for its herbal supplements prior to processing, Schneiderman said. The company would test for allergen contamination pre and post production and had also agreed to prominently disclose in its stores and on its website if a supplement product was derived from whole herbs or extracts, Schneiderman said. Herbal Plus is part of GNC’s vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements business, which accounts for almost 40 percent of its U.S. retail revenue. The investigation into the supplements sold by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp was ongoing, DeBold said. Walgreens was reviewing the matter and intends to continue cooperating with the Attorney General’s office, spokesperson James Graham said. Wal-Mart and Target were not available for comment.

9,WBA,Walgreens profit beats expectations; more cost cuts planned,"(Reuters) - Drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) on Thursday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would widen its cost-cutting program, sending its shares higher. The company, formed by the December acquisition of Europe’s Alliance Boots by Walgreen Co, said it would reorganize corporate and field operations, streamline information technology functions and close 200 U.S. stores while opening 200 others. “This really is just getting the right stores in the right place,” Executive Vice President Alex Gourlay said on a conference call. In August, Walgreen Co announced a $1 billion cost-cutting program over three years. Walgreens said on Thursday that it had identified ways to increase the program to a projected $1.5 billion by the August year-end of fiscal 2017. The company said it would take pretax restructuring charges of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion over time. Shares of the largest U.S. drugstore chain operator, which is reporting its first results since the merger, were up 2.8 percent at $90.17. Walgreens said combined net savings for the first half of fiscal 2015 were $310 million and that it was on track to reach at least $650 million for the full year and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2016. The company reported a 35.5 percent rise in net sales to $26.6 billion for the second quarter ended Feb. 28, mainly due to the addition of Boots. Analysts on average had expected sales of $27.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at U.S. Walgreens and Duane Reade stores open at least a year rose 6.9 percent, benefiting from a strong cough, cold and flu season and continued growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions. The U.S. drugstore business generated about 79 percent, or $21 billion, of total sales. Pharmacy sales accounted for 64.4 percent of U.S. sales. Comparable-store sales in the international retail pharmacy division rose 2.9 percent in January and February. Net income attributable to Walgreens Boots was $2.04 billion, or $1.93 per share. Walgreen alone earned $716 million, or 74 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Walgreens Boots earned $1.18 per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of 95 cents. The company forecast full-year earnings of $3.45 to $3.65 per share, excluding items. Analysts were expecting $3.61.

13,WBA,Rite Aid shareholders vote to limit CEO's golden parachute,"June 25 (Reuters) - Drugstore operator Rite Aid Corp’s  shareholders on Thursday voted to change the terms of payment for its chief executive’s golden parachute, supporting a union-backed investor group over the company’s board. Rite Aid CEO John Standley stands to receive $42 million if he loses his job in the event of the company being taken over, including $31.6 million through the accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards. CtW Investment Group, which has a nominal stake in Rite Aid and advises funds holding a 0.18 percent stake, had proposed to limit the accelerated vesting, saying the amount should instead be paid on a pro-rata basis, based on the CEO’s performance until a takeover. CtW Investment said it sought to rein in the value of accelerated equity as such payments should not be based on what an executive might have earned if he or she had not only kept the position after a takeover but also met performance targets. According to preliminary results, 58 percent of Rite Aid shareholders voted in favor of the proposal, according to a statement from CtW Investment, which is affiliated with Change to Win, a federation of unions. Rite Aid was not immediately available for comment. There has been speculation that Rite Aid could be an acquisition target. Pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  have expressed interest in buying the company in the past. While proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS supported CtW Investment’s proposal, Rite Aid had argued that such a move would potentially undermine its compensation program and ability to retain executives. CtW Investment has asked that if Rite Aid changes its policy, the move should be applicable to both current and future CEO contracts. CtW Investment owned 865 Rite Aid shares, according to a May 15 regulatory filing, and says it works with pension funds that are associated with Change to Win and manage $250 billion in assets. Rite Aid’s shares were off 0.5 percent at $8.64 in afternoon trading.

14,WBA,Walgreen settles Medicaid false billing case in New York,"(Reuters) - Walgreen Co will pay $2.55 million to settle charges by New York’s attorney general that a pharmacy unit improperly billed Medicaid for costly drugs to treat hemophilia patients, without proof that it actually delivered the drugs to those patients. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Monday said his audit of Medicaid billings by Trinity HomeCare LLC found improper conduct and false billings from 2007 to Sept. 2011. He said these related to eight patients in New York City and one on Long Island, and included one instance where drugs were simply left for a patient in the hallway of an apartment building.

18,WBA,Walgreen to pay $22.4 million in N.Y. Medicaid improper billing case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walgreen Co has reached a $22.4 million settlement with the New York attorney general resolving claims that a unit improperly billed the government for reimbursement for a pediatric drug. The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, resolves claims first asserted in 2009 by a whistleblower in a lawsuit against Trinity Homecare LLC, a pharmacy primarily owned by Walgreen. The settlement marked the second in less than two weeks by the New York attorney general and Walgreen over improper conduct and billings by Trinity, after an earlier $2.55 million accord on June 29. Walgreen agreed to the settlement to avoid delay and expense and did so without any admission of liability, said spokesman James Cohn. The latest settlement concerned an injectable respiratory drug called Synagis, a brand name drug sold by AstraZeneca Plc  that is intended for at-risk premature infants. According to the whistleblower lawsuit filed by a hospital physician, Susan Vierczhalek, Trinity promoted the off-label use of the drug and caused false claims to be submitted to the government. In a statement, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the pharmacy “did not always have a prescription for that drug, but billed Medicaid for it anyway.” “Of greater concern than the improper billing, is the possibility that infants could have received injections which were not properly prescribed to them,” he said. The federal government will receive some of the settlement, while New York will receive $12.23 million, Schneiderman’s office said. New York in turn will pay Vierczhalek $4 million as her share of the settlement, according to court papers. Barbara Hart, Vierczhalek’s lawyer, called the settlement “a great fraud recovery for Medicaid and gratifying in all respects.” Representatives for Walgreen did not respond to requests for comment.

Medicaid improper billing case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walgreen Co has reached a $22.4 million settlement with the New York attorney general resolving claims that a unit improperly billed the government for reimbursement for a pediatric drug. The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, resolves claims first asserted in 2009 by a whistleblower in a lawsuit against Trinity Homecare LLC, a pharmacy primarily owned by Walgreen. The settlement marked the second in less than two weeks by the New York attorney general and Walgreen over improper conduct and billings by Trinity, after an earlier $2.55 million accord on June 29. Walgreen agreed to the settlement to avoid delay and expense and did so without any admission of liability, said spokesman James Cohn.  The latest settlement concerned an injectable respiratory drug called Synagis, a brand name drug sold by AstraZeneca Plc that is intended for at-risk premature infants. According to the whistleblower lawsuit filed by a hospital physician, Susan Vierczhalek, Trinity promoted the off-label use of the drug and caused false claims to be submitted to the government. In a statement, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the pharmacy “did not always have a prescription for that drug, but billed Medicaid for it anyway.” “Of greater concern than the improper billing, is the possibility that infants could have received injections which were not properly prescribed to them,” he said. The federal government will receive some of the settlement, while New York will receive $12.23 million, Schneiderman’s office said. New York in turn will pay Vierczhalek $4 million as her share of the settlement, according to court papers. Barbara Hart, Vierczhalek’s lawyer, called the settlement “a great fraud recovery for Medicaid and gratifying in all respects.” Representatives for Walgreen did not respond to requests for comment. Walgreen is part of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, and this year sold a majority stake in Trinity’s parent Walgreens Infusion Services to private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners.

Attorney General Chris Koster on Tuesday filed papers in a Kansas City, Missouri state court seeking civil fines of up to $5,000 per tag against the Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  unit, and additional penalties if the tags are not removed. Koster said inspectors from his consumer protection unit found 1,306 expired tags at 49 of the 50 Walgreens stores they visited in Missouri from July 26 to Sept. 1, including two tags that expired in 2013. He said this violated a June 2014 agreement and permanent injunction under which the largest U.S. drugstore chain, which is based in Deerfield, Illinois, agreed to remove stale tags within 12 hours of their expiration. That agreement also called for periodic, independent audits of Walgreen stores. “Consumers should not have to dig through outdated and incorrect information to find out the true price of any item,” Koster said in a statement.

27,WBA,Walgreens says will buy smaller drugstore rival Rite-Aid,"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said on Tuesday it would acquire smaller peer Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $9.4 billion to widen its footprint in the United States and negotiate for lower drug costs. The $9-a-share cash deal, worth $17.2 billion including acquired debt, will increase the footprint of Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, by half. It will also improve its ability to negotiate for low drug prices and fend off rivals from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to online pharmacies. The price represents a 48 percent premium to where Rite-Aid shares closed on Monday, the day before the agreement was signed, the companies said in a joint release. A Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would need approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which studies retail mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law. Shares of Rite Aid, which had a market value of $6.36 billion at Monday’s close, rose as much as 44 percent on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks. Walgreens stock rose as much as 7 percent. Walgreens said it expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2016 and to boost its earnings per share in the first full year after its completion. Moreover, it sees cost savings of more than $1 billion from buying Rite-Aid, which will initially operate under its existing brand name.  The healthcare sector has been consolidating in recent years as providers look to beef up and bargain for lower prices from drugmakers.  In part, that is because President Barack Obama’s national healthcare reform law seeks to limit spending by cutting payments in government insurance programs. Large companies that provide health benefits have also tightened their spending. Hospitals, drug distributors, health insurers and companies that manage pharmacy benefits all say that they need to be bigger to compete in this new landscape.  Analysts said the deal would increase Walgreens’ presence in the Pacific Northwest and make it better able to take on CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the nation’s largest drug chain in terms of sales. CVS, whose shares rose 1.8 percent on Tuesday, in August closed its $10.1 billion acquisition of pharmacy services provider Omnicare, which will expand its presence in the senior care market.  Antitrust lawyer David Balto, a former FTC official, earlier on Tuesday said the Walgreens-Rite-Aid deal would receive careful scrutiny by U.S. regulators and then probably be approved. “Drugstore services have evolved substantially in the past several years,” he said, “and the market is becoming robustly competitive, with substantial competition from supermarkets and mass merchants.”  Others said that given an extended FTC review of office supplies retailer Staples Inc’s SPLS.O planned takeover of Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would also be closely scrutinized. Walgreens has 13,200 stores, some 60 percent of which are in the United States, and generated $76.4 billion in sales in the year ended on Aug. 31, 2014. Rite Aid, with 4,570 U.S. stores, has annual sales of about $27 billion.  CVS had sales of $139.4 billion last year. But it has 7,870 stores, fewer than Walgreens.  While Walgreens focuses more on its retail drugstore business, CVS, through its 2007 acquisition of CareMark, is also the second largest pharmacy-benefit manager in the U.S.     Pharmacy benefit managers are paid by health plans to  ensure drugstores only dispense medicines on the plan’s list of pre-authorized drugs — a middleman role designed to keep drug costs down. “This would be a merger that’s really about increasing scale” and getting cost savings, said Tigress Financial Partners Research Director Philip Van Deusen. Increased scale would help the combined company better withstand pricing pressure from major retailers, including  Internet players like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) that sell many of the same products, Deusen said.

30,WBA,Wall St. slips on rate uncertainty; Apple up after the bell,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Tuesday on uncertainty over the U.S. rate outlook and disappointing results from Ford and other companies. Upbeat results from Apple (AAPL.O) after hours, however, could give the market a boost on Wednesday.  Shares of Apple, the biggest company by market capitalization, rose 2.8 percent to $116.89 after it reported higher-than-expected earnings and revenue. Apple’s stock ended the regular session down 0.6 percent at $114.55. Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures NQc1 also edged up after Apple’s results. “Both earnings and revenues were above expectations, which I think was well embraced based on the fact that a lot of companies have been struggling on the top line,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Apple shares. Also after the bell, shares of Twitter (TWTR.N) dropped 11 percent to $27.89 after it reported results. Twitter’s stock ended the regular session up 1.5 percent at $31.34. During the regular session, Ford (F.N) dropped 5 percent to $14.89 after quarterly results missed expectations, while JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) fell 3.2 percent to $25.36 after it said it will make less money per mile in October than it did a year ago. Shares of other airlines also fell, and the Dow Jones transportation average .DJT dropped 2.6 percent. The Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. While expectations for a rate hike this week are slim, investors are looking for clues in its policy statement on Wednesday as to when the Fed will begin to raise interest rates. “That’s going to be parsed every way possible,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Casting more doubts on whether the Fed will raise rates this year, data showed U.S. non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped last month after a downwardly revised decline in August. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 41.62 points, or 0.24 percent, to 17,581.43, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 5.29 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,065.89 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 4.56 points, or 0.09 percent, to 5,030.15. Alibaba (BABA.N) rose 4 percent to $79.44 after the e-commerce giant reported better-than-expected revenue.  Declines in crude oil weighed further on energy shares, and the S&P; energy index .SPNY, down 1.2 percent, led sector declines for the S&P; 500. Healthcare was one of two S&P; 500 sectors to end in positive territory for the day. The index .SPXHC was up 1.7 percent after better-than-expected earnings from top drugmakers Pfizer (PFE.N) and Merck (MRK.N).  Rite Aid (RAD.N) shares jumped 42.6 percent to $8.67. Sources said Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) is nearing a deal to buy the company. NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 2,293 to 797, for a 2.88-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 2,003 issues fell and 820 advanced, for a 2.44-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

33,WBA,Senators call for scrutiny of Walgreens-Rite Aid deal,"(Reuters) - Two influential U.S. senators called for close scrutiny of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s (WBA.O) plan to buy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $9.4 billion, a deal that would unite two of the three biggest U.S. drugstore chains. Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said the company had analyzed the antitrust aspect of the deal but would not speculate on the number of drugstores it might need to divest in order to win regulatory approval. Walgreens ranks first and Rite Aid third by number of stores, either side of CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). The top two antitrust lawmakers in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday urged antitrust enforcers to give the plan careful scrutiny because of the importance of healthcare in the U.S. economy. “I have fought tirelessly to promote competition in the health sector and I believe the proposed merger of two of the three largest drug store chains in the country raises serious issues,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement. The subcommittee’s chair, Republican Senator Mike Lee, said he hoped antitrust agencies would “closely scrutinize” the deal. Several analysts and antitrust lawyers said the deal would probably pass regulatory muster provided some stores were divested, especially in the northeastern United States, where Walgreens and Rite Aid stores overlap by more than 25 percent. Walgreens shares closed down 10.7 percent on Wednesday. They had risen 7 percent on Tuesday after reports emerged that a deal was imminent. Rite Aid shares, which rose 40 percent on Tuesday, fell 7.0 percent to $8.06. “We have done significant analysis on how we can bring the two companies together, including the antitrust analysis,” Pessina said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. He said the deal made sense as the company was facing “tough challenges” in all its markets, either from competitors or from the government’s “relentless” drive to manage healthcare costs. Walgreens offered to buy Rite Aid to gain scale in the retail pharmacy industry and not to increase its negotiating power with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, he added. President Barack Obama’s national healthcare reform law, which seeks to limit spending by cutting payments in government insurance programs, has been a contributory factor to a recent spurt in consolidation across the healthcare industry. Healthcare deal-making hit a record of $392.4 billion in 2014 and has already surpassed that this year, reaching $447.5 billion as of Sept. 10, according to Thomson Reuters data. Walgreens, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Wednesday, said it expects to save more than $1 billion from the Rite Aid deal.

35,WBA,UPDATE 3-Senators call for scrutiny of Walgreens-Rite Aid deal,"* Senator says deal raises “serious issues” * Walgreens has done analysis of antitrust hurdles - CEO * Walgreens, Rite Aid have overlap in northeastern U.S. - analysts   (Adds senators’ comments, updates share prices) By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Diane Bartz Oct 28 (Reuters) - Two influential U.S. senators called for close scrutiny of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s plan to buy Rite Aid Corp for $9.4 billion, a deal that would unite two of the three biggest U.S. drugstore chains. Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said the company had analyzed the antitrust aspect of the deal but would not speculate on the number of drugstores it might need to divest in order to win regulatory approval. Walgreens ranks first and Rite Aid third by number of stores, either side of CVS Health Corp. The top two antitrust lawmakers in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday urged antitrust enforcers to give the plan careful scrutiny because of the importance of healthcare in the U.S. economy. “I have fought tirelessly to promote competition in the health sector and I believe the proposed merger of two of the three largest drug store chains in the country raises serious issues,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement. The subcommittee’s chair, Republican Senator Mike Lee, said he hoped antitrust agencies would “closely scrutinize” the deal. Several analysts and antitrust lawyers said the deal would probably pass regulatory muster provided some stores were divested, especially in the northeastern United States, where Walgreens and Rite Aid stores overlap by more than 25 percent. Walgreens shares closed down 10.7 percent on Wednesday. They had risen 7 percent on Tuesday after reports emerged that a deal was imminent. Rite Aid shares, which rose 40 percent on Tuesday, fell 7.0 percent to $8.06. “We have done significant analysis on how we can bring the two companies together, including the antitrust analysis,” Pessina said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. He said the deal made sense as the company was facing “tough challenges” in all its markets, either from competitors or from the government’s “relentless” drive to manage healthcare costs. Walgreens offered to buy Rite Aid to gain scale in the retail pharmacy industry and not to increase its negotiating power with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, he added. President Barack Obama’s national healthcare reform law, which seeks to limit spending by cutting payments in government insurance programs, has been a contributory factor to a recent spurt in consolidation across the healthcare industry. Healthcare deal-making hit a record of $392.4 billion in 2014 and has already surpassed that this year, reaching $447.5 billion as of Sept. 10, according to Thomson Reuters data. Walgreens, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Wednesday, said it expects to save more than $1 billion from the Rite Aid deal. But the company said it would suspend share repurchases under its $3 billion program to fund the deal.

36,WBA,Walgreens says will buy smaller drugstore rival Rite-Aid,"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said on Tuesday it would acquire smaller peer Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $9.4 billion to widen its footprint in the United States and negotiate for lower drug costs. The $9-a-share cash deal, worth $17.2 billion including acquired debt, will increase the footprint of Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, by half. It will also improve its ability to negotiate for low drug prices and fend off rivals from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to online pharmacies. The price represents a 48 percent premium to where Rite-Aid shares closed on Monday, the day before the agreement was signed, the companies said in a joint release. A Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would need approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which studies retail mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law. Shares of Rite Aid, which had a market value of $6.36 billion at Monday’s close, rose as much as 44 percent on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks. Walgreens stock rose as much as 7 percent. Walgreens said it expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2016 and to boost its earnings per share in the first full year after its completion. Moreover, it sees cost savings of more than $1 billion from buying Rite-Aid, which will initially operate under its existing brand name.  The healthcare sector has been consolidating in recent years as providers look to beef up and bargain for lower prices from drugmakers.  In part, that is because President Barack Obama’s national healthcare reform law seeks to limit spending by cutting payments in government insurance programs. Large companies that provide health benefits have also tightened their spending. Hospitals, drug distributors, health insurers and companies that manage pharmacy benefits all say that they need to be bigger to compete in this new landscape.  Analysts said the deal would increase Walgreens’ presence in the Pacific Northwest and make it better able to take on CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the nation’s largest drug chain in terms of sales. CVS, whose shares rose 1.8 percent on Tuesday, in August closed its $10.1 billion acquisition of pharmacy services provider Omnicare, which will expand its presence in the senior care market.  Antitrust lawyer David Balto, a former FTC official, earlier on Tuesday said the Walgreens-Rite-Aid deal would receive careful scrutiny by U.S. regulators and then probably be approved. “Drugstore services have evolved substantially in the past several years,” he said, “and the market is becoming robustly competitive, with substantial competition from supermarkets and mass merchants.”  Others said that given an extended FTC review of office supplies retailer Staples Inc’s SPLS.O planned takeover of Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would also be closely scrutinized. Many analysts expect some divestitures to be required in states where the combined company would have a particularly strong position, including parts of the northeast. In New York, for instance, the two have more than 25 percent of the market by store count, Cowen analysts said.  Walgreens has 13,200 stores, some 60 percent of which are in the United States, and generated $76.4 billion in sales in the year ended on Aug. 31, 2014. Rite Aid, with 4,570 U.S. stores, has annual sales of about $27 billion.  CVS had sales of $139.4 billion last year. But it has 7,870 stores, fewer than Walgreens.  While Walgreens focuses more on its retail drugstore business, CVS, through its 2007 acquisition of CareMark, is also the second largest pharmacy-benefit manager in the U.S.     Pharmacy benefit managers are paid by health plans to  ensure drugstores only dispense medicines on the plan’s list of  pre-authorized drugs - a middleman role designed to keep drug  costs down. “This would be a merger that’s really about increasing scale” and getting cost savings, said Tigress Financial Partners Research Director Philip Van Deusen. Increased scale would help the combined company better withstand pricing pressure from major retailers, including  Internet players like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) that sell many of the same products, Deusen said.

(on.wsj.com/1TTCXU9) Walgreen had suspended laboratory services by Theranos on Jan. 28 after the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said that Theranos’ deficient practices at its Newark lab posed “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety”. Theranos has been in the spotlight after reports in the Wall Street Journal suggested that its blood-testing devices were flawed and had problems with accuracy. The 40 Theranos “wellness centers” at Walgreens stores in Arizona are the primary source of revenue for the blood-testing company and its conduit to consumers, the newspaper said. Theranos and Walgreens were unavailable for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

55,WBA,"UPDATE 2-Valeant sets earnings date, shares jump on hope for positive news","(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N), the subject of intense scrutiny over its business practices and pricing policies, said it would release preliminary quarterly results and guidance on March 15, raising hopes the company will serve up some positive news after months of uncertainty. Valeant’s stock - which had plunged 24 percent since the company said last week that it would delay its results, withdrew 2016 guidance and was the target of an SEC probe - rose as much as 8.5 percent in morning trading on Monday. The stock has shed about 77 percent of its value since August, when it hit a record high of $263.81. The Laval, Quebec-based company had originally been scheduled to release its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 29. “This stock has been so volatile ... it is possible the company’s announcement it will report Q4 earnings and update guidance on the 15th has some investors more optimistic that some recent fears about accounting restatements and withdrawn guidance won’t be as bad as perceived,” Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said in an email to Reuters. Reuters reported on Tuesday that a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was focused on the drugmaker’s relationship with Philidor RX Services, a specialty drug distributor that came under fire for its aggressive tactics to increase insurer reimbursements.   Valeant has since cut ties with Philador and reached a deal to distribute its drugs through Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O). The company said the delay in releasing the results was related to the return of Chief Executive Michael Pearson two months after he was hospitalized for pneumonia. “Now that I have returned, I have been working diligently to review the business so that I can share our latest performance and outlook with shareholders,” Pearson said in a statement on Monday. Valeant said it would hold a conference call after releasing its results. The company said this month it would restate results for 2014 and 2015 after identifying some sales to Philidor that should have been recognized when products were dispensed to patients, not when they were delivered to the distributor. Valeant’s Toronto-listed shares were up 8 percent at C$88.15 at midday, while its U.S.-listed shares trading at $66.43.

59,WBA,"Walgreens, Duane Reade settle NY overcharge probe","(Reuters) - Walgreen Co agreed to reform its advertising practices and pay $500,000 to settle allegations its Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in New York overcharged consumers at the register and used price tags that fooled them into thinking they were getting great deals. The settlement with the largest U.S. drugstore chain, a unit of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, was announced on Thursday by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. It ends a two-year probe into pricing practices at the 251 Walgreens and 214 Duane Reade stores in New York. Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Illinois, did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Schneiderman said the stores often charged consumers higher prices at the register than shown in print ads or on shelf tags, including tags featuring prices that had expired. He also said stores touted some items as a “smart buy” or “great buy” while selling them at retail prices, and promoted other items as “last chance” or “clearance” despite keeping them on shelves as long as 10 months. Walgreen was also faulted for using the words “like paying” and “like buying” to suggest that consumers were getting immediate discounts, when they were actually getting discounts  that could be used only on future purchases. Thursday’s accord requires Walgreen to remove stale shelf tags within 36 hours; restricts the use of “smart buy,” “great buy,” “like paying” and “like buying”; and ends the use of “last chance” or “clearance” tags to promote items that are neither. It also requires external audits of stores, and fines when stores fail two in a row. Employees will also get more training. Walgreen spokesman Phil Caruso said the company has already made many of the required changes. Last September, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster also accused Walgreen of failing to remove expired price tags.

65,WBA,Walgreens makes overdose remedy prescription-free in New Mexico,"(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is making the opioid antidote naloxone available without a prescription in all its pharmacies in New Mexico, part of a plan to make the drug readily available in 35 states by the end of this year. Naloxone, administered by injection or nasal spray, can be used in the event of an overdose to reverse the effects of heroin and other opioid drugs. The Obama administration has been funding expanded distribution of naloxone amid a growing epidemic of addiction to opioid drugs in the United States.      The drugstore chain has already made naloxone available without a prescription in Alabama, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. In 2014, a record number of Americans died from drug overdoses. New Mexico had one of the highest rates of overdose deaths, along with West Virginia, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio. In March, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez signed a bill into law that expands access to naloxone, allowing it to be available in more than 70 Walgreens pharmacies throughout the state. The law also protects those who administer naloxone from civil liability and criminal prosecution.  “Walgreens’ expansion of medications access in northern New Mexico and throughout the state will make it easier for families to help their loved ones suffering from addiction,” said Richard Martinez, a Democratic member of the state Senate. Approximately 78 people die in the United States every day due to drug overdose, with half of those deaths related to prescription opioid pain medications, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  “We want to make sure that we work together with all the states in accordance with each state’s pharmacy regulations and make this life saving drug available to all,” a representative of Walgreens said.  Naloxone manufacturers include Pfizer Inc’s Hospira unit and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc.

70,WBA,"UPDATE 6-Valeant CEO cuts outlook for 'distracted' company, shares plunge","Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) slashed its 2016 forecasts on Tuesday, as its new chief executive said he would focus on rebuilding the reputation of a “distracted organization” with a debt-loaded balance sheet. The maker of toenail fungus cream Jublia and anti-depressant drug Wellbutrin, which has faced intense scrutiny for business and accounting practices, missed first-quarter profit estimates on weakness in its dermatology business. The Laval, Quebec-based drugmaker expects full-year adjusted earnings of $6.60-$7.00 per share, compared with its previous forecast of $8.50-$9.50, and revenue of $9.9 billion-$10.1 billion, down from $11.0 billion-$11.2 billion. The Canadian drugmaker’s U.S.-listed shares (VRX.N) slumped to close down 14.6 percent to $24.64, paring earlier losses of as much as 22 percent. “Negative external attention continues to adversely impact the business and our reputation with patients, physicians and all of you, our shareholders, as well as our distracted organization,” Chief Executive Joe Papa, who took over in May, said during a conference call with analysts. He did not directly answer a question on whether there had been takeover offers for Valeant. Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc, one of Valeant’s biggest shareholders, cut its stake by more than half to 4.7 percent as of May 31, it said in a regulatory filing. The investment firm that runs the Sequoia Fund, long known for its ties to Warren Buffett, was sued by shareholders who claim it recklessly took a huge stake in Valeant. Papa said the results reflected “significant disruption” over the past nine months. It will take up to six months to stabilize the company, he said, including staff recruitment, improving relationships with doctors and drug payers, selling assets and repaying debt. Papa did not specify which assets would be put up for sale, but said they do not include core businesses of dermatology, consumer products, Bausch + Lomb eyecare and Salix gastrointestinal drugs. The company has repaid $730 million of its roughly $30 billion in debt this year, and is aiming for total repayment of $1.7 billion. Valeant racked up much of the debt through its aggressive pace of acquisitions under former CEO Mike Pearson. Papa called Valeant’s problems “speed bumps,” but doubts remain for others. Valeant has $15 billion in debt due by 2020, and “if the business stays the way it is, or continues to deteriorate, we believe Valeant will be challenged in making those debt payments,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst David Maris. During the analysts’ call, he questioned executives about a lack of transparency in how the company offered guidance. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had fallen nearly 90 percent from its August 2015 high of $263.81. Valeant filed its 2015 financial report in late April, after missing an original deadline of March 15 due to an in-house review of its accounting practices, allaying concerns about a possible default on its debt. The probe found problems dating back to 2014. The company, which will hold its 2016 annual meeting of shareholders on June 14, filed its quarterly report on Tuesday with the U.S. regulators, ahead of a July 31 deadline.  Papa said there are still challenges, including with U.S. dermatology sales, which are reliant on a pact with pharmacy Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O). Dermatology sales dropped 43 percent during the first quarter compared with the same period in the previous year. Valeant’s net loss was $373.7 million, or $1.08 per share in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $97.7 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Valeant earned $1.27 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.37, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 9.3 percent to $2.37 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $2.38 billion.

Despite higher demand, oil eased as traders booked profits after a three-day winning streak that started Monday and pushed prices to 2016 highs, and as the dollar moved higher. Financial stocks came under pressure again as global issues, including uncertainty over interest rate hikes and the impending vote on Britain’s membership in the European Union, sent investors flocking to safe haven assets. The yield on government bonds fell globally, while gold prices held near a three-week high. “The U.S. indexes are trailing what is happening overseas this morning. We’ve seen a decline in crude prices and strength in U.S. treasuries and that combination adds ups to a red day,” said Paul Springmeyer, investment management director at U.S. Bank Wealth Managing in Minneapolis. “There still remains quite a bit of uncertainty out there ... and returns will be fairly muted until those question marks are resolved” Springmeyer said. At 11:15 a.m. ET (1513 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 68.69 points, or 0.38 percent, at 17,916.5. The S&P; 500 was down 12.47 points, or 0.59 percent, at 2,103.01. The Nasdaq Composite was down 43.08 points, or 0.87 percent, at 4,915.53. Despite the losses since Thursday, the S&P; and Dow were still on track to close higher for the week, but the Nasdaq moved into the red. Eight of the 10 S&P; sectors were lower, led by a 1.1 percent drop in the financials index. The index is now down nearly 3 percent for the year, making it the worst performing index. The healthcare index  also moved into negative territory for the year. Goldman Sachs fell 1.5 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. There were a few rare bright spots in the market. Intel shares reversed course to trade up 0.2 percent after it won a contract to supply chips for some Apple  iPhones, Bloomberg said. Intel will replace Qualcomm , which was down 1.2 percent. Drugstore operator Walgreens rose 5 percent and its acquisition target Rite Aid was up 3.6 percent after the New York Post said there were signs the FTC would approve the deal. Walgreens gave the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,186 to 691. On the Nasdaq, 2,000 issues fell and 638. The S&P; 500 index showed 29 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 new highs and 32 new lows.

78,WBA,RPT-UPDATE 4-Walgreens U.S. retail sales rise less than expected,"(Repeats to widen distribution) * Q3 US retail sales up 0.1 pct vs. estimates of 0.7 pct * Co has been investing to revive U.S. retail business * Q3 total sales miss estimates, adjusted EPS beats * Raises lower end of FY adjusted profit forecast * Shares fall as much as 3.5 percent By Sruthi Ramakrishnan July 6 (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, the No.1 U.S. drugstore operator by store count, reported a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales, hurt by weak demand for over-the-counter drugs and other products. The company’s shares fell as much as 3.5 percent on Wednesday. Walgreens has been investing to revive U.S. retail sales, or front-end sales, mainly by sprucing up its beauty business, which is a big traffic driver. It is rolling out a revamped beauty division to more than 1,800 stores by end of 2016. However, comparable sales in the business were underwhelming in the latest third quarter, rising just 0.1 percent, after two quarters of declines. Analysts were expecting U.S. retail sales, which accounts for roughly a third of total U.S. sales, to increase 0.7 percent, according to Evercore ISI. The rest of Walgreens’ U.S. sales comes from its pharmacy business, where comparable sales rose 6 percent due to a jump in prescriptions filled for Medicare Part D drugs. Total net sales rose 2.4 percent to $29.5 billion, missing analysts average estimate of $29.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, Walgreens’ profit of $1.18 per share beat analysts average estimate of $1.14. Walgreens said its acquisition of Rite Aid Corp was on track to close later this year and that it was looking for buyers for the stores it needed to divest to get regulatory clearance. Rite Aid’s shares rose 2 percent. “While USA Retail is facing some pressure, we believe that the RAD deal will cause sentiment in USA Retail to shift positively once integration efforts begin,” Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen wrote in a note. Walgreens also said it was bracing for a long period of volatility following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union. The company’s revenue from UK, about 9 percent of sales last fiscal, could be a cause for concern, especially with the pound falling about 13 percent against the dollar since the vote on June 23. “The situation is very volatile at this time. For sure, the period of uncertainty will be quite long,” Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said.

79,WBA,Walgreens U.S. retail sales rise less than expected,"(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O), the No.1 U.S. drugstore operator by store count, reported a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales, hurt by weak demand for over-the-counter drugs and other products. The company’s shares fell as much as 3.5 percent on Wednesday. Walgreens has been investing to revive U.S. retail sales, or front-end sales, mainly by sprucing up its beauty business, which is a big traffic driver. It is rolling out a revamped beauty division to more than 1,800 stores by end of 2016. However, comparable sales in the business were underwhelming in the latest third quarter, rising just 0.1 percent, after two quarters of declines. Analysts were expecting U.S. retail sales, which accounts for roughly a third of total U.S. sales, to increase 0.7 percent, according to Evercore ISI. The rest of Walgreens’ U.S. sales comes from its pharmacy business, where comparable sales rose 6 percent due to a jump in prescriptions filled for Medicare Part D drugs. Total net sales rose 2.4 percent to $29.5 billion, missing analysts average estimate of $29.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, Walgreens’ profit of $1.18 per share beat analysts average estimate of $1.14. Walgreens said its acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) was on track to close later this year and that it was looking for buyers for the stores it needed to divest to get regulatory clearance. Rite Aid’s shares rose 2 percent. “While USA Retail is facing some pressure, we believe that the RAD deal will cause sentiment in USA Retail to shift positively once integration efforts begin,” Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen wrote in a note. Walgreens also said it was bracing for a long period of volatility following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union. The company’s revenue from UK, about 9 percent of sales last fiscal, could be a cause for concern, especially with the pound falling about 13 percent against the dollar since the vote on June 23. “The situation is very volatile at this time. For sure, the period of uncertainty will be quite long,” Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said.

92,WBA,"Fitch Rates Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. $1B Unsecured Term Loan 'BBB'","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.'s (WBA) $1 billion unsecured term loan. The loan  is structured in two $500 million tranches, with one maturing in March 2017 and  the other maturing one year following the date of the close of the Rite Aid  Corporation (Rite Aid) acquisition, pending regulatory approval. Proceeds will  be used to partly fund the company's acquisition of Rite Aid. Fitch rates WBA's  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.  A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. Of the total $17 billion purchase price for Rite Aid, Fitch estimates WBA will  fund the acquisition with $14.6 billion of debt, including the assumption of  $2.3 billion of Rite Aid's existing unsecured debt. As WBA has obtained $6  billion in term loans and $6 billion of unsecured notes, the company will need  to raise another $0.3 billion in financing. WBA has disclosed that this could  include bank financing, commercial paper and/or private debt placement.  The 'BBB' rating incorporates WBA's leading position and increasing market share  in the growing drugstore category. WBA's ample free cash flow (FCF) provides it  the financial flexibility to invest strategically in its business and new  opportunities while managing its balance sheet. The debt-financed Rite Aid  acquisition offers WBA the ability to strengthen its competitive position and  generate significant procurement and cost synergies.  While incremental debt is expected to yield elevated leverage at 4.2x on a pro  forma basis, Fitch expects WBA to return adjusted leverage to its historical  low-3.0x levels by fiscal 2019 (August). Concerns include ongoing pressure on  U.S. pharmacy reimbursement rates, WBA's under-penetration in the U.S. specialty  pharmacy business, and integration risks with Rite Aid. KEY RATING DRIVERS Since Walgreen Co. (WAG) completed its merger with Alliance Boots to form WBA on  Dec. 31, 2014, the combined entity has developed a holistic strategy to grow its  presence in the U.S. healthcare market. The company has undertaken a number of  strategic priorities to drive the business, including the following: --AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) Long-Term Relationship: In March 2013, WAG and  wholesaler ABC announced a 10-year agreement (extension of three years announced  on May 5, 2016) to source all drugs through a newly formed strategic partnership  which would enable sharing of synergies by layering ABC's generic volume into  WBA. Previously, WAG sourced branded pharmaceuticals through Cardinal Health  Inc., specialty pharmaceuticals through ABC and generics directly from  manufacturers.  Management also believed an economic interest in ABC was important and  structured warrants and an open-market purchase program. As of August 2016, WBA  owns 24% of ABC at a cost of approximately $3.1 billion after exercising its  final warrants for $1.2 billion (announced August 25, 2016).  --Rite Aid Purchase: In October 2015, WBA announced the proposed purchase of  Rite Aid, designed to add to the company's national retail coverage and  purchasing scale. Rite Aid - which has approximately 6% share of the U.S.  prescription market - has strong presence in key markets where Walgreens has  lower market share such as California and the Northeast. The company is also  targeting $1 billion in cost synergies, including leveraging scale in sourcing  and eliminating duplicative corporate expenses. Fitch has modelled synergies  approaching $750 million by fiscal 2019. The transaction is expected to close in  the second half of calendar 2016.  --Cost Structure Opportunities: The company has identified $1.5 billion in cost  reduction opportunities primarily in the Walgreens U.S. business (up from $1  billion initially identified in June 2012 at the announcement of the  WAG/Alliance Boots partnership) and plans to complete the program by the end of  fiscal 2017. Key areas of focus have included retail footprint optimization,  headquarters rationalization and store operations efficiencies. In terms of the front-end, which represents around 30% of enterprise sales  volume (three-quarters via Walgreens stores in the U.S.), WBA has a multifaceted  strategy. First, new management sees an opportunity to improve basic operations  such as inventory management and shrink reduction. Second, management believes  Walgreens has historically been overly focused on promotions, with many loss  leaders driving down margins. WBA has been reducing promotions and relying more  on strong operations and its Balance Rewards loyalty program to drive sales.  Third, WBA plans to revitalize its beauty offering in the U.S., using elements  of the successful Boots model including owned brands such as No 7, Soap & Glory  and Botanics. Fitch views as positive efforts to drive installed loyalty  programs as a means to improve customer stickiness.  RATING STRENGTHS Category Growth and Competitive Resilience WBA benefits from share gains in its U.S. pharmacy business (approximately 50%  of total company sales), with the industry expected to grow 1%-2% annually each  in volume and pricing. The industry has benefitted from an aging U.S.  population, enrollment increases due to the Affordable Care Act, and  prescription price increases, particularly for specialty pharmaceuticals.  Unlike many other retail categories, Fitch views pharmacies as having limited  competition from new formats given fixed-price contracts and pharmacist supply  constraints. Mail-order, which emerged as a major threat to retailers over the  past several decades, appears to have peaked, particularly given '90-day at  retail' offers across the industry as well as a number of branded drugs shifting  to over-the-counter. There has been significant pharmacy reimbursement pressure due to shifts to  managed care from cash over the 1990s through mid-2000s and growth in  Medicaid/Medicare over the last few years, and this pressure is expected to  continue over the next few years as payers strive to contain healthcare costs.  Economics of scale are critical to negotiate better pricing on pharmaceutical  purchases to help offset some of the reimbursement pressure. As a result, Fitch  expects WBA will continue to drive U.S. share gains with volume growth in the  2%-3% range while overall industry grows at 1%-2%.  Front-end sales have grown in the low-single digits in recent years, and have  shown resilience to competition from channels including discounters and online.  Fitch believes that WBA's low front-end ticket (less than $10 in most cases),  convenience model, and purchase immediacy have allowed it to effectively compete  against new entrants. Fitch expects WBA's front-end comparable store sales  (comps) to be slightly positive over the next three years. Market Share Gains Expected to Continue With 20% prescription market share, WBA is the second largest player in the U.S.  and has driven market share through execution and scale benefits. As a leading  market player with strong loyalty from a sticky customer base, WBA is a  preferred retail partner and can compete effectively for inclusion in pharmacy  networks with acceptable financial terms. WBA's size also permits cost-effective  pharmaceuticals buying, enhanced by its partnership with wholesaler ABC to  leverage the combined buying scale. As a result of WBA's scale and execution, the company has built a long track  record of growth, including U.S. comparable prescription volume growth of 1.8%  and 3.5% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, respectively. This growth reflects  market share gains due to the structural challenges facing the retail pharmacy  space. Industry challenges such as increased concentration of payers (including  the government), mail-order, and narrow networks, have not negatively impacted  Walgreens' volume growth and in Fitch's view, have likely helped it gain share  against smaller operators and independents. However, these challenges have  dampened gross margins and Fitch expects WBA's U.S pharmacy gross margins to  decline 30-40 basis points (bps) annually. Despite overall market strength, WBA is underpenetrated in specialty  pharmaceuticals relative to the market and competitors such as CVS Caremark  (CVS), which has made targeted investments into the specialty category and  benefits from its purchase of pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and mail-order  operator Caremark in 2006. CVS currently has approximately 25% share of the U.S.  specialty market, which Fitch estimates at more than twice that of Walgreens. As  specialty pharmaceutical growth will dominate overall spending growth over the  rating horizon, WBA is somewhat structurally disadvantaged. The company's  recently announced strategic alliance to combine its specialty pharmacy business  with Prime Therapeutics LLC could improve its growth profile while benefitting  from scale efficiencies. Fitch anticipates WBA can grow its U.S. pharmaceuticals  sales in the 4% range annually, by taking share in non-specialty categories  while maintaining or losing modest share in the specialty category. Fitch expects WBA's international business, approximately 30% of total company  sales, to grow in the low-single-digits annually over the forecast horizon,  driven by 1%-2% comps in international retail and modest growth in the  international wholesale business. International gross margins are expected to be  flattish in the low-20% range, as the dynamics pressuring gross margins in the  U.S. are less prevalent abroad. Rite Aid EBITDA Opportunity Fitch views the proposed purchase of Rite Aid, which reported sales of $31  billion and EBITDA of $1.4 billion in 2015, positively due primarily to the  procurement and cost structure opportunities gained by exploiting the combined  entity's scale. The company's $1 billion cost synergy target is predicated  largely on improved sourcing, in addition to reducing duplicative costs in the  combined entity. Based on visibility into these synergy opportunities, Fitch  believes at least $750 million of synergy savings are possible by fiscal 2019,  though mitigated by around $400 million EBITDA reduction, assuming the FTC  mandates approximately 1,000 store closures due to local market share concerns. Rite Aid would improve WBA's national retail coverage, particularly in Southern  California and Northeastern U.S. markets, positioning it well to compete for  inclusion in narrow and preferred pharmacy networks. At the end of fiscal 2015,  76% of U.S. households operated within a five-mile radius of a Walgreens or  Duane Reade (also owned by WBA) and Fitch anticipates the coverage is likely to  rise to the mid-to-high 80% range at the close of the acquisition. Beyond the synergy benefits, WBA may also benefit from store consolidations over  the next few years, where a Rite Aid or Walgreens store is closed and the  prescription file is transferred to another nearby location. The drugstore  industry has historically driven EBITDA improvements through these  consolidations. Additionally, Rite Aid historically has produced lower per-store  sales productivity than its larger peers given significant lack of investments,  and WBA plans to improve comps through its operating expertise. Fitch has not  incorporated upside from either of these opportunities into its forecast. Size and Scale Enables Financial Flexibility WBA's scale affords significant financial flexibility, allowing the company to  invest in its existing business and capitalize on new opportunities while  reducing leverage post the Rite Aid acquisition, which will add approximately  $14 billion of debt to WBA's existing $14 billion (as of May 31, 2016) yielding  pro forma leverage of approximately 4.2x, up from latest 12 months (LTM)  leverage of 3.2x.  Fitch believes the purchase of Rite Aid (assumed in Fitch's modelling to occur  in early fiscal 2017 if approved by the FTC) and accompanying synergies could  drive EBITDA to close to $12 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to a projected $9  billion expected in fiscal 2016 excluding Rite Aid and $10 billion on a pro  forma WBA/Rite Aid basis.  Fitch expects FCF to be $3.5 billion-$4 billion in fiscal 2016-2017 (after  dividends and one-time cash restructuring/merger expenses but prior to any  potential working capital improvements) but should increase to the $5 billion  range by fiscal 2018, and is expected to be used for debt paydown. Fitch  believes debt paydown could yield adjusted leverage in the mid-3x range at the  end of fiscal 2018 and below 3.5x within 36 months of closing the Rite Aid  acquisition, absent any large-scale acquisitions. Should the Rite Aid acquisition not be consummated, Fitch expects WBA to end  fiscal 2016 with leverage in the low-3.0x range. The company would likely use  FCF to resume share repurchases, absent any other acquisition opportunities.  RATING CONCERNS Gross Margin Pressure Fitch sees continued gross margin pressure on sales of pharmaceuticals in the  U.S. Structural margin pressure has been a consequence of increased penetration  of the government as pharmaceutical payer under the Medicare and Medicaid  programs, ongoing pressure from commercial payers, and a mix shift toward the  90-day at retail offering. This pressure has been somewhat mitigated by the  growth in generic penetration over the last few years, though this penetration  is expected to taper given a lighter calendar of branded expirations.  Projected margins may also be affected by the growth in preferred/narrow  networks, as WBA sacrifices margin for network inclusion to drive volume. Over  the forecast horizon, Fitch expects U.S. pharmacy gross margins to decline  30-40bps annually, while U.S front-end gross margins are expected to remain  relatively flat. Fitch has also assumed modest gross margin pressure in WBA's  international retail pharmacy and wholesale businesses.  Cash Flow Deployment Options/Lack of Financial Targets WBA has shown a willingness to use cash and leverage to grow its business.  Examples include its strategic investment in ABC and its announced merger with  Rite Aid. Management has expressed support of partnerships and the need to  reduce inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system. This mindset, coupled with  management's lack of publicly stated financial targets, yields some concern that  WBA will prioritize strategic growth over balance sheet management in the medium  term. Front-End Competition from Online Players WBA's enterprise front-end sales have been resilient to strengthened competition  from discounters and online channels. Fitch believes this is due to low average  ticket prices, WBA's convenience model and purchase immediacy. However, online  merchants (Amazon.com, Inc. in particular) continue to improve their business  models and speed of delivery, which could impact WBA's higher-margin front-end  sales in the future. New Management Yields Operational Changes WBA is making a number of changes in operations, including corporate  realignment/headcount reduction, streamlining of store-level operations, systems  overhauls, and front-end merchandising changes in categories like beauty. While  these changes could improve margins while boosting sales, they create operating  risk which could result in poor store execution and inventory mismanagement. Rite Aid Integration Risk Fitch assumes WBA can achieve $750 million of the planned $1 billion in  synergies by fiscal 2019. Fitch expects WBA will enact a number of changes to  Rite Aid operations, including store closures/consolidations, supply  chain/procurement changes, and merchandising updates. Any of these could cause  inventory interruptions and customer dissatisfaction, putting at risk both  synergy forecasts and Rite Aid's ongoing sales trajectory. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects 2.5%-3% sales growth at legacy WBA, driven by 4% U.S. pharmacy  and 0%-1% U.S. front-end comps and low-single-digit growth in the company's  international retail and wholesale businesses. Rite Aid pharmacy comps are  expected to be in the 2% range, with slightly positive front-end comps. As a  result, sales growth for the combined entity is projected to be around 2%-3%  after adjusting for an assumed 1,000 Rite Aid closures. --Combined gross margin is expected to remain in the 25% range, as 30-40bps of  annual U.S. pharmacy gross margin pressure is mitigated by Rite Aid synergies.  SG&A; growth should be modestly lower than sales growth due to fixed-cost  leverage and Rite Aid synergies. Total Rite Aid synergies are expected to be  $750 million by fiscal 2019. --EBITDA is expected to be $9 billion in fiscal 2016, improving to close to $11  billion in fiscal 2017 due to the Rite Aid acquisition and toward the $12  billion range in fiscal 2019 on core business growth and Rite Aid synergies.  Should the acquisition not close, Fitch would expect standalone WBA EBITDA to  increase toward $10 billion over the next 36 months. --FCF after dividends is projected to be $3.5 billion-$4.0 billion in fiscal  2016-2017, increasing to around $5 billion beginning fiscal 2018 on EBITDA  growth and substantial reduction of one-time integration charges. --FCF is expected to be used to reduce debt to the mid-3.0x range in fiscal 2018  and the low-3.0x range in fiscal 2019, at which point WBA could resume share  repurchases (in addition to those offsetting stock-option exercises). --If the Rite Aid acquisition does not close, FCF is projected to be in the $4  billion range beginning fiscal 2017, and could be used to resume WBA's share  repurchase program while maintaining leverage in the low-3.0x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES A negative rating action could occur given some combination of the following: --Persistently negative front-end comparable store sales or flattish  prescription volume growth, indicating market share erosion; --Unsuccessful execution yielding flattish or modestly declining EBITDA from pro  forma levels, driven by greater-than-expected gross margin declines on worsening  reimbursement rates or weak implementation of the Rite Aid integration or  merchandising/systems initiatives; --A debt-financed transaction or divergence of cash flow to unanticipated  strategic priorities, limiting debt paydown; --Diminished confidence in WBA's ability and willingness to reduce leverage  below 3.5x by fiscal 2019, absent an unforeseen debt-financed acquisition. Given WBA's lack of stated targets with respect to financial leverage, an  upgrade is unlikely due to the risk of a leveraging transaction. However, Fitch  would view positively a public commitment to sustain leverage below 3.0x. LIQUIDITY At May 31, 2016, the company had $6.1 billion in liquidity, consisting of $3.1  billion in cash (which excludes $174 million of deposits restricted under agency  agreements and by law and other obligations) and full availability on its $3  billion revolver. WBA had $13.5 billion of debt at May 31, 2016, composed of a GBP billion term  loan ($2.1 billion U.S. dollar equivalent) with the remainder in senior  unsecured notes. WBA is funding the acquisition with $14.6 billion of debt,  including the assumption of $2.3 billion of Rite Aid's existing unsecured debt. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates WBA as follows: Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB';  --Unsecured Revolver (as co-borrower) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loans 'BBB'; --Unsecured bonds 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. Walgreen Co. --Unsecured revolver (as co-borrower) 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loan (as co-borrower) 'BBB'; --Unsecured bonds 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

93,WBA,Walgreens expects to sell more stores than estimated for Rite Aid deal,"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said it would likely have to divest between 500 and 1000 stores, more than its previous estimate, to win regulatory approval for its planned acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N). Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore operator, had earlier estimated it would have to sell not more than 500 stores to win the approvals. The company operated 8,208 locations or 8,199 drugstores as of May 31. Rite Aid shares rose as much as 7 percent to touch $8.30, the stock’s highest level since the deal was announced in October. Walgreens shares were up about 2 percent at $84.46. Analysts viewed the divestiture as positive for the deal. Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said Thursday’s announcement brings “additional confidence that the transaction is on track to close”. Walgreens offered to buy smaller peer Rite Aid in a $9.4 billion deal that would increase its U.S. footprint and give it scope to negotiate for lower drug costs. Walgreens said it continues to expect the acquisition to close in the second half of this year and to realize synergies of over $1 billion within three to four years after that. The drugstore operator said it continues to expect the deal to add to its adjusted earnings in the first full year after closing, after taking into account costs related to the divestitures.

97,WBA,JPMorgan prepares to pull Chase ATMs from Walgreens stores,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A decade after JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said with great fanfare that it would make life easier for customers by putting its cash machines into Duane Reade drug stores in New York City and Walgreens stores in Florida, the big bank is retreating. Customers who use the ATMs marked with Chase’s blue octagon logo in those drug stores are beginning to be met with message: “Soon this machine will no longer be a Chase ATM.” The new message is the public start of a withdrawal that stems from an agreement the largest U.S. bank by assets made in April to sell 2,586 cash machines - primarily in Walgreens and Duane Reade drug stores, and other retailers - to ATM operator Cardtronics (CATM.O) for an undisclosed amount. The exact timing depends on how quickly the machines can be converted for use under the brand name of another financial institution.  The deal includes ATMs in Walgreens in nine states in total, including stores in Arizona and the Chicago area. Chase spokesman Mike Fusco said the bank is logging off of the ATMs because it will save money and because customers use these particular machines less. “It really came down to simplifying the business,” said Fusco. “Our customers are using those ATMs less frequently given that our ATM presence has expanded significantly over the last 11 years.” Even with the disconnection, Chase will own and operate more than 16,000 ATMs, Fusco said. That is more than twice as many as in 2005 when the bank turned to drug stores to quickly place cash dispensers. It also has ATMs at some airports, train stations and sports arenas. Fusco said Chase has ATMs within five minutes of the “vast majority” of discontinued machines because of expansions since it made the drug store deals. For example, in 2008, two years after turning to Walgreens for more Florida locations, JPMorgan picked up 260 branches in its financial crisis purchase of Washington Mutual. Chase ATMs in branches accept deposits while the store machines it is giving up only dispense cash and show account balances. Cardtronics is talking to other financial institutions about putting their brands on the machines and it expects to announce new arrangements “later this year,” Cardtronics spokesman Nick Pappathopoulos said in an email.

101,WBA,Kroger balks at buying stores from Walgreens-Rite Aid deal -source,"(Reuters) - Supermarket chain Kroger Co is questioning whether to proceed with buying divested stores from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc as part of its proposed acquisition of Rite Aid Corp, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. Cincinnati, Ohio-based Kroger’s hesitation casts uncertainty on the future of the $9.4 billion Walgreens-Rite Aid deal, which need approval from antitrust authorities, who have pushed back against a number of large deals this year. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has told Kroger it would not have the option to close and integrate Rite Aid stores that are near Kroger locations, the source said. Kroger had concerns over the financial feasibility of such a set-up, as Rite Aid and Kroger have some overlap in products they sell, the source said, asking not to be named as the matter is confidential. Kroger and Walgreens representatives declined to comment. Walgreens said in early September it would likely have to divest between 500 and 1000 stores, more than its previous estimate, to win regulatory approval for its planned acquisition. Walgreen operates about 8,100 stores in the United States. Kroger had indicated to Rite Aid it had an interest in buying some of the divested stores, the source said. To be sure, it remains possible that other buyers, such as private equity firms, may step in to buy the stores if Kroger opts not to pursue a deal. It is not clear, however, whether another supermarket operator will step in, said David Balto, an antitrust attorney. “An acquisition (of the divested assets) by a supermarket would be a substantial challenge because it’s outside their normal area of expertise,” he said. “Pharmacies are the most competitive part of the health care system. Because of that, acquiring pharmacies may not be that attractive [for a grocery operator]” he added.

111,WBA,"UPDATE 5-Trump victory clouds outlook for Time Warner-AT&T;, other mergers","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate dealmakers were likely to put major merger plans on hold as they assess whether U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his populist promises and a threat to block AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) purchase of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), or act more like traditional business-friendly Republican administrations. Trump’s rhetoric and the personal nature of the campaign, which included little discussion of policy, left many uncertain about the new U.S. leader’s plans, including how his administration will handle mega-mergers. Wall Street braced for a drop in deals, with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday projecting a 20 to 30 percent downside for earnings of banks that focus on merger and acquisition advice, and Jefferies saying that uncertainty about Trump’s policy on trade, healthcare, taxes and energy could hamper underwriting activity and M&A; globally. “I think a lot of deals will hit the pause button for a bit until we get some clarity on whether President Trump will moderate or be as disruptive as some expect,” said a senior Wall Street banker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media. “It’s going to be a tough environment for everything until we see how [Trump] behaves as a leader,” the banker added. Trump said in October that AT&T;’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio was an example of a “power structure” rigged against him and voters, and that he would block a deal. The gap between Time Warner shares and the implied value of AT&T;’s cash and stock bid was over 23 percent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, compared to around 22 percent at Tuesday’s close, indicating greater investor skepticism that the companies will be able to complete the transaction.  Still, some investors believed the man who considers himself business friendly would take a more moderate tone than in the campaign once he assumes office, as he did on Tuesday night in his acceptance speech. “We think Trump will be pretty good for merger and acquisition activity. As a general proposition, he is pro-business and pro-free market,” said Roy Behren, portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Management. Other big pending U.S. deals also did not see sharp changes in their spreads on Wednesday morning, and the spreads of three pharmaceutical or health care-related deals that have encountered antitrust troubles, Aetna (AET.N)-Humana (HUM.N), Anthem (ANTM.N)-Cigna (CI.N) and Walgreens (WBA.O)-Rite Aid (RAD.N), actually narrowed, signaling investors may think they are more likely to close under a Trump administration. The president does not directly decide if a merger is illegal under antitrust law and the job is done by the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, which divide up the work of assessing mergers. If one of the agencies decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree. AT&T; Chief Financial Officer John Stephens on Wednesday said his company was looking forward to working with Trump and  “optimistic” regulators would approve the deal.  Trump’s policies and discussions “about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T;’s goals,” Stephens said at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York. Time Warner’s shares were last down 1 percent to $86.71, after trading as low as $85.60, while AT&T; shares were up just under 1 percent at $37.24. The Dow and S&P; 500 were both over 1 percent higher in late afternoon trading. The election results mean “increased risks” for the AT&T-Time; Warner deal, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said. “At the very least, there are going to be individuals put in place (by a Trump administration) that are going to make the deal a lot more challenging to complete,” he added.    Trump’s protectionist stance also raises the risk that some foreign corporations, including from China, may face higher hurdles in trying to take over American companies, dealmakers said. “If you were thinking about doing a cross-border deal six months ago you weren’t considering things like potential trade barriers, protectionism and tariffs. These are things you have to at least develop a view on and factor into the risk assessment of doing an overseas deal now,” said Johs Worsoe, MUFG’s head of investment banking & markets in the Americas.

112,WBA,Rite Aid to sell 865 stores to Fred's,"(Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp said it would sell 865 stores to Fred’s Inc for $950 million to satisfy antitrust concerns over its proposed takeover by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. Fred’s shares jumped 73 pct to $19.34 in morning trading on Tuesday, while Rite Aid shares were up 5.6 pct at $8.63. Rite Aid and Walgreens were widely expected to divest stores in states where the combined company would have a particularly strong position. Walgreens has 13,200 stores, nearly 60 percent of which are in the United States, while Rite Aid has 4,570 stores in the United States. Walgreens said in October 2015 it would buy smaller peer Rite Aid for $9.4 billion to widen its U.S. footprint. Fred’s will continue to operate the acquired stores under the Rite Aid banner during the transition period, the companies said on Tuesday. Walgreens said it continues to expect the acquisition to realize savings of over $1 billion within three to four years after the closing of the deal, which is expected in early 2017. Fred’s said BofA Merrill Lynch and Regions Bank will provide financing for store acquisitions.  Fred’s was advised by A.T. Kearney. BofA Merrill Lynch was the financial adviser for Walgreens Boots Alliance, while Citi advised Rite Aid.

113,WBA,Walgreens profit beats estimates on PBM partnerships,"(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as recent partnerships with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurance companies helped boost sales of prescription drugs as well as non-drug items. The largest U.S. drugstore chain also raised the lower end of its adjusted profit forecast for the year ending August 2017. Walgreens, which is awaiting regulatory approval for its $9.5 billion takeover of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), said it expects to close the deal early this year. It had previously extended the merger agreement till Jan. 27. Walgreens entered partnerships last year with PBMs such as Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O) and OptumRx and insurer UnitedHealthcare (UNH.N) which helped boost sales in the first quarter. Net income attributable to Walgreens fell to $1.05 billion, or 97 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Nov. 30, from $1.11 billion, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier.     Excluding items, the company earned $1.10 per share, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $1.09, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell to $28.50 billion from $29.03 billion, falling for the first time in four years and missing the analyst estimate of $29.23 billion.

116,WBA,Walgreens to pay $50 million to resolve U.S. prescription kickback case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) will pay $50 million to resolve a U.S. lawsuit accusing it of violating federal law by providing beneficiaries of government healthcare programs discounts and other incentives to fill their prescriptions at its pharmacies. The settlement, announced by Manhattan U.S Attorney Preet Bharara on Thursday, resolves a whistleblower lawsuit that the government joined related to the national pharmacy chain’s Prescription Savings Club program. Bharara said Walgreens allowed beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid to take part in the Savings Club program even though doing so violated a federal law against paying those beneficiaries kickbacks so they would choose Walgreens. Walgreens’ written materials about the Savings Club program, and its own internal policy, stated that beneficiaries of government health insurance programs were not eligible to participate, according to court filings related to the settlement. Nonetheless, the company offered employees bonuses for enrolling people in the program without checking whether they were eligible, Bharara said. As a result, he said, hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries were enrolled in the program. Walgreens acknowledged as part of its settlement that government beneficiaries were improperly enrolled in its savings program. About $46 million of the settlement will resolve claims by the federal government and the rest will go to states, which help administer Medicaid. The former Walgreens pharmacy manager who filed the whistleblower lawsuit, Marc Baker, will get about $9.7 million of the federal government’s portion of the settlement. “We entered into this agreement to avoid the delay, expense, and uncertainty of litigation, and did so without any admission of legal liability,” Walgreens spokesman Jim Cohn said in an email. He said the company still offers discounts to customers who are not government beneficiaries through the Savings Club program.

117,WBA,FTC not sold on Walgreens' plan to win nod for Rite Aid deal: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is not satisfied with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s (WBA.O) plan to divest stores to win antitrust clearance for its acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The FTC isn't convinced that Walgreen's proposal to sell 865 drugstores to Fred's Inc (FRED.O) would do enough to preserve competition that would be lost in the $9.4 billion tie-up, Bloomberg reported on Friday. (bloom.bg/2iJXpwf) The FTC is also unlikely to complete its review of the deal before the deadline of Jan. 27 to close the transaction, the Bloomberg report said. In October, Walgreens said it was “confident about this deal,” despite having to postpone the closure of the deal by three months to the end of January. The company also included Rite Aid’s profit in its full-year forecast to show its belief in closing the deal. If the deal is not completed, it would be a “massive downside” for Rite Aid with its stock likely to trade at $3.50 or below, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said in a note. Rite Aid’s shares were down 10 percent at $7.73 in afternoon trading. The bonds of the junk-rated pharmacy chain also plunged, dropping by roughly four points. Walgreens shares were down 2.4 percent in heavy trading, while Fred’s was down 3 percent. “For Walgreens, the transaction is a more modest negative ... We would not expect WBA to sit on the capital for very long and would look for a combination of share repurchases and additional M&A; in the not-too-distant future,” Muken said. Walgreens, the biggest drug store chain in the United States by store count, will have to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million if the FTC blocks the deal. “We still believe Walgreens will work as hard as possible towards completing the acquisition.

121,WBA,"Walgreens working to finalize Rite Aid deal, clear antitrust hurdles","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said Thursday that the biggest U.S. drug store chain was pressing on with its purchase of smaller Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), which was announced in October 2015 and has not closed. Rite Aid Corp said on Dec. 20 that it would sell 865 stores to Fred’s Inc (FRED.O) for $950 million to satisfy antitrust concerns on the deal, which was valued at $9.4 billion when it was announced in October 2015.  The Federal Trade Commission is assessing the proposed merger to ensure it complies with antitrust law. “During the year, we also continued in our effort to get regulatory approval for our acquisition,” said Stefano Pessina, Walgreens Boots Alliance chief executive, at an annual shareholders meeting in New York City. Pessina declined to detail issues raised in the review: “The only thing I can repeat is that we are actively engaged in dialogue with the FTC and we are doing everything we can to support their work,” he said. Pessina said Walgreens was also talking to Rite Aid. “These discussions include taking into account anything required to gain approval for the transaction,” he said. It could take two months for the agency to assess a proposed divestiture of that size since it would look at the proposed sales, store by store, and in detail, said David Balto, a former FTC official now in private practice. “Retail market divestitures are very complex. It’s unrealistic to assume that they could get through a divestiture that’s this significant in a few weeks,” said Balto. The purchase is a big expansion for Fred’s. The chain has more than 650 discount stores in the southeastern United States with 350 pharmacies, according to its website. Walgreens has 13,200 stores, nearly 60 percent of which are in the United States, while Rite Aid has 4,570 stores in the United States. The FTC may be doubly careful after it was stung by the failure of an earlier retail divestiture. It allowed regional grocer Haggen to buy 146 stores as part of a deal to allow Albertsons to buy Safeway in early 2015, only to have Haggen file for bankruptcy that same year. Albertsons bought dozens of the stores. The FTC is also in transition. President Donald Trump named Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen the acting chair on Wednesday. Another commissioner, former Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, leaves early next month.

The companies said on Monday they agreed to reduce the offer price to $6.50-$7.00 per share, valuing Rite Aid at $6.84 billion-$7.37 billion.

128,WBA,"Fitch Rates Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.'s New Term Loans and RCF 'BBB'","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.'s (WBA) new $4.8 billion and $1 billion term loan  credit facilities as well as its $1 billion revolving credit facility (RCF).  These facilities, which are expected to be used to finance the proposed Rite Aid  acquisition, replace $6.8 billion in funding commitments which expired Jan. 27,  2017.  The $4.8 billion term loan is structured in two $2.4 billion tranches, maturing  Oct. 27, 2019 and Oct. 27, 2021, respectively. The $1 billion term loan is  structured in two $500 million tranches, which expire on the first anniversary  of the date of funding and the earlier of the same date or March 30, 2018,  respectively. Both term loan commitments expire July 31, 2017 with potential  extensions to Oct. 31, 2017. The $1 billion revolver, which has an accordion  feature for additional commitments of up to $250 million, is a 364-day facility  which became effective Feb. 1, 2017 and may be used for general corporate  purposes including the funding of its Rite Aid acquisition. Fitch Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for WBA is 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.  A  full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. On Jan. 30, 2017, WBA announced a renegotiated Rite Aid merger agreement, which  both lowers the purchase price and extends the agreement to July 31, 2017. The  previous $17 billion purchase price was reduced by $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion,  with the final price dependent on required store divestitures, which could be up  to 1,200, higher than the original plan of up to 1,000 stores. Fitch estimates a total purchase price for Rite Aid of approximately $14.5  billion, including the assumption of $2.3 billion (from a total $7 billion) of  Rite Aid's existing unsecured debt. WBA has obtained $12.8 billion in financing  for the acquisition, including approximately $6 billion each of unsecured notes  and term loans and $1 billion in revolver availability. The 'BBB' rating incorporates WBA's leading position and increasing market share  in the growing drugstore category. WBA's ample free cash flow (FCF) provides it  the financial flexibility to invest strategically in its business and new  opportunities while managing its balance sheet. The debt-financed Rite Aid  acquisition offers WBA the ability to strengthen its competitive position and  generate significant procurement and cost synergies.  Incremental debt is expected to yield elevated leverage of around 4.0x on a pro  forma adjusted debt/EBITDAR basis from an LTM 3.3x times on a standalone basis  (eliminating $6 billion in funded debt associated with the Rite Aid  acquisition). Fitch expects WBA to return adjusted leverage to the mid-3x level  by fiscal 2019 (August) and toward the low-3x range thereafter. Concerns include  ongoing pressure on U.S. pharmacy reimbursement rates, WBA's under-penetration  in the U.S. specialty pharmacy business, and integration risks with Rite Aid. KEY RATING DRIVERS Since Walgreen Co. (WAG) completed its merger with Alliance Boots to form WBA on  Dec. 31, 2014, the combined entity has developed a holistic strategy to grow its  presence in the U.S. healthcare market. The company has undertaken a number of  strategic priorities to drive the business, including the following: --AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) Long-Term Relationship: In March 2013, WAG and  wholesaler ABC announced a 10-year agreement (subsequently extended to 2026) to  source all drugs through a newly formed strategic partnership which would enable  sharing of synergies by layering ABC's generic volume into WBA. Previously, WAG  sourced branded pharmaceuticals through Cardinal Health Inc., specialty  pharmaceuticals through ABC and generics directly from manufacturers.  Management also believed an economic interest in ABC was important and  structured warrants and an open-market purchase program. As of February 2017,  WBA owns 26% of ABC at a cost of approximately $3.1 billion after exercising its  final warrants for $1.2 billion.  --Rite Aid Purchase: In October 2015, WBA announced the proposed purchase of  Rite Aid, designed to add to the company's national retail coverage and  purchasing scale. Rite Aid - which has approximately 6% share of the U.S.  prescription market - has strong presence in key markets where Walgreens has  lower market share such as California and the Northeast. The company is also  targeting $1 billion in cost synergies, including leveraging scale in sourcing  and eliminating duplicative corporate expenses. Fitch has modelled synergies  approaching $750 million by fiscal 2020. --Cost Structure Opportunities: The company has identified $1.5 billion in cost  reduction opportunities primarily in the Walgreens U.S. business, up from $1  billion initially identified in June 2012 at the announcement of the  WAG/Alliance Boots partnership, and plans to complete the program by the end of  fiscal 2017. Key areas of focus have included retail footprint optimization,  headquarters rationalization and store operations efficiencies. WBA has a multifaceted strategy in terms of the front-end, which represents  around 30% of enterprise sales volume, of which three-quarters is generated via  Walgreens stores in the U.S. First, new management sees an opportunity to  improve basic operations such as inventory management and shrink reduction.  Second, management believes Walgreens has historically been overly focused on  promotions, with many loss leaders driving down margins. WBA has been reducing  promotions and relying more on strong operations and its Balance Rewards loyalty  program to drive sales. Third, WBA plans to revitalize its beauty offering in  the U.S., using elements of the successful Boots model including owned brands  such as No 7, Soap & Glory and Botanics. Fitch views as positive efforts to  drive installed loyalty programs as a means to improve customer stickiness.  RATING STRENGTHS Category Growth and Competitive Resilience WBA benefits from share gains in its U.S. pharmacy business, which accounts for  approximately 50% of total company sales, with the industry expected to grow  1%-2% annually each in volume and pricing. The industry has benefitted from an  aging U.S. population, enrollment increases due to the Affordable Care Act, and  prescription price increases, particularly for specialty pharmaceuticals.  Unlike many other retail categories, Fitch views pharmacies as having limited  competition from new formats given fixed-price contracts and pharmacist supply  constraints. Mail-order, which emerged as a major threat to retailers over the  past several decades, appears to have peaked, particularly given ""90-day at  retail"" offers across the industry as well as a number of branded drugs shifting  to over-the-counter. However, there has been significant pharmacy reimbursement pressure due to  shifts to managed care from cash over the 1990s through mid-2000s and growth in  Medicaid/Medicare over the last few years, and this pressure is expected to  continue over the next few years as payers strive to contain healthcare costs.  Economics of scale are critical to negotiate better pricing on pharmaceutical  purchases to help offset some of the reimbursement pressure. As a result, Fitch  expects WBA will continue to drive U.S. share gains with volume growth in the  2%-3% range while the overall industry grows at 1%-2%.  Fitch has currently not modelled any impact on total coverage, volume, or  pricing based on potential changes to the Affordable Care Act or other  legislative activity impacting the pharmaceutical industry. Front-end sales have grown in the low-single digits in recent years, and have  shown resilience to competition from channels including discounters and online.  Fitch believes that WBA's low front-end ticket at less than $10 in most cases,  convenience model, and purchase immediacy have allowed it to effectively compete  against new entrants. Fitch expects WBA's front-end comparable store sales  (comps) to be slightly positive over the next three years. Market Share Gains Expected to Continue With 20% prescription market share, WBA is the second-largest player in the U.S.  and has driven market share through execution and scale benefits. As a leading  market player with strong loyalty from a sticky customer base, WBA is a  preferred retail partner and can compete effectively for inclusion in pharmacy  networks with acceptable financial terms. WBA's size also permits cost-effective  pharmaceuticals buying, enhanced by its partnership with wholesaler ABC, to  leverage the combined buying scale. As a result of WBA's scale and execution, the company has built a long track  record of growth, including U.S. comparable prescription volume growth of 3.5%  and 2.3% in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively. This growth reflects  market share gains in light of the structural challenges facing the retail  pharmacy space. Industry challenges, such as increased concentration of payers  (including the government), mail-order, and narrow networks, have not had a  negative impact on Walgreens' volume growth and, in Fitch's view, have likely  helped it gain share against smaller operators and independents. However, these  challenges have dampened gross margins and Fitch expects WBA's U.S pharmacy  gross margins to decline 30-40bps annually. Despite overall market strength, WBA is underpenetrated in specialty  pharmaceuticals relative to the market and competitors such as CVS Caremark  (CVS), which has made targeted investments into the specialty category and  benefits from its purchase of pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and mail-order  operator Caremark in 2006. CVS currently has approximately a 25% share of the  U.S. specialty market, which Fitch estimates at more than twice that of  Walgreens. As specialty pharmaceutical growth will dominate overall spending  growth over the rating horizon, WBA is somewhat structurally disadvantaged. The  company's recently announced strategic alliance to combine its specialty  pharmacy business with Prime Therapeutics LLC could improve its growth profile  while benefitting from scale efficiencies.  Fitch anticipates WBA can grow its U.S. pharmaceuticals sales in the 4% range  annually, by taking share in non-specialty categories while maintaining or  losing modest share in the specialty category. Fitch expects WBA's international business, approximately 30% of total company  sales, to grow in the low single digits annually over the forecast horizon,  driven by 1%-2% comps in international retail and modest growth in the  international wholesale business. International gross margins are expected to be  flattish in the low-20% range, as the dynamics pressuring gross margins in the  U.S. are less prevalent abroad. Rite Aid EBITDA Opportunity Fitch views the proposed purchase of Rite Aid, which reported sales of $33  billion and EBITDA of $1.3 billion in the LTM ended November 2016, positively  due primarily to the procurement and cost structure opportunities gained by  exploiting the combined entity's scale. The company's $1 billion cost synergy  target is predicated largely on improved sourcing, in addition to reducing  duplicative costs in the combined entity. Fitch believes at least $750 million  of synergy savings are possible by fiscal 2020, though mitigated by around $300  million EBITDA reduction, assuming the FTC mandates approximately 1,200 store  divestitures due to local market share concerns. Depending on final store divestitures, Rite Aid would improve WBA's national  retail coverage, particularly in Southern California and Northeastern U.S.  markets, positioning it well to compete for inclusion in narrow and preferred  pharmacy networks. At the end of fiscal 2015, 76% of U.S. households operated  within a five-mile radius of a Walgreens or Duane Reade (also owned by WBA) and  Fitch anticipates the coverage is likely to rise to the mid-to-high 80% range at  the close of the acquisition. Beyond the synergy benefits, WBA may also benefit from store consolidations over  the next few years, where a Rite Aid or Walgreens store is closed and the  prescription file is transferred to another nearby location. The drugstore  industry has historically driven EBITDA improvements through these  consolidations. Additionally, Rite Aid has historically had lower per-store  sales productivity than its larger peers given significant lack of investments,  and WBA plans to improve comps through its operating expertise. Fitch has not  incorporated upside from either of these opportunities into its forecast. Size and Scale Enables Financial Flexibility WBA's scale affords significant financial flexibility, allowing the company to  invest in its existing business and capitalize on new opportunities while  reducing leverage post the Rite Aid acquisition, which could add approximately  $12 billion of debt to WBA's existing $13 billion (as of Nov. 30, 2016 and  excluding $6 billion in unsecured notes intended to finance the Rite Aid  acquisition), yielding pro forma leverage of approximately 4.0x, up from current  leverage of 3.3x (excluding debt associated with the Rite Aid acquisition). Fitch believes the purchase of Rite Aid and accompanying synergies could drive  EBITDA to close to $12 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $9 billion in fiscal  2016 excluding Rite Aid and about $10 billion on a pro forma WBA/Rite Aid basis.  Fitch expects pro forma FCF to be around $4 billion after dividends, before  one-time cash restructuring/merger expenses and prior to any potential working  capital improvements. FCF should increase to the $5 billion range by fiscal 2020  on synergies and reduced merger expenses, and is expected to be used primarily  for debt paydown. Fitch believes debt paydown could yield adjusted leverage in  at around mid-3x by fiscal 2019 and toward the low-3.0x range thereafter, absent  any large-scale acquisitions. Should the Rite Aid acquisition not be consummated, Fitch expects WBA to end  fiscal 2017 with leverage in the low-3.0x range. The company would likely use  FCF to resume share repurchases, absent any other acquisition opportunities.  RATING CONCERNS Gross Margin Pressure Fitch sees continued gross margin pressure on sales of pharmaceuticals in the  U.S. Structural margin pressure has been a consequence of increased penetration  of the government as a pharmaceutical payer under the Medicare and Medicaid  programs, ongoing pressure from commercial payers, and a mix shift toward the  90-day at retail offering. This pressure has been somewhat mitigated by the  growth in generic penetration over the last few years, though this is expected  to taper off given a lighter calendar of branded expirations.  Projected margins may also be affected by the growth in preferred/narrow  networks, as WBA sacrifices margin for network inclusion to drive volume. Over  the forecast horizon, Fitch expects U.S. pharmacy gross margins to decline  30bps-40bps annually, while U.S front-end gross margins are expected to remain  relatively flat. Fitch has also assumed modest gross margin pressure in WBA's  international retail pharmacy and wholesale businesses.  Cash Flow Deployment Options/Lack of Financial Targets WBA has shown a willingness to use cash and leverage to grow its business.  Examples include its strategic investment in ABC and its announced merger with  Rite Aid. Management has expressed support of partnerships and the need to  reduce inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system. This mindset, coupled with  management's lack of publicly stated financial targets, yields some risk with  regard to the pace of debt paydown. Front-End Competition from Online Players WBA's enterprise front-end sales have been resilient to strengthened competition  from discounters and online channels. Fitch believes this is due to low average  ticket prices, WBA's convenience model, and purchase immediacy. However, online  merchants, Amazon.com, Inc. in particular, continue to improve their business  models and speed of delivery, which could affect WBA's higher-margin front-end  sales in the future. Rite Aid Integration Risk Fitch assumes WBA can achieve $750 million of the planned $1 billion in  synergies by fiscal 2020. Fitch expects WBA will enact a number of changes to  Rite Aid operations, including store closures/consolidations, supply  chain/procurement changes, and merchandising updates. Any of these could cause  inventory interruptions and customer dissatisfaction, putting at risk both  synergy forecasts and Rite Aid's ongoing sales trajectory. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects 2.5%-3% sales growth at legacy WBA, driven by 4% U.S. pharmacy  and 0%-1% U.S. front-end comps and low-single-digit growth in the company's  international retail and wholesale businesses. Sales growth for the combined  entity is projected to be around 2%-3% after adjusting for an assumed 1,200 Rite  Aid divestitures. --Standalone EBITDA, which was $9 billion in fiscal 2016, is expected to  increase toward $10 billion over the next 36 months. EBITDA of around $10 billion on a pro forma basis including Rite Aid could  improve to around $12 billion over the 36 months following the close of the  acquisition on modest core growth and Rite Aid synergies.  --FCF after dividends is projected to be around $4 billion on a pro forma basis,  prior to merger-related expenses and restructuring charges. FCF is expected to  increase toward $5 billion on Rite Aid synergies in the 36 months following the  close of the acquisition. FCF is expected to be used primarily to reduce debt to  the mid-3.0x range in fiscal 2018 and the low-3.0x range in fiscal 2019. --Standalone FCF is projected to be in around $4 billion beginning fiscal 2017,  and could be used to resume WBA's share repurchase program while maintaining  leverage in the low-3.0x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES A negative rating action could occur given some combination of the following: --Persistently negative front-end comparable store sales or flattish  prescription volume growth, indicating market share erosion; --Unsuccessful execution yielding flattish or modestly declining EBITDA from pro  forma levels, driven by greater-than-expected gross margin declines on worsening  reimbursement rates or weak implementation of the Rite Aid integration or  merchandising/systems initiatives; --A debt-financed transaction or divergence of cash flow to unanticipated  strategic priorities, limiting debt paydown; --Diminished confidence in WBA's ability and willingness to reduce leverage  below 3.5x by fiscal 2020, absent an unforeseen debt-financed acquisition. Given WBA's lack of stated targets with respect to financial leverage, an  upgrade is unlikely due to the risk of a leveraging transaction. However, Fitch  would view positively a public commitment to sustain leverage below 3x. LIQUIDITY At Nov 30, 2016, the company had $9.4 billion in cash (which excludes $174  million of deposits restricted under agency agreements, law,or other  obligations) and full availability on its revolver. WBA had $18.9 billion of debt at Nov. 30, 2016, composed of a GBP 1.4 billion  term loan (or USD$1.8 billion equivalent) with the remainder in unsecured notes,  of which approximately $6 billion is expected to finance the Rite Aid  acquisition. WBA is funding the acquisition with approximately $12 billion of  debt, including the assumption of $2.3 billion of Rite Aid's existing unsecured  debt.

131,WBA,Walgreens posts surprise sales drop on weakness in Europe,"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) reported a surprise drop in quarterly sales on Wednesday, citing challenging market conditions in Europe and the impact of a stronger dollar. The company also said it would repurchase up to $1 billion worth of shares until Dec. 31. Walgreens said sales from its international business fell 14.5 percent to $3.10 billion in the second quarter ended Feb. 28. Sales in its wholesale business, which also operates in Europe, fell 10.6 percent to $5.03 billion. The average value of the dollar has risen 3.3 percent against a basket of currencies in the three months ended February. Sales in the quarter were also hurt by a drop in front-end sales at its U.S. stores due to weak demand for consumables and personal care items. Front-end sales, which include sales of non-prescription drugs, beauty products and toiletries, account for a third of the U.S. pharmacy business. Walgreens has been trying to revive U.S. retail sales, or front-end sales, mainly by sprucing up its beauty business, which is a big traffic driver.

132,WBA,UPDATE 2-Walgreens posts surprise sales drop on weakness in Europe,"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) reported a surprise drop in quarterly sales on Wednesday, citing challenging market conditions in Europe and the impact of a stronger dollar. The company also said it would repurchase up to $1 billion worth of shares until Dec. 31. Walgreens said sales from its international business fell 14.5 percent to $3.10 billion in the second quarter ended Feb. 28. Sales in its wholesale business, which also operates in Europe, fell 10.6 percent to $5.03 billion. The average value of the dollar has risen 3.3 percent against a basket of currencies in the three months ended February. Sales in the quarter were also hurt by a drop in front-end sales at its U.S. stores due to weak demand for consumables and personal care items. Front-end sales, which include sales of non-prescription drugs, beauty products and toiletries, account for a third of the U.S. pharmacy business. Walgreens has been trying to revive U.S. retail sales, or front-end sales, mainly by sprucing up its beauty business, which is a big traffic driver. The company said it would roll out revamped beauty sections in more than 1,000 stores by the end of 2017. It renovated beauty units in over 1,800 stores last year.

139,WBA,CVS Health's profit beats as pharmacy margins rise,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit as higher margins in its pharmacy business helped offset the loss of major contracts last year. Same-store prescription volumes fell 460 basis points in the first quarter due to the loss of contracts to fill prescriptions for Tricare, a U.S. Department of Defense health care program, and for customers of pharmacy benefits manager Prime Therapeutics, to rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O). However, higher generic drug dispensing rate and a cut back on promotions at the front-end of the store lifted gross margin in the pharmacy business by about 35 basis points to 29.4 percent. Front-end same-store sales fell 4.9 percent in the first three months ended March 31. The company sells beauty products, snacks and over-the-counter drugs at the front-end of its nearly 9,700 stores.  Front-end same-store sales slipped for the fourth straight quarter and the company has been investing to turn around sales by improving the store layout and product assortment. CVS reiterated its 2017 profit forecast and estimated second-quarter adjusted earnings largely below analysts’ average estimate of $1.33 per share. The company’s shares were down 2 percent at $80.23 in morning trading on Tuesday. Through Monday’s close, they had gained 5.4 percent since Walgreens reported a surprise drop in sales last month.     Revenue in CVS’s bigger pharmacy services business rose 8.5 percent to $31.2 billion as claims increased across its network and on strong demand for its specialty pharmacy service. The specialty pharmacy service provides expensive drugs to people with chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Net income attributable to CVS fell to $952 million, or 92 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $1.15 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Interest expenses declined 11 percent to $252 million, while the company also got $19 million in tax benefits from the adoption of new accounting guidance for share-based compensation. Excluding items, the company earned $1.17 per share. Revenue rose 3 percent to $44.51 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.10 per share on revenue of $44.20 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Rite Aid’s share price dropped as much as 16.7 percent after the Capital Forum reported that the Federal Trade Commission’s staff was prepared to recommend that the agency file a lawsuit to stop the deal. Shares of Walgreens were little changed. A final decision on a lawsuit would be made by FTC acting Chair Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, and Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat. A source close to the deal confirmed the report to Reuters and said that agency staff has asked companies and groups concerned about the deal for depositions and affidavits that could be used in a lawsuit aimed at stopping it.

Theranos was founded by Elizabeth Holmes in 2003 to develop an innovative blood testing device that would give quicker results using just one drop of blood. The Palo Alto, California-based company, once valued at $9 billion, ran into trouble after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles beginning October 2015, suggesting its blood-testing devices were flawed and inaccurate. Walgreens terminated its relationship with Theranos in June 2016, and closed operations at all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers at its stores in Arizona. The following month, Holmes was barred by a U.S. regulator from owning or operating a lab for at least two years.

151,WBA,"Walgreens scraps Rite Aid merger, will instead buy half its stores","(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) after failing to win antitrust approval, but said it would instead buy nearly half of the smaller rival’s U.S. stores for $5.18 billion. Rite Aid’s shares plunged about 28 percent to $2.85, while Walgreens shares were up 1 percent at $77.97. Walgreens also ended a related deal to sell as many as 1,200 Rite Aid stores to Fred’s Inc (FRED.O), sending Fred’s shares down 19 percent. Walgreens, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, will likely have an easier time winning antitrust approval to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores after it failed to win approval to take over the nearly 4,600-store chain. “Walgreens and Rite Aid have taken a pragmatic approach,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. The revised deal could offer many of the same benefits as a whole-sale take out of the company, but on a smaller scale. Walgreens said it expects about $400 million of cost savings from its new agreement, down from around $1 billion expected from the original deal.  That could help offset challenges it faced in recent years hitting targets for sales growth, which has been weighed on in part by disappointing growth in its retail segment.  Walgreens also invited Rite Aid to join its group purchasing agreement, which aims to leverage the combined heft of its members to negotiate discounts on generic drug prices.  The decision to sell so many stores will weaken Rite Aid and could still be controversial, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer who had worked with groups opposing Walgreens’ takeover of Rite Aid. “Rite Aid’s future is going to be bleak after they sell these stores. This is still going to raise some serious questions. It’s still taking out a major competitor,” Balto said. In fact, Walgreens’ plan to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores accomplishes many of the same goals as the merger - including eliminating Rite Aid as a rival - but does so in a way that makes it harder for the FTC to take the companies to court to stop the transaction, antitrust experts said. “Obviously no victory dance for the FTC today. This was a big stick-it-to-you. They’re (the FTC) getting a worse outcome than they would before,” said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC. “Clearly they (the companies) know what the FTC concerns are. They have likely worked around those issues, which has to be very frustrating for the FTC.” The FTC sued to stop two separate deals last week, suggesting that former administration’s tough antitrust approach will continue under President Donald Trump. The agency is being run by Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen and three commissioner slots are vacant. The FTC said on Thursday it would review the new proposal. Rite Aid said the stores to be sold are mainly in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The deal also includes distribution centers in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.  Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen estimated that under the new deal, Walgreens would be paying $2.4 million per Rite Aid store, higher than what it would have paid under a previous agreement, where it would have paid $2.04 million to $2.06 million per store.  Walgreens said on Thursday it expects the new deal to close within six months.      Walgreens also reported better-than-expected profit and sales for the third quarter, helped by a rise in prescription volumes in its U.S. pharmacy business.   The company also authorized a $5 billion buyback program and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast by 8 cents per share to a range of $4.98 to $5.08. Analysts on average were expecting full-year profit of $4.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The new agreement will assist Rite Aid in addressing pharmacy margin challenges and in significantly reducing debt, the company’s CEO John Standley said in a statement.  Walgreens said it would pay Rite Aid a $325 million termination fee. In October 2015, Walgreens said it would buy No. 3 Rite Aid for $9.5 billion.

The revised deal could offer many of the same benefits as a whole-sale take out of the company, but on a smaller scale. Walgreens said it expects about $400 million of cost savings from its new agreement, down from around $1 billion expected from the original deal.  That could help offset challenges it faced in recent years hitting targets for sales growth, which has been weighed on in part by disappointing growth in its retail segment.  Walgreens also invited Rite Aid to join its group purchasing agreement, which aims to leverage the combined heft of its members to negotiate discounts on generic drug prices.  The decision to sell so many stores will weaken Rite Aid and could still be controversial, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer who had worked with groups opposing Walgreens’ takeover of Rite Aid. “Rite Aid’s future is going to be bleak after they sell these stores. This is still going to raise some serious questions. It’s still taking out a major competitor,” Balto said. In fact, Walgreens’ plan to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores accomplishes many of the same goals as the merger - including eliminating Rite Aid as a rival - but does so in a way that makes it harder for the FTC to take the companies to court to stop the transaction, antitrust experts said. “Obviously no victory dance for the FTC today. This was a big stick-it-to-you. They’re (the FTC) getting a worse outcome than they would before,” said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC. “Clearly they (the companies) know what the FTC concerns are. They have likely worked around those issues, which has to be very frustrating for the FTC.” The FTC sued to stop two separate deals last week, suggesting that former administration’s tough antitrust approach will continue under President Donald Trump. The agency is being run by Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen and three commissioner slots are vacant. The FTC said on Thursday it would review the new proposal. Rite Aid said the stores to be sold are mainly in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The deal also includes distribution centers in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.  Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen estimated that under the new deal, Walgreens would be paying $2.4 million per Rite Aid store, higher than what it would have paid under a previous agreement, where it would have paid $2.04 million to $2.06 million per store.  Walgreens said on Thursday it expects the new deal to close within six months.      Walgreens also reported better-than-expected profit and sales for the third quarter, helped by a rise in prescription volumes in its U.S. pharmacy business.   The company also authorized a $5 billion buyback program and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast by 8 cents per share to a range of $4.98 to $5.08. Analysts on average were expecting full-year profit of $4.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The new agreement will assist Rite Aid in addressing pharmacy margin challenges and in significantly reducing debt, the company’s CEO John Standley said in a statement.  Walgreens said it would pay Rite Aid a $325 million termination fee. In October 2015, Walgreens said it would buy No. 3 Rite Aid for $9.5 billion.

153,WBA,Walgreens salvages mild boost from intense effort,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walgreens Boots Alliance has at least salvaged something from the wreckage of its deal to buy rival U.S. drugstore chain Rite Aid. After antitrust pushback on the full-strength $9.4 billion deal, Walgreens has abandoned it and is instead buying over 2,000 of Rite Aid’s stores for $5.2 billion. For Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina, doing about half the deal with half the benefits is something – but it’s a modest return on at least 20 months’ work. The acquisition, announced in October 2015, was always a high-risk, high-return venture. Adding over 4,500 locations would have combined two of the top three pharmacies in America and produced a projected $1 billion of annual savings. Investors initially added $5 billion to Walgreens’ market value. Regulators proved harder to persuade. An initial proposal to divest 865 stores was bumped up to 1,200 in a revised proposal earlier this year. The Federal Trade Commission made it clear, however, that this still wouldn’t cut it.  Walgreens is confident the new deal addresses watchdogs’ concerns. And Pessina can claim there’s still a decent rationale for the acquisition, even though Walgreens has to pay a $325 million break fee to Rite Aid for the old deal on top of the new price. The purchase includes almost half Rite Aid’s stores, and Walgreens reckons there are at least $400 million of annual cost savings to be had. The value of those synergies should cover any premium Pessina is paying. And assuming the stores account for half of Rite Aid’s estimated net operating profit in 2020, it all adds up to a post-tax return on investment above 10 percent. Walgreens stock was flat in Thursday late morning trade in New York, when the broader market was down. That’s a far better outcome than the more than 25 percent slump in Rite Aid’s shares. Even so, it’s hardly the knockout transaction Pessina was aiming for. Given Walgreens and its executives have spent approaching two years on the deal, it may count as a dent in his strong deal-making reputation. Amid other big threats, including Amazon.com exploring the pharmacy business, all that time and effort could have been usefully directed elsewhere.",6292017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-riteaid-m-a-breakingviews/walgreens-salvages-mild-boost-from-intense-effort-idUSKBN19K2S8
154,WBA,"Walgreens scraps Rite Aid merger, will instead buy half its stores","(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid Corp after failing to win antitrust approval, but said it would instead buy nearly half of the smaller rival’s U.S. stores for $5.18 billion.

155,WBA,US STOCKS-Wall St extends losses as tech selloff deepens,"* U.S. economy grew 1.4 pct in Q1 vs prior reading of 1.2 pct * Nasdaq on track to post monthly loss after 7 months of gains * Rite Aid slumps to near 4-yr low after Walgreens terminates deal * Indexes down: Dow 0.77 pct, S&P; 0.88 pct, Nasdaq 1.62 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Ankur Banerjee and Tanya Agrawal June 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street extended losses in early afternoon trading on Thursday with all three major indexes on track to post their biggest one-day drop in a month as a selloff in technology stocks deepened. Tech stocks, which have led the S&P; 500’s record run this year, pulled back recently after some investors questioned the sector’s high valuations and shifted to defensive sectors. The S&P; tech index led the laggards among the 11 sectors, with the index on track to post its biggest monthly loss in a year. Apple, which fell 1.8 percent, was the biggest drag on all the three major indexes, while Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon were among the top three drags on the Nasdaq and the S&P.; The CBOE Volatility index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, hit more than a one-month high of 12.38 points. The financial sector, which rose as much as 2.02 percent, before paring gains to trade up 0.31 percent, was one of the only two gainers. Shares of the top six U.S. banks rose after the Federal Reserve cleared them in the second part of its annual stress test, allowing them to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks. “Part of the reason why tech is down today is the steam in the recent rotation out of some of big tech winners and into banks,” said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. “The catalyst for that rotation today is the really strong stress test results coupled with higher treasury rates this morning and a positive GDP revision, leading investors to move into financial which has underperformed this year.” The financial index has grown about 6 percent this year, underperforming the 8.1 percent rise in the S&P.; At 12:41 P.m. ET (1641 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 166.04 points, or 0.77 percent, at 21,288.57, the S&P; 500 was down 21.49 points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,419.2. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 100.77 points, or 1.62 percent, at 6,133.65, on track to post a monthly loss after seven straight months of gains. Earlier in the day, data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. Oil prices rose to a two-week high, extending the rally into the sixth straight session, after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply, helping the energy sector post a gain of 0.38 percent. Among stocks, Rite Aid slumped as much as 30 percent to a near four-year low after Walgreens Boots Alliance terminated its agreement to buy the drug store chain and said it would instead buy nearly half of its stores for $5.18 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,156 to 714. On the Nasdaq, 2,007 issues fell and 786 advanced.

156,WBA,Fitch Affirms Walgreens Boots Alliance at 'BBB' Following Revised Rite Aid Corp Transaction,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.'s (WBA) 'BBB' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) following its proposed purchase of 2,186 Rite Aid Corporation locations for $5.175 billion. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Fitch views the new proposal, which replaces WBA's previous proposal to acquire Rite Aid in its entirety, to be a strategic positive based on increased geographic coverage, including the Northeastern U.S., although neutral to its credit profile. WBA's 'BBB' rating incorporates the company's leading position and increasing market share in the growing drugstore category. WBA's ample free cash flow (FCF) provides it the financial flexibility to invest strategically in its business and new opportunities while managing its balance sheet. The addition of 2,186 Rite Aid locations offers WBA the ability to strengthen its competitive position while generating synergies of around $400 million as guided by management. Given the significantly reduced purchase price, pro forma adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to remain around 3.3x, similar to latest 12-month levels (excluding funded debt associated with the proposed Rite Aid acquisition). Fitch expects adjusted leverage to remain near these levels over the next 24-36 months, absent further investment opportunities. Rating concerns include ongoing pressure on U.S. pharmacy reimbursement rates, WBA's under-penetration in the U.S. specialty pharmacy business, and integration risks with the addition of Rite Aid stores. KEY RATING DRIVERS Since Walgreen Co. (WAG) completed its merger with Alliance Boots to form WBA on Dec. 31, 2014, the combined entity has developed a holistic strategy to grow its presence in the U.S. healthcare market. The company has undertaken a number of strategic priorities to drive the business, including the following: --AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) Long-Term Relationship: In March 2013, WAG and wholesaler ABC announced a 10-year agreement (subsequently extended to 2026) to source all drugs through a newly formed strategic partnership which would enable sharing of synergies by layering ABC's generic volume into WBA. Previously, WAG sourced branded pharmaceuticals through Cardinal Health Inc., specialty pharmaceuticals through ABC and generics directly from manufacturers. Management also believed an economic interest in ABC was important and structured warrants and an open-market purchase program. WBA currently owns approximately 26% of ABC at a cost of approximately $3.1 billion after exercising its final warrants for $1.2 billion. --Cost Structure Opportunities: The company has identified $1.5 billion in cost reduction opportunities primarily in the Walgreens U.S. business, up from $1 billion initially identified in June 2012 at the announcement of the WAG/Alliance Boots partnership, and plans to complete the program by the end of fiscal 2017. Key areas of focus have included retail footprint optimization, headquarters rationalization and store operations efficiencies. WBA has a multifaceted strategy in terms of the front-end, which represents around 30% of enterprise sales volume, three-quarters of which is generated via Walgreens stores in the U.S. First, new management sees an opportunity to improve basic operations such as inventory management and shrink reduction. Second, management believes Walgreens has historically been overly focused on promotions, with many loss-leaders driving down margins. WBA has been reducing promotions and relying more on strong operations and its Balance Rewards loyalty program to drive sales. Third, WBA plans to revitalize its beauty offering in the U.S., using elements of the successful Boots model including owned brands such as No 7, Soap & Glory and Botanics. Fitch views as positive efforts to drive installed loyalty programs as a means to improve customer stickiness. RATING STRENGTHS Category Growth and Competitive Resilience WBA benefits from share gains in its U.S. pharmacy business, which accounts for approximately 50% of total company sales, with the industry expected to grow 1%-2% annually each in volume and pricing. The industry has benefitted from an aging U.S. population, enrollment increases due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and prescription price increases, particularly for specialty pharmaceuticals. Unlike many other retail categories, Fitch views pharmacies as having limited competition from new formats given fixed-price contracts and pharmacist supply constraints. Mail-order, which emerged as a major threat to retailers over the past several decades, appears to have peaked, particularly given ""90-day at retail"" offers across the industry as well as a number of branded drugs shifting to over-the-counter. However, there has been significant pharmacy reimbursement pressure due to shifts to managed care from cash over the 1990s through mid-2000s and growth in Medicaid/Medicare over the last few years, and this pressure is expected to continue over the next few years as payers strive to contain healthcare costs. Economics of scale are critical to negotiate better pricing on pharmaceutical purchases to help offset some of the reimbursement pressure. As a result, Fitch expects WBA will continue to drive U.S. share gains with volume growth in the 2%-3% range while the overall industry grows at 1%-2%. Fitch has currently not modelled any impact on total coverage, volume, or pricing based on potential changes to the ACA or other legislative activity affecting the pharmaceutical industry. Front-end sales have grown in the low single digits in recent years, and have shown resilience to competition from channels including discounters and online. Fitch believes that WBA's low front-end ticket at less than $10 in most cases, convenience model, and purchase immediacy have allowed it to effectively compete against new entrants. Fitch expects WBA's front-end comparable store sales (comps) to be slightly positive over the next three years. Market Share Gains Expected to Continue With 20% prescription market share, WBA is the second-largest player in the U.S. and has driven market share through execution and scale benefits. As a leading market player with strong loyalty from a sticky customer base, WBA is a preferred retail partner and can compete effectively for inclusion in pharmacy networks with acceptable financial terms. WBA's size also permits cost-effective pharmaceuticals buying, enhanced by its partnership with wholesaler ABC, to leverage the combined buying scale. As a result of WBA's scale and execution, the company has built a long track record of growth, including U.S. comparable prescription volume growth of 3.5% and 2.3% in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively. This growth reflects market share gains in light of the structural challenges facing the retail pharmacy space. Industry challenges, such as increased concentration of payers (including the government), mail-order, and narrow networks, have not had a negative impact on Walgreens' volume growth and, in Fitch's view, have likely helped it gain share against smaller operators and independents. However, these challenges have dampened gross margins and Fitch expects WBA's U.S pharmacy gross margins to decline 30bps-40bps annually. Despite overall market strength, WBA is underpenetrated in specialty pharmaceuticals relative to the market and competitors such as CVS Caremark (CVS), which has made targeted investments into the specialty category and benefits from its purchase of pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and mail-order operator Caremark in 2006. CVS currently has approximately a 25% share of the U.S. specialty market, which Fitch estimates at more than twice that of Walgreens. As specialty pharmaceutical growth will dominate overall spending growth over the rating horizon, WBA is somewhat structurally disadvantaged. The company's recently announced strategic alliance to combine its specialty pharmacy business with Prime Therapeutics LLC could improve its growth profile while benefitting from scale efficiencies. WBA's proposed acquisition of 2,186 Rite Aid locations would yield increased geographic coverage, particularly in certain Northeastern markets of the U.S., improving its ability to compete for inclusion in narrow and preferred pharmacy networks. At the end of fiscal 2016, 76% of the U.S. population lived within a five-mile radius of a Walgreens or Duane Reade (also owned by WBA) and Fitch anticipates the coverage is likely to rise modestly following the Rite Aid stores acquisition. Fitch anticipates WBA can grow its U.S. pharmaceuticals sales at around 4% annually, by taking share in non-specialty categories while maintaining or losing modest share in the specialty category. Fitch expects WBA's international business, approximately 30% of total company sales, to grow in the low single digits annually over the forecast horizon, driven by 1%-2% comps in international retail and modest growth in the international wholesale business. International gross margins are expected to be flattish in the low-20% range, as the dynamics pressuring gross margins in the U.S. are less prevalent abroad. RATING CONCERNS Gross Margin Pressure Fitch sees continued gross margin pressure on sales of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. Structural margin pressure has been a consequence of increased penetration of the government as a pharmaceutical payer under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, ongoing pressure from commercial payers, and a mix shift toward the ""90-day at retail"" offering. This pressure has been somewhat mitigated by the growth in generic penetration over the last few years, though this is expected to taper off given a lighter calendar of branded expirations. Projected margins may also be affected by the growth in preferred/narrow networks, as WBA sacrifices margin for network inclusion to drive volume. Over the forecast horizon, Fitch expects U.S. pharmacy gross margins to decline 30bps-40bps annually, while U.S front-end gross margins are expected to remain relatively flat. Fitch has also assumed modest gross margin pressure in WBA's international retail pharmacy and wholesale businesses. Cash Flow Deployment Options/Lack of Financial Targets WBA has shown a willingness to use cash and leverage to grow its business. Examples include its strategic investment in ABC and its announced merger with Rite Aid. Management has expressed support of partnerships and the need to reduce inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system. This mindset, coupled with management's lack of publicly stated financial targets, yields some risk with regard to the pace of debt paydown. Front-End Competition from Online Players WBA's enterprise front-end sales have been resilient to strengthened competition from discounters and online channels. Fitch believes this is due to low average ticket prices, WBA's convenience model, and purchase immediacy. However, online merchants, Amazon.com, Inc. in particular, continue to improve their business models and speed of delivery, which could affect WBA's higher-margin front-end sales in the future. Amazon.com's proposed purchase of Whole Foods Market, Inc. suggests the online retailer could be an increasing threat for share gains in some of WBA's categories like food consumables. DERIVATION SUMMARY WBA's 'BBB' rating incorporates the company's leading position in the growing drugstore category, which has proven to be resilient to discount and online competition. The rating also considers the company's ample FCF generation and balance sheet management. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Fitch expects 2.5%-3% sales growth at legacy WBA, driven by 4% U.S. pharmacy and 0%-1% U.S. front-end comps and low-single-digit growth in the company's international retail and wholesale businesses. Sales growth for the acquired Rite Aid stores could initially be somewhat negative given Rite Aid's current trajectory, but should improve to modestly positive if WBA is able to reverse the trend. --Standalone EBITDA, which was $9 billion in fiscal 2016, is expected to increase toward $10 billion over the next 36 months, primarily on sales growth. Margins are expected to be range-bound given ongoing reimbursement rate pressure. EBITDA of approximately $9.4 billion on a pro forma basis including the acquired Rite Aid stores could improve toward $10.5 billion over the 36 months following the close of the transaction on modest core growth and Rite Aid synergies. --FCF is projected to be around $4.5 billion on a pro forma basis, prior to merger-related expenses and restructuring charges. FCF is expected to increase toward $5 billion on Rite Aid synergies in the 36 months following the close of the acquisition. Pro forma leverage is expected to be around 3.3x and remain near this level, absent further investment opportunities. --Standalone FCF is projected to be around $4 billion annually beginning fiscal 2017, and could be used to resume WBA's share repurchase program while maintaining leverage in the low-3.0x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Persistently negative front-end comparable store sales or flattish prescription volume growth, indicating market share erosion; --Unsuccessful execution yielding flattish or modestly declining EBITDA from pro forma levels, driven by greater-than-expected gross margin declines on worsening reimbursement rates or weak implementation of merchandising/systems initiatives; --A debt-financed transaction which diminishes confidence in WBA's ability to sustain adjusted leverage below 3.5x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Given WBA's lack of stated targets with respect to financial leverage, an upgrade is unlikely due to the risk of a leveraging transaction. However, Fitch would view positively a public commitment to sustain leverage below 3x. LIQUIDITY At May 31, 2017, the company had $12.2 billion in cash and full availability on its revolvers. WBA had $19 billion of debt at May 31, 2017, of which approximately $6 billion was expected to finance the Rite Aid acquisition. Given the revised transaction terms, Fitch expects WBA to pay down debt in addition to the $3.5 billion of notes redeemed in June 2017. Year-end debt is expected to be in the $13 billion range, consisting primarily of unsecured notes. Fitch would expect to withdraw its ratings of redeemed debt upon repayment. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed WBA's ratings as follows: Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured revolver (as co-borrower) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loans at 'BBB'; --Unsecured bonds at 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Walgreen Co. --Unsecured revolver (as co-borrower) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loan (as co-borrower) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured bonds at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

161,WBA,Walgreens deal offers no lasting relief to Rite Aid,"(Reuters) - A slimmed-down Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) could lose much of its bargaining heft with insurers and makers of branded drugs at a time when it is trying to turn around its flagging pharmacy business, analysts said. Rite Aid said on Thursday it would sell nearly half its U.S. stores to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) after the drugstore operators agreed to scrap a whole-sale merger. Wall Street showed its displeasure at the new deal, pushing Rite Aid’s shares down 30 percent to a near four-year low after the announcement. The stock added to its losses, falling 7 percent on Friday. Rite Aid has been struggling with eroding profits in its pharmacy business, which sells prescription drugs, as increases in branded drug prices have slowed while reimbursement pressure for generics has intensified. “I think Rite Aid is going to struggle to remain relevant in the pharmacy industry,” said Adam Fein, president at Pembroke Consulting, which tracks the drug distribution industry. “The pharmacy industry has become hyper competitive and it favors either large teams or nimble independents, and Rite Aid is buck in the middle and doesn’t have geographic scale anywhere, except in the North East and the West Coast.” But it’s not all bad news for the company. Under the new deal, Rite Aid will gain access to Walgreen’s centralized sourcing system, allowing it to procure generic drugs at low costs for 10 years and giving its pharmacy margins a much-needed boost. Walgreens, the No. 1 drugstore chain in the country, has a sourcing contract with AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), the second-largest U.S. drug distributor, giving the alliance  bargaining clout against drugmakers. “We estimate more favorable generic procuring costs could provide 3-5 percent of saving on RAD’s total generic spend,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note. Still, being left with only half its stores will be punishing on economies of scale for Rite Aid, which is already struggling to turn a profit, said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Rite Aid on Thursday posted a much bigger quarterly loss, mainly because of a drop in same-store sales due to low reimbursement rates. This was the company’s third loss in the past five quarters. EBITDA margins for the company fell to an average of 3.4 percent in fiscal 2017 ended March 31, from 4.8 percent in 2013. In contrast, Walgreens’ EBITDA margins have averaged 7.3 percent on average for first three quarters of fiscal 2017, which ends in August, from 6.9 percent for the whole of 2013. Rite Aid, however, said the deal would make it a smaller but stronger company, helping it address pharmacy margin challenges and significantly cut its debt - over $7 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Selling roughly half its stores will leave Rite Aid more reliant on its pharmacy benefit management business, which maintains formularies, or preferred drugs lists, negotiates rebates with drugmakers, and processes prescription drug claims. “We think this will benefit RAD from a valuation perspective as we estimate that PBMs trade at a premium to drug retailers, by about a couple of turns in our view,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note. The smaller company could also be an attractive buyout target for a private equity firm or a rival such as Fred’s Inc (FRED.O), which was to buy some assets that would have been divested under the previously planned Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, analysts said.

169,WBA,Israel's Teva seeks partners for new drugs to relieve pressure,"JERUSALEM/LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) (TEVA.N) is looking to team up with other drugmakers to fund some of its development pipeline as it struggles with debts and expiring patents. “We are looking for partners ... a series of partners. It’s not to fund the whole pipeline, just some projects in it. A small part of it,” Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley told Reuters in an email on Wednesday.  Israel’s Teva needs extra financial firepower to develop new drugs and has few options left other than striking alliances with big pharma players, sources familiar with the company said. “Teva will avoid injecting any extra funding in new drugs,” one of the sources said. “They will partner with other big pharmas and share the proceeds.” Earlier this month the world’s largest generics drugmaker, which is facing price erosion in the United States, reported a steeper than expected drop in second-quarter earnings, slashed its dividend by 75 percent and cut its 2017 forecast. Teva is saddled with debts amounting to some $35 billion, mostly from financing its $40.5 billion purchase of Actavis — Allergan’s (AGN.N) generics business — last year. A loss of confidence in the company’s management have led to a nearly 50 percent drop in Teva’s shares since Aug. 3, while losses are about 75 percent since the start of 2016. Investors say Teva paid too much for Actavis, prompting Chief Executive Erz Vigodman’s resignation in February and his temporary replacement by Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg, while Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of June, again with only an interim stand-in. “People have lost faith in Teva not for what happened, but we don’t see where its going,” Eldad Tamir, head of the Tamir Fishman Investment House, said. In addition to seeking partners, Teva is responding by speeding up plans to divest non-core assets, the sources said, with long-term decisions including a possible break-up into two companies, generics and specialty drugs, only likely to be discussed after it fills its leadership vacuum. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have been asked to find buyers for Teva’s women’s health business and European oncology and pain unit, respectively.  Industry players including U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL.O), German healthcare group Fresenius (FMEG.DE) and Indian drug firm Intas Pharmaceuticals INTA.NS are all carrying out due diligence on the assets, which could be worth about $2 billion combined, the sources said. A source familiar with the divestments said that India’s Intas, which last year bought the generics business of Actavis in the UK and Ireland from Teva, is now bidding for specific assets within the women’s health unit, adding Teva is open to a break-up to speed up the sale. This means the business could be sold in two or three chunks with its U.S. and international operations being chopped and some products like contraceptive drugs Plan B and Paragard being carved out and sold separately, the sources said. The oncology business could also be broken up as industry players are mainly interested in pure cancer drugs while pain treatment medicine, which is being offered as part of the same deal, is seen as less attractive, the sources said. The prospect of a piecemeal deal has drawn interest from private equity funds including Advent and TPG, the sources said. Fresenius, Mylan and Advent declined to comment while Intas Advent and TPG were not immediately available for comment. Teva is also considering options for its respiratory treatments business as part of a review of its entire portfolio, the sources said. It recently decided to part ways with Iceland-based Medis, a supplier of development work to third-party drugmakers, which one source said could fetch about $500 million. Some banks have suggested a possible sale of PGT Healthcare, a consumer care products joint venture with Procter & Gamble (PG.N), but Teva’s spokeswoman Bradley said this remains core. Some shareholders have called on Teva to either split into two or sell off its generics business completely. Pressure is mounting on the U.S. generic drug industry because pharmacy groups, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O), are wielding more leverage when buying such drugs. “Teva should get out of generics. It means splitting the company of course, selling the generics in pieces and focusing on specialty drugs,” Benny Landa, an entrepreneur who in 2014 led an investor bid to shake up Teva’s board, said. Teva should become more like research-focused Novartis NOVM.S and its generics unit Sandoz, which are run as two separate firms, he added. But such changes could be slowed by Teva’s articles of association. These were designed to prevent a hostile takeover and include provisions that limit the number of board members to be replaced per year to a third of all seats. Teva’s problems also stem in large part from its specialty business. Its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone had contributed much of Teva’s revenue and profit, but its patent has run out and now is facing generic competition. Teva had no other drugs to take its place, although it has a pipeline of 21 specialty medicines for migraine, Huntington’s Disease, pain, respiratory and neurology in various stages of development, from early stage clinical trials to drugs already registered and awaiting regulatory approval.

174,WBA,Walgreens gets regulatory nod for slimmed-down Rite Aid deal,"(Reuters) - U.S. antitrust regulators have allowed a slimmed-down deal for drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) to buy about 42 percent of Rite Aid Corp’s (RAD.N) U.S. stores for $4.38 billion, Walgreens said on Tuesday. Walgreens will acquire 1,932 Rite Aid stores, 254 fewer than it announced in July, in areas where competition between the two chains is not significant. Rite Aid shares slid 9.3 percent at $2.48 while Walgreens was down 1.8 percent to $81.11. One member of the Federal Trade Commission was concerned that a smaller Rite Aid may be unable to compete against its larger rivals. The deal, which widens Walgreens’ footprint in the United States, began as an offer made in October 2015 to buy all of Rite Aid’s 4,600 stores. But Walgreens failed to win approval for that $9.4 billion deal and rejigged it. Walgreens operates stores under its own name as well as Boots stores in Britain and Duane Reade stores in the United States. Under the deal, Rite Aid has the option of joining Walgreens’ group purchasing agreement to negotiate discounts on generic drug prices. Walgreens said it will also buy Rite Aid’s three distribution centers in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Republican Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting chairman of the Federal Trade Commission which approved the deal, said a sharply smaller Rite Aid will still be able to effectively compete against Walgreens and the other big U.S. chain, CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). “Walgreens’ acquisition of Rite Aid stores in the revised transaction is limited to areas where competition between the two firms is not significant,” she said. Kroger (KR.N) and Wal-Mart (WMT.N) and other big supermarket chains and retailers also offer significant pharmacy services, she added.  Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat and the only other member of what should be a five-member commission, said she feared the deal “continues to raise significant competition issues.” “In particular, I am concerned that the transaction could reduce Rite Aid’s long-term ability to obtain low generic drug prices,” she said. Leerink analyst David Larsen said in a research note he was “pleasantly surprised” the deal was approved without lengthy scrutiny. One antitrust expert, Andre Barlow of law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, noted that Rite Aid was a smaller, No. 3 behind two behemoths. “Clearly a smaller chain doesn’t have the same leverage as a larger chain. But there is probably a legitimate concern that Rite Aid wasn’t an effective competitor prior to the acquisition,” he said. Walgreens said it does not expect the deal to have a significant impact on its adjusted earnings for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2018. Store purchases would begin in October and are expected to be completed in spring 2018.

Kroger (KR.N) and Wal-Mart (WMT.N) and other big supermarket chains and retailers also offer significant pharmacy services, she added.  Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat and the only other member of what should be a five-member commission, said she feared the deal “continues to raise significant competition issues.” “In particular, I am concerned that the transaction could reduce Rite Aid’s long-term ability to obtain low generic drug prices,” she said. Leerink analyst David Larsen said in a research note he was “pleasantly surprised” the deal was approved without lengthy scrutiny. One antitrust expert, Andre Barlow of law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, noted that Rite Aid was a smaller, No. 3 behind two behemoths. “Clearly a smaller chain doesn’t have the same leverage as a larger chain. But there is probably a legitimate concern that Rite Aid wasn’t an effective competitor prior to the acquisition,” he said. Walgreens said it does not expect the deal to have a significant impact on its adjusted earnings for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2018. Store purchases would begin in October and are expected to be completed in spring 2018.

179,WBA,UPDATE 1-Generic drugmaker Impax Labs in talks to merge with Amneal - WSJ,"(Reuters) - Impax Laboratories Inc IPXL.O is in talks to merge with privately held Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The generic drugmaker’s shares rose as much as 19.3 pct to $25.70, highest in nearly a year. Impax and Amneal are in talks that could yield a transaction next month, according to the WSJ report.  The merger talks come at a time when the largest U.S. retail pharmacies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O), are wielding more leverage when buying generic drugs, accelerating a decline in prices likely to affect drug companies for some time. The pressure is exacerbated as U.S. regulators push for the market entry of more generics to drive down branded drug prices otherwise spiraling out of control.     Reuters reported in March that Impax had asked investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it conduct a strategic review. Amneal and Impax, which had a market valuation of $1.60 billion as of Wednesday’s close, declined to comment.

180,WBA,REFILE-Rite Aid posts profit due to fees from failed Walgreens merger deal,"(Corrects spelling of earlier in second paragraph) Sept 28 (Reuters) - Drug store operator Rite Aid Corp reported a rise in quarterly net income on the back of a termination fee it got due to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s failed attempt to buy its smaller rival. Rite Aid’s net income rose to $170.7 million, or 16 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Sept. 2, from $14.8 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter includes a $325 million termination fee. Total revenue fell to $7.68 billion from $8.03 billion. Walgreens scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid outright in June after failing to win antitrust approval, and said it would instead buy nearly half of its smaller rival’s U.S. stores, which also failed to pass regulatory muster. Rite Aid finally got regulatory approval earlier this month to sell 1,932 stores to Walgreens for $4.38 billion.

184,WBA,Drug chains tumble on reports Amazon eyeing their pie,"(Reuters) - Shares of drug retailers Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O), CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) tumbled on Friday after reports that Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) was looking to make a move into selling drugs online. Amazon is reported to be in discussions with mid-market pharmacy benefit managers and has been hiring talent to assess the drug retailing market for its entry, brokerage firm Leerink analyst Ana Gupte wrote in a note to clients. “We are convinced that AMZN will almost certainly enter the drug distribution value chain within 2 years, evolving into a more disruptive offering over time,” Gupte said. Amazon’s entry into pharmaceuticals has been long rumored in the media. On Friday, CNBC reported that the e-commerce giant would decide before Thanksgiving whether to move into selling prescription drugs online, citing a company email and a source familiar with the matter. (cnb.cx/2hTIxvL) Amazon does not comment on rumors or speculation, a company spokeswoman said.

185,WBA,Walgreens beats profit estimates as new contracts provide boost,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s (WBA.O) quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates, as the company filled millions of more drug prescriptions thanks to newly won contracts from pharmacy benefit managers. Walgreens, which in June scrapped plans to buy fellow pharmacy company Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) after a two-year long wait for regulatory approval, has been under pressure from investors to grow drugstore sales faster. Big contracts from pharmacy benefit managers have helped allay some of those concerns and helped Walgreens boost revenue in its latest quarter. The company last year snatched a contract from larger rival CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) to fill prescriptions for Tricare, a Department of Defense healthcare program, and for customers of Prime Therapeutics, a Minnesota-based pharmacy benefit manager. Tricare brought about 9.7 million new members to Walgreens, while Prime Therapeutics added 22 million. Walgreens also formed a venture with Prime, called AllianceRX Walgreens Prime, to handle mail orders and specialty prescriptions for their combined customers. “The formation of AllianceRX Walgreens Prime is primarily responsible for driving up prescription volumes (for Walgreens) including mail and specialty,” Moody’s Vice President Mickey Chadha said via email. Sales at Walgreens’ U.S. pharmacies rose 12.6 percent in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, after the company filled 250.2 million prescriptions, up 9 percent from a year ago. Walgreens also said it would review its U.S. stores network, following its acquisition of nearly 2,000 Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) drugstores. The company expects the review to bring savings of about $300 million each year through 2020. Still, Walgreens also expects to spend $750 million on acquisition costs and another $500 million on store conversions and refurbishing. The impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, where Walgreens is the largest drugstore chain, would reduce current-quarter profit by $90 million, the company said on a call with analysts. Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens also said it expects 2018 adjusted earnings of $5.40 to $5.70 per share. The forecast was largely above analysts’ average estimate of $5.47, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5.3 percent to $30.15 billion in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ expectations of $29.93 billion. Net income attributable to Walgreens fell 22 percent to $802 million, hurt mainly by the $325 million termination fee it paid Rite Aid after their failed merger. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.31 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.21. Walgreens’ shares were slightly lower at $67.20 in morning trading.

189,WBA,UPDATE 3-Wal-Mart tie-up helps McKesson top profit estimates,"(Reuters) - McKesson Corp (MCK.N), the biggest U.S. drug distributor, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit after a tie-up with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) helped it buy generic drugs at lower prices, sending its shares up nearly 6 percent on Thursday. The results come as the industry is coping with a slump in generic drug pricing and a slowdown in the pace of price hikes for branded drugs, with rumors of Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) entry into the supply chain adding to anxieties. McKesson does not take the entry of any competitor in the drug supply chain lightly, Chief Executive John Hammergren said, drawing similarities between the company and Amazon, especially in terms of logistics. “To some extent, we were Amazon before it was cool to be Amazon,” Hammergren said on a conference call. McKesson and Wal-Mart came together in 2016 to exert their combined negotiating power when buying generic drugs, a tactic also followed by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and other large U.S. retail pharmacies. “We’re purchasing pharmaceuticals at lower prices than we’d expected when we first put the plan together,” McKesson Chief Financial Officer James Beer said. Stubbornly low prices for generic drugs have weighed on the market for copycat drugs and U.S. health regulators’ move to speed up approval of more such drugs is only going to increase the pressure. The alliances between major U.S. retail pharmacies and U.S. drug distributors have allowed wholesalers such as McKesson to avail large discounts on buying generic drugs. ClarusONE, the entity formed by McKesson and Wal-Mart’s tie-up, “is a positive operation for McKesson for sure,” Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj said. With the pace of price increases for branded drugs unlikely to bounce back in the next few years, analysts expect drug distributors will continue to face pressure on their margins. McKesson said its latest second quarter got a boost as some revenue related to branded drugs was recorded in the period, rather than the current third quarter. The company’s revenue rose 4 percent to $52.06 billion in the second quarter. Profit plunged to $1 million, from $307 million, due to goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charges as well as restructuring costs. Excluding such items, McKesson earned $3.28 per share, sailing past analysts average estimate of $2.80, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. McKesson’s shares were up 5.8 percent at $160.12. Rivals AmerisourceBergen (ABC.N) rose 3.8 percent and Cardinal Health (CAH.N) 2.6 percent.

191,WBA,FTC judge rules against 1-800 Contacts on antitrust charges,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Federal Trade Commission judge has ruled against the online seller 1-800 Contacts, which the agency accused of hammering out deals with rivals that made it harder for consumers to comparison shop, the agency said on Monday. The FTC accused the company of reaching agreements with 14 other online contact lens retailers which required the companies to refrain from advertising to consumers who had searched online for 1-800 Contacts. 1-800 Contacts, in exchange, agreed to not advertise to people who searched for the rivals’ names. The agreements hampered price-conscious consumers from finding rival contact lens sellers and checking their costs, the ruling said. “The evidence in this case demonstrates that the advertising restraints imposed by the challenged agreements cause harm to consumers and competition in the market for the sale of contact lenses online,” wrote Michael Chappell, the FTC administrative law judge who heard the case. The decision was reached on Oct. 20 but withheld until Monday in order to make redactions. Chappell ordered 1-800 Contacts to end the practice of reaching agreements that limit the advertisements of rivals. 1-800 Contacts General Counsel Cindy Williams said she was disappointed in the initial ruling and the company would appeal to the commission. “Nothing in the initial ruling, however, changes our view that the settlement agreements are lawful and procompetitive and that the company will ultimately prevail once the administrative process runs its course,” she said. The deals were reached with Vision Direct, which is owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc; Luxottica Group SpA, which owns LensCrafters and Pearle Vision; and National Vision, among others, according to Chappell’s initial decision. AEA Investors LP is a major owner of 1-800 Contacts.  The online retailer is the world’s largest contact lens store, according to its website. It also has about 50 percent of the market for online sales of contact lenses, according to the FTC complaint filed in the case.

198,WBA,Fitch Downgrades GNC to 'B-' After Withdrawal of Refinancing Proposal; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded GNC Holdings, Inc.'s IDR to 'B-' from 'B' on increased refinancing risk following the announced withdrawal of its proposed refinancing offering. The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's reduced confidence in GNC's ability to address upcoming maturities ($300 million revolver due September 2018 and $1.1 billion term loan maturity in March 2019) given the termination of its current refinancing process. The inability of GNC to successfully address its upcoming maturities in a timely fashion would be a rating concern. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The ratings continue to reflect GNC's leading position in the growing health and wellness products market. The ratings consider recent market share declines, driven by encroaching competition and executional missteps, which in concert with recent financial policy decisions, have weakened the company's leverage profile. However, the ratings also reflect steps the company has made to reverse operational declines and reduce leverage, through diverting FCF towards debt paydown and suspending dividends and share buybacks. Fitch expects total revenue to remain fairly stable in the $2.5 billion range between 2016 and 2020 and EBITDA is expected to trough in the mid-$200 million range in 2017, versus $350 million in 2016 and the average $500 million range between 2012 and 2015. EBITDA is expected to improve to the $300 million to $325 million range by 2019/2020 on modest top line growth and gross margin expansion as a result of store closings leading to reduced occupancy costs and merchandise margin stabilization. KEY RATING DRIVERS Unsuccessful Refinancing: GNC published a press release on Dec. 4, 2017 announcing the withdrawal of its proposed refinancing. This announcement comes after proposals to refinance its capital structure on Nov. 8, 2017 and a second on Nov. 27, 2017. Both failed to materialize given evolving market conditions and demand. The company also announced its engagement with Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC to explore strategic alternatives and optimize its capital structure. Fitch views GNC's inability to refinance as a rating concern since the company faces greater urgency in addressing a $300 million revolver due September 2018 and a $1.1 billion term loan maturity in March 2019. While the company could generate some liquidity through asset sales (such as distribution centers) or increased refranchising activity, Fitch projects the company will need to refinance a significant portion of upcoming maturities; as such, its inability to successfully complete its proposed refinancing suggests the possibility the company may need to effect a distressed debt exchange or restructuring. Good Position in a Growing Category: GNC is a leading U.S. retailer and manufacturer (with around 6% share) of health and wellness products, including vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements (VMHS), and sports nutrition and diet products. Historically, the company has benefited from stable growth in the VMHS industry, brand leadership, and its broad store footprint and brand presence in the U.S. and internationally. The company has 9,083 stores globally as of September 2017 and manufactures product sold in retailers across the food, drug, and discount category. The company has outsized presence at Rite Aid Corporation stores through a partnership and a storefront on Amazon.com. Overall online sales penetration is around 10%, in line with industry averages. GNC's brand leadership is evident with nearly half of consolidated revenue derived from owned-brand product. The approximately $40 billion VMHS industry has proven to be recession resistant by growing at a mid-single digit rate through economic cycles. The consumable nature of the products and high frequency of usage as part of regular dietary regimens drive the stability and defensibility of the business. Given an aging U.S. population and increased consumer focus on personal health and wellness, Fitch expects the VMHS industry to continue mid-single digit growth over the next several years, making it one of the faster growing segments within retail. Historically, the standalone vitamin retail business has been resilient to channel disruption from discount and online players for several reasons. First, inventory breadth in the category is significant, which is an unappealing characteristic for discount players that prefer a focused, high-turning inventory mix. Second, the nature of the industry's product requires an elevated service component. GNC, whose service model provides product and regimen guidance to less knowledgeable customers, has benefited from this information asymmetry. Finally, loyalty programs have proven effective for standalone players to maintain share in the space, with GNC's (now-replaced) Gold Card discount program generating nearly 80% of company sales. Recent Weakness: Despite good historical fundamentals, GNC's operating trajectory turned in 2014, with sales declining from a peak of $2.6 billion in 2013 to an expected $2.5 billion in 2017, while EBITDA has been halved from around $530 million in 2013 to an expected $260 million in 2017. While the category has continued its growth trajectory, the alternate channels appear to be taking share from standalone players such as GNC. The proliferation of vitamin-related information online coupled with an increased vitamin focus by a number of competitors in the discount, grocery, drug retail and online spaces have limited GNC's competitive advantage in recent years. Fitch believes GNC was also impacted by operational missteps in recent years. The company's marketing and merchandising efforts have historically appealed to sports-related products such as muscle-gain proteins, while industry growth has focused more around natural/organic supplements, particularly for the growing baby boomer population. In addition, while the company's Gold Card loyalty program was a historical advantage, the loyalty scheme more recently created price confusion amongst consumers who increasingly value price transparency. The pricing structure was also misaligned in the company's stores relative to its online channel, where products were heavily discounted. EBITDA declines in recent years have outpaced revenue moderation due to the deleveraging impact on fixed expenses such as rent and store payroll as well as the company's decisions to maintain investments in marketing and product innovation. More recently, margins have declined due to the company's concerted efforts to reduce prices in an increasingly competitive environment and to align pricing across its channels and simplify its pricing model for loyalty card customers. EBITDA erosion has caused the company's leverage profile to weaken, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR forecasted to rise from the mid-4.0x range in 2013 to around 7.0x in 2017. This increase was exacerbated by the company's decision to execute debt-financed share buybacks in 2015 and 1H 2016. Outstanding debt balances increased around $300 million from the beginning of 2015 until the company ceased share buybacks in mid-2016. EBITDA Expected to Trough in 2017: Over the past 18 months, GNC has implemented a number of strategic changes which could stabilize results while improving the company's leverage profile. The company has reduced prices to be more competitive and aligned price points across channels to reduce customer confusion. GNC replaced its existing loyalty program, where a paid membership provided ongoing product discounts. The new loyalty program includes both a free tier where customers can earn rewards based on spending, and a paid tier with additional benefits. The goal of the new free tier is to drive higher program enrollees while improving ongoing product margins. Research and development investments have been geared toward enhanced product innovation to drive customer excitement and brand differentiation. Sales staff re-training is designed to fortify the company's ability to effectively counsel and advise customers. GNC's efforts have shown some key signs of improvement, with average transactions improving from negative in 2015-2016 to up over 10% through the first three quarters of 2017 and positive enrollment trends for the company's new loyalty program (nine million members in the free tier and 600,000 members in the paid tier as of October 2017). Comparable store sales (comps) were 1.3% in 3Q 2017, the company's first positive comp since 4Q 2015, and are expected to be positive in 4Q and annually beginning 2018. While sales have shown some evidence of stabilization, GNC's initiatives have had a negative impact on EBITDA. Price reductions have reduced gross margin by over 200 bps to 33% through the first three quarters of 2017, while the elimination of the paid loyalty program has caused significant declines in high-margin membership fee revenue. EBITDA, which was $350 million in 2016, could decline to around $260 million in 2017, with quarterly declines YTD through 3Q but flattish EBITDA in 4Q. Despite recent trends and increased competition from alternate channels, Fitch believes there is long-term viability in the standalone vitamin retail space and that GNC's size, positive free cash flow (FCF) generation, brand recognition and vertical manufacturing capabilities are assets that could allow it to defend share longer-term should its recently enacted strategies be successful. As the company laps significant changes made in 2017, the continuation of modestly comps could yield EBITDA trending above the $300 million level over the next three years. New Financial Policy and FCF Supports Deleveraging: As GNC undertakes these initiatives, the company has also made significant changes to its cash deployment strategies. Over the past 18 months, the company has eliminated both its dividend and share buyback program, and redirected its FCF to debt paydown, repaying nearly $200 million of debt from 2Q 2016 through 3Q 2017. The company's net leverage target of 3x, capitalizing leases at 5x, equates to 4x Fitch-defined leverage (capitalizing leases at 8x) assuming minimal cash balances for both calculations. Assuming the company successfully completes the refinancing of its upcoming maturities and continues to direct FCF toward debt paydown in concert with its stated financial policy, leverage could approach mid-5.0x in 2020 based on around $200 million of FCF in 2017 and $100 million in FCF annually beginning 2018. RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS Current Recovery Considerations: Fitch's recovery analysis is based on a going concern value of $1.25 billion, versus approximately $630 million from an orderly liquidation of assets, which are composed primarily of inventory, receivables and owned property and equipment. Post-default EBITDA was estimated at $250 million, similar to the company's trailing 12 month EBITDA. Fitch believes current operating results represent a potential post-bankruptcy scenario following an approximately 50% decline in EBITDA over the past three years. The analysis uses a 5.0x enterprise value/EBITDA multiple, consistent with the 5.4x median multiple for retail going concern reorganization but at the low end of the 12-year retail market multiples of 5x to 11x, and below 7x-12x for retail transaction multiples. The multiple considers GNC's historically strong position in a good category, recent competitive encroachment by alternate channels and operational missteps. After deducting 10% for administrative claims, the remaining $1.125 billion would lead to superior recovery prospects (71%-90%) for the company's credit facility which is therefore rated 'B+/RR2'. DERIVATION SUMMARY The downgrade of GNCs IDR to 'B-' from 'B' reflects increased refinancing risk following the company's withdrawal of its proposed term loan refinancing. The ratings continue to reflect GNC's leading position in the growing health and wellness products market. The rating considers recent market share declines, driven by encroaching competition and executional missteps, which in concert with recent financial policy decisions, have weakened the company's leverage profile. However, the rating also reflects steps the company has made to reverse operational declines and reduce leverage, through diverting FCF towards debt paydown and suspending dividends and share buybacks. Other retailers within the 'B' category including SUPERVALU Inc. (B/Stable) and Rite Aid Corporation (B/Stable). SUPERVALU is a secularly challenged grocery retailer and wholesale grocery operator, with leverage around 4.0x. Rite Aid Corporation (B/Stable) is a drug retailer whose recent market share losses raise questions around EBITDA stabilization prospects. Its pro forma leverage following the sale of assets to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is projected to trend around 7.0x. The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's reduced confidence in GNC's ability to successfully address upcoming maturities without a distressed debt exchange or restructuring, given the termination of its refinancing process. The company's revolver matures in September 2018, followed by a significant maturity wall of $1.13 billion in March 2019, which the company needs to address. The company would need to deal with these upcoming maturities in a timely manner, while also meeting operating base case assumptions, to stabilize the Negative Outlook. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Fitch expects total revenue to remain fairly stable in the $2.5 billion range between 2016 and 2020. Revenue is expected to decline 3% in 2017 and decline 1% in 2018 due to store closings before turning modestly positive in the low single digit range. Same store sales are expected to be flat in 2017 given second half improvement and grow in the low single digit range in 2018-2020. --EBITDA is expected to trough in the mid-$200 million range in 2017, versus $350 million in 2016 and the average $500 million range between 2012 and 2015. EBITDA is expected to improve to the $300 million to $325 million range by 2019/2020 on modest top line growth and gross margin expansion as a result of store closings leading to reduced occupancy costs and merchandise margin stabilization. --FCF is expected to be $200 million in 2017, partly driven by working capital improvement of $75 million, and $100 million annually thereafter, assuming interest expense could increase resulting from a refinancing of the company's term loan. GNC has suspended both its dividend and share buybacks. Fitch would expect the company to use FCF towards debt paydown, in line with its public guidance. --Adjusted leverage (capitalizing rent expense at 8x) is projected at 7x for 2017, versus the 4.5x-5x range in 2013-2015, but is expected to trend towards the mid-5x by 2020 based on EBITDA growth and debt reduction. This assumes the successful refinancing of its entire capital structure. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Stabilization of the outlook would occur if the company successfully addresses all its maturities and shows signs of stabilization in its business. --An upgrade to 'B' could occur if the company successfully addresses all its maturities and shows signs of improvement in sales and EBITDA such that leverage starts trending towards 6x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A downgrade would occur if the company is unable to successfully address upcoming debt maturities in a timely fashion. LIQUIDITY GNC's total liquidity as of Sept. 30, 2017 was $286 million, which includes $40 million in cash and $246 in availability on the company's $300 million revolver. Revolver availability was reduced by $48 million in borrowings and $5.9 million in letters of credit. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded GNC as follows: GNC Holdings, Inc. --Long-Term IDR to 'B-' from 'B'. General Nutrition Centers, Inc. --Long-Term IDR to 'B-' from 'B'; Fitch has assigned the following ratings to GNC: --Senior secured credit facility 'B+'/'RR2'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

199,WBA,"CVS likely wants FTC antitrust review, not Justice Dept, of Aetna deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It is uncertain who in the U.S. government will carry out an antitrust review of CVS Health Corp’s (CVS.N) deal to buy health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), but the drugstore company is likely hoping the potentially more lenient Federal Trade Commission gets the nod, antitrust experts say.  The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission share the job of reviewing mergers to make sure they don’t hurt consumers, but sometimes it comes down to a coin toss as to who reviews a deal that involves both agencies’ areas of expertise.  The Justice Department might be best-placed since it recently reviewed, and stopped, two insurance industry tie-ups, including Aetna’s plan to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N).  Meanwhile, the FTC also has highly-relevant expertise, considering it reviewed CVS’s purchase of Target’s (TGT.N) pharmacy business in 2015 as well as another big pharmacy deal, Walgreens’ (WBA.O) purchase of much of Rite Aid (RAD.N) this year.     “If I were the parties, I would try to steer it to the FTC,” said Fiona Schaeffer of the law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy. She described CVS’s plan to buy Aetna as “eminently approvable” by either agency because critics would be unable to come up with a convincing theory to show the deal will harm consumers. The issue will likely be resolved in clearance discussions held almost immediately after the companies officially inform enforcers about the deal. In the meeting, both sides will consider each agency’s expertise in the industry in question as well as resource constraints. Which agency gets the deal may also be left to chance. “It tends it goes to a coin toss via a computer program if they (agency officials) can’t work it out,” said one expert, who asked not to be named to protect business relationships. Antitrust experts said that the companies likely hope the Justice Department loses that coin toss. After decades of allowing vertical deals like the CVS/Aetna tie-up, where a company merges with a supplier, the Justice Department just sued to stop AT&T; (T.N), owner of DirecTV, from buying Time Warner (TWX.N), in late November. In general, antitrust experts say, the antitrust agencies tend to approve vertical deals because of the efficiencies inherent in buying a supplier. The big exception - and this is the situation in AT&T;’s deal for Time Warner - is if there is a fear that AT&T;’s rivals would lose critical access to Time-Warner products like HBO or CNN. Unlike the Justice Department, the FTC has shown no apparent interest in suing to stop a vertical deal. The agency is chaired by Maureen Ohlhausen, a moderate Republican, who will be replaced by Joe Simons, another moderate Republican, as soon as the Senate confirms him.  It would be a surprise for moderate Republicans to file a lawsuit to stop a vertical merger, according to six antitrust experts. That said, two antitrust experts said they believed the Justice Department could try to stop this transaction for fear that customers would either face higher drug prices or have less choice. “Events of the past three weeks suggest that (Justice Department’s top antitrust enforcer) Makan (Delrahim) might sue to challenge this deal,” said Chris Sagers, who teaches antitrust at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.

200,WBA,Fred's shares hit 18-year low after company pulls dividend,"(Reuters) - Discount store operator Fred’s Inc (FRED.O) said on Wednesday it had canceled its quarterly cash dividend and was exploring alternatives for some of its assets, sending its shares plunging 25 percent to their lowest in more than 18 years. Fred’s in June was forced to abandon its offer to acquire 1,200 Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) stores after Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid following antitrust concerns. Walgreens later agreed to buy some of Rite Aid stores.  Fred’s, which operates about 600 general merchandise and pharmacy stores in the United States, has cut costs, shut underperforming stores and introduced beverages such as beer and wine to attract customers to its stores. But on Wednesday, the company reported its sixth straight decline in quarterly sales and a bigger loss.  “I think that if we do nothing, we run the risk of being irrelevant in the space,” Timothy Liebmann, chief operating officer of pharmacy at Fred’s, said on a conference call. Drugstore operators are also under pressure from the growing possibility of ecommerce giant Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) entry into the business. Fred’s, however, said its decision to evaluate alternatives for its non-core assets, including real estate and specialty pharmacy business, was not a response to a third party proposal. The company’s shares were down 21 percent at $3.99 in late morning trading on Wednesday. They have lost nearly 60 percent of their value since the failed Rite Aid deal.

208,WBA,"Walgreens' weak retail sales, gross margins hit shares","(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) on Thursday reported its sixth straight fall in retail same-store sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 along with a drop in gross margins in its U.S. business, sending its shares down as much as 6.3 percent. The biggest U.S. drugstore chain’s stock fell to $70.73, recording its biggest intraday percentage loss in more than two years. Same-store sales in its front-end outlets through which the company sells over-the-counter drugs and general merchandise fell 0.9 percent, hurt by weak demand for consumables and personal care products. Comparable pharmacy sales rose 7.4 percent, but higher sales of low-cost generic drugs and their lower reimbursement rates hit margins. Gross margins in its Retail Pharmacy USA business, which includes front-end stores and pharmacies, fell to 24.9 percent from 26.3 percent, a year earlier. The weakness in sales at its retail stores has raised doubts about its degree of success from its move to add 1,932 Rite Aid stores to its store base within the next three years.      “From our perspective, it may take at least a handful of years before Walgreens is able to fully benefit from the acquisition,” Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj wrote in a note. Walgreens, unlike its rival CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), did not detail the impact of the recent tax overhaul on its business.  On Thursday, CVS shares rose as much as 4 percent after it said cash flows would get a $1.2 billion boost from the new  U.S. tax code that would see corporate tax rates slashed to 21 percent from 35 percent.    Net income attributable to Walgreens fell to $821 million, or 81 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Nov.30, from $1.05 billion, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier.  An impairment charge related to its investment in Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals [GZPHA.UL] hurt profits, the company said.  On an adjusted basis, the drugstore chain earned $1.28 per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $1.26 per share. Net sales rose 7.9 pct to $30.74 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a revenue of $30.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

215,WBA,Amerisource deal may not keep Walgreens competitive: analysts,"(Reuters) - Walgreens’ potential deal for drug distributor AmerisourceBergen will boost its cash flow and push it deeper into a lucrative specialty pharmacy market, but may fail to keep it competitive in an evolving U.S. healthcare sector, analysts said. A deal would not be a surprise, but analysts noted that it might cost Walgreens Boots Alliance opportunities down the line as the company tries to keep pace with rival CVS Health Corp, which is set to buy health insurer Aetna Inc, and possibly go up against Amazon.com. AmerisourceBergen shares were up 8.7 percent in midday trading, while Walgreens shares were little changed. “This purported deal wouldn’t be shocking ... but we’re currently struggling to see the strategic allure of the combination for Walgreens,” Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said. While the CVS-Aetna deal is expected to create a consumer healthcare giant that will only widen CVS’ formidable reach, Walgreens will get no such lift if it buys AmerisourceBergen, in which it holds a 26 percent stake, analysts said. However, any Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen deal would give Walgreens a bigger presence in the specialty pharmacy space, where it does not have adequate exposure, setting it up to compete better against CVS and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. “As the broader healthcare sector focuses more on moving specialty drug administration out of facility-based (hospital/physician’s office) settings, gaining a strong foothold in specialty through ABC could be a valuable strategic move,” Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said. AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens have a 10-year deal, struck in 2013, that allows the drug distributor to buy drugs for Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore operator. The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal on Monday, but said talks were in early stages. “This deal has probably been brewing longer than they’re letting on ... unlike CVS-Aetna, there are more immediate margin and synergy opportunities,” said Brad Haller, M&A; director at West Monroe Partners. He, however, added that those cost savings may not be immediately achievable because Walgreens is already knee-deep in completing post-merger integrations with Boots Alliance and Rite-Aid. “Adding on another large-scale integration would be difficult,” he said. Walgreens bought Alliance Boots in 2014 and said last year it would buy nearly 2,000 Rite-Aid stores. A potential Walgreens deal comes as the U.S. healthcare landscape remains in a state of flux, with changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act, escalating drug prices and Amazon’s possible entry. Analysts have long speculated that Amazon is likely to disrupt healthcare with deals with drug distributors, insurers or hospitals. Amazon Business, the company’s business-to-business marketplace already sells professional medical products and hospital consumables such as gloves.  Amazon plans to expand the business, the WSJ reported on Tuesday, and recently dispatched employees to a large Midwestern hospital system, where hospital officials are testing whether they can use Amazon Business to order health-care supplies.  The news pushed down shares of dental supply companies Henry Schein Inc and Patterson Cos Inc. Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and Cardinal Health were lower as well.

Amazon.com rose 1.9 percent while Apple added 0.73 percent, both helping the S&P; 500 shake off a negative open to the session and climb 0.13 percent in afternoon trade. Investors said upcoming data on U.S. consumer prices and retail sales due out on Wednesday would be key to where stocks move in the short term. Inflation and interest-rate fears sparked a stock market rout after U.S. jobs data on Feb. 2. Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the market’s mid-day recovery was a good sign, but that it was too soon to predict the market’s recovery. “We think we’re going to be volatile for a few more trading days at least, as the market sorts out what’s really been going on,” Haworth said. Among the biggest movers was sportswear retailer Under Armour, up more than 17 percent on strong quarterly sales, and AmerisourceBergen, up 8 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens was seeking to buy out the drug distributor. Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects. After a wildly volatile week that pushed the market into correction territory, U.S. stocks gained roughly 3 percent over Friday and Monday, their best two-day gain since June 2016. At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 percent at 24,625.71 points, while the S&P; 500 had gained 3.7 points to 2,660.54. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.33 percent to 7,004.71. Eight of the 11 major S&P; indexes rose, led by consumer staples, up 0.45 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dipped to 2.842 percent, shy of a four-year peak of 2.9020 percent hit on Monday. The CBOE Volatility Index, a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility and seen as a contributing factor itself to the selloff, was last at 25.31 points, half the 50-point mark it touched last week. Wall Street’s recent pullback wiped out all of January’s gains for the benchmark S&P; 500, which is now down about 0.5 percent for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 1.4 percent in 2018. On a day of heavy trading in healthcare companies, Henry Schein and Patterson Companies fell 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively, after news of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint against the dental supply firms. Investors in those and other healthcare distributors are weighing the possible ramifications of the AmerisourceBergen deal and a report of Amazon’s push into the space.

Strong U.S. consumer price and retail sales data on Wednesday would fan fears over rising inflation and the pace of interest rate rises - the same worries that sparked a stock market rout after U.S. jobs data on Feb. 2. Among the biggest movers were sportswear retailer Under Armour, up more than 15 percent on strong quarterly sales, and AmerisourceBergen, up 8 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens was seeking to buy out the drug distributor. “Investors are probably positioning with a bit of a risk-off mindset going into those two (economic data reports) tomorrow,” said Matt Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments. “The core CPI estimate is a modest decrease from last month. But in the event that inflation does accelerate, that could lead volatility to continue as the Goldilocks environment may be under further pressure.” Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects.

Ten of the 11 major S&P; indexes were lower, led by losses in the technology and healthcare indexes. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering at 2.8439 percent, shy of a four-year peak of 2.9020 percent hit on Monday. The CBOE Volatility Index, a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility and seen as a contributing factor itself to the selloff, was last trading at 26.39 points, half the 50-point mark it touched last week. The recent pullback wiped out all of January’s gains for the benchmark S&P; 500 and the blue-chip Dow, both now down more than 1 percent for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still clinging to a 0.87 percent gain for the year. On a day of heavy trading in healthcare companies, Henry Schein and Patterson Companies fell 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively, after news of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint against the dental supply firms. Their losses were the biggest among healthcare distributors weighing up the possible ramifications of the AmerisourceBergen deal and a report of Amazon’s push into the space.

218,WBA,UPDATE 1-Amerisource deal may not keep Walgreens competitive - analysts,"(Reuters) - Walgreens’ potential deal for drug distributor AmerisourceBergen will boost its cash flow and push it deeper into a lucrative specialty pharmacy market, but may fail to keep it competitive in an evolving U.S. healthcare sector, analysts said. A deal would not be a surprise, but analysts noted that it might cost Walgreens Boots Alliance opportunities down the line as the company tries to keep pace with rival CVS Health Corp, which is set to buy health insurer Aetna Inc, and possibly go up against Amazon.com. AmerisourceBergen shares were up 8.7 percent in midday trading, while Walgreens shares were little changed. “This purported deal wouldn’t be shocking ... but we’re currently struggling to see the strategic allure of the combination for Walgreens,” Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said. While the CVS-Aetna deal is expected to create a consumer healthcare giant that will only widen CVS’ formidable reach, Walgreens will get no such lift if it buys AmerisourceBergen, in which it holds a 26 percent stake, analysts said. However, any Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen deal would give Walgreens a bigger presence in the specialty pharmacy space, where it does not have adequate exposure, setting it up to compete better against CVS and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. “As the broader healthcare sector focuses more on moving specialty drug administration out of facility-based (hospital/physician’s office) settings, gaining a strong foothold in specialty through ABC could be a valuable strategic move,” Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said. AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens have a 10-year deal, struck in 2013, that allows the drug distributor to buy drugs for Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore operator. The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal on Monday, but said talks were in early stages. “This deal has probably been brewing longer than they’re letting on ... unlike CVS-Aetna, there are more immediate margin and synergy opportunities,” said Brad Haller, M&A; director at West Monroe Partners. He, however, added that those cost savings may not be immediately achievable because Walgreens is already knee-deep in completing post-merger integrations with Boots Alliance and Rite-Aid. “Adding on another large-scale integration would be difficult,” he said. Walgreens bought Alliance Boots in 2014 and said last year it would buy nearly 2,000 Rite-Aid stores. A potential Walgreens deal comes as the U.S. healthcare landscape remains in a state of flux, with changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act, escalating drug prices and Amazon’s possible entry. Analysts have long speculated that Amazon is likely to disrupt healthcare with deals with drug distributors, insurers or hospitals. Amazon Business, the company’s business-to-business marketplace already sells professional medical products and hospital consumables such as gloves.  Amazon plans to expand the business, the WSJ reported on Tuesday, and recently dispatched employees to a large Midwestern hospital system, where hospital officials are testing whether they can use Amazon Business to order health-care supplies.  The news pushed down shares of dental supply companies Henry Schein Inc and Patterson Cos Inc. Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and Cardinal Health were lower as well.

219,WBA,US STOCKS-Wall Street drops as caution sets in ahead of inflation data,"* Indexes down: Dow 0.39 pct, S&P; 0.33 pct, Nasdaq 0.09 pct * U.S. consumer prices and retail sales data due Wednesday * Market rout not impacting economic outlook - Fed’s Mester * Under Armour climbs after posting upbeat revenue * AmerisourceBergen jumps on report of takeover approach (Changes comment, updates price, adds details) By Sruthi Shankar Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes fell for the first time in three sessions on Tuesday as caution crept in ahead of crucial data on inflation, a root cause of the recent sell-off. A strong reading on U.S. consumer price and retail sales data on Wednesday could fan fears over rising inflation and faster interest rate hikes - the same worries that sparked the sell-off after strong jobs data on Feb. 2. “Investors are probably positioning with a bit of a risk-off mindset going into those two (economic data reports) tomorrow,” said Matt Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments. “The core CPI estimate is a modest decrease from last month. But in the event that inflation does accelerate, that could lead volatility to continue as the Goldilocks environment maybe under further pressure.” Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects. After a wildly volatile week that pushed the market into correction territory, U.S. stocks gained roughly 3 percent over Friday and Monday, their best two-day gains since June 2016. By 11:09 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 96.29 points, or 0.39 percent, at 24,504.98, the S&P; 500 was down 8.64 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,647.36 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 6.63 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,975.34. Nine of the 11 major S&P; indexes were lower, led by losses in the healthcare and financial indexes. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering at 2.8439 percent, shy of their four-year peak of 2.9020 percent on Monday. The CBOE Volatility Index, a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility, eased to near session-lows at 25.51, and well short of the 50-point mark it touched last week. The recent pullback has wiped out all of the year’s gains for the benchmark S&P; 500 and the blue-chip Dow, which are now down about 0.7 percent so far in 2018. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was still clinging to a 1.22 percent gain for the year. Of the 70 percent of the S&P; 500 companies that have reported earnings, nearly 78 percent of them topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent average beat-rate in the past four quarters. Shares of Under Armour rose more than 18 percent after the sportswear maker reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts’ estimates. AmerisourceBergen jumped about 8 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens made a takeover approach for the drug distributor. Walgreens rose marginally. Henry Schein and Patterson Companies fell 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively, after a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint against the dental supply companies. Their losses were the biggest among healthcare distributors weighing up the possible ramifications of the AmerisourceBergen deal and a report of Amazon’s push into the space. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,527 to 1,240. On the Nasdaq, 1,352 issues fell and 1,346 advanced.

221,WBA,Walgreens bid for AmerisourceBergen would be a head-scratcher - analysts,"Feb 13 (Reuters) - Walgreens’ potential move to buy a drug distributor in which it already has a 26 percent stake has some analysts questioning the logic and wondering if it would be enough to compete in an evolving U.S. healthcare sector. Analysts said any deal would not be a surprise, but might cost Walgreens opportunities down the line as the company tries to keep pace with rival CVS Health Corp, which is set to buy health insurer Aetna Inc, and an impending threat from Amazon.com. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, the largest U.S. drugstore operator, has made a takeover approach to AmerisourceBergen Corp, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, but said the talks were in early stages. AmerisourceBergen shares were up 12 percent in early trading, while Walgreens shares were up 1.4 percent. Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and Cardinal Health were lower. “This purported deal wouldn’t be shocking ... but we’re currently struggling to see the strategic allure of the combination for Walgreens,” Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a note. The two companies are already closely allied, having struck a 10-year deal in 2013 for AmerisourceBergen to buy drugs for Walgreens, which subsequently acquired 26 percent of the distributor. The rationale for such a deal is a bit of a head-scratcher as Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen already have a joint venture that affords both the strategic value that combining would provide, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said. The news comes as the U.S. healthcare landscape remains in a state of flux, with changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act escalating drug prices and Amazon’s possible entry. Walgreens has highlighted that it tends to prefer partnerships, which analysts say could eventually turn into acquisitions. A deal, however, would give Walgreens a bigger presence in the specialty pharmacy space, where it does not have adequate exposure, setting it up to compete better against CVS and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. “As the broader healthcare sector focuses more on moving specialty drug administration out of facility-based (hospital/physician’s office) settings, gaining a strong foothold in specialty through ABC could be a valuable strategic move,” Tanquilut said.

By 8:35 a.m. ET (1335 GMT), Dow e-minis were down 122 points, S&P; 500 e-minis were down 11.25 points, Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 32.75 points. The major indexes gained roughly 3 percent over the past two trading sessions, their best such period since June 2016 and after finishing last week with their worst performance in two years. “We saw an impressive rebound yesterday, but by no means are we in the clear,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects. She said inflation should gradually rise this year to the central bank’s two-percent target, but not at a rate that requires a faster reaction from the Federal Reserve in terms of raising interest rates. The next reading on inflation, will come with consumer prices data on Wednesday. A strong number could stoke fears over price growth and faster rate hikes - the same worries that sparked the sell-off after strong jobs data on Feb. 2. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering at 2.8439 percent, falling back from a four-year peak of 2.9020 percent hit on Monday. The CBOE Volatility Index, a widely-followed measure of short-term stock market volatility , opened at 26.94 points, after two days of relative calm. The index had jumped above 50 at the height of last week’s sell-off. The recent pullback has wiped out all of the year’s gains for the benchmark S&P; 500 and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, which are down 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, so far in 2018.

236,WBA,Walgreens retail sales decline overshadows pharmacy business strength,"(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s (WBA.O) quarterly profit and sales beat analysts’ estimates on Wednesday helped by higher prescription volumes, but concerns surrounding its retail business played on investors’ minds. Shares of the company that rose as much as 3.1 percent in early trading, pared gains to trade up just 0.3 percent at $66.56 later in the morning. Like other drugstore chains, Walgreens is seeing a drop in customer visits to its retail stores, where it sells over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics, as purchases have now shifted online.  To stanch falling sales at retail - its front-end business - the company has focused on boosting sales through its prescription only pharmacy business by signing partnerships with pharmacy benefit managers such as Prime Therapeutics that has given it more than 20 million additional customers.  Walgreens is also pulling non-profitable items off shelves at its front-end stores and promoting store-brands to boost margins.  The efforts came at a cost - same-store sales at its retail stores fell 2.7 percent in the quarter, continuing a nearly two-year slide. Analysts had expected flat growth. “The Street is panicked about poor retail activity, panicked about Amazon. When they don’t quantify what the impact of their rationalization decisions (are), they shoot themselves in the foot. The stock should be up a lot more”, Baird analyst Eric Coldwell told Reuters.  Walgreens said it did not see much of an uptick in prescription volumes during one the harshest flu-season in the United States in decades, surprising analysts who expected the rise in flu shots to have boosted sales significantly. To simply say ‘flu was pretty normal’ and not quantify it was a big mistake,” Coldwell added. Same-store sales at its pharmacies rose 5.1 percent, but missed analysts expectations for a 5.4 percent rise, according to four analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Walgreens filled 9.1 percent more prescriptions in the quarter, but that was mainly driven by customers seeking higher-priced specialty drugs. Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $5.85 and $6.05 per share from between $5.45 and $5.70 per share. Analysts were estimating $5.78 per share for the year.   The raise in forecast reflects a $350 million tax benefit for fiscal year 2018, an increase of about $150 million from the company’s previous estimate.  Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.73 per share. Net sales rose 12 percent to $33.02 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.55 per share on revenue of $32.19 billion.

242,WBA,Drug retailer Rite Aid's upbeat forecast lifts shares,"(Reuters) - Drug retailer Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) on Thursday forecast a full-year profit largely above estimates as it expects reimbursement rates to rise this year and its deal with Walgreens to help it secure better generic drug prices. Rite Aid sold half of its stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) last year after Walgreens’ bid to buy the whole company collapsed due to antitrust concerns. The much smaller Rite Aid then agreed to be bought by U.S. grocer Albertsons Cos Inc, hoping to still remain a formidable player in the sector. Rite Aid’s shares were up 3 percent at $1.69 in premarket trading. The drug retailer said it expects full-year 2019 sales of $21.7 billion to $22.10 billion, largely above the average analyst estimate of $21.73 billion. It forecast an adjusted profit of 2 cents to 6 cents per share, compared with the estimate of 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In its deal with Walgreens, Rite Aid sold 1,932 stores and secured a 10-year option to purchase generic drugs sourced through an affiliate of Walgreens at cost. The company said this agreement would benefit its full-year outlook, which does not include the impact of its pending deal with Albertsons. “We continue to believe the retail pharmacy group is well positioned as healthcare evolves to a more consumer-centric model,” J.P.Morgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a pre-earnings note. For the fourth quarter, the company’s revenue fell to $5.39 billion from $5.90 billion, hurt by a decline in reimbursement rates and prescription volumes. Analysts on average had expected $5.57 billion. Retail pharmacy sales fell about 10 percent in the quarter, while pharmacy services revenue dropped 4.3 percent. The company posted net loss from continuing operations of $483.7 million, or 46 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 3, compared with a loss of $25.1 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. The loss includes $325 million of income tax expense related mainly to the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets in connection with the new U.S. tax law. Excluding one-time items, Rite Aid reported a loss from continuing operations of 1 cent per share, in line with Wall Street estimates.

244,WBA,"Prince heirs sue Illinois hospital, Walgreens pharmacy chain over singer's death","(Reuters) - Heirs of Prince have sued an Illinois hospital and pharmacy chain Walgreens, saying they could have prevented the singer’s 2016 death if they had properly diagnosed and treated his overdose days earlier, a court document showed on Monday. The wrongful death lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago on Friday, accuses a doctor and pharmacist at Trinity Medical Center in Rock Island, Illinois, of failing to properly investigate the overdose or see that the pop star received appropriate counseling.   The six heirs also accuse two Walgreens pharmacists of improperly dispensing prescription medication to Prince, according to the lawsuit. Representatives of the hospital could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening. A spokesman for the hospital’s parent company, UnityPoint Health, told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the company did not comment on pending litigation. A spokesman for Walgreens, whose parent company is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, declined to comment to Reuters.  Prince, 57, was found dead at his Paisley Park home and recording studio complex near Minneapolis on April 21, 2016. The official cause of death was a self-administered overdose of the painkiller fentanyl, which is 50 times stronger than heroin.  A Minnesota prosecutor said last week he could not bring any criminal charges in connection with the “Purple Rain” singer’s death after a two-year investigation failed to determine where he obtained a counterfeit painkiller laced with fentanyl.  Police investigating Prince’s death found numerous opioids in the singer’s home, according to court documents released in April 2017.  The death of the music superstar, who crafted a public image of a clean and healthy vegan lifestyle, shocked the world and set off a protracted battle among his siblings and half-siblings over who would inherit his estate, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Prince, known for his androgynous style and sexually charged songs, died a day before he was set to meet a California-based doctor who specializes in addiction treatment. After his death, his longtime collaborator and protege Sheila E. told “Entertainment Tonight” that Prince had been suffering from hip and knee pain from decades of intense performing, much of it in his heels.

247,WBA,UPDATE 2-LabCorp's Covance business powers quarterly profit beat; shares rise,"(Reuters) - Laboratory Corp of America Holdings (LH.N) posted a quarterly profit on Wednesday that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by higher demand at the unit performing clinical trials for drugmakers, and prompting the company to raise its full-year revenue target. The company’s Covance unit, which has been steadily improving, hit $1 billion in sales for the first time, benefiting from the acquisition of privately held CRO Chiltern International. Covance sales rose 39.3 percent to $1.08 billion, better than consensus estimates of $1.02 billion by Evercore ISI. LabCorp has been acquiring contract research organizations as drugmakers try to cut costs by outsourcing clinical trials.       “It is reassuring to see Covance pivot to growth after 1H17 declines, and that the Chiltern integration appears to be going smoothly,” Barclays analysts said in a research note. The company’s shares were up 3.4 percent at $171.79. LabCorp is also focusing on expanding partnerships. It has an ongoing collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O), where it has patient service centers within Walgreens stores. “We expect the partnership with Walgreens to expand both in number of stores and scope over the balance of 2018,” Chief Executive Officer David King said on a conference call with analysts.      Revenue from its diagnostics unit, which offers services such as genetic and pathology tests through labs throughout the United States, rose 8 percent to $1.64 billion in the quarter. “In diagnostics, our focus on women’s health and medical drug monitoring as well as our strategic collaboration with 23andMe contributed to organic growth,” King said. LabCorp provides its testing services to 23andMe, a Mountain View, California-based genetic testing company. The diagnostics testing company raised its 2018 net revenue growth forecast to 10-12 percent from 9.5-11.5 percent. LabCorp reiterated its earnings forecast of $11.30 to $11.70 per share. Net earnings attributable to LabCorp was $173.2 million, or $1.67 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with $183 million, or $1.75 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $2.78 per share. Analysts on average had estimated $2.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose 18 percent to $2.85 billion, which also beat analysts’ estimates of $2.77 billion. Last week, Quest Diagnostics (DGX.N) also reported a better-than-expected first quarter earnings, citing benefits of tax reform.
