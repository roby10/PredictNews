1,HON,UPDATE 1-US architecture billings index falls in June-AIA," * June ABI 46.3 vs. May 47.2   * Project inquiries index rises to 58.1   * Institutional sector weakest amid tight govt. budgets   * Analyst: Construction recovery in 2012 or later  (Adds analyst comment)   NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - A leading indicator of U.S. non-residential construction activity fell for the third consecutive month in June, suggesting an anticipated construction recovery was still several months away.   The Architecture Billings Index fell 0.9 point to 46.3 points in June, according the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in demand for architects’ services, whose revenue predicts construction activity nine to 12 months in the future.   A separate index of project inquiries rose, however, to 58.1 from 52.6 in May. This measure is typically higher as multiple architecture firms compete for the same work.   “While a modest turnaround appeared to be on the way earlier in the year, the overall concern about both domestic and global economies is seeping into design and construction industry and adding yet another element that is preventing recovery,” AIA chief economist Kermit Baker said.   Demand is weakest in the institutional sector that includes government buildings, reflecting depressed government budgets, according to the monthly survey of architecture firms.   “The threat of the federal government failing to resolve the debt ceiling issue is leading to higher borrowing rates for real estate projects,” Baker said. “Should there actually be a default, we are likely looking at a catastrophic situation for a sector that accounts for more than 10 percent of overall GDP.”   Commercial property values fell to new lows in April and office vacancy rates are well above pre-recession lows, JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan said in a note to clients.   “The recovery has yet to find solid ground and that the non-residential construction environment remains challenging,” she said. “We believe it is more likely that non-residential construction will not recover until 2012+.”   A depressed construction market has been a headwind for manufacturers of construction machinery and components that make up buildings’ infrastructure, such as electrical, cooling and security systems.   Most diversified industrial companies get at least some revenue from the non-residential construction sector, which includes office buildings, retail and warehouse space, and institutional buildings such as schools and hospitals.   Companies exposed to the sector include Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Terex Corp (TEX.N).   European companies such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST) are also big players in the sector.

3,HON,"Honeywell profit beats second-quarter view, raises outlook","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) reported a higher quarterly profit, citing robust growth in the aerospace commercial aftermarket, and raised its 2011 outlook.  Its shares fell as Wall Street digested the company’s reporting on discontinued operations, lower aerospace margins, and a steep drop in Caterpillar Inc stock price after the maker of heavy machinery reported a profit short of expectations.  The Honeywell’s shares, which dropped as much as 4.6 percent after its results were released, were down 2.1 percent in midday trade at $56.97.  “If there was a negative in the quarter it would probably be lighter margins in aerospace, but overall results were solid,” said Matt Collins, Edward Jones analyst.  “Management is pointing to slower growth in the second half of the year, and a lower tax rate may be supporting the guidance raise,” he said. “We think a pullback today would give long-term investors a nice opportunity to buy.”  Honeywell, the world’s largest maker of cockpit electronics, on Friday reported net income of $810 million, or $1.02 per share, up 43.1 percent from $566 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 98 cents per share on that basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It earned $1.00 per share from continuing operations.  “The global industrial economy outlook looks very good,” Dave Anderson, Honeywell’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “We’re looking at sales growth in the second half in the low double-digits on top of 15 percent year to date,”  Domestic demand is “muted,” Europe has “held up reasonably well for us,” while emerging markets including China are a big driver with over 20 percent growth in the quarter, he said.  Anderson said, “we’re remaining flexible relative to the near-term economic outlook, and we’re doing that by being really close guardians of our cost structure,” holding expenses relatively flat.  “The stalemate in Washington, D.C., the debt overhang, concerns about where we’re going to go in terms of corporate tax reform, the European sovereign debt situation ... all affect business sentiment,” he added.  Honeywell said second-quarter sales came to $9.09 billion, up 14.6 percent from $7.93 billion.  The company, which also makes systems to manage the temperature and security of large buildings, said sales were $9.3 billion after adding in $234 million from its discontinued consumer products group.  Analysts, on average, had expected $9.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Honeywell also raised its 2011 earnings outlook, including discontinued operations, to $3.85 to $4.00 per share from its prior estimate of $3.80 to $3.95 a share.  The Morris Township, New Jersey-based company forecast full-year sales of $36.1 billion to $36.7 billion, up 12 percent to 14 percent from last year, excluding the consumer products group sales reported in discontinued operations.  “It was a good report and good guidance, so it looks like a buying opportunity because they’re likely to continue to report strong earnings going forward,” said Argus Research analyst John Staszak.

6,HON,UPDATE 3-Air Products profit and outlook tepid; stock falls," * Fiscal Q3 adj EPS $1.46 matches Street expectations   * Revenue up 15 percent at $2.58 billion   * Forecasts fiscal Q4 profit in range mostly below Street   * CEO says ‘very disappointed’ with results in main units   * Shares down 2.4 percent  (Adds CFO comments, electronics context; updates stock)   By Ernest Scheyder   NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Operational challenges and higher costs hampered Air Products and Chemicals Inc’s (APD.N) quarterly profit and led executives to forecast a tepid fiscal fourth quarter, pushing the company’s stock down 2.4 percent.   Air Products, which supplies argon, oxygen and other industrial gases to retail, manufacturing and construction customers, said its operations in North America remain the weakest, hurt by lackluster consumer demand and uncertainty about U.S economic policy.   “The economy in North America has kind of hit a soft patch,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Huck said on a conference call with reporters. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty around there.”   Asian growth remains strong, and the company plans to increase its capital spending there, Huck said.   The Air Products results came on the same day that manufacturing giants Honeywell Inc (HON.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) issued weak forecasts. [ID:nN1E76L01M] [ID:nN1E76L04K]   Planned customer plant shutdowns during the fiscal third quarter dented Air Products’ tonnage business, which operates industrial gas facilities on-site for customers.   Higher costs ate into the merchant business, which supplies industrial gas for retail and construction customers.   Chief Executive John McGlade said he was “very disappointed” about the weak performance.   “With the Tonnage planned maintenance outages behind us and the actions we are taking to improve Merchant performance, we expect margins to improve significantly” in the current quarter, McGlade said in a statement.   Mixed results could continue, the company said. Air Products forecast a profit of $1.48 to $1.53 per share for the current quarter. Analysts expect $1.52.   “As uncertainties surrounding policy, fiscal and sovereign debt issues begin to resolve over the coming months, we would expect growth to pick up early in our fiscal 2012,” said Huck.   For the third quarter, ended June 30, the company posted net income of $326.5 million, or $1.50 per share, compared with $253.2 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.   Excluding a gain from the sale of its healthcare business in 2009, Air Products earned $1.46 per share. That met analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue rose 15 percent to $2.58 billion. Analysts expected $2.53 billion.   Sales to electronics customers showed the fastest growth, up 21 percent to $602 million.   The electronics segment, which supplies gases that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) use to make their popular products, should continue to grow, Huck said.   “We expect continued strong performance from this segment,” he said.   Air Products walked away from a planned $5.9 billion buyout of smaller rival Airgas Inc ARG.N earlier this year. [ID:nN15128419]   Shares of Air Products were down 2.4 percent to $93.16 in midday trading. The stock has traded between $69.89 and $98.00 in the past 52 weeks.

9,HON,COMPANY VIEW-Executives on U.S. debt ceiling talks," NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats rushed to rework rival deficit reduction plans on Wednesday, but with the fate of both proposals in doubt, top lawmakers pursued a behind-the-scenes compromise to avert a crippling U.S. debt default. [ID:nN1E76P2HJ]   Here are comments from company executives over the past week on what they think about the debt talks:   ROBERT GREIFELD, CEO, NASDAQ OMX GROUP (NDAQ.O)   “We’re not going to have a default. I’m confident that our political leaders will come to a pragmatic solution. I’m confident they’ll get there,” Greifeld told Reuters in an interview.   Separately, on a conference call with analysts, he said, “On a macroeconomic basis it’s not hard to say that we need greater certainty out of Washington. It’s not helpful for investor confidence in terms of what we see transpiring here.”   GREG SWIENTON, CEO, RYDER SYSTEM INC (R.N)   Swienton said the company is not undergoing any current tactical changes because of the overhanging debt ceiling tumult.   “As an American I worry about it a great deal. As the CEO of Ryder, you worry that that might have an impact on the economic environment.   “I hope we get some sanity in Washington. I hope they figure it all out for everyone’s benefit and we’ll all be much better off.”   ROBERT MOORE, CFO, LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC (LPLA.O)   “The debt ceiling issue is a major overhang for us at the moment, and how that ultimately is resolved is unclear at this point, and it’s equally unclear as to what the real consequences of the outcome from that debate will be under a variety of scenarios.”   JOSEPH ZUBRETSKY, CFO, AETNA (AET.N)   “We have a team of people who are monitoring the debt ceiling situation closely. We do not believe that a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in any short-term impact to our claims-paying ability.   “We have adequate liquidity to meet all potential funding commitments and the business should perform just fine.   “Longer-term, not addressing this situation is really just untenable for the nation. It needs to be addressed so there’s more certainty in the environment.”   WES BUSH, CEO, NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP (NOC.N)   “Continued uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and future defense budget caused our customers to move more slowly and spend more conservatively.”   MIKE JACKSON, CEO, AUTONATION (AN.N)   “If there is an extended stalemate here on the debt ceiling and the government shuts down step by step, that will have a meaningful impact on the economy and definitely affect the pace of this recovery.   “Assuming there’s an orderly resolution to the debt situation, I see a very strong close to the year.”   EMERSON ELECTRIC CO (EMR.N):   “U.S. and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft-patch and it remains unclear if they will improve much in the second half of the calendar year.   “Industrial-related businesses are still strong, but we expect them eventually to soften due to the generally poor economic environment (the negative budget discourse in Washington, D.C., and ongoing European debt crisis) and weakening trends.”   SCOTT DAVIS, CEO, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC (UPS.N)   The world’s largest package delivery company gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” Davis told analysts on a conference call.   Without a debt resolution or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.   SANDY CUTLER, CEO, EATON CORP (ETN.N)   “These compromises never seem to come together until the 24th hour. It looks like that’s how this one is going to play out. I think they will find some common ground at the very last moment and pull a rabbit out of the hat.”   DAVID SIMON, CEO, SIMON PROPERTY GROUP (SPG.N)   “I’m known for checking our accounts receivable every month when I get the report. And they (the U.S. government) are always 30 days delinquent.   “But beyond that, we don’t see any real risk. Spreads will invariably widen for all of corporate America and for all asset classes. So we’ll be a participant in that, but beyond that, we can’t see anything that’s going to be anything material.”   “We’ve kind of aired our dirty laundry in the international press and that’s not good for the U.S. markets, it’s not good for U.S. business.”   JIM HAGEMANN SNABE, CO-CEO, SAP AG (SAPG.DE)   “We strongly believe that businesses and countries need stability on the financial side. We hope the U.S. will sort its financial situation out.”   Snabe said there was nothing the company can do to prepare for a possible default.   THOMAS FALK, CEO, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP (KMB.N)   “I was in Europe recently, and we were having a debate with some of our European team over which region of the world had the bigger problem: is it the Europe sovereign debt crisis or the U.S. structural budget deficits and debt ceiling?   “It’s just disappointing that the two biggest economies in the Western world can’t seem to get their fiscal house in order.”   DAVE ANDERSON, CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC (HON.N)   Anderson said the stalemate in Washington and concerns over corporate tax reform and European sovereign debt were among the principal factors affecting business sentiment.   “Despite the fact that we’re in a market upturn right now in the industrial economy, we try to hold fixed costs relatively flat. We don’t want to get out ahead of our headlights in terms of any over-hiring.”   CLAY JONES, CEO, ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (COL.N)   “I’m not sure how one prepares for a default since we’ve never had one in the history of our country. There is no playbook that I know of that suggests here’s what one should do, either as a company or a private citizen, when the country starts going out of business.”   KEITH SHERIN, CFO, GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE.N)   The largest U.S. conglomerate has boosted its cash holdings and cut its long-term debt in the past three years.   “The main thing that we’ve done, and it’s not specifically for the discussion going on in the U.S. about raising the debt ceiling or the European issue, is we just have dramatically increased our liquidity.”   YOUNG SOHN, CEO OF CHIPMAKER INPHI (IPHI.N)   “If interest rates change and people lose their confidence in a stable currency, the macroeconomic headwind will increase and that means people will be confused and maybe panic.   “We have to be very careful here. This is not something politicians should take lightly and it’s not something they can play with. They’ve had several months to fix this problem.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, Ilaina Jonas, Liana B.

10,HON,UPDATE 1-U.S. architects group cuts construction forecast,"   * Sees U.S. construction spending down 5.6 pct in 2011   * Sees 2012 rebound led by hotel sector   * Tight credit, govt budget shortfalls depress spending   NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - An architects’ trade group cut its 2011 U.S. construction forecast on Wednesday, citing tight credit conditions, government budget shortfalls and a depressed housing market.   The American Institute of Architects (AIA) said it now expects spending on nonresidential construction projects to fall 5.6 percent this year before rebounding in 2012. In January it forecast a 2 percent decline this year.   “Consumer and business confidence is poor and the overall economy has yet to pull out of the downturn that began in 2008, which both add to the general sense of anxiety and uncertainty in the real estate market” said AIA Chief Economist Kermit Baker.   “The depressed demand for new construction isn’t likely to improve until next year, led by the commercial sector: offices, retail and hotels.”   Overall nonresidential spending is expected to rise 6.4 percent in 2012, the group said, a slightly stronger recovery than it forecast six months ago.   The AIA publishes a widely cited index of architecture billings that is considered a leading indicator of construction spending up to a year ahead. The billings index has been below 50, indicating contraction, for three consecutive months, after recovering earlier in the year. [ID:nN1E76J08K]   The AIA Consensus Construction Forecast Panel is conducted twice a year with leading nonresidential construction forecasters, including McGraw Hill Construction, IHS-Global Insight and Moody’s economy.com.   Construction of hotels and industrial space is forecast to fall by double digits this year, while smaller declines are forecast for the office and retail sectors.   But in 2012, spending on hotel construction is seen rising 18 percent. AIA said spending on factories and other industrial buildings will rise 8.4 percent; office buildings up 9.8 percent; and retail up 11.8 percent.   The AIA forecast more modest recoveries next year in institutional categories that include churches, schools and healthcare facilities.   A weak U.S. construction market has been a source of frustration for multinational manufacturers that sell machinery to erect buildings or components such as elevators and cooling and security systems. Many industrial names stand to gain once a full-fledged construction recovery finally gains momentum.   U.S. construction spending fell for a sixth straight month in May to its lowest level in more than a decade, according to a government report. June figures due on Monday are forecast to be flat. [ECI/US]   Companies exposed to the sector include Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Emcor Group (EME.N) and Terex Corp (TEX.N).   European companies such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST) are also big players in the sector.   Industrial shares in the United States and Canada were down sharply on Wednesday after leading conglomerate Emerson Electric warned of slowing growth in major economies.

11,HON,Company View: Executives on debt ceiling talks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deadlock between Republicans and Democrats over how best to reduce the deficit, and over what period, has blocked an agreement to allow the raising of the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  A Republican deficit reduction plan headed to a close vote in Congress on Thursday and the White House urged lawmakers to compromise.  Here are comments from company executives on what they think about the debt talks:  “What’s going on in Washington concerns me more than anything going on in our business. We need courageous people in Washington, and my biggest fear is they’re not there.”  McCausland said he favors a plan from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner.  “I hope the Boehner plan is voted on by the Congress and passes. I think it’s the best plan out there.  “We can’t default. I don’t think we will. But we also can’t borrow 40 cents out of every dollar we spend.”  “The uncertainty itself does create a lot of questions and a lot of fear down value chains.

12,HON,COMPANY VIEW-Executives on U.S. debt ceiling talks," NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - Deadlock between Republicans and Democrats over how best to reduce the U.S. deficit, and over what period, has blocked an agreement to allow the raising of the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.   A Republican deficit reduction plan headed to a close vote in the U.S. Congress on Thursday and the White House urged lawmakers to compromise. [ID:nN1E76R004]   Here are comments from company executives on what they think about the debt talks:   “What’s going on in Washington concerns me more than anything going on in our business. We need courageous people in Washington, and my biggest fear is they’re not there.”   McCausland said he favors a plan from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner.   JOHN FARACI, CEO, INTERNATIONAL PAPER (IP.N)   “I hope the Boehner plan is voted on by the Congress and passes. I think it’s the best plan out there.   “We can’t default. I don’t think we will.

Its shares fell as Wall Street digested the company’s reporting on discontinued operations, lower aerospace margins, and a steep drop in Caterpillar Inc stock price after the maker of heavy machinery reported a profit short of expectations. [ID:nN1E76L04K]   The Honeywell’s shares, which dropped as much as 4.6 percent after its results were released, were down 2.1 percent in midday trade at $56.97.   “If there was a negative in the quarter it would probably be lighter margins in aerospace, but overall results were solid,” said Matt Collins, Edward Jones analyst.   “Management is pointing to slower growth in the second half of the year, and a lower tax rate may be supporting the guidance raise,” he said. “We think a pullback today would give long-term investors a nice opportunity to buy.”   Honeywell, the world’s largest maker of cockpit electronics, on Friday reported net income of $810 million, or $1.02 per share, up 43.1 percent from $566 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 98 cents per share on that basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It earned $1.00 per share from continuing operations.   “The global industrial economy outlook looks very good,” Dave Anderson, Honeywell’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “We’re looking at sales growth in the second half in the low double-digits on top of 15 percent year to date,”   Domestic demand is “muted,” Europe has “held up reasonably well for us,” while emerging markets including China are a big driver with over 20 percent growth in the quarter, he said.   Anderson said, “we’re remaining flexible relative to the near-term economic outlook, and we’re doing that by being really close guardians of our cost structure,” holding expenses relatively flat.   “The stalemate in Washington, D.C., the debt overhang, concerns about where we’re going to go in terms of corporate tax reform, the European sovereign debt situation ... all affect business sentiment,” he added.   Honeywell said second-quarter sales came to $9.09 billion, up 14.6 percent from $7.93 billion.   The company, which also makes systems to manage the temperature and security of large buildings, said sales were $9.3 billion after adding in $234 million from its discontinued consumer products group.   Analysts, on average, had expected $9.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Honeywell also raised its 2011 earnings outlook, including discontinued operations, to $3.85 to $4.00 per share from its prior estimate of $3.80 to $3.95 a share.   The Morris Township, New Jersey-based company forecast full-year sales of $36.1 billion to $36.7 billion, up 12 percent to 14 percent from last year, excluding the consumer products group sales reported in discontinued operations.   “It was a good report and good guidance, so it looks like a buying opportunity because they’re likely to continue to report strong earnings going forward,” said Argus Research analyst John Staszak.

Cleveland-based Parker said it expects fiscal 2012 earnings from continuing operations of $6.70 to $7.50 a share. Analysts’ average forecast is $7.51 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Because Parker’s fiscal year ends in June, it is among the first of the large U.S. industrials to give a full-year forecast that includes a large portion of calendar 2012.   Jefferies & Co analyst Stephen Volkmann said he expected the midpoint of the company’s forecast to be lower, given macroeconomic concerns and management’s tendency to be conservative in its forecasts.   “The range is a little bit wider than we had been expecting,” Volkmann said.   Parker on Tuesday reported that earnings rose to $294.7 million, or $1.79 a share, in the fourth quarter, ended June 30, from $223.1 million, or $1.35 a share, a year earlier.   Sales increased 22 percent to $3.4 billion.   Orders rose 15 percent, down from 25 percent in the quarter ended March 31.   Analysts expected earnings of $1.80 a share on sales of $3.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan said Parker’s margin of 14.8 percent was lower than her expectations of 15.5 percent.   Parker, which competes with Pall Corp PLL.N, Eaton Corp (ETN.N) and Honeywell (HON.N), makes fluid power systems, electromechanical controls and related components for use in manufacturing, transportation and processing industries.   Parker shares, which have fallen about 16 percent in the last month, were down 5 percent to $73.50 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  (Reporting by A.

18,HON,"As swift bear market bit, some funds were prepared","BOSTON (Reuters) - Some investors burned by the bear market of 2008 have gravitated to funds that use short-term tactics to avoid losses — and the strategy has paid off in recent months.  Such funds, like the $7.3 billion Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Fund or the $14.8 billion Permanent Portfolio, have recently outperformed the market and traditional lower-risk balanced funds.  These are not the leveraged short-selling funds that surge with each market decline. They are diversified funds with a bias: Their managers look for ways to preserve capital during market swoons.  The past month was a key test for the funds as they encountered one of the swiftest bears to bite investors in years. The average U.S. equity mutual fund lost 7.33 percent Monday and 19.31 percent over the past month, according to Lipper data. Even balanced funds known for conservative, diversified investments, lost 4.53 percent and 11.73 percent.  But the risk-reducing strategies of the ‘hedging’ funds appear to have worked better to preserve capital:  —The Eaton Vance fund, which spreads its bets for and against currencies, equities and bonds, lost just 0.56 percent on Monday and 1.19 percent over the past month.  —The Permanent Portfolio, hedging with precious metals and foreign currencies, dropped just 1.26 percent on Monday and 2.63 percent over the past month.  —Quant investing firm AQR’s $155 million Risk Parity Fund, one of the most complicated new offerings, uses a strategy of investing relatively more in bonds than a typical balanced fund. The fund lost 2.22 percent on Monday and 5.21 percent over the past month.  —The $164 million Forester Value Fund combines individual stock picking with hedges using puts on market indexes and the occasional short-positioned exchange-traded fund. The fund dropped just 1.82 percent on Monday and 6.09 percent over the past month.  The funds are not likely to do as well in a rebound as ones that are less risk averse. Stocks rebounded sharply Tuesday, but for a large population of cautious investors it was a fresh reminder to look for safe investing alternatives.  At Eaton Vance, Eric Stein and his co-managers have been anticipating problems in the United States and Europe for quite some time.  The fund’s short positions in European sovereign debt and bets on emerging market currencies have performed well in recent weeks as the crisis rolled on.  In the U.S., Eaton Vance is less concerned with the recent battle over extending the debt ceiling and Standard &Poor’s decision to downgrade. Instead, the firm is far more worried about the weakening economy that can’t seem to get back on its feet after the 2008 financial crisis.  Stein’s fund started shorting Greek debt back in 2005 but lately has cut back and shifted to more fruitful targets like the bonds of Spain, France and Belgium. Triple-A rated French debt looks particularly juicy to short, Stein said.  But this is not just a short-selling ambush. On the long side, the fund has bought the currencies of Malaysia, Indonesia and China. All three offer better yields than U.S. short-term accounts and feature economies with much better growth prospects, he said.  It’s impossible to create a perfect hedge, to be sure, and not all of the funds’ strategies paid off. Seeing a problem on the horizon is one challenge. Timing is another  At the $1.2 billion Leuthold Core Investment Fund, managers saw warning signs of a stock market drop building in July. Co-manager Andy Engel in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said the almost 200 economic and market indicators his firm tracks shifted from positive to neutral around July 15 and flashed “sell” by July 29.  It took a few days for managers to pare their 60 percent long position in stocks down to 45 percent. And they plan to go still lower, shooting for the minimum 30 percent permitted by the fund’s investment guidelines, Engel said.  “We think this is a new cyclical bear market,” Engel said. “From peak to trough, we’re expecting a 25 to 30 percent decline. That’s about 950 on the S&P 500.”  The fund lost 3.57 percent on Monday, slightly better than the average for balanced funds, and 12.22 percent over the past month, also better than most.  The fund was hurt by a small short position against U.S. Treasury 10-year bonds, which rallied sharply on Monday. The surprising strength of U.S. bonds after the Standard & Poor’s downgrade led to losses on the trade.  “The stunning thing was the debt was downgraded and people are flooding into T-bonds still,” he said. “People looking at the Treasury market as a safe haven are going to be sorely disappointed.”  Forester Value manager Tom Forester was able to position for the crash in time.  All year, Forester has been lightening up on financial and industrial stocks, cutting back positions in custody back State Street and manufacturer Honeywell, for example, while adding to defensive picks like Pfizer, Kraft Foods and Altria Group.  “A lot of these blue chip stocks have great balance sheets and their revenues are fairly stable,” Forester, based in Lake Forest, Illinois, said.

20,HON,Insight: Equity analysts behind the curve...again,"LONDON (Reuters) - Equity analysts seem to have been caught out once again by a tectonic shift in economic outlook, highlighting potential pitfalls in earnings models devised by highly-paid professionals on Wall Street and in the City of London.  While businesses and households on both sides of the Atlantic have been sending a clear message for months that an already weak economy is slowing sharply, forecasts for future company earnings have barely budged.  Consensus forecasts from Thomson Reuters still point to 15.3 percent earnings growth for U.S. companies over the next 12 months and 11.6 percent for Europe.  Both numbers now seem destined to fall. If they do, equities might turn out not to be as cheap as they appear.  Unexpectedly sturdy first-half profits have played a pivotal role in propping up hopes until recently. But, as investment houses routinely warn, past performance is no guarantee of future results and many investors are now wondering just when those earnings will start to slide.  Today’s picture of earnings forecasts is worryingly similar to that in 2008.  Then it took the collapse of Lehman Brothers to finally prompt analysts to cut forecasts on both sides of the Atlantic, despite the earlier crisis at Bear Stearns and strong flashing lights from the real economy.  This year, just as in 2008, both the U.S. Institute for Supply Management index and the euro zone Purchasing Managers Index — two measures of real economic activity — have turned sharply lower far ahead of any move in earnings forecasts.  The rout in global stock markets, driven by fears over growth, shows investors certainly have little faith in corporate profits in the wake of Standard & Poor’s decision to strip the United States of its top-notch credit rating and Europe’s continuing debt crisis.  So why have equity analysts apparently not factored these big macro shifts into earnings forecasts?  One reason is that they are emotional as well as rational beings, according to David Tuckett of University College London, who has conducted a psychoanalytical study of markets after interviewing fund managers controlling over $50 billion.  “Financial markets are markets in stories, and financial analysts are strongly influenced by the mood context of the moment,” he said.  “At the same time, they tend to simply extrapolate from what has happened forward and they tend to do it as a group. There’s a lot to be lost from standing out from the crowd — they want to stand out a bit but not too much.”  Tuckett describes the phenomenon as “groupfeel.”  “Groupfeel is the same as groupthink, except it is based on wanting to feel like everyone else rather than wanting to feel dangerously out of the crowd. That naturally makes it difficult for them to change quickly, unless everybody else is changing.”  Some “top-down” strategists are now moving on earnings. Credit Suisse on Friday hacked backed its 2011 forecast for euro zone earnings growth to 7 percent from 12 percent and cut U.S. estimates to 12 percent from 14 percent.  “Bottom-up” analysts, looking at individual companies, are slower. Being a good analyst means being close to the company you follow and those companies will tend to maintain rosy outlooks for as long as possible.  Many securities houses are also slow to feed big, non-company specific macro factors into their models. Those that do may therefore have an edge.  Winners in predicting the post-Lehman earnings landscape in the United States and Europe included Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and UBS, according to Starmine. link.reuters.com/jaf23s Daniel Beunza, a lecturer in management at the London School of Economics, says the political uncertainty at the heart of the current crisis is particularly hard for equity analysts to model — and he points out we have been before.  Beunza has a paper accepted for publication in the journal Economy and Society analyzing one specific example of politics confounding the smartest analysts, when Europe’s competition head Mario Monti blocked General Electric’s takeover of Honeywell International in 2001.  In a similar way, oil company analysts continually underestimated the political fallout of BP’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.  “Typically, where market participants get it wrong is when they have to price in political factors,” Beunza said. “The whole sovereign debt crisis requires a knowledge of politics that, for most part, they don’t have.”  Economists polled by Reuters now believe the chances of another U.S. recession are rising and Europe’s recovery is also at risk, although they are still clinging to hopes of better times ahead.  But their numbers, too, probably need to be taken with a pinch of salt. An analysis of earlier polls found economists were too optimistic about 20 out of 27 major monthly indicators from April and May in the United States, euro zone and Britain.

21,HON,Checkpoint Systems under pressure to seek strategic review,"(Reuters) - Checkpoint Systems Inc, maker of merchandise protection products for retailers, is expected to receive a letter from activist investor MMI Investments LP on Wednesday, requesting the company seek a strategic review, according to the contents of the letter obtained by Reuters.  MMI Investments, also known as Millbrook Capital Management Company LLC, wrote in its letter to Checkpoint’s board of directors that the company is “significantly undervalued given its strong products, technology, market positions and customer relationships.”  As one of Checkpoint’s largest shareholders, with a current stake of 4.9 percent, the New York-based hedge fund said recommendations it had suggested privately to the board, and chairman and CEO Rob van der Merwe since June 2011 to increase shareholder value had fallen on deaf ears.  “We have recommended that Checkpoint hire an investment banker to explore strategic alternatives, which the board summarily dismissed. We have attempted to connect Checkpoint with those who are highly qualified and potentially interested in buying the company, to no avail,” Jerome Lande, partner of MMI Investments wrote in the letter.  The letter, dated August 10 and addressed to the board, also mentioned the activist’s recent request to have an MMI representative appointed to Checkpoint’s nine-member board, an option that was also rejected.  MMI Investments plans to file a schedule 13-D with the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating that it has accumulated over 5 percent stake in the company.  As of Tuesday’s close, Checkpoint had a market capitalization of $576 million. The shares closed up almost 10 percent to $14.37.  Philadelphia, PA-based Checkpoint has over the last three decades built a suite of products that primarily focus on reducing “shrink,” or merchandise lost through employee theft, shoplifting, vendor theft and paperwork errors, for retailers ranging from supermarkets to apparel.  MMI Investments said Checkpoint’s stock has been negative every year for the last eight years and has underperformed the S&P 500 as well as small cap indices, including the Russell 2000. Analysts have estimated a 12-month target price of between $20 to $25, the lower range based on operational challenges in the retail and apparel end-markets globally and the higher share price reflecting recent high levels of unemployment increasing shrink in the developed world.  “Our analysis suggests that a transaction could yield a stock price in the low-to-mid $20s, assuming acquisition by a financial sponsor at 7.5x to 8.5x the midpoint of the company’s 2011 EBITDA guidance, and potentially well above that with a strategic acquirer,” Lande said in the letter.  MMI Investments is no stranger to activism. Most recently, the hedge fund won its several month shareholder battle against EMS Technologies. The activist had requested that EMS hire an independent special committee to run its sale process and nominated a slate of nominees to the company’s board of directors.  EMS, which provides wireless connectivity solutions over satellite and terrestrial networks, eventually sold itself in June to Honeywell International Inc for $506 million in cash.",8102011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-checkpointsystems/checkpoint-systems-under-pressure-to-seek-strategic-review-idUSTRE7792UM20110810
22,HON,Checkpoint Systems under pressure to seek sale," * MMI Investments sends letter seeking strategic review   * Earlier recommendations rebuffed by board   By Nadia Damouni   NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - One of Checkpoint Systems Inc’s CKP.N largest shareholders is seeking a sale of the company, according to a letter the shareholder, MMI Investments LP, sent to the company.   MMI Investments, also known as Millbrook Capital Management Company LLC, holds a 4.9 percent stake in Checkpoint, which makes a variety of products designed to curtail shoplifting.   The New York-based hedge fund said it tried to make its recommendations to the company’s board and its chief executive Rob van der Merwe since June, but had been rebuffed.   “We have recommended that Checkpoint hire an investment banker to explore strategic alternatives, which the board summarily dismissed.

23,HON,UPDATE 2-First Solar executive Meyerhoff leaving company," * Meyerhoff was CFO before leading new utility business   * Had served as president of utility unit for a year   * Gave no reason for departure  (Adds background on First Solar, Meyerhoff, analyst comment, byline)   By Nichola Groom   LOS ANGELES, Aug 16 (Reuters) - First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) on Tuesday said the head of its utility systems business, Jens Meyerhoff, is leaving the company, effective Sept. 30.   James Brown, senior vice president of utility systems business sales, will succeed Meyerhoff in the utility-scale solar unit and will report to Chief Executive Rob Gillette.   Meyerhoff, who served as the company’s chief financial officer for four years before being tapped to lead the fast-growing utility unit, did not give a reason for his departure.   “The company has now reached a size and scale that allows me to step back and self-reflect before deciding my next step in life,” he said in a statement. He noted several recent milestones in the company’s U.S. utility-scale solar business, including the sale of its 290 megawatt Agua Caliente project in Arizona to NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N) and the start of construction on its 550 MW Desert Sunlight power plant in California.   Meyerhoff joined the company as CFO in 2006 and became president of its newly created utility systems unit slightly more than a year ago in July of 2010.   “It’s a little surprising considering the fact that he just fairly recently took on the job as president of the company’s utility business,” said Brigantine Advisors analyst Ramesh Misra. “He was the CFO for a long time and most of the Street knew him as the CFO. Moving over to the utility business went to show how much importance the company accorded its utility business.”   His departure is the latest of several management shifts at the world’s most valuable solar company since longtime CEO Mike Ahearn stepped down from that post in late 2009 and handed over the reins to Honeywell Aerospace (HON.N) veteran Gillette.   Most recently, the company’s president of operations, Bruce Sohn, left the company in April to pursue other opportunities. He is now CEO of energy storage startup Fluidic Energy.   A month before that, First Solar appointed Mark Widmar as its new finance chief, replacing interim CFO James Zhu. Zhu is now the company’s chief accounting officer.   As part of the management transition, Frank DeRosa will become the utility business’s senior vice president of business development for the Americas, First Solar said.

24,HON,Indicator of U.S. building has steep drop in July,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A leading indicator of nonresidential construction in the United States fell for a fourth straight month in July, in a sign that demand for offices and other commercial properties is weakening.  The monthly Architecture Billings Index fell to 45.1 last month, a 1.2-point drop that was its steepest since February 2010, the American Institute of Architects said on Wednesday. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction in billings by architects, whose revenue projects construction activity over the next six to nine months.  “Business conditions for architecture firms have turned down sharply,” said Kermit Baker, the group’s chief economist. “Late last year and in the first couple of months of this year there was a sense that we were slowly pulling out of the downturn, but now the concern is that we haven’t yet reached the bottom of the cycle.”  By region, the Midwest was weakest, while the South was strongest. By sector, demand was weakest for multifamily residential buildings and strongest for commercial and industrial sites.  “The steep decline in the ABI since February suggests that the nonresidential construction recovery struggles to gain traction,” said J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan, noting that the sector may not recover until next year or later.  Weak construction activity for both commercial properties and homes has depressed demand for building components including elevators, air conditioners and electrical systems as well as contributing to high unemployment in the construction trades.  Companies exposed to the sector include Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N), Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Terex Corp (TEX.N) in the United States, as well as Europe’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and lock maker Assa Abloy AB (ASSAb.ST).

26,HON,UPDATE 2-Lockheed F-35 test jets cleared to fly again,"   * Permanent fix still needed for a subsystem failure   * $382 bln program would be costliest US arms purchase   * Early production models remain grounded  (Adds Honeywell’s role, Lockheed comment, background)   By Jim Wolf   WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 test fighter aircraft have been cleared for flight after a precautionary grounding, but early production models remain parked until a permanent fix is found to a subsystem failure, the Pentagon’s program office said Thursday.   The United States is developing three models of radar-evading F-35s with eight international partners — Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway.   It would be the Pentagon’s costliest arms purchase at more than $382 billion over the coming two decades for more than 2,440 aircraft.   An Air Force Safety Investigation Board continues to review the failure of an “Integrated Power Package” aboard an F-35A assigned to Edwards Air Force Base, California, on Aug. 2, the office said in a statement. The subsystem is built by Honeywell Aerospace, a unit of Honeywell International. (HON.N)   The investigation indicates that a valve did not function properly, the F-35 program office said. The integrated power package provides power to start the engine and generates cooling for the aircraft. A Honeywell representative said he was trying to obtain more information on the valve in question.    Lockheed Martin is pleased with “the progress we have made in resolving the IPP issue and we are scheduled to begin flying today to continue our flight test program,” Michael Rein, a spokesman for the company’s F-35 program, said by email.   The program office said monitoring of the valve position “is a mitigating action to allow monitored operations” for the developmental test aircraft — but not the two early-production planes now parked at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, whose flights would be unmonitored.   The production aircraft will not return to air or ground operations “until there’s a permanent resolution to the valve issue in place,” said Joseph DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program office.   A total of 20 F-35s were grounded under the suspension of operations announced on Aug. 3, including the test planes and the early-production aircraft.   Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier by sales, expects the F-35 to account for more than 20 percent of revenue once the Pentagon starts full production runs, likely in another few years.   The impact of the latest F-35 grounding, the second this year, on test flight execution and production operations continues to be assessed, DellaVedova said in the statement. In March, the test planes were grounded after a dual electrical power generator failed in flight.   The program has built “margin into the test schedule to accommodate incidents that occur in the development effort,” the statement said.   F-35 competitors for international sales include Boeing Co’s (BA.N) F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Saab’s Gripen, Dassault’s Rafale, Russia’s MiG-35 and Sukhoi Su-35 and the Eurofighter Typhoon made by a consortium of British, German, Italian and Spanish companies.   Lockheed’s chief F-35 subcontractors are Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and BAE Systems (BAES.L) Plc. United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Pratt & Whitney unit is building the engine.   There are three F-35 models, or variants: A conventional takeoff-and-landing type for the Air Force; a short takeoff-vertical landing model for the Marine Corps and a carrier takeoff-and-landing variant for the Navy.

28,HON,Wall Street ends worst month in year on upbeat note,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed out the worst month in more than a year on an up note on Wednesday, with sharp gains in the last several days still not enough to repair the damage from a U.S. credit downgrade and fears of a slide back into recession.  Sentiment turned dramatically in recent days on expectations the Federal Reserve will again intervene to support the economy. With Wednesday’s gains, the Dow was back in positive territory for 2011.  Banks led a late-day surge on Wednesday, helping to extend a four-day rally, followed by industrial shares. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) rose 1.3 percent to $37.56 while Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) was up 1.3 percent at $91.00.  Minutes from the most recent Fed policymakers’ meeting released on Tuesday that indicated several Fed members favored more monetary easing bolstered the appetite for equities.  “The market has been somewhat schizophrenic lately, but the idea of more stimulus lets you put a rosy spin on everything,” said Steve Sosnick, equity-risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.  “Our rally has quieted down since the data wasn’t great this morning, and we still don’t know if that kind of weakness will be enough to trigger ‘extraordinary action’ from the Fed,” he said.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, at an annual Fed conference in Wyoming last week, said the U.S. central bank’s scheduled meeting in September would run for two days instead of the planned one to mull options for additional monetary stimulus.  Data on hiring by private employers in August and factory activity in the U.S. Midwest released on Wednesday showed some signs of weakening growth.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI finished up 53.58 points, or 0.46 percent, at 11,613.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 5.97 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,218.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 3.35 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,579.46.  The S&P 500 rose in seven of the past eight sessions for total gains of 8.5 percent, led by sectors tied to economic growth.  For August, though, the S&P fell 5.7 percent, its worst month since May 2010. The Dow fell 4.4 percent in August while the Nasdaq slumped 6.4 percent. It was the fourth straight down month for all.  Equities on Wednesday were volatile late in the session, turning briefly negative before snapping back into positive territory. Still, the volatility did not compare to early in the month, when Wall Street was marked by massive swings of more than 3 percent.  “The market has no conviction one way or the other, and the low volume exaggerates all the moves we get,” said Carl Kaufman, who helps manage just under $2 billion at the Osterweis Strategic Income fund in San Francisco.  “We get some good numbers, but there are questions about the future, a lot of people are still seeking safety. The market is a zephyr in the whirlwind of headlines.”  An index of factory activity in the U.S. Midwest slipped to its lowest level since November 2009, though the figures still pointed to manufacturing growth. A separate report showed private sector job growth slowed in August for a second straight month.  Tech shares weighed on the Nasdaq, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) off 1.3 percent to $384.83 and chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) down 2.7 percent to $13.31.  Industrial stocks were among the top gainers, with the S&P industrials index .GSPI up 0.7 percent. Honeywell International (HON.N) gained 1.1 percent to $47.81 while Joy Global Inc JOYG.O rose 1.3 percent to $83.45. The company agreed to sell the drilling products business of recently acquired LeTourneau Technologies to Cameron International Corp CAM.N for $375 million.  Telecom stocks were the day’s losers after the Obama administration filed to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $39 billion proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) because of anti-competitive concerns.  AT&T shares slumped 3.8 percent to $28.48, the biggest decliner on the Dow. The S&P Telecommunications index .GSPL dropped 1.6 percent, by far the biggest loser among S&P sectors.

32,HON,"Sunoco to sell refinery business, keep retail","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sunoco Inc (SUN.N) plans to end nearly 120 years in the U.S. refining business, selling its two remaining plants as higher crude prices and slumping demand squeezed profits in the latest restructuring of the sector.  The Philadelphia-based company will remain a gasoline retailer through its 4,900 stations across the East Coast and Midwest, but will put its 335,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) Philadelphia refinery and 178,000-bpd Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania refinery on the block.  The move is the latest shift in the U.S. refining sector, which has seen a wave of companies disposing of refining assets, selling plants or mothballing them over the past two years as firms reorganize businesses to adjust to changing economics in oil product markets.  U.S. refiners have seen profits squeezed by sluggish demand due to the weaker economy and strong crude oil prices. Sunoco Chief Executive Lynn Elsenhans said the refining segment operated at a loss in eight of the last 10 quarters.  “It is in the best interests of shareholders to exit this business and focus on our profitable retail and logistics businesses,” Elsenhans said in a statement on Tuesday.  Sunoco’s share price rose $1.92, or 5 percent, on the day to $38.03 after the news.  If the company is unable to strike a deal to sell the plants by July 2012, it plans to idle the two main processing units at the facilities.  One option if no buyers can be found is to turn the refineries into terminals. Marcus Hook offers the better site for a terminal facility as it has storage tanks for crude oil and refined products as well as caverns for natural gas liquids storage, Elsenhans said.  The Philadelphia refinery would likely be better used as an industrial site and could process ethane from Marcellus Shale natural gas into ethylene, Elsenhans said.  The 513,000 bpd of refining capacity Sunoco is selling represents a significant portion of East Coast capacity. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated East Coast refining capacity at 1.7 million bpd, of which 1.27 million bpd is operating capacity, in a report from early 2011.  Energy investment bank Simmons & Co said in a Tuesday note that ConocoPhillips (COP.N) may be the next to put East Coast refineries up for sale, although the company said it had no such plan.  Conoco owns the 238,000-bpd Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, as well as the 185,000-bpd Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery.  In addition to its gasoline stations, Sunoco plans on retaining its logistics business, which has refined product and oil pipelines as well as terminals and is operated by Sunoco Logistics Partners SXL.N.  The company will hold a strategic review, assisted by Credit Suisse CSGN.VX, to explore ways to use its “strong cash position and maximize the potential for its logistics and retail businesses”.  Sunoco bought its first refinery in the 1890s as part of an early effort to diversify its oil production business.  Sunoco has had some initial interest from potential buyers, a company spokesman said, without elaborating further. Industry watchers said big refining players on the East Coast such as PBF and ConocoPhillips could be barred from purchasing due to concerns about market concentration.  “It would have to be private equity,” said Mark Gilman of New York-based The Benchmark Company, echoing comments from other analysts.  PBF, which purchased two East Coast plants — the idled Delaware City, Delaware refinery and the Paulsboro, New Jersey refinery — in recent years, declined comment. ConocoPhillips also declined comment.  Norwegian integrated oil company Statoil, a supplier of crude to refiners in the region, also declined to comment.  While refiners in other parts of the United States have somewhat rebounded from paltry margins because they can process cheap, dirty crude or sit near growing U.S. supply, East Coast refineries have lagged.  Midwest refiners, for example, have seen robust margins for months because of close access to increased supply from U.S. and Canadian shale oil plays. But East Coast refiners largely rely on more expensive imports.  U.S. Northeast refining margins have averaged $8.59 per barrel so far this year, Credit Suisse said in a report, $3.84 per barrel higher than a year ago, but nowhere near the $26.18 per barrel margin seen in the Midwestern United States.  Sunoco’s plants, which ran expensive, light, sweet crudes sourced from West Africa and other Atlantic Basin suppliers, also lack sophisticated coking capacity that would enable them profitably to run cheaper, heavy, sour crude, like refiners along the Gulf Coast.  “Sunoco has largely missed out on the strong recovery in refining profits over the last year because of its reliance on higher-cost waterborne feedstock and lack of Midcontinent refining capacity,” Morningstar Equity Research said in a note.  In addition, East Coast plants are further from South American markets, which Gulf Coast refiners have been supplying in greater volumes as demand there grows.  Elsenhans said the strategic review will look at every aspect of the company and determine the best way to unlock value for shareholders, including governance, management, uses of cash and potential sales of other operating units.  “Everything is on the table,” she said.  Sunoco expects a pretax non-cash charge of $1.9-$2.2 billion in the third quarter related to impairment of the plant and equipment in its refineries.  If the processing units are idled, additional pretax charges of up to $500 million may be incurred.  Sunoco has already completed the sale of its 170,000-bpd Toledo refinery in Ohio to PBF Holding for $400 million. In May, it sold a chemicals plant in Philadelphia to Honeywell International (HON.N) for about $85 million.  Sunoco also spun off its coal production unit SunCoke Energy (SXC.N).

34,HON,"UPDATE 3-Sunoco to exit refining; focus on pipeline, retail ops"," * Has begun process to sell Philadelphia, Marcus Hook refineries   * Credit Suisse to assist in strategic review process   (Adds details, Sunoco CEO comment, comments from LUKOIL, background)	   Sept 6 (Reuters) - U.S.-based energy company Sunoco Inc  plans to exit its low-margin refining business to focus on its more-profitable pipeline and retail marketing operations.	   The move is the latest shift in the U.S. refining market that has seen Marathon Oil splitting off its refining arm and ConocoPhillips seeking to break into two, as companies reorganize businesses to adjust to the changing economics in the oil products markets.	   Sunoco’s refining margins are weighed down as it processes more expensive grades of oil in the U.S. East Coast where it has its refineries. Other refiners, in contrast, source less costly crude in the middle of the country where supplies are large.	   “Given the unacceptable financial performance of these assets... it is in the best interests of shareholders to exit this business and focus on our profitable retail and logistics businesses,” Chief Executive Lynn Elsenhans said in a statement.	   Sunoco has tried to differentiate its refining business by running high acid crude streams to increase margins, but these crudes necessitate longer maintenance turnarounds to deal with the damage done to the refinery from the acid.	   Its refineries also do not have coking capacity, so they cannot run heavy, sour crude streams without producing a lot of residual fuel oil — for which is there is no market. 	   Cokers are used to destroy that residual fuel oil and produce more gasoline and distillate.	   The company has begun a process to sell its 335,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Philadelphia refinery and the 178,000 bpd Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, refinery.	   Sunoco said it would pursue all options to sell the refineries, but if it was unable to strike a suitable deal, it would idle the main processing units at the facilities in July next year.	   Two potential buyers could be Norwegian oil company Statoil  and Russia’s second-biggest oil producer LUKOIL  . 	   At present LUKOIL is not interested in purchasing any refining capacities, especially in the USA, the company said in an e-mailed response. Statoil did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.	 	   The company will hold a strategic review to explore ways to use its “strong cash position and maximize the potential for its logistics and retail businesses.” Credit Suisse will assist Sunoco in the strategic review process.	   Sunoco’s retail marketing arm, which sells gasoline and middle distillates, runs convenience stores in at least 23 states. 	   Its logistics business, operated by Sunoco Logistics Partners LP , has refined product and crude oil pipelines as well as terminals.	   Sunoco expects a pretax non-cash charge of $1.9-$2.2 billion in the third quarter related to impairment of the plant and equipment in its refineries.

35,HON,Exclusive: United Tech seeks $10-20 billion for deal,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for a U.S. acquisition that could shape up as its biggest takeover in a decade, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Investors immediately bid up shares of smaller aerospace suppliers Goodrich Corp GR.N, Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N) on Friday betting that the diversified U.S. manufacturer could buy one of them and kick-start a wave of consolidation in the aerospace and defense sector.  Goodrich, which is benefiting from rising demand for equipment for large commercial aircraft, makes the most strategic sense for United Tech, according to people familiar with the industry but not directly involved in the deal. Its chief executive, Marshall Larsen, is preparing to retire in the next couple of years.  Shares of Goodrich rose 7.4 percent on the NYSE, giving it a market value of $11.6 billion. The stock surged another 21 percent after-hours on increasing speculation that Goodrich is United Tech’s most likely target.  Rockwell Collins is also a good strategic fit for United Tech, industry insiders say, although compared to Goodrich, its revenue is more dependent on the defense sector, which faces budget cuts in the United States and Europe. Rockwell Collins shares closed up 7.8 percent on the NYSE to give it a market value of $8.6 billion.  Mergers could help the aerospace industry cut costs and boost capacity to meet booming demand from aircraft manufacturers.  A mid-tier aerospace company joining the United Tech group would gain access to more work, said Jim McAleese, a Washington-based defense consultant.  “It would also expand United Technologies’ footprint into the premium commercial aerospace portfolios, beyond their current work in engines through Pratt & Whitney,” he said.  United Tech, which has a market value of about $68 billion, is still working on terms of an offer and any potential bid could still fall apart, said the people with direct knowledge of the situation. They asked not to be identified as the plans are confidential.  Officials at United Tech, which makes products ranging from helicopters to air conditioners, declined to comment, as did those at Goodrich, Rockwell Collins and Textron.  A deal of this scale would be United Tech’s largest takeover attempt since its unsuccessful bid for Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) in 2000. Since then, its largest acquisitions have been in the $1 billion to $3 billion range as it built up its fire and security division.  United Tech shareholders took the news in stride. Its shares edged 0.1 percent lower to close at $75.50 on a day the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which United Tech is a component, rose 0.7 percent.  For most of the past five years, United Tech has budgeted $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year for takeovers, regularly making deals that are small enough that the Hartford, Connecticut-based company does not disclose their size.  Company officials have repeatedly said they are interested in more deals, and in July Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes suggested United Tech would not shy away from larger targets.  “You’re going to see us put our balance sheet to work, you’re going to see us put more cash to work on the M&A side,” Hayes said. “That’s where I think a big piece of growth is going to come from in the next few years; it’s going to come from the M&A.”  United Tech officials have expressed particular interest in targets to merge into its Fire and Security and Hamilton Sundstrand security and aircraft components arms. Both divisions are below Chief Executive Louis Chenevert’s $10 billion annual revenue target.  Acquiring either Goodrich or Rockwell, which are big suppliers to United Tech, could help the company weather the expected downturn in defense spending in the United States and Europe by giving it a larger share of the smaller pie that will remain, according to industry executives.  U.S. congressional leaders last month agreed to cut $350 billion from national security spending over the next decade.  For some veterans of the industry, the decline in defense spending brings to mind the late 1980s and early 1990s, when top U.S. defense officials told companies they should consider joining forces to cut costs.  “This definitely feels like a return to those times,” said one industry executive. “There are a lot of second-tier companies that will very likely be absorbed.”  Being acquired by a conglomerate like United Tech could allow the target company to retain some independence. United Tech has five divisions that operate under their own brand names, including Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand.  Brian Langenberg, who follows United Tech at Langenberg & Co, said he would trust them to do a large-scale acquisition, even if it meant taking on substantial debt.  “You don’t get that many swings at something that size. It’s a disciplined company,” Langenberg said. “I’ve never seen them do something that doesn’t make sense.”  As of July, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners had done just $184 million in acquisitions this year and had $5.4 billion in cash on hand.  “UTX is well capitalized, corporate debt rates are near historical lows and the recent market sell-off has potentially made purchase prices a little more attractive,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard in a note to clients.  Chenevert, who came up through the company’s aerospace business and headed Pratt & Whitney before taking the top job, holds up his $1.8 billion acquisition of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) security business as the ideal deal.  In 2008, United Tech made a hostile $2.64 billion takeover offer for Diebold Inc (DBD.N), a maker of automated teller machines. That effort was ultimately fruitless, and Chenevert has since said he would be reluctant to go hostile again.

For most of the past five years, United Tech has budgeted $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year for takeovers, regularly making deals that are small enough that the Hartford, Connecticut-based company does not disclose their size.   Company officials have repeatedly said they are interested in more deals, and in July Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes suggested United Tech would not shy away from larger targets.   “You’re going to see us put our balance sheet to work, you’re going to see us put more cash to work on the M&A side,” Hayes said. “That’s where I think a big piece of growth is going to come from in the next few years; it’s going to come from the M&A.”   United Tech officials have expressed particular interest in targets to merge into its Fire and Security and Hamilton Sundstrand security and aircraft components arms. Both divisions are below Chief Executive Louis Chenevert’s $10 billion annual revenue target.   Acquiring either Goodrich or Rockwell, which are big suppliers to United Tech, could help the company weather the expected downturn in defense spending in the United States and Europe by giving it a larger share of the smaller pie that will remain, according to industry executives.   U.S. congressional leaders last month agreed to cut $350 billion from national security spending over the next decade.   For some veterans of the industry, the decline in defense spending brings to mind the late 1980s and early 1990s, when top U.S. defense officials told companies they should consider joining forces to cut costs.   “This definitely feels like a return to those times,” said one industry executive. “There are a lot of second-tier companies that will very likely be absorbed.”   Being acquired by a conglomerate like United Tech could allow the target company to retain some independence. United Tech has five divisions that operate under their own brand names, including Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand.   Brian Langenberg, who follows United Tech at Langenberg & Co, said he would trust them to do a large-scale acquisition, even if it meant taking on substantial debt.   “You don’t get that many swings at something that size. It’s a disciplined company,” Langenberg said. “I’ve never seen them do something that doesn’t make sense.”   As of July, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners had done just $184 million in acquisitions this year and had $5.4 billion in cash on hand.   “UTX is well capitalized, corporate debt rates are near historical lows and the recent market sell-off has potentially made purchase prices a little more attractive,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard in a note to clients.   Chenevert, who came up through the company’s aerospace business and headed Pratt & Whitney before taking the top job, holds up his $1.8 billion acquisition of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) security business as the ideal deal.   In 2008, United Tech made a hostile $2.64 billion takeover offer for Diebold Inc (DBD.N), a maker of automated teller machines. That effort was ultimately fruitless, and Chenevert has since said he would be reluctant to go hostile again.

38,HON,UTX exploring Goodrich takeover: sources,"(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is exploring a takeover of aerospace company Goodrich Corp GR.N but the two sides are not yet close to a deal, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.  Reuters reported on Friday that United Technologies was lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for a U.S. acquisition that could shape up as its biggest takeover in a decade.  Investors bid up shares of aerospace companies on the news, with speculation increasingly focused on Goodrich. The stock rose to as high as $112 in after-hours trading on Friday, valuing Goodrich at $14 billion.  A move by United Tech could mark the start of a more aggressive phase of consolidation in the aerospace sector to prepare for cuts in defense spending in the United States and Europe.  Mergers could help the industry lower costs and boost capacity to meet booming demand for components used in commercial aircraft.  Goodrich is benefiting from rising demand for equipment for large planes and sales tied to servicing and parts.  The company has solid exposure to growing commercial aircraft programs. For instance, it supplies a host of parts to EADS unit Airbus, and will design the nacelle and thrust reversers for the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine that is an option for the A320neo aircraft family.  Charlotte, N.C.-based Goodrich also supplies electronic braking and a host of other critical systems to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which got U.S. government approval to enter into commercial passenger service last month (August 2011).  Defense and space accounts for about one-third of total Goodrich sales. The company has focused its military strategy on products that guide missiles and gather and process intelligence data.  CEO Marshall Larsen, a 34-year company veteran, told Reuters in June that he’ll reach Goodrich’s mandatory retirement age of 65 in a couple of years.

41,HON,"Exclusive: United Tech, Goodrich near deal: sources","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is negotiating the final terms of an all-cash acquisition of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N with the goal of reaching a deal in the next few days, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which were seen as the only possible contenders big enough to buy Goodrich, are unlikely to enter a bidding war, according to several people familiar with the companies’ thinking.  People familiar with the discussion between United Technologies and Goodrich declined to elaborate on the likely price and cautioned the talks could still fall apart.  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is advising United Tech and also offering financing, while Goodrich is being advised by Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX and Citigroup Inc (C.N), the sources said.  An acquisition of Goodrich, which has a market capitalization of about $14 billion, would be the biggest deal in a decade for United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Otis elevators and Carrier heating and air conditioning systems.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Goodrich’s aircraft products include landing gear and wheels and brakes, fuel pumping systems, seating and nacelles, the enclosed structure in which the engine is housed or cargo is carried.  Adding Goodrich would help United Technologies build critical mass in aerospace as rising demand for fuel-saving aircraft spurs airline orders.  At the same time, new aircraft programs such as the Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus EAD.PA A320neo — which Goodrich supplies — are set to ramp up production.  Goodrich could also provide a buffer for United Technologies as some of its units face headwinds because of a declining defense spending outlook.  Reuters first reported on Friday that United Tech was lining up financing of $10 billion to $20 billion for a takeover of a U.S. company.  Goodrich would be a “game changer for the company and a catalyst for additional M&A,” said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy in Fairfax, Virginia.  “This will put pressure on competitors of United Technologies to make their own deals, to broaden their own abilities, to create more integrated systems,” he added.  Industry executives said there would be some overlap in the areas of service and maintenance, making nacelles and landing gear, but said they did not expect significant opposition from defense officials.  While a full review of any anti-trust issues only kicks in after a deal is formally announced, no major concerns have been flagged, according to one of the people familiar with the negotiations.  Goodrich shares closed 3.9 percent higher at $111.82 on the New York Stock Exchange, while United Tech rose 0.6 percent to $76.01.  Representatives of United Technologies, Goodrich, Honeywell and GE declined to comment. JPMorgan, Citi and Credit Suisse also declined to comment.

43,HON,US architecture billings index rebounds in August," * August ABI up 6.3 pts to 51.4 in August   * Project inquiries index up 3.2 pts to 56.9   * Trade group: construction market may have bottomed   NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - A leading indicator of U.S. nonresidential construction activity surprisingly rebounded last month after four months of declines, an architects’ trade group said on Wednesday.   The architecture billings index jumped to 51.4 last month from 45.1 in July, according the American Institute of Architects. Any reading above 50 indicates rising demand for design services, a predictor of construction spending nine to 12 months in the future.   “Based on the poor economic conditions over the last several months, this turnaround in demand for design services is a surprise,” said AIA Chief Economist, Kermit Baker.   A separate index of inquiries for new projects, typically higher than the ABI, rose to 56.9 in August from 53.7.   Architects’ clients continue to struggle to find financing for projects, but the August data suggests the U.S. construction industry may have bottomed, the AIA said.   A depressed construction market has been a headwind for manufacturers of construction machinery and components that make up buildings’ infrastructure, such as electrical, cooling and security systems.   Analysts who cover industrial stocks have called the ABI as important an economic indicator as the monthly industrial data from the Institute for Supply Management.   Most diversified industrial companies get at least some revenue from the non-residential construction sector, which includes office buildings, retail and warehouse space, and institutional buildings such as schools and hospitals.    Companies exposed to the sector include Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Terex Corp (TEX.N).   European companies such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST)  are also significant players in the sector.

It would be the largest acquisition ever for United Tech, boosting the diversified U.S. manufacturer’s presence in the civilian aerospace market. The company, worth $69 billion on the stock market, expects to issue $4.6 billion in new shares and take on about $15 billion in debt to fund the deal.   Goodrich had been on United Tech’s radar since the time of Chenevert’s predecessor as CEO, George David. Talks between Chenevert and Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen began more than a year ago, Chenevert said.   “There was no other property that offered the opportunities that Goodrich offers,” the Canada-born executive told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.   He dismissed reports that Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech had considered other targets in the sector, including Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N). “These other businesses are totally different than what we do. This one happens to do complementary products and systems,” he said.   While the deal looks strategically sound, the $127.50 per share offer price — a 47 percent premium on Goodrich shares before Reuters reported United Tech was on the prowl — was more than investors had expected, said Edward Jones analyst Matt Collins.   “We are disappointed that (United Tech) will be issuing stock to help pay for (Goodrich), in order to maintain its “A” credit rating,” Collins said.   Commercial aviation is expected to be a growth market in coming years, driven in part by strong demand in developing parts of Asia. Goodrich parts are used on Boeing Co’s (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’ A320neo.   Governments in the United States and Western Europe are preparing to cut military spending amid broad budget crunches. Those cutbacks could prompt a new wave of consolidation in the defense sector, with General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) seen as possible buyers.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   For a story on defense consolidation:      [ID:nS1E78I1I4]   Facts about United Tech CEO Chenevert      [ID:nS1E78F1JE]   For a related Breakingviews column:        [ID:nS1E78L0MT]   Graphic on United Tech deals:                              r.reuters.com/byx73s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   United Tech shares were down 8.3 percent on Thursday. Goodrich rose 10.2 percent, the day’s biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange.   Chenevert said he paid little attention to a one-day share slide.   “The market is what the market is going to be today,” he said. “I did this deal because in 10 years, 20 years from now, it (will have been) absolutely the right thing to do.”   Together, the companies will generate $66 billion in revenue this year, though the deal is not expected to close until mid-2012 and may not boost United Tech’s earnings for another two years after that.   United Tech will assume $1.9 billion of Goodrich debt.   United Tech currently generates 18 percent of its revenue from the U.S. military, and expects that percentage to rise a couple of points as a result of the deal. Goodrich generates about one-third of its revenue from military sales.   If successful, the deal will be United Tech’s largest acquisition ever. In 2000 it made a $36 billion offer for Honeywell but was outbid by General Electric Co (GE.N). The GE-Honeywell combination was ultimately nixed by European regulators.   United Tech, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, said it would throttle back on other spending for the next few years as it digests the Goodrich deal.   It also plans to freeze share buybacks through 2012, resuming them on a limited basis in 2013 and 2014, and will cut its typical takeover budget to $1 billion a year from $2 billion. Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said those moves were necessary to protect the company’s “A” credit rating, which he views as “sacrosanct.”   Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit outlook on United Tech to “negative” from “stable” as a result of the move, saying that it could lower its rating on the company as it issues new debt. Fitch also said it would review the company’s rating.   The company believes it will be able to generate $350 million to $400 million a year in cost savings through the combination with Goodrich, Hayes said.   JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is leading a $15 billion loan package to fund the deal, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) also involved.

48,HON,"Ingersoll Rand cuts profit view, shares tumble","(Reuters) - Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N) cut its profit forecast for the rest of the year on Friday, blaming weak demand in North America for residential heating and cooling systems and commercial security products.  The warning sent shares of the U.S. maker of air conditioners and locks down as much as 18 percent to their lowest level in more than two years, and came as Wall Street is getting nervous that corporate profit growth may be slowing.  Analysts, on average, look for the companies that make up the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX to report 13.5 percent earnings growth in the third quarter, down from an average forecast of 17 percent as of July 1.  “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that residential markets were not going to be doing anything substantial for a company’s results,” said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Research. “This (Ingersoll forecast) is a warning sign, to show you that improving profits and beating guidance is not going to be easy for a while.”  Electric products maker Cooper Industries Plc CBE.N also cited weak demand for products used in residential and commercial buildings when it cut its third-quarter forecast earlier this month.  Ingersoll’s troubles are twofold: The second-half recovery in consumer demand for air conditioning and security systems that it expected has not materialized, and consumers who have replaced air conditioners or heaters have opted for lower-priced units, rather than the more profitable, and more expensive, high-efficiency systems, analysts said.  The Ingersoll cut could be the start of a wave of earnings warnings in the industrial sector, which is grappling with weak demand in the United States and Europe, one analyst said.  “My feeling is this is the first of many in the industrial space in the next couple of weeks,” said Eric Landry, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.  Ingersoll, which is headquartered in Davidson, North Carolina, but incorporated in Dublin, generates 67 percent of its revenue in North America. That makes it more reliant on its home market than bigger U.S. industrials, including General Electric Co (GE.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which have used growth in Asia and the Middle East to offset sluggish U.S. spending.  Ingersoll shares were down $4.21, or 13 percent, at $27.75 in early-afternoon trading, the sharpest decline on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of $26.13 earlier in the session. The earlier low marked Ingersoll’s biggest one-day drop since the 1987 “Black Monday” stock market crash.  The Standard & Poor’s capital-goods industry index .GSPIC was down 1.9 percent, and U.S. stocks were broadly lower as investors worried the global economy is slowing.  Ingersoll, which makes Schlage locks and Trane air conditioners, cut its third-quarter profit forecast to a range of 77 cents to 80 cents per share. At its midpoint, that is down 12.8 percent from the company’s prior forecast and would represent a decline from 80 cents per share in the year-earlier third quarter.  Analysts were expecting the company to post a profit of 91 cents a share for the quarter before special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  For the year, Ingersoll now expects earnings of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. At its midpoint, that is down 8 percent from prior guidance and below the $2.96 per share Wall Street had looked for.  The Ingersoll warning did not catch investors entirely unawares. Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan earlier this month cut his third-quarter forecasts on a range of big industrials, including Ingersoll, GE, SPX Corp SPW.N and 3M Co (MMM.N), warning that he expected forecast cuts.  Not all the recent news from the sector has been as bleak. Last week Honeywell said its third-quarter earnings would likely come in at the high end of its forecast range of 96 cents to $1.01 per share.

The warning sent shares of the U.S. maker of air conditioners and locks down as much as 18 percent to their lowest level in more than two years, and came as Wall Street is getting nervous that corporate profit growth may be slowing.   Analysts, on average, look for the companies that make up the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX to report 13.5 percent earnings growth in the third quarter, down from an average forecast of 17 percent as of July 1.   “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that residential markets were not going to be doing anything substantial for a company’s results,” said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Research. “This (Ingersoll forecast) is a warning sign, to show you that improving profits and beating guidance is not going to be easy for a while.”   Electric products maker Cooper Industries Plc CBE.N also cited weak demand for products used in residential and commercial buildings when it cut its third-quarter forecast earlier this month. [ID:nL3E7KF3UM]   Ingersoll’s troubles are twofold: The second-half recovery in consumer demand for air conditioning and security systems that it expected has not materialized, and consumers who have replaced air conditioners or heaters have opted for lower-priced units, rather than the more profitable, and more expensive, high-efficiency systems, analysts said.   The Ingersoll cut could be the start of a wave of earnings warnings in the industrial sector, which is grappling with weak demand in the United States and Europe, one analyst said.   “My feeling is this is the first of many in the industrial space in the next couple of weeks,” said Eric Landry, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.   Ingersoll, which is headquartered in Davidson, North Carolina, but incorporated in Dublin, generates 67 percent of its revenue in North America. That makes it more reliant on its home market than bigger U.S. industrials, including General Electric Co (GE.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which have used growth in Asia and the Middle East to offset sluggish U.S. spending.   Ingersoll shares were down $4.21, or 13 percent, at $27.75 in early-afternoon trading, the sharpest decline on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of $26.13 earlier in the session. The earlier low marked Ingersoll’s biggest one-day drop since the 1987 “Black Monday” stock market crash.   The Standard & Poor’s capital-goods industry index .GSPIC was down 1.9 percent, and U.S. stocks were broadly lower as investors worried the global economy is slowing.   Ingersoll, which makes Schlage locks and Trane air conditioners, cut its third-quarter profit forecast to a range of 77 cents to 80 cents per share. At its midpoint, that is down 12.8 percent from the company’s prior forecast and would represent a decline from 80 cents per share in the year-earlier third quarter.   Analysts were expecting the company to post a profit of 91 cents a share for the quarter before special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   For the year, Ingersoll now expects earnings of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. At its midpoint, that is down 8 percent from prior guidance and below the $2.96 per share Wall Street had looked for.   The Ingersoll warning did not catch investors entirely unawares. Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan earlier this month cut his third-quarter forecasts on a range of big industrials, including Ingersoll, GE, SPX Corp SPW.N and 3M Co (MMM.N), warning that he expected forecast cuts.   Not all the recent news from the sector has been as bleak. Last week Honeywell said its third-quarter earnings would likely come in at the high end of its forecast range of 96 cents to $1.01 per share.

50,HON,Echelon eyes smart grid growth away from home,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Smart grid infrastructure firm Echelon Corporation’s chief executive said he saw more opportunities in Europe and the rest of the world than at home, where there is little appetite to upgrade power networks.  “We have 20 percent more supply of electricity in the U.S. than there is demand, and no political will,” Ron Sege said in an interview on the sidelines of an industry conference in Amsterdam.  “At least in Europe you have political will, the 2020 mandates, France reaffirming its commitment, and Germany moving slowly along,” added Sege, whose company made 70 percent of its revenue in Europe in the last quarter.  Smart grids are designed to accommodate a range of generation options, including renewables, and to provide customers and utilities with more real-time information, enabling them to manage usage and supply more efficiently.  A drive to better track household energy use, smooth demand surges and curb overall power usage has driven a surge in demand for smart grids worldwide, although economic concerns have made investors wary about utilities cutting back investment.  Sege acknowledged this was a possibility but said there was no change to the company’s guidance to investors and that Echelon would do well because it was focused on power markets where demand exceeded supply and demand management was needed.  In May Japanese electronics giant Toshiba forecast that the global smart grid market would grow six fold to 5.8 trillion yen ($75.6 billion) over the next decade as it announced the $2.3 billion takeover of Swiss-based smart meter maker Landis+Gyr.  The European Commission expects 200 million smart meters to be installed by 2020 in the European Union, with an investment totaling 40 billion euros ($53 billion).  The U.S. has been reluctant to follow suit, struggling to justify the costs involved.  “The stimulus of 2008 was the last political statement that the government has made, and there are questions as to whether the government should be investing in, or mandating, this kind of energy efficiencies,” Sege said.  Demand for smart grid will be tempered in the U.S. in the next few years, as opposed to Europe, where Scandinavian countries are leading the way, defying Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, Sege added.  “Scandinavian countries generally continue to move aggressively to invest, with windmills everywhere; they have made a strong political decision to move to a green economy, and they have put their money where their mouth is,” Sege said.  Outside Europe, Sege sees strong potential in China and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, South Africa and Latin American markets, particularly Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Mexico.  “I was touring one of our factories in China, and the guy said we had to hurry up because the power was going out at 1 o’clock. The workers then were off to another factory up the street. Rationing is just a way of life in China, so they have tremendous need for demand-side management,” Sege said.  Echelon, which boasts Honeywell and Siemens among its clients, is looking to replicate the model of striking partnerships to expand geographically, such as its deals with meter suppliers Holley Metering in China and ELO Sistemas Electronicos in Brazil, Sege said on Tuesday.  Echelon, which competes with Elster Group and Itron, is more than a smart meter provider, and its portfolio across the smart grid infrastructure had allowed its pricing power to hold up better than its competitors, Sege said.  “Our labor costs in China have gone up, and we did indicate that this will cause some short-term problems from a profitability perspective, but commodity prices are coming down, and in general our manufacturing efficiency is going up,” he added.  Echelon is targeting gross margin of 45 percent in the long term. “We think we can get back to our historic margin levels over time,” Sege said.

51,HON,Business jet industry looks to 2012 for growth,"(Reuters) - The business jet industry is expecting 2012 to mark its first year of growth in deliveries since the financial downturn, but more pain could still be ahead for the low end of the segment that has been hardest hit. “2011 did not play out as we expected to see the growth and orders being placed, so we’re shifting our hopes to 2012,” said Jens Hennig, vice president of operations at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based international group that tracks noncommercial aviation. Honeywell International, maker of avionics and engines, also thinks better times are coming. “We believe 2011 will be the low point,” said Rob Wilson, president of Honeywell’s business and general aviation unit. Unit deliveries will rise 3 to 5 percent in 2012 as new models such as the long-range Gulfstream G650 enter service, Honeywell projected in its annual business aviation outlook released on Saturday. Demand for business jets fell in 2009 after five years of growth in deliveries as companies clamped down on spending after the global financial crisis peaked in 2008 and tighter credit made purchases difficult. Business jet shipments fell again in 2010 and were down about 27 percent through the first six months of this year, according to GAMA data on worldwide deliveries. (For a graphic of shipments click on link.reuters.com/pyq34s ) Volatile financial markets and fears that the economy could get worse are weighing on buyers. “The classic indicator for business jet deliveries is corporate profits, which are at record levels,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. “The problem is that people are reluctant to spend.” Larger jets, used by bigger companies and extremely wealthy individuals, have fared better than smaller ones whose chief clients include small business customers that have been pinched in the downturn. Deliveries of large jets rose 13 percent from 2008 to 2010, while light-jet shipments fell 61 percent during that time, according to data from the manufacturers’ association. Companies that offer larger business jets include General Dynamics’ Gulfstream unit. Those that cater to the smaller end of the market include Textron Inc’s Cessna and privately held Hawker Beechcraft. “The larger the jet, the more positive the market feeling is,” said Eddy Pieniazek, director at the global aviation consultancy Ascend. “That small end is bouncing along the bottom and requires some more consistent economic growth to push it forward.” The lower end of the market could see more restructurings or consolidation if a recovery takes longer to play out, some said. “There’s too much private jet manufacturing capacity, and I don’t think it all survives,” said Kenneth Ricci, principal at Directional Aviation Capital, a private investment firm. “I don’t think we have all this production capacity five years from now.” Slumping orders and rising cancellations led smaller-jet makers such as Cessna, Hawker and Bombardier to cut U.S. jobs in recent years. GAMA said its members have laid off 20,000 people in the United States since the fall of 2008. Companies that specialize in smaller aircraft will have difficulty in the longer term and could see significant structural changes, Ricci said. “I think there’ll be mergers, there’ll be consolidation,” said Ricci. “The net result will be less manufacturing capacity for the private aircraft business, less supply and I think ultimately that will then drive the recovery.” Teal Group’s Aboulafia also said the smaller-jet sector could be in for more pain. “If there isn’t some kind of recovery, then something needs to happen,” said Aboulafia. “Either you’ll see growth or someone needs to go.” ",10092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-businessjets/business-jet-industry-looks-to-2012-for-growth-idUSTRE79802620111009

53,HON,PREVIEW-Investors to manufacturers: what about next year?,"* United Technologies, Textron report on Oct. 19 * Ingersoll Rand, Danaher report on Oct. 20 * GE, Honeywell report on Oct. 21 * Caterpillar, Eaton report on Oct. 24 * 3M, Illinois Tool Works report on Oct. 25 By Scott Malone BOSTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - “Forget about where you’ve been. Tell us where you’re going.” That’s the message from investors to big U.S. manufacturers ahead of a wave of earnings reports over the next few weeks. They will be far less interested in hearing how the third quarter went than what companies expect next year to be like and how they are preparing for it. While early earnings reports from big companies including Alcoa Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co disappointed investors, analysts are still expecting the industrial sector to chalk up solid third-quarter profit growth of 15.2 percent across the sector, above the 12.5 percent forecast for the full Standard & Poor’s 500 index . Chief executives are likely to push back on questions about their 2012 outlooks — big companies including General Electric Co , United Technologies Corp and Honeywell International Inc typically wait until December to discuss their forecast for the next year. But some investors say the European debt crisis and signs of slowing demand will make them eager for an earlier update. The memory of the sharp downturn following the late 2008 credit crunch is still fresh in their minds. “Are managements going to retrench as quickly and as deeply in the event of a credit moment in Europe or China as they did last time around?” said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio. “What we want to hear is a dose of reality. What are you planning, what’s your contingency, what are you actually seeing?” This comes as CEOs of many big U.S. companies say orders are holding up, and one of the main risks they see is that customers will start holding off on orders out of fear that something might happen to hurt the economy. “There is just not enough certainty and in some ways the most important thing we can do right now is social and it has to do with rebuilding confidence,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt told a group of executives from mid-sized U.S. companies in Columbus, Ohio last week. Immelt is due to speak at a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event in New York on Monday. Heading into the reporting season, not every company has offered a positive view of how the third quarter went. Ingersoll Rand Plc fired a warning shot, saying that profit could be down for the quarter, as demand for heating and cooling equipment that it had earlier expected in North America failed to materialize. But Honeywell confirmed its outlook, saying it expected to come in at the high end of its forecast on strong demand for turbochargers and automation and control equipment. Several factors are working in big manufacturers’ favor: One is that the price of a wide range of metals have fallen, easing pressure on profit margins. The price of copper, particularly important as it used for all sorts of wiring, fell by 25 percent in the third quarter. Another is that many big industrials, including GE, United Technologies and ITT Corp now generate a significant portion of their revenue from maintenance of the products they sell, and that business tends to hold up even when new-equipment sales fall. But the risks are also clear. With growth at home sagging, U.S. multinationals have been counting on foreign demand to drive results. Europe’s economies are being rocked by a sovereign-debt crisis and China is showing signs of slowing. Analysts, on average, have forecast slower growth for big manufacturers in the third quarter versus the first half of the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Among blue-chip names, for GE, they look for earnings to rise 10.7 percent; for United Technologies they see 11.5 percent; for Caterpillar Inc 27 percent, and for 3M Co 5 percent. In addition, some investors say Wall Street’s worries may have gotten ahead of reality. The S&P; capital goods index has fallen some 14 percent over the past six months, a steeper slide than the 8 percent decline of the broad S&P; 500. “We don’t believe there’s going to be a double dip. We do believe we’re in a slow recovery, but this market is behaving like it’s got bipolar disorder,” said Scott Schermerhorn, portfolio manager with Granite Investment Advisors Inc in Concord, New Hampshire, which manages about $500 million in investments and is currently underweight in the industrial sector. “The reason we scaled back on industrials was they were ahead of themselves,” Schermerhorn said. “Now we view industrials as attractive again and we’re actively looking in that space.”",10142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-manufacturing-results/preview-investors-to-manufacturers-what-about-next-year-idUSN1E7990IG20111014

Obstacles remain to resolving the crisis, and important differences still separate major players France and Germany, but investors apparently took it as a positive that their leaders have set a target date of Wednesday for finding a solution. “It’s that hope, it’s that anticipation that they have created,” said Rob Russell, president of Russell & Company in Dayton, Ohio. “The French and the Germans both have a lot to risk. They both have somewhat different ideas they are going to have to have some kind of solution.” The Dow Jones industrial average gained 194.59 points, or 1.69 percent, to 11,736.37. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 18.52 points, or 1.52 percent, to 1,233.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.98 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,635.60. Recent gains have pushed the S&P; 500 to the top end of its trading range between 1,230 and 1,250 where it has struggled to advance. Many investors are looking for progress in Europe before looking to earnings to push equities higher. France’s push to use more European Central Bank money to fight the euro zone debt crisis ran into strong resistance from Germany and other EU partners. Equity markets have been susceptible to wild swings in recent weeks as traders latch on to varying headlines on Europe’s debt crisis, leaving markets prone to volatility heading into the weekend. Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing among S&P; sectors after McDonald’s Corp reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by new menu items in the United States and a tiered-price menu in Europe that includes premium and lower-priced selections. Shares of the fast-food restaurant chain rose 2.9 percent to $91.55. The S&P; consumer discretionary sector gained 2.3 percent. Among industrial companies, Honeywell International Inc shares rose 3.7 percent to $50.29 after it reported better-than-expected results and lifted its earnings outlook.The commercial aerospace company rose as high as 5 percent, its biggest gain since Aug. 23. General Electric Co’s third-quarter earnings rose, meeting Wall Street’s estimate, driven by strong demand from Brazil, Russia and China. The shares fell 1.5 percent to $16.38. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 133 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings through Friday, 68 percent have topped analysts’ expectations.

Shares of the maker of cockpit electronics, auto products and control systems for buildings rose 3.4 percent in morning trading as the company expressed confidence in the near future even as it was seeing signs of an economic slowdown. Honeywell’s earnings were fueled by growth and a recovery of margins in its commercial aerospace business. Honeywell joins a group of U.S. manufacturers, including General Electric Co , reporting strong earnings and taking a conservative approach in the near term to maintain margin growth. “What you’re seeing in the segment is a pattern where companies are beating their numbers” even as they acknowledge concern over the economy, said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co. Honeywell reported third-quarter net income of $862 million, or $1.10 per share, attributable to common shareholders, compared with $598 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.00 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Expectations were pretty high in the first place,” Langenberg said. “This is a materially better company than a couple years ago ... They managed expectations, but they also managed to beat expectations.” Honeywell said net income included a benefit from a lower tax rate equal to 4 cents a share and other gains equal to 33 cents a share. The company made a voluntary contribution to its underfunded pension during the quarter. “Excluding this (pension) contribution, Honeywell’s earnings roughly matched its free cash flow, an indication that earnings quality remains good,” Matt Collins, an analyst with Edward Jones, said in a note to investors. Aerospace sales rose 8 percent due to increased volume, a favorable product mix and productivity improvements. Profit margins in that segment increased to 18.2 percent. Honeywell said it experienced profit growth and margin expansion in all business segments. Sales rose 14 percent to $9.3 billion. Organic sales, or those excluding items like acquisitions, grew 8 percent. The company raised its 2011 sales forecast to a range of $36.5 billion to $36.7 billion, up about 13 percent over 2010. It previously said it expected $36.1 billion to $36.7 billion. The new 2011 earnings forecast of $4.00 to $4.05 a share compares with a prior outlook of $3.85 to $4.00. The company attributed the higher forecast to expectations of growth in its existing units, “despite signals of slower economic growth.” During an interview on CNBC following the earnings release, Chief Executive Dave Cote said the company expected 2012 to be a “slow-growth economy.” Honeywell will stay conservative in terms of capital expenditures and hiring, he said. Collins of Edward Jones said, “While 2012 is expected to be a more challenging year, we expect earnings can continue to grow. With exposure to both commercial aerospace and autos, we believe Honeywell is well positioned to benefit from recovering demand around the world.” Shares of Honeywell were up 3.4 percent at $50.13 in morning trading.",10212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/honeywell/update-4-honeywell-posts-higher-earnings-raises-2011-view-idUSN1E79K04620111021

61,HON,"""Italian Prussian"" Monti enters political storm","ROME (Reuters) - Mario Monti, the economist who will head an emergency Italian government following the departure of Silvio Berlusconi, brings credentials earned in a decade of battles as a European Commissioner from the 1990s. Monti made his name as the powerful Competition Commissioner who took on U.S. corporate titans General Electric and Microsoft, blocking GE’s planned merger with rival Honeywell and imposing a record 497 million euro ($683 million) antitrust fine on the software giant. His technical expertise, sharp intellect and diplomatic skills added to his refusal to bow to intense lobbying pressures made him one of the most highly regarded officials the Commission has seen. “He didn’t have a very Italian way of going about things,” recalls one former ambassador, who worked with Monti in Brussels and remembers him as a hard but reliable negotiating partner. “His nickname in those days was ‘The Italian Prussian.’” He was nominated by Berlusconi as internal markets commissioner in 1994, taking over the competition portfolio in 1999 where he served for five years. Named last week as Senator for Life by President Giorgio Napolitano, Monti, 68, is expected to appoint a small cabinet made up largely of technical specialists to steer Italy through a crisis that has brought it to the brink of financial disaster. A similar technocrat government under former Bank of Italy official Lamberto Dini passed important reforms in 1995 and the hope of many outside Italy is that Monti, or some other independent outsider, could do the same. A convinced free marketeer with close connections to the European and global policy making elite, Monti has always backed a more closely integrated euro zone and has written a series of articles in recent months lambasting the Berlusconi government’s policy failures. He is chairman of the European branch of the Trilateral Commission, a body that brings together the power elites of the United States, Europe and Japan and is also a member of the secretive Bilderberg Group of business leaders and other “leading citizens.” With bond markets pushing Rome ever closer to the point where it would need an international bailout to manage its towering public debt, investors’ hopes have been pinned on a solution that would get past Italy’s dysfunctional politics. Italy’s main business and banking associations have called for a “national emergency government” with broad parliamentary backing, warning that “this is not the moment for conflict and division.” Monti himself underlined the temptation of a non-political solution in an article in August entitled “Il podesta forestiero,” a reference to the foreign governors or “podestas” appointed by the strife-torn Italian cities of the Middle Ages. The article referred to reform demands imposed by the European Central Bank in return for its agreement to prop up Italian bonds in the markets, but it highlighted the widespread frustration at the failings of Italy’s political class. However as numerous politicians have pointed out over the past few days, the notion of a pure “technical government” above the daily fray is an illusion which is likely to be severely tested in the weeks and months ahead. “He has a good feeling for how politics works but he isn’t a man for horse trading,” said one longtime associate.

Honeywell has projected sales of $37.8 billion to $38.9 billion in 2012 and earnings per share of $4.25 to $4.50, which would represent growth of between 5 percent and 11 percent from 2011. It had projected sales of $41 billion to $45 billion for 2014. The company did not give a forecast for 2013. Analysts, on average, expect earnings per share this year of $4.44 and sales of $38.50 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company forecast “high-growth region” sales increasing to $8 billion this year and $10 billion in 2014, from $7.2 billion in 2011. “China and India have been the principal engines of this growth story,” said Shane Tedjarti, chief executive and president of high growth regions, adding that Honeywell sees Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Turkey among its next top international opportunities. The company, based in Morris Township, New Jersey, has said that strong demand for aircraft components would boost its fortunes this year, offsetting declining demand for automation systems used in large commercial buildings. “Strategy stays consistent,” focused on diverse products, businesses and geographies, Chief Executive Officer David Cote said in a Webcast of the company’s investor conference. “I like having a lot of bets in a lot of places, and we’re  not going to change that,” said Cote, who has been at the company for a decade.

73,HON,"Honeywell profit jumps, 2012 forecast raised","(Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) reported higher quarterly results and raised its earnings forecast for the full year, saying rising demand in the United States and high-growth markets were more than offsetting softness in Europe. The company said its commercial aerospace segment and its specialty materials businesses, known as UOP, drove up first-quarter earnings, and it forecast increased sales and profit for the second quarter. UOP, which includes catalysts and absorbents used in refining oil, benefited from strong demand in both refining and petrochemical segments, executives told analysts on a Friday conference call. Bolstered by its new product development and geographic expansion, Honeywell expects to post higher earnings in 2012 even in an uneven global economy. “We said were going to assume Europe was in recession for the whole year, and unfortunately, I think we are going to be right,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote said on the call. “Fortunately, we planned for it.” Honeywell shares rose 3.3 percent to $59.95 in midday trading and were up 10.4 percent year-to-date. “It’s starting to become one of those sleep-at-night stocks where it was once a company that was a little bit accident-prone,” said Scott Davis, managing director at Barclays Capital. “We’ve seen a consistency of execution, where they can have a business or couple of businesses that are weaker, like turbo and Europe, and it doesn’t hurt them that much,” he added. “You do see a runway toward continued strong performance.” Current growth is occurring without much of a housing market turnaround, and will be further underpinned once that takes hold, analysts said. Honeywell’s results came the same day that the largest U.S. conglomerate, General Electric (GE.N), reported results that topped forecasts on strong demand for energy equipment and railroad locomotives. The company, whose products range from cockpit electronics to control systems for large buildings, said earnings had risen to $825 million, or $1.04 per share, from $708 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Last month, the Morris Township, New Jersey-based company told analysts that it expected a profit of 96 cents to 98 cents a share. Sales increased 7 percent to $9.3 billion, above the $9.15 billion that analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Honeywell raised its forecast for 2012 earnings from continuing operations to a range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share from $4.25 to $4.50. The strength of UOP, whose revenue rose 40 percent in the first quarter, “should continue as orders were up over 50 percent,” Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan wrote in a note. The company’s profit topped Nomura’s estimates, he said. “There’s not a lot to pick at.” In a slide presentation before the conference call, the company forecast second-quarter earnings of $1.09 to $1.13 per share from continuing operations, up 9 percent to 13 percent from a year earlier. It said it expected a 4 percent to 6 percent increase in second-quarter sales, to between $9.4 billion and $9.6 billion. Honeywell said it now expected full-year sales of $38.0 billion to $38.6 billion, narrowing the range of its forecast of $37.8 billion to $38.9 billion given last month.

77,HON,Honeywell CEO sees long slump ahead for Europe,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) expects continued weak demand in Europe this year due to the ongoing debt crisis, Chief Executive David Cote said on Monday. “Europe continues to be weak,” Cote said at an investor conference. “There is a good chance that in Europe we wind up with something like a Japanese decade.” He was referring to Japan’s prolonged period of slow economic growth, which followed the bursting of the Asian read estate bubble in the early 1990s.

82,HON,TEXT-Fitch affirms Honeywell at 'A/F1';outlook stable,"June 08 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed Honeywell International Inc.’s (HON) long-term and short-term ratings at ‘A’/‘F1’. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full rating list is provided at the end of this release. HON’s ratings incorporate the company’s well-positioned business portfolio, consistent operating performance, product and geographic diversification, and solid financial metrics. Debt to EBITDA was stable at 1.4 times (x) as of March 31, 2012. Free cash flow to total adjusted debt was 14% at March 31, 2012. The measure was below the company’s typical range, largely reflecting the impact of a large pension contribution in 2011. HON’s favorable financial performance reflects growing demand in several important long-cycle markets including commercial aerospace, refining, and petrochemical, as well as HON’s expanding presence in emerging regions. The company’s results also include the impact of a long term refinement of its business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, and improvements to its cost structure. Current restructuring actions are concentrated in the Transportation Systems (TS) and Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segments. Cash restructuring charges of $150 million in 2012 are expected to be offset by a similar amount of expected cash savings. Restructuring is partly associated with approximately $1 billion of acquisitions and nearly $1.2 billion of divestitures during 2011, including the sale of the Consumer Products Group in 2011 for $955 million. The transaction was consistent with the company’s emphasis on higher-growth, technology-centered markets that offer attractive margins. Fitch estimates free cash flow in 2012 could approach $1.3 billion-$1.5 billion compared to $944 billion in 2011. The increase reflects higher earnings and lower pension contributions, partly offset by an increase in capital expenditures. HON plans to increase capital spending to approximately $1.1 billion in 2012 compared to $800 million in 2011. Much of the increase will be used to support expansion in growing markets. Other uses of cash include ongoing payments for asbestos and environmental liabilities. Net payments totaled $307 million in 2011 and are estimated by HON at $466 million in 2012, before taxes. Actual payments related to asbestos liabilities will depend on final resolution of legacy litigation related to NARCO. Asbestos liabilities represent a long term drag on HON’s cash flow, but the amounts are manageable and could eventually begin to decline. HON expects to contribute close to $1 billion of cash to its U.S. pension plans in 2012 compared to $1.65 billion in 2011. The company has made large voluntary contributions during the past several years which has helped offset the negative impact of declining discount rates on pension liabilities. At Dec. 31, 2011, U.S. plans were underfunded by $2.7 billion (82% funded). HON intends to fully fund its pension plans over the next few years. Other rating concerns include the impact of economic weakness in Europe, slowing growth in China, weak construction markets, discretionary cash deployment, and lower defense spending. HON’s defense-related revenue could decline modestly, but the impact is mitigated by a relatively small exposure to overseas contingency operations in the Department of Defense budget where spending cuts are concentrated. A substantial portion of the company’s direct exposure to Europe is through its Turbo and ACS businesses, but restructuring actions in these businesses should position them to adapt to market conditions. Also, the Turbo business has strong positions on new automotive platforms which should moderate the impact of a weak European economy. Fitch believes HON’s discretionary spending for acquisitions and share repurchases will be controlled in the current environment. There has been some weakness in certain of HON’s short cycle markets in the ACS and Specialty Products businesses. Some of these markets could see better conditions later in 2012 if economic concerns do not worsen materially. Rating concerns are mitigated by HON’s consistently strong operating cash flow, financial flexibility, and its ability to maintain relatively steady margins through the previous economic downturn. Fitch anticipates HON will maintain a stable financial profile while it expands existing businesses internally and through acquisitions, and that it will continue to deploy cash for pension contributions, dividend increases, and modest share repurchases. The ratings could be considered for a downgrade in the event that demand in HON’s end markets deteriorates materially and contributes to weaker margins, free cash flow and liquidity. The ratings and outlook could also be negatively affected in the event of large acquisitions or other discretionary spending. Liquidity at March 31, 2012 included $4 billion of cash, much of which is located outside the U.S., and a $3 billion credit facility that matures in 2017. HON also has an on-balance-sheet securitization program of $400 million which was unused at March 31, 2012. Liquidity is offset by $1 billion of short-term debt and approximately $600 million of long term debt scheduled to mature in March 2013. Fitch estimates some of HON’s debt maturities could be refinanced. Other long-term debt maturities are well distributed through 2037. Fitch has affirmed HON’s ratings as follows: —Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A’; —Senior unsecured bank credit facilities at ‘A’; —Senior unsecured debt at ‘A’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F1’; —Commercial paper at ‘F1’. The ratings affect approximately $7.9 billion of debt outstanding at March 31, 2012.",6082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA841820120608

87,HON,"Honeywell profit up 12 percent on solid U.S., cost cuts","(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) posted an 11.7 percent rise in profit that topped analysts’ forecasts, as solid U.S. demand for chemicals and building control systems and cost cuts offset weakness in Europe. Shares of the maker of cockpit electronics and automotive turbochargers were up 6.6 percent — their biggest one-day gain in more than three years — after Honeywell also raised the low end of its 2012 profit forecast. “For 2012 and 2013 we have focused on margin expansion as key to earnings growth, to leverage sales in a tough macroeconomic environment,” Chief Executive David Cote told analysts on a conference call. The company is in the midst of restructuring projects that will cut costs by about $150 million this year and another $125 million next year, Cote said, adding, “we’ll continue to be cautious about adding people.” Second-quarter earnings rose to $905 million, or $1.14 per share, from $810 million or $1.02 per share a year earlier. Analysts’ average forecast was $1.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The result, which came despite weaker-than-expected revenue, showed that Honeywell could perform well even in the face of a debt crisis in Europe — where it generates about 30 percent of its sales — analysts said. “Honeywell clearly is not immune to macro headwinds and evidence of that was apparent in second-quarter top line,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeffrey Sprague wrote in a note to clients, adding that the company is better-positioned than its peers to boost margins due to its practice of steadily tweaking operations to make them more efficient. Better-than-expected operating margins helped earnings grow faster than the 3.8 percent rise in revenue, with strong sales of aviation equipment offsetting a decline in demand for turbochargers, the result of a European auto slump. “We were especially encouraged by continued strength in commercial aerospace after market, North America and productivity benefits,” said BernsteinResearch analyst Steven Winoker. Honeywell shares were up 6.6 percent at $58.16 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier high at $58.49. Officials with the Morris Township, New Jersey-based company said they have been engaged in steady rounds of restructuring since 2009, when the last U.S. recession officially ended, with most of their efforts focused on Europe. Among the changes, Honeywell is shifting some production in its Transportation Systems unit, which makes products including automotive turbochargers, to China from Europe. The aim is both to take advantage of lower costs and to move production into a faster-growing market. “The demand in Europe has gone down ... but we can build a factory in a market where there is growing demand,” said David Anderson, the company’s chief financial officer, adding that its China factory would be able to produce not only for European automakers, but for Asian consumers and for Asian automakers selling to Europe. The company has also combined operations in Europe and elsewhere around the world into fewer buildings, which allows staff to share services and cuts real estate costs, Anderson said. Honeywell this year began tying its employees’ compensation to divisional profit margin targets, to encourage workers to focus on cost. “It’s not just about having the change du jour but really thinking strategically about the linkage of performance and shareholder value and people’s behaviors,” Anderson said. The company on Wednesday also raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast by 5 cents, and now anticipates 2012 earnings of $4.40 to $4.55 per share, representing growth of 9 to 12 percent. The company lowered its full-year sales forecast by $200 million to a range of $37.8 billion to $38.4 billion, reflecting the weakening of the euro. Overall, that still would represent 3 to 5 percent revenue growth, helped by strong demand for specialty chemicals and equipment for aircraft. Even a modest hike to its forecast was welcomed by Wall Street after smaller industrial peers including conglomerate Dover Corp (DOV.N), engine maker Cummins Inc CMI.M and electronic connector maker TE Connectivity Ltd (TEL.N) cut their projections earlier this month. “In this environment, we consider this a positive guide,” said Nomura Equity Research analyst Shannon O’Callaghan. Investors will gain a broader sense of the sector’s health over the coming week as top U.S. manufacturers including United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), General Electric Co (GE.N), Danaher Corp (DHR.N) and Ingersoll-Rand Co (IR.N) release results.

The company on Wednesday also raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast by 5 cents, and now anticipates 2012 earnings of $4.40 to $4.55 per share, representing growth of 9 percent to 12 percent. It said it expected to push profit margins higher this year, which would offset lower-than-previously forecast sales. Chief Executive David Cote said the company, which also makes automotive turbochargers and cockpit electronics, faces an “increasingly uncertain global economic environment.” Honeywell shares rose 1.5 percent to $55.35 in premarket trading, from a $54.54 close on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are little changed for the year, lagging an 8 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.

91,HON,"3M, Honeywell step up deals amid economic uncertainty","(Reuters) - 3M Co and Honeywell International Inc signed separate takeover deals to further diversify their broad lineups of industrial goods at a time of uncertainty for the world economy, the large U.S. manufacturers said on Monday. 3M said it would pay $860 million to buy industrial ceramics company Ceradyne Inc, the biggest takeover deal for the maker of products ranging from Post-It notes to films used in television screens since it named Inge Thulin chief executive officer in February. Honeywell announced plans to pay $525 million in cash for a 70 percent stake in privately held Thomas Russell Co, which makes equipment used in natural gas production. Big U.S. manufacturers including General Electric Co have invested heavily to boost their exposure to that sector amid a surge in U.S. natural gas production driven by advances in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology. The announcements come less than two weeks after the CEOs of both Honeywell and 3M separately said that a worrisome world economic outlook was making it easier to negotiate acquisitions by tempering expectations of what companies would fetch. 3M’s shares were up 1.5 percent, despite some analysts’ concerns that it may not have gotten Ceradyne for a bargain, paying a 43 percent premium on its Friday closing price, said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. “The valuation is pretty full on this one,” Windau said. “But it does fit nicely with 3M and what their fundamental business is, and that is the materials sector. It makes a lot of sense for them.” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Richard Tortoriello said 3M had paid a fair price for Ceradyne, whose shares were down about 9 percent this year as of Friday. Ceradyne stock was up 42.9 percent at $34.92 in early afternoon trading, just below the $35 offer price from 3M, whose shares gained 1.5 percent to $93.79. Honeywell rose 2 percent to $60.94. The deals come despite a host of worries sapping corporate confidence. Among them are concerns the U.S. fiscal cliff that could force sharp year-end spending cuts by the federal government, Europe’s debt crisis and slowing growth in Asia. In response, U.S. industrials have stepped up their pace of dealmaking. So far in 2012, they had announced $50.93 billion in mergers as of Sunday, up 7.2 percent from a year earlier. During that time, the overall pace of U.S. dealmaking has declined 23.1 percent to $593.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. “When times are bad and everybody is uncertain about the future, that is the right time to buy,” Honeywell CEO Dave Cote said last month, reasoning that acquisitions made in boom times are more likely to be overvalued. Serial buyers, such as 3M and Honeywell, tend to study takeover targets for an extended time before making an offer, moving only when they feel they will be able to negotiate a price that matches their valuation models, said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co. “If the asset makes sense and the price makes sense, you go for it,” Langenberg said. Not every company in the sector is looking to bulk up, though. Tyco International Ltd on Monday completed its three-way breakup, with the remaining parent company focused on commercial fire and security products, with its former consumer alarm business now trading as ADT Corp and its former water operations rolled into Pentair Inc. Thulin told investors on September 19 that he would seek fewer but larger deals than his predecessor, George Buckley, but he held to the company’s long-term goal of making $1 billion to $2 billion in acquisitions per year. The company has yet another large deal in the works - it is working to overcome U.S. regulators’ objections to its planned $550 million takeover of Avery-Dennison Corp’s office products business. 3M said its deal would reduce earnings by 5 cents per share in the first 12 months following closure, which it expects in the fourth quarter. Analysts have forecast 2013 earnings of $6.93 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Focusing on larger deals may be a more effective way of increasing the size of 3M, which analysts expect to generate $30 billion in revenue this year. Ceradyne would add $476.7 million to that total, and boost its presence in the aerospace sector, where 3M is currently a small player. Meanwhile, Honeywell’s UOP arm has the right to buy the remaining 30 percent of Thomas Russell, at a price linked to the business’s operating income. Decade-old Thomas Russell should generate 2012 revenue of about $425 million, Honeywell said. Analysts expect revenue of $38.11 billion this year from Honeywell, which also makes aircraft electronics and building control systems. Honeywell said it expected its deal to have no effect on 2012 profit and to boost 2013 earnings.

96,HON,NRC lays down terms for Honeywell before Ill. uranium plant opening,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc said Tuesday it could take nine to 12 months to upgrade the Metropolis Works uranium conversion facility in Southern Illinois to ensure it could withstand a strong earthquake or tornados. On Tuesday, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a Confirmatory Order telling Honeywell what actions the company must take before it can resume operations at Metropolis. The facility has been shut since May 9 following an NRC inspection that determined a major earthquake or tornado could result in a higher risk to the public than originally assumed, the NRC said in a release. That inspection was part of the NRC’s assessment of all U.S. nuclear related facilities in the wake of last year’s Fukushima disaster in Japan. There were no safety concerns at the facility currently since the plant is shut, the NRC said. “This agreement with the NRC gives Honeywell clarity about the type and extent of necessary upgrades to the facility, allowing us to continue the scoping, planning and design work,” Larry Smith, plant manager for the facility, said in a release. “Thanks to this agreement, we are closer to being able to estimate the required investment and schedule of work needed for the facility to resume full production,” Smith said. A spokesman at Honeywell told Reuters the company has not publicly announced the estimated cost of the needed upgrades. The Honeywell Metropolis Works is the only facility in the United States that takes milled uranium and converts it into uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6), which is then enriched at other facilities like USEC Inc’s Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky to make fuel for commercial power reactors. USEC’s Paducah uranium enrichment facility is located across the Ohio River from the Metropolis plant in Paducah, Kentucky. The Honeywell spokesman said the company does not comment on how the plant’s shutdown was affecting the nation’s supply of uranium hexafluoride. UF6 is not a widely traded product but since May when the Metropolis facility shut, cash prices have declined from about $140 kilograms of uranium (kgU) to about $130 in September. See Ux Consulting Co LLC (UxC) Uranium UF6 North American price monthly contracts and The NRC said it will not allow the Metropolis plant to resume operations until Honeywell satisfies the provisions outlined in the NRC’s order. “These measures ensure the continued safety of the people who work at Honeywell as well as those who live nearby,” Victor McCree, the NRC’s Region II Administrator, said in the release. The inspection in May said process equipment in the facility lacks seismic restraints, support and bracing that would assure integrity during a significant seismic or wind event. Specifically, the NRC said the amount of uranium hexafluoride that could be released into the environment should the process equipment be damaged by such an event could be significantly larger than assumed in the facility’s Emergency Response Plan. The material that could be released poses more of a chemical hazard than a radiation hazard, the NRC said. But with the facility shut, the NRC said a seismic event or a tornado would not result in a significant release of material. The NRC said it identified two apparent violations associated with the inspection findings. Honeywell’s Emergency Response Plan, submitted in May 2005, failed to identify accident sequences related to credible seismic and tornado events and the plant’s Integrated Safety Analysis Summary erroneously states that “the plant is designed to withstand earthquake with no safety implications,” the NRC said. Due, in part, to Honeywell’s cooperation and stated commitment to protect workers and public safety, the NRC said it decided to issue a Confirmatory Order in lieu of a Notice of Violation and consideration of civil penalties. The NRC wants the company to revise its Emergency Response Plan and its Integrated Safety Analysis, ensuring that both define and provide the safety bases for its improved seismic and wind design. The NRC also wants Honeywell to implement proposed modifications to ensure the facility can safely withstand such events.

The ream of recent results sets the stage for an even heavier week of earnings reports next week, including those of global heavyweights such as Caterpillar Inc, Dupont Co , 3M Co, Boeing Inc, Eli Lilly & Co  and Procter & Gamble. GE, Honeywell, Ingersoll Rand Plc and Parker Hannifin Corp all took in less revenue than analysts had expected. “Revenues keep missing,” said Ken Polcari, managing director of ICAP Equities in New York. “That is the story that we are hearing across the line.” Going forward, however, the outlook is mixed. Ingersoll and Parker Hannifin gave forecasts that disappointed investors. GE and Honeywell missed analysts’ sales estimates, but kept their forecasts for the rest of the year. All but Parker reported higher profit in the quarter. GE, the largest U.S. conglomerate, said sales at its aviation and healthcare arms dipped 1 percent in the quarter, though analysts noted overall revenue was hurt by a firmer dollar, which diminished the value of its foreign sales.  GE shares were down 2.8 percent at $22.17 on Friday afternoon. Shares of diversified U.S. manufacturer Honeywell were up 2 percent at $62.67 after it reported a 10 percent rise in quarterly earnings as falling natural gas prices buoyed profit at its UOP chemical arm and offset weakness in Europe. The industrials sector is one of five market segments where earnings have been better than expected so far this quarter, even as revenue has fallen short. Recent results suggested multinationals could be reaching the limit of their ability to boost profit through efforts such as cost cutting, said Keith Goddard, CEO of Capital Advisors. “We’re at the upper boundary of where profit margins can go. They’re not going to expand further,” Goddard said, adding that margins are not likely to collapse, barring another recession. Industrial companies cut costs so deeply during the most recent recession, they now deserve higher valuations, Capital Advisors’ Goddard said, noting it is unusual for a growth stock fund to own names like GE, Eaton Corp, General Motors Co , FedEx Corp and Swiss-based conglomerate ABB Ltd , a GE peer. Top GE and Honeywell executives said the third quarter may represent the greatest hit their results take from exchange-rate fluctuations, since the comparison was against a third quarter of 2011 when the dollar was falling after a standoff in Washington over whether to allow a U.S. debt default. GE Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin noted that the dollar was up about 14 percent from a year ago. “Even if the dollar stays where it is for the fourth quarter, that’ll be less of a drag,” Sherin said. “It’ll be a little stronger, but it won’t be as much as the third-quarter impact. But who knows where it’s going to go?” Honeywell expects the strengthening of the dollar to reduce operating income by $100 million in 2012, but does not expect those pressures to recur next year, said Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson. Honeywell, traditionally an aggressive cost-cutter, offered a guarded 2013 forecast that calls for sales growth from existing businesses in the low single digits, but stronger margins. “We expect to grow earnings at a multiple of sales in what will likely be a slow-growth environment,” Anderson said. Struggling international industrial markets hurt profit at Parker Hannifin, which said the economic picture remained murky and that it was focused on controlling costs. The maker of motion control and hydraulic systems slashed its forecast for the fiscal year through June 2013. Parker’s international industrial segment showed a third consecutive year-over-year sales decline, which was “largely as a result of recessionary conditions in Europe and moderating growth in Asia,” CEO Don Washkewicz said on a conference call. Parker shares were down 6.8 percent at $79.28 on Friday afternoon. Heating and cooling systems maker Ingersoll also cited weakness in Europe for revenue that fell short of estimates. However, it beat profit expectations as it realized some of the benefits of years of restructuring. Its shares were up 2.3 percent at $46.69. Some of the strongest results were from companies that will soon be swallowed up by larger rivals. U.S. engineering company Shaw Group Inc, which agreed in July to a $3 billion takeover by Chicago Bridge & Iron Co, beat estimates, helped by higher sales in its power business. Cooper Industries Plc, the electrical products maker that agreed to a takeover by Eaton, reported higher-than-expected profit and sales amid lighting demand in North America and growth in international energy projects. Cooper’s sales in China jumped more than 20 percent in the quarter, raising hopes that the massive Asian economy, a key market for U.S. industrials, may be reviving from a slowdown that has rattled the nerves of investors in economically sensitive stocks. “I don’t think it’s smart to bet against (China),” Honeywell CEO Dave Cote said. Cote said the U.S. and world economies could recover more strongly if governments take concrete steps to resolve debt issues in major nations.

105,HON,Honeywell forecasts growth in corporate jet sales,"(Reuters) - Demand for corporate jets has begun to recover from a post-recession low and is likely to rise over the next decade, with $250 billion worth of new aircraft delivered by 2022, according to a forecast by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N). The forecast projects that companies will increasingly choose larger aircraft capable of traveling longer distances, driven by the desire to use private jets in international travel and to transport larger teams of people, Honeywell said in its forecast, released on Sunday. The total value of corporate jets delivered worldwide in 2012 will rise 9 percent from 2011, said the diversified U.S. manufacturer, which makes engines used in the aircraft. Major makers of business aircraft include Textron Inc’s (TXT.N) Cessna, General Dynamics Corp’s (GD.N) Gulfstream, Canada’s Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), and Brazil’s Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA). Honeywell expects similar growth levels and demand patterns in 2013. “It’s all about range. To have more range you have more fuel, more fuel requires bigger wings, bigger wings mean bigger fuselage,” said Rob Wilson, president of Honeywell’s business and general aviation operation. “So you will get a larger cabin with the higher range requirements. In addition, when you’re going to be on an airplane for 12, 14 hours, you need a certain amount of volume to prevent you from going a little stir-crazy.” A Honeywell survey found that 69 percent of spending on new aircraft in 2012 was for large-cabin jets. Morris Township, New Jersey-based Honeywell based its forecast on interviews with 1,500 operators of corporate jets, as well as other economic data sources. Sales of corporate jets have traditionally closely tracked growth in corporate profits — when times were good, companies invested in aircraft; when conditions worsened, they pulled back. That cycle played out in the last recession, with orders falling sharply in 2008 and 2009, then steadying. The current wave of third-quarter corporate earnings reports has largely showed a decline in profit among companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX, with analysts expecting the group's collective earnings to fall 1.9 percent in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wilson, however, argued that with North America representing just 53 percent of expected corporate jet demand over the next five years, the correlation between U.S. corporate profits and jet sales may not be as strong as in prior cycles. “The linkage to corporate profits may have been more of a hangover from when we saw the market being much more dominated by North American companies,” he said. “With that now being half the market, we don’t see the linkage being as strong, we see other facets globally that drive it.” Honeywell’s survey found growing demand for corporate jets in Asia and Latin America. Corporate jet makers have suggested in recent weeks that demand could pick up after the November 6 U.S. presidential elections and Congress’s year-end “fiscal cliff” deadline passes, as jet buyers will then have a clearer sense of the economy’s heading. “Our primary customers are small, mid-sized businesses. There’s no question that a lot of these guys are looking at a very uncertain next few months, right?” Textron Chief Executive Scott Donnelly told investors on an October 17 conference call. “People will wake up the morning after the election, they may be happy, they may be unhappy. But to some degree people are going to have to dust themselves off and say, ‘You know what? I’ve got to get on with my life.’ ... It takes some uncertainty off the table and that is probably good for the market.” ",10282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-honeywell-forecast/honeywell-forecasts-growth-in-corporate-jet-sales-idUSBRE89R0K720121028

107,HON,"Congress, Obama playing with dynamite, CEOs say of 'fiscal cliff'","* Top CEOs to meet with Obama on Wednesday * Lawmakers “playing with nitroglycerin”-Honeywell CEO * Business Roundtable kicks off ad campaign featuring CEOs * Uncertainty hurting recovery, executives said By Scott Malone BOSTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Corporate America is raising the volume of its plea that the U.S. government avert a year-end “fiscal cliff” that could send the nation back into recession, but chief executives aren’t pushing the panic button just yet. With a heated election season in the rear-view mirror, executives are calling on the White House and congressional leaders to head off a self-imposed deadline that could bring $600 billion in spending cuts and higher taxes early in 2013 if they are unable to reach a deal on cutting the federal budget deficit. The Business Roundtable on Tuesday kicked off a print , radio and online ad campaign on which it plans to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars featuring the chiefs of Honeywell International Inc, Xerox Corp and United Parcel Service Inc calling on lawmakers to resolve the issue. One of the more dramatic warnings of the consequences of  allowing the U.S. economy to go over the fiscal cliff came from Honeywell CEO David Cote. “If the last debt ceiling discussion was playing with fire, this time they’re playing with nitroglycerin,” Cote said in an interview. “If they go off the cliff, I think it would spark a recession that’s a lot bigger than economists think. Some think it would just be a small fire. I think it could turn into a conflagration.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the U.S. economy would contract 0.5 percent in 2013 if the government fails to stop the budget cuts and tax increases - far below the 2 percent growth economists currently forecast. A failure in Washington to solve the crisis by the year’s end could prompt major companies to curtail investment plans, said Duncan Niederauer, CEO of NYSE Euronext, operator of the New York Stock Exchange. “We simply won’t be investing in the United States. We will be investing elsewhere where we have more certainty of the outcome,” Niederauer said in an interview. About a dozen top U.S. CEOs, including General Electric Co’s  Jeff Immelt, Aetna Inc’s Mark Bertolini, American Express Co’s Ken Chenault and Dow Chemical Co’s  Andrew Liveris are scheduled to meet with President Barack Obama on Wednesday to discuss the issue. The four are members of “Fix the Debt,” an ad-hoc lobbying organization that this week launched an advertising campaign that advocates long-term debt reduction. Bank of America Corp CEO Brian Moynihan said on Tuesday that worries about the cliff have companies holding off on spending. “That uncertainty continues to hold back the recovery,” Moynihan said, speaking at an investor conference in New York. Sandy Cutler, CEO of manufacturer Eaton Corp, shared his concern. “Until we solve the fiscal issues (in the United States and Europe), you’re not going to get back to normal GDP growth,” Cutler told investors on Tuesday. CEOs are not alone in this worry. The CBO report warned that failure to reach a deal could push the U.S. unemployment rate up to 9.1 percent, the highest since July 1991. It is currently 7.9 percent. Obama and the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives have signaled a more conciliatory tone since last week’s election, when Obama soundly defeated Republican challenger Mitt Romney, whose party retained a majority in the House. Wilbur Ross, an investor known for taking stakes in distressed companies, is bracing for higher tax rates in 2013. “We, like many people, have been trying to utilize gains this year. It does seem that the probability is that rates will go up,” Ross said in an interview with Reuters Insider. “We don’t have a “for sale” sign on anything. But we are mindful that there is a benefit to concluding things this year rather than next. Concerns about the cliff have not prompted customers to cancel orders, though they have added to an overall level of uneasiness that has companies wary of making large capital purchases or hiring significant numbers of new workers. “We haven’t seen the panicking, like, ‘I’m not going to order something because of the fiscal cliff,’” said Steve Shawley, chief financial officer of heating and cooling systems maker Ingersoll Rand Plc. “Customers are being very judicious with their orders.” Likewise, JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon last month told investors he did not expect the negotiations to hurt lending in the fourth quarter. “The fiscal cliff isn’t going to change us,” Dimon said, referring to JPMorgan’s commercial bank, which loans money to businesses. The bank’s investment banking side could be more vulnerable if the debate makes investors jittery, he allowed.

The industry has already shed tens of thousands of jobs and closed facilities. Lockheed Martin Corp’s new president and chief operating officer, Marillyn Hewson, told analysts on Monday her company had been preparing for tighter defense budgets for years, even before the sequestration deal. “We aren’t going to see a major change,” said Hewson. “We’ve been very proactive as a leadership team in taking actions in recent years to address our cost structure, to look at how we can make our product more affordable.” Automatic cuts to the federal budget could reduce federal health spending by $21.5 billion in 2013, potentially affecting everything from Medicare to the Food and Drug Administration, according to an analysis by PwC’s Health Research Institute. Vincent Forlenza, the CEO of Beckton Dickinson & Co, said the labs he supplies have held off on buying new instruments because of the threat of spending cuts. “If we don’t get to a deal we will have another year of paralysis and putting off research,” Forlenza said. “The impact of uncertainty on the (National Institutes of Health) budget is causing our research customers to put off research.”",11132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fiscal-business/congress-obama-playing-with-dynamite-ceos-say-of-fiscal-cliff-idUSL1E8MCDTU20121113
108,HON,"INTERVIEW-NYSE, Honeywell CEOs call for action on 'fiscal cliff'","* Markets pricing in more uncertainty -Honeywell, NYSE CEOs * NYSE, Honeywell would look to invest more outside of U.S. if no deal reached * Both say deal must include tax increases, spending cuts, entitlement reform By John McCrank NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. politicians face a stark choice over the next six weeks: come together on a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, or prepare for a recession as companies seek other places to invest, said the CEOs of NYSE Euronext  and Honeywell International Inc. President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans have sounded conciliatory notes on the fiscal cliff since last week’s election, but there is still plenty of scepticism in the business community on the chances of a deal, NYSE’s Duncan Niederauer and Honeywell’s David Cote told Reuters on Tuesday. In August 2011, Congress did not agree on raising the U.S. debt ceiling until the last possible minute, leading to massive volatility in equity markets and a downgrade of America’s debt rating. “If the debt ceiling was playing with fire, this is nitroglycerine,” said Cote. “If they go off the cliff, I think it would spark a recession that’s a lot bigger than economists think. Some think it would just be a small fire. I think it could turn into a conflagration.” Since the election, markets have been focused on the fiscal cliff of steep government spending cuts and tax rises due to be implemented under existing law in early 2013 and the uncertainty surrounding it, along with more long-term fears about the size of the U.S. debt, Big Board boss Niederauer said. “The next 60 days are critical,” he said. He said the market seemed to be pricing in more uncertainty in the months ahead, and that there could be an upside surprise in store if real progress is made in the lame-duck session of Congress, which would set the table for a credible solution to conquering the debt burden in the following months. Niederauer said that uncertainty - including around simple things like what the corporate tax rate will be in 2013 - makes it difficult for companies to make plans to invest and hire workers in the United States, further stifling economic growth. While the economy has struggled since the recession, corporations are sitting on stockpiles of cash and are waiting for a signal as to where to invest, said Niederauer. If politicians are not able to create some certainty in the markets by putting aside partisan ideas, and making real progress in the next 60 days on fiscal issues, money will go elsewhere, both Niederauer and Cote said. “We simply won’t be investing in the United States. We will be investing elsewhere, where we have more certainty of the outcome,” Niederauer said. “Capital is a coward,” said Cote of Honeywell, a diversified manufacturer. “You don’t go to places that are excessively risky or have more risk in them than you are willing to take.” He said that with many of the world’s big democracies - Japan, India, the EU, the U.S. - in gridlock because of debt, somebody needs to exercise some leadership. “There is a real opportunity for presidential leadership. That is the one guy in the entire country who could make this argument to the American public and give it to them holistic instead of in pieces,” Cote said. Both Cote and Niederauer said they were optimistic a deal will be reached in time. Democrats and Republicans generally agree on the need to avoid about $600 billion in deficit reduction measures set to start in 2013. But they are at odds how to get over the immediate crisis, divided over whether to extend tax cuts for everyone, as Republicans want, or just for those earning below $250,000, as the president wants. Solving the problem requires “both an increase in taxes and significant entitlement reform, along with discretionary spending cuts if this is going to work, and we need this to work,” Cote said. Both Cote and Niederauer are part of an ad hoc lobby group called Fix the Debt, made up of CEOs pushing for long-term deficit reduction, and Cote is one of several CEOs meeting with President Obama on Wednesday to discuss fiscal issues. “He (Obama) fully understands the significance of not just the fiscal cliff, but long-term debt, to our economy and what that’s doing to hold us back and wants to do something that’s going to really make a difference here long-term,” he said. Cote said it was not reasonable to expect Congress to come up with the bigger $4 trillion answer by the end of the year. It could, however, put a mechanism in place to develop a simplified tax system that collects more, simplified Medicare/Medicaid that spends considerably less, and discretionary spending cuts, by a specified date such as July 4, he said. Of the $4 trillion in deficit reduction, which would be phased in over 10 years, Cote said a plan might include $1 dollar in tax increases for every $3 of spending cuts. There would also need to be a backup - like a Simpson-Bowles, a Domenici-Rivlin, or another $4 trillion debt reduction plan - that would automatically kick in if the plan is not ready by the target date. Cote, whose name has been brought up by pundits as a potential replacement for Timothy Geithner as Treasury Secretary, said he has not given that role much thought. “It’s nice to be thought about, but I like what I am doing,” he said when asked if he would consider the job if offered. Top executives scheduled to meet with the president on Wednesday include the CEOs of General Electric Co, Wal-Mart, Ford Motor Co, Procter and Gamble Co , American Express, Chevron Corp, International Business Machines, PepsiCo Inc, Xerox Corp, and Aetna Inc.

Vincent Forlenza, the CEO of Becton Dickinson & Co, said the labs he supplies have held off on buying new instruments because of the threat of spending cuts. “If we don’t get to a deal we will have another year of paralysis and putting off research,” Forlenza said. “The impact of uncertainty on the (National Institutes of Health) budget is causing our research customers to put off research.”   (Additional reporting by John McCrank, Nick Zieminski, Caroline Humer, Jed Horowitz, Sharon Begley and Daniel Wilchins in New York, Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina, Nichola Groom in Los Angeles, Andrea Shalal-Esa in Washington, Debra Sherman in Chicago and Anna Driver in Houston; Editing by Patricia Kranz and Steve Orlofsky and Carol Bishopric)",11142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fiscal-business/rpt-corrected-update-1-congress-obama-face-dynamite-in-fiscal-cliff-ceos-idUSL1E8ME0WH20121114

114,HON,UPDATE 2-IK Investment plans sale of fire safety firm Minimax,"* Minimax’s 2011 sales 1 bln euros, earnings 92.5 mln eur * IK plans to pick banks for sale next year -sources * Could attract Honeywell, United Technologies -sources * IPO also an option for Minimax -source By Arno Schuetze and Simon Meads FRANKFURT/LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Private equity group IK Investment Partners is planning to sell Germany-based fire extinguisher maker Minimax, which generated 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in sales last year, sources said. The private equity house, which focuses on buying mid-sized companies in Northern Europe, aims to pick advisory banks early next year and launch the sale process within the first half of the year, four people familiar with the matter said. Minimax, which employs over 6,200 people and makes a range of fire extinguishing and detection systems, could attract U.S. technology groups Honeywell and United Technologies  as well as rival private equity groups, two of the sources said. The company posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 92.5 million euros in 2011 and sales of 995 million euros, company accounts showed. Rival companies such as security firm Tyco, and Honeywell itself, trade at 7.8 times their earnings and Minimax could fetch more than 700 million euros on a similar valuation. An initial public offering (IPO) of the business is also an option, one of the people said. A spokeswoman for IK declined to comment. IK bought Minimax in 2006 from Investcorp for an undisclosed amount, financing the deal with 530 million euros in bank lending, data from Thomson Reuters LPC showed. At that point the company had revenues of under 500 million euros a year, but it has since grown considerably, taking over U.S. rival Viking Group in 2009. It is now the world’s third-largest fire equipment supplier, and market leader in the United States and China, generating the vast majority of sales from industrial fire protection systems. The prospective sale comes at an important time for IK Investment Partners as it asks investors to back its latest buyout fund, for which it has raised about half of the 1.7 billion euros it is seeking. However, recent efforts to sell companies have gone poorly. It was forced to shelve the sales of industrials firm Schenck Process, sports pitch maker Sport Group and glass manufacturer Flabeg when bids fell short of targets, sources said. IK, with roots in the Nordic region, has also been at the centre of a long-running tax investigation by Sweden’s Tax Agency, resulting in bills for hundreds of millions of dollars in back taxes for the firm’s dealmakers.",11232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/ik-minimax/update-2-ik-investment-plans-sale-of-fire-safety-firm-minimax-idUSL5E8MN6S120121123

119,HON,Coolant safety row puts the heat on Europe's carmakers,"* Daimler test prompts rethink on air-conditioning coolant * Honeywell, Dupont have invested hundreds of millions * Product only one that meets strict EU emissions guidelines By Christiaan Hetzner FRANKFURT, Dec 12 (Reuters) - When engineers at Mercedes-Benz tasked with field-testing a revolutionary new refrigerant watched it ignite in a ball of fire before their eyes, it took a while for the significance of their discovery to sink in. Simulating a leak in the air-conditioning line of a Mercedes B-Class tourer, they had released a fine mixture of refrigerant and A/C compressor oil, which sprayed across the car’s turbo-charged 1.6 litre engine. The substance caught fire as soon as it hit the hot surface, releasing a toxic, corrosive gas as it burned. The car’s windshield turned milky white as lethal hydrogen fluoride began eating its way into the glass. “We were frozen in shock, I am not going to deny it. We needed a day to comprehend what we had just seen,” said Stefan Geyer, a senior Daimler engineer who ran the tests. Air-conditioning refrigerants are not the stuff of controversy. Traditionally, they have been made of relatively innocuous chemicals that change from liquid to vapour and back again, transferring heat and cooling the surrounding air in the process. But the discovery at the German carmaker’s Sindelfingen test track in early August suggested this new product posed a very real risk to car passengers. It has set off a battle royal between Daimler and U.S. conglomerate Honeywell, replete with mudslinging, conspiracy theories and spin-doctoring. At stake is not just a lucrative business for Honeywell and its partner Dupont, who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, market and produce the coolant known as HFO-1234yf. Their refrigerant also happens to be the only product of its kind that meets new EU climate guidelines. Because of concerns about greenhouse gases, EU legislators in Brussels have ordered the phasing out of the long-time industry standard, R134a, from January. By 2017, every single air-conditioned car that rolls off assembly lines for sale in Europe - roughly 14 million vehicles a year - could be filled with about $70 worth of HFO-1234yf. The Daimler test has sent the industry, and Brussels, scrambling to figure out whether years of tests that showed the new product to be perfectly safe could have been flawed. If it does pose a danger, they must reconsider plans to introduce the refrigerant across Europe’s entire fleet - and act fast. “The industry obviously takes very seriously the new findings, which show the refrigerant can be flammable under certain extreme conditions,” said Cara McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Europe’s auto industry association ACEA. After confirming their August results in subsequent tests, Daimler notified the authorities in late September that it wanted to recall all 1,300 cars worldwide that already use the new refrigerant. A month later, with only a few weeks to go until the phase-in of HFO-1234yf begins, 13 major carmakers quietly began a new fourth round of safety tests to assess the accuracy of the Daimler results, which showed combustion occurring in more than two-thirds of the cases after a simulated head-on collision. Meanwhile, Honeywell and Dupont are in full-blown damage control mode. They stand to lose a fortune in wasted development costs and forfeited future revenue. Honeywell alone has secured over 100 patents for the product worldwide. The companies say the simulations were not conducted under real-life conditions and note that cars that were actually crashed to test the material - rather than subject to simulated accidents - did not raise any red flags. They accuse Daimler of grossly exaggerating the danger and even of deliberately staging the test to provoke a scare out of ulterior motives that have nothing to do with passenger safety - a claim the Stuttgart-based carmaker vehemently denies. Geyer’s findings were so diametrically at odds with previously documented research that even German engineers at an automotive icon like Mercedes started to doubt themselves. “It was scarcely believable. The most complicated lab tests conducted using the most sensitive measuring instruments around found nothing and all we do is drive a car around a couple of times, open a tiny hole in the refrigerant line and the next thing you know the car is on fire,” said Geyer. Had he seen a February 2008 report by a small Austrian firm, Obrist Engineering, he might have known that combustion could occur at engine operating temperatures. Obrist identified a risk of secondary fire and urged further investigation to assess the implications for passengers, citing the relatively low concentrations of toxic emissions needed to kill a human being. Andreas Kornath, a chemistry professor at the University of Munich who works with fire fighters, has been warning carmakers about HFO-1234yf and the risks posed by even low amounts of hydrogen fluoride (HF) released during its combustion. “Whereas carbon monoxide does no permanent tissue damage and during a fire rises straight into the atmosphere, HF binds with ambient moisture to form very fine droplets of hydrofluoric acid that can remain suspended in the air,” he said. Readily absorbed by the skin, hydrogen fluoride begins attacking the body once it enters the bloodstream by spreading death on a cellular level, a process known as necrosis. High enough doses are known to cause the lungs to fill up with fluid, causing a drowning sensation, and to trigger cardiac arrest. According to the U.S. Labour Department’s Occupation Safety and Health Administration, workers should not be exposed over an eight-hour period to more than three milligrams of hydrogen fluoride per cubic metre of air, or three parts per million. Permissible levels for hydrogen cyanide - used by the Nazis in gas chambers - are over three times as high. After already suffering a nine-month production delay in China, the last thing Honeywell and Dupont need now is a potential safety scandal that could have ramifications for their business in Europe and beyond. Thanks to incentives offered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the refrigerant is likely to be rolled out widely in the United States as well. The duo’s patent-protected monopoly has aroused suspicion by carmakers and envy at other rivals. Europe’s ACEA believes Honeywell intentionally concealed its patent process, a claim the company rejects as baseless. French chemical company Arkema prompted the EU to launch anti-trust investigations last December. Honeywell is being examined over whether it “abused its dominant position” and “engaged in deceptive conduct”. While Honeywell and Dupont concede that HFO1234yf is “mildly flammable”, they point to peer-reviewed safety tests from December 2009 that estimate the refrigerant could pose a danger in just one or two cases per year. “The chance of being killed by an inflating airbag is 100 times higher,” said Chris Seeton, an engineer from Honeywell leading the development of HFO-1234yf. With much on the line and environmental groups in Germany advocating the industry focus on developing carbon dioxide as a natural refrigerant, things are turning ugly. Honeywell accuses Daimler of designing the test in such a way as to create the desired result, all the way down to the amount of refrigerant found in the A/C system. “We fundamentally believe they knew what they were doing when they went to videotape this,” said Honeywell’s Seeton. “Their test was engineered for that outcome.” By fomenting a fear campaign, his company says, Daimler might be seeking to postpone as long as possible paying the higher costs of the new refrigerant, which they say is ten times as expensive as R134a. “It wasn’t until they were under significant economic constraints and this billion-euro cost savings (programme was launched) that they brought this issue up,” said Terrence Hahn, General Manager for Honeywell’s Fluorine Products business. Seeton also believes Daimler might be using safety as an argument to test the EU’s resolve, given German carmakers are seeking greater allowance to build cars with dirtier emissions than permitted under current 2020 targets. Daimler dismisses the claims. It says it now faces higher costs from ditching the new refrigerant. Michel Gabriel, managing director of consultancy Interbrand in Zurich, believes Daimler is justified in taking a cautious stance, given its reputation for producing cars with the highest levels of safety. “In cases where management is aware of a certain problem and knowingly acts anyway, judging a risk to be acceptable, then they might make themselves liable to the accusation that they had acted irresponsibly,” he said. “A premium carmaker’s most important asset is its brand.” The German carmaker won over its first supporter in November in the form of Volkswagen. Its chairman, Ferdinand Piech, said the group would work on developing a new A/C system using CO2, since it is “guaranteed not to burn”. Brussels has not received any formal request to delay enforcement of the EU directive yet, but the German auto industry wants six additional months to conduct more tests. “Daimler has raised the highest concern in the European Commission,” said a spokeswoman, adding Brussels is “closely following the developments in the relevant investigations”. One industry source believes the EU has no choice but to push back the January phase-in of HFO-1234yf, since every carmaker has been caught unprepared. Launching infringement proceedings against the carmakers is a political no-go at a time when the auto industry has its back against the wall. “Just look at Peugeot, Ford or Opel; piling on fines would break their neck,” the person said. “There is no alternative to finding a new refrigerant, given the current debate. The Mercedes recall signalled that very clearly.”",12122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-cars-refrigerant/coolant-safety-row-puts-the-heat-on-europes-carmakers-idUSL5E8NBB7L20121212

Honeywell and Dupont are deeply invested in the success of the new refrigerant. Initial results of tests conducted by 13 major auto manufacturers and compiled and vetted by the SAE International, formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, were issued on Friday. Daimler, whose flagship premium brand is Mercedes-Benz, was one of the 13 automakers involved in the testing. The SAE International said preliminary results show there is no reason to change its previous stance that HFO-1234yf is safe to use in automobiles. The SAE is expected to issue its completed risk assessment in mid-February and will publish the new findings by the end of the second quarter in 2013. “To date, the majority of the (automakers) involved in the new (research) do not believe that any of the new information reviewed will lead to a change in the overall risk assessment,” the SAE International said. Outside of Daimler, the SAE said, no other automaker provided “information that would suggest a concern for the safe use” of the new refrigerant. The issue is controversial as the entire auto industry has been on its way to rolling out the new refrigerant in the European Union starting in January, as part of an EU directive banning refrigerants now used, which the EU says create high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Were other carmakers to discover that the refrigerant mix is combustible at certain engine operating temperatures, then regulators as well as public opinion might force them to find a new, more expensive and technically complicated solution to meeting the EU directive. Daimler indicated that the new research does not alter its stance against the use of HFO-1234yf. “This preliminary opinion from a continuing investigation of SAE is based primarily on assumptions and does not reflect what our tests showed repeatedly,” a spokesman for Daimler said, adding that Mercedes-Benz would still not use the substance.

122,HON,"CEOs pan fiscal cliff deal, vow to continue debt fight","(Reuters) - U.S. executives largely panned the congressional deal to steer America away from the “fiscal cliff,” saying Washington wasted an opportunity to address the nation’s long-term debt, but said they would continue to agitate for a better budget plan. While CEOs expressed relief that $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts will not kick the fragile economy in the gut, their gratitude was salted with insults. “I think this deal’s a disaster,” said Peter Huntsman, chief executive of chemical producer Huntsman Corp. “We’re just living in a fantasy land. We’re borrowing more and more money. This did absolutely nothing to address the fundamental issue of the debt cliff.” Former Wells Fargo CEO Dick Kovacevich said the agreement confirms that Washington and both parties are totally out of control. “I think it’s a joke,” Kovacevich said of the deal. “It’s stunning to me that after working on this for months and supposedly really getting to work in the last 30 days that this is what you come up with.” Kovacevich and others said business leaders need to consider a different approach, one that either bypasses lawmakers or lays out a much more specific plan for deficit reduction. Corporate America had mounted a media blitz in the last two months, calling on Congress to both avert the potentially devastating fiscal cliff and replace it with a reasonable long-term plan to get the federal deficit under control. Dozens of CEOs joined a loose coalition known as the “Fix the Debt” campaign, travelled to Washington to talk directly with lawmakers, visited the White House, and made regular rounds on TV news programs. The executives scaled back their public posturing during the furious last-minute negotiations, which coincided with their holiday vacations, but some executives kept the phone lines to Washington open. They are not happy with what their efforts bought them. The final deal contained no meaningful spending cuts and adds trillions to the deficit, compared to the budget savings that would have occurred if the extreme measures of the cliff had kicked in. It also set up another cliff of sorts in two months. That’s when the nation is expected to hit its borrowing limit, and when the across-the-board spending cuts known as “sequestration” are now scheduled kick in. Despite executives’ distaste for the deal, they’re not turning their backs on Washington and are holding out hope for a greater deficit reduction plan. “We cannot give up now, that’s not how a great nation acts,” said Honeywell International Inc CEO David Cote, a driving force behind the Fix the Debt group. He said in a statement Wednesday that he’s “encouraged” by comments made by both Democrats and Republicans saying that more work needs to be done. Some in the business community are calling for a change in strategy due to the meager results of the fiscal cliff deal. “It doesn’t work talking to the politicians, obviously,” former Wells CEO Kovacevich said. “What we’ve got to do is educate the American public that our country is going to hell.” There are questions about how meaningful of a contribution Corporate America can make, especially if they do not deliver a unified voice on hard decisions such as industry-specific tax breaks. Republican Senator Bob Corker from Tennessee said on CNBC on Wednesday morning that the business community could play a great role by pushing for concrete entitlement changes. The business community appears reluctant to provide lawmakers with specific proposals. Jon Romano, a spokesman for the Fix the Debt campaign, said the group has set out principles for a long-term deal, but it doesn’t want to prescribe what the policy should look like. “We’re really looking to our elected leaders on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue to come up with that solution to this issue,” Romano said. Mark Kennedy, who heads George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management and served in Congress from 2001 to 2007, said business leaders need to do more. He said executives should identify “sacred cows” that should no longer be protected, be more specific about how big a deficit reduction deal should be, and get specific about what they want included. “It’s more helpful to get parameters as to what should be done than to just say, do something,” Kennedy said.

125,HON,Honeywell profit tops Wall Street view on margin boost,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) posted fourth-quarter earnings just above Wall Street estimates, reflecting the diversified U.S. manufacturer’s campaign to boost profit margins in the face of sluggish sales growth. The maker of cockpit electronics and systems to manage the climate and security of large buildings confirmed its 2013 profit forecast on Friday and said it expected earnings to rise 6 percent to 11 percent in the first quarter. “It is just too early to tell what direction the economy is going,” said Chief Executive Officer David Cote, who has been one of the loudest voices in corporate America calling on policy leaders in Washington to address the nation’s rising debt load. “Big democracies around the world are still in gridlock over debt, and the U.S. is kicking the debt can down the road and finding that kick doesn’t quite go as far as it used to.” Honeywell said earnings came to $251 million, or 32 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. For the year-earlier period, the company booked a loss of $310 million, or 40 cents per share. Factoring out accounting items related to the company’s pension plan, the profit was $1.10 per share, topping the analysts’ average forecast of $1.09, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Honeywell shares were up 0.5 percent at $68.57 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Overall profit margins rose to 15.6 percent of sales from 15.1 percent a year earlier as Cote has been pushing to boost productivity across the company’s four divisions, including consolidating businesses into fewer locations. Revenue rose 1 percent to $9.58 billion from $9.47 billion a year earlier. The company’s performance materials unit, whose products include chemicals and equipment used in oil and gas production, notched the strongest sales growth in the quarter, up 8 percent. At the transportation systems unit, which makes products that include automobile turbochargers, sales fell 11 percent, reflecting weak European demand. The Morris Township, New Jersey-based company affirmed its 2013 profit forecast of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. At Thursday's close, Honeywell shares had risen about 18.5 percent over the past year, outpacing the 13.6 percent rise of the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX.

130,HON,Researchers warn of cyber flaws in Honeywell control systems,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - A widely used system for controlling electricity, heating and other systems inside buildings remains vulnerable to attacks over the Internet, despite warnings from U.S. officials, researchers said on Tuesday. The Niagara control system from Honeywell International Inc’s Tridium division are configured to connect to the Internet by default, even though that is not necessary for them to function, two researchers from security firm CyLance said at a security conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The pair, Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle, uncovered vulnerabilities last year that prompted the Department of Homeland Security to warn customers to change their settings and resulted in Honeywell releasing a software update that the two researchers previously said had successfully addressed the problems. Yet they revealed on Tuesday they have since uncovered new flaws in Tridium’s technology that continue to make customers vulnerable to attack via the Internet. They showed they could take control of a Niagara system using a new piece of software they had written to demonstrate the vulnerabilities in the system. They declined to explain their techniques out of concern that malicious hackers might try to copy their methods. They said attackers could accomplish the same ends by taking advantage of weak encryption and passwords stored internally on the Tridium control devices. Once inside, hackers could wreak havoc with the physical environment and in many cases could also jump to a building’s main office computers, McCorkle said. “It’s a little worrisome,” McCorkle said. “Don’t put it on the net.” A Honeywell spokesman said the company was working to address the new problems as quickly as possible and would alert customers of the risks. “We appreciate the fact that Mr. Rios and Mr. McCorkle are continuously reminding the user community of these sorts of vulnerabilities and we share their interest in getting them fixed,” said Honeywell spokesman Mark Hamel. Department of Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard declined to comment on the security of the Niagara technology. Poor security in industrial control systems, including those that run manufacturing facilities and power plants, has become an intense focus for security researchers and hackers alike since 2010 when the Stuxnet virus surfaced. Stuxnet attacked Iran’s nuclear program, targeting centrifuges at a uranium enrichment facility running on widely used control systems from German conglomerate Siemens AG. It exploited previously unknown security flaws in Siemens technology. Scores of security experts have since rushed to identify similar bugs in an effort to prevent malicious hackers from launching potentially devastating attacks on power systems, chemical plants, water utilities and other facilities that run on industrial control systems technology. In their presentation, the two researchers showed that some 21,000 Niagara systems used at hospitals and other facilities can currently be accessed via the public Internet, using a specialized search engine known as Shodan. Many Niagara customers do not realize their systems are attached to the internet because they were originally installed by outside contractors, the two said. Building operators typically control Niagara systems directly from inside the facilities they control, with Internet access surviving as a back-up, they said. Experts in industrial control systems security compare the problems to those in the early days of Microsoft Corp’s Windows software for PCs. But they warn it will be harder to fix the bugs because equipment often remains in place for decades and some manufacturers have no easy way to get security improvements to their customers. Rios said they notified Tridium of their most recent findings and that the division hoped to have a fix available to customers of the current version of Niagara within a week, with fixes for older versions coming later. A spokeswoman for Tridium said she could not immediately comment on the findings from Rios and McCorkle.

134,HON,Honeywell says carmakers convinced its coolant is safe,"FRANKFURT, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Honeywell refuted claims that its new carbon-neutral air conditioning refrigerant was unsafe, citing findings by an automotive industry research group that it said backed up the product. The comments by the U.S. conglomerate came after German carmaker BMW left an industry research programme investigating the safety of the refrigerant, saying it disagreed with the test methods and following Daimler and Audi  which also quit the programme. Honeywell said on Tuesday that the latest research backed its view that the new coolant was fit to equip cars, its only commercial use given the refrigerant’s high price. It cited comments made on Monday by the international Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), which is carrying out the research, that the “high level of confidence (in refrigerant HFO-1234yf) continues to grow” since combustion requires “extremely idealized conditions”. Terrence Hahn, vice president and general manager for Honeywell Fluorine Products, said on Tuesday: “The SAE’s latest evaluation, combined with years of other extensive testing, leaves no doubt that HFO-1234yf is safe for automotive applications.” SAE aims to complete its research and publish a final report in the second quarter of this year. Daimler, whose Mercedes-Benz marque counts safety as one of its core brand values, banned the use of HFO-1234yf in its cars on fears it would prove to be flammable and create a toxic gas called hydrogen fluoride when burning. BMW and Audi have not stated that the refrigerant itself poses a danger. Daimler believes SAE conclusions from 2009 mistakenly failed to classify HFO-1234yf as a potential source of a primary fire. Daimler also argues that it is inherently more dangerous than the non-flammable R134a being phased out. SAE said on Monday it “notes with disappointment” the decision by Daimler, BMW and Audi to resign from the industry research group, in which 10 other carmakers still participate. The new refrigerant is being phased in by the European Commission because any leakages in a car’s air conditioning system are far less prone to add to climate-warming gases in the atmosphere than the R134a currently used. Sources told Reuters on Monday that the European Commission last week informed German authorities it saw “no grounds” to give German carmakers more time to comply with the EU-wide phase-in that started Jan. 1, despite safety concerns. Honeywell and its production partner DuPont control the supply of the new refrigerant, which has a carbon footprint almost as low as CO2, well below that of R134a, which will be banned in the EU entirely come 2017. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in the development and commercialisation of refrigerant HFO-1234yf. Honeywell and DuPont stand to profit from what eventually is expected to be a billion dollar market.",2122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/honeywell-daimler/honeywell-says-carmakers-convinced-its-coolant-is-safe-idUSL5N0BCII120130212
135,HON,Honeywell to test some F-35 parts after smoke incident,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Monday an F-35 test plane was involved in an incident on February 14 that caused smoke in the cockpit, and it was sending the affected parts back to their manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc, for a detailed inspection. Kyra Hawn, spokeswoman for the $396 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, said an initial assessment of the incident at a Maryland air base showed it was isolated, software-related, and posed minimal risk. The Pentagon has made temporary changes to prevent another smoke incident, she said. News of the previously unreported incident comes just days after U.S. military officials grounded the entire fleet of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 jets for the second time this year after discovering a 0.6 inch crack on a fan blade in the single jet of another test plane. A spokesman for enginemaker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said the blade assembly arrived at the company’s Middletown, Connecticut, facility on Sunday evening and engineering teams were examining it now. Honeywell builds the plane’s “power thermal management system,” which uses a lithium-ion battery similar to those whose failures have grounded Boeing Co’s entire fleet of 787 airliners, but Hawn said there was no connection between the February 14 incident and the F-35’s lithium-ion batteries. “It has no linkage whatsoever with the lithium-ion batteries,” Hawn said. She said the February 14 incident was the only one involving smoke in the cockpit of an F-35 “in recent program history.” Lockheed is building three models of the new radar-evading warplane to replace nearly a dozen fighter jets in use by the U.S. military and its allies. The Pentagon plans to buy 2,447 of the advanced fighter in coming decades. Honeywell said it would inspect the system, which manages the distribution of hot and cold air in the F-35 fuselage, once it arrived at the company’s Phoenix testing facility. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded Boeing’s 787 commercial airliner on January 16 after two separate battery failures, including one that triggered an emergency landing in Japan after the crew detected smoke in the cockpit. Boeing’s biggest rival, Airbus, a unit of Europe’s EADS, has decided in the aftermath to skip using lithium-ion batteries in its new A350 airliner. But the Pentagon earlier this month said it would continue using lithium-ion batteries on the F-35 since they were made by different manufacturers from those used on the 787, and had been found to be safe after extensive testing. Hawn said an initial assessment of the February 14 incident involving BF-2, one of the Marine Corps’ short takeoff, vertical landing variants, had linked the problem to a software issue, not a problem with the hardware on the auxiliary power unit. The entire temperature management system was being sent to Honeywell for a closer inspection and development of a permanent fix, she said, noting that the plane was going through developmental testing specifically to find any such problems. “This is the purpose of test, development and initial training in any program - identify discrepancies, develop fixes, and put them in place to ensure safety of operations,” she said, adding that initial assessment indicated “minimal risk and (a) relatively uncomplicated resolution.” Honeywell spokesman Nathan Drevna said the company would inspect the system once it arrived at the Phoenix facility. “The pilot landed safely. The Honeywell-related products are being shipped to our testing facility so we can quickly inspect and determine next steps with our customer,” Drevna said. Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said there was no sign that a lithium-ion battery was involved, and the battery had not been pulled from the F-35 for further review. “There is no evidence that the lithium ion batteries are a contributor to this event,” he said, adding, “no battery faults were observed at any time.” One U.S. defense official familiar with the incident said the F-35 pilot reported “trace amounts of smoke” in the cockpit after he followed procedures to stop and restart the auxiliary power unit when a caution light came on. The pilot then halted the test flight and landed safely at the base, without ever declaring an in-flight emergency, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, adding, “there wasn’t any fire associated with the smoke incident.” Procedures have now been changed so that pilots do not restart the backup power unit in flight, the official said. Honeywell’s Drevna said the temperature control unit is part of a bigger integrated power package (IPP), also built by Honeywell, which uses a 270-volt lithium-ion battery to start the engine, and also provide emergency backup power. Only the temperature control system was being sent back to Honeywell. Lockheed said the power and thermal system was not using the battery at the time of the February 14 incident and the battery checked out as fully functional during a post-flight review. The IPP also functioned as designed, he said. A malfunctioning valve in the larger IPP system grounded the F-35 for two weeks in August 2011, but this was a separate issue, the Pentagon said on Monday.

138,HON,EXCLUSIVE-Honeywell to test some F-35 parts after smoke incident-Pentagon,"(Adds quotes, details throughout, byline) By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Monday an F-35 test plane was involved in an incident on Feb. 14 that caused smoke in the cockpit, and it was sending the affected parts back to their manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc , for a detailed inspection. Kyra Hawn, spokeswoman for the $396 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, said an initial assessment of the incident at a Maryland air base showed it was isolated, software-related, and posed minimal risk. Interim changes had been implemented to prevent another smoke incident, she said. News of the previously unreported incident comes just days after U.S. military officials grounded the entire fleet of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 jets for the second time this year after discovering a 0.6 inch crack on a fan blade in the single jet of another test plane. Honeywell builds the plane’s “power thermal management system,” which uses a lithium-ion battery similar to those whose failures have grounded Boeing Co’s entire fleet of 787 airliners, but Hawn said there was no connection between the Feb. 14 incident and the F-35’s lithium-ion batteries. “It has no linkage whatsoever with the lithium-ion batteries,” Hawn said. She said the Feb. 14 incident was the only one involving smoke in the cockpit of an F-35 “in recent program history.” Lockheed is building three models of the new radar-evading warplane to replace nearly a dozen fighter jets in use by the U.S. military and its allies. The Pentagon plans to buy 2,447 of the advanced fighter in coming decades. Honeywell said it would inspect the system, which manages the distribution of hot and cold air in the F-35 fuselage, once it arrived at the company’s Phoenix testing facility.

141,HON,"Volkswagen rules out Honeywell, DuPont refrigerant","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), the world’s third largest carmaker, has joined compatriot Daimler (DAIGn.DE) in deciding not to use a new air-conditioning refrigerant developed by U.S. firms Honeywell (HON.N) and DuPont DD.N in its cars. Volkswagen plans to roll out carbon dioxide-based air conditioning systems throughout its entire fleet instead of the Honeywell/DuPont refrigerant called HFO-1234yf, which was created to meet more stringent environmental regulation. Daimler engineers testing the flammability of HFO-1234yf discovered that it could spark a fire under the hood of the car strong enough to spread throughout the vehicle. In the process, the chemical emits a highly toxic gas when burning. The U.S. duo invested heavily in bringing to market the refrigerant, which conforms to a new EU directive. Due to its high price, costing 10 times as much as the current common refrigerant R134a, it’s only commercial application is in cars. “Over the course of more than two decades in development, CO2-based automobile air-conditioning systems have experienced a number of performance, cost, safety and environmental issues that have made them a less attractive alternative to automakers globally,” Honeywell said in a statement, after Daimler decided on Thursday to develop a new CO2-based A/C system. Critics of carbon dioxide as a refrigerant argue that it requires a comprehensive and costly redesign of A/C systems, can cause drowsiness among drivers if it leaks into the passenger cabin and may trigger higher indirect carbon emissions since it potentially requires more fuel to operate. While Daimler sold only about 1.5 million Mercedes and Smart cars last year, VW’s decision means Honeywell and DuPont have lost another 9.3 million vehicles worth of business. A spokesman for Volkswagen declined on Friday to say when exactly Volkswagen would begin to use carbon dioxide in its A/C systems, citing such information was relevant for competitors, but ruled out any possibility that it could begin this year.

143,HON,Germany makes new offer over EU-Daimler coolant spat -sources,"* Commission has said will take action if law breached * Honeywell says its product is safe, subject to extensive testing By Barbara Lewis and Francesco Guarascio BRUSSELS, March 13 (Reuters) - Germany has written to the EU executive with a new set of proposals aiming to break a deadlock over law requiring carmakers to stop using extremely potent greenhouse gases in air cooling systems, EU sources said. The problem for Germany is that luxury car giant Daimler AG  says the new, less polluting fluid on the market is dangerously flammable and is refusing to use it. That has set it at odds not only with the European Commission, but with U.S. firm Honeywell International Inc. , which developed the coolant in partnership with Dupont  and says it is safe. “Germany has just sent us a new letter with proposals on how to comply with the directive. We are examining now this new offer. We cannot impose fines on Daimler, but we need to have the directive applied correctly in all member states,” an EU official said on condition of anonymity. Following an earlier exchange of letters, the Commission confirmed on Wednesday that it had received a letter dated March 5 from the German authorities and would “reply in due time”. While the Commission is relying on Germany to enforce EU law and cannot directly fine carmakers, it has said it will start infringement procedures against member states for breach of a new law that forbids the use of any air conditioning fluids with a global warming potential exceeding 150 times the impact of carbon dioxide. The coolant produced by Honeywell named HFO-1234yf is only four times more potent than CO2 and does meet the EU requirement. It compares with the previous industry standard, which has a planet-warming power more than 1,000 times that of CO2. In a Daimler test of HFO-1234yf last year involving a simulated leak, the new coolant burst into flames. The Commission does not prescribe which coolant is used provided that it meets the criteria, but the problem is that any alternative Daimler can develop will take time. “In principle, we have nothing against Daimler if it plans to develop a new refrigerant. The industry has already decided on a refrigerant, but if this is changed in respect of the new rules, we have no problem,” the Commission official said. Germany’s letter makes certain suggestions, which the sources did not disclose. An EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Germany had in addition asked the Commission to grant more time to German authorities. “We feel that the security concerns raised by some car producers should be taken very seriously. Therefore, we feel that it would not serve the desired purpose if we forced car producers to use 1234yf (the new coolant),” the diplomat said. Honeywell says its coolant is highly efficient and safe and has been subject to comprehensive, independent testing. “Daimler had six years to solve this issue. No other carmarker has reported any safety issues,” Paul Sanders, a managing director at Honeywell, said in an interview. “We continue to work with the Commission and member states authorities to enable the full implementation of the directive (EU law).” Officials at Daimler could not immediately be reached for comment.",3132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-daimler/germany-makes-new-offer-over-eu-daimler-coolant-spat-sources-idUSL6N0C5AXI20130313

145,HON,GM's Opel says crash test shows new refrigerant is safe,"* Controversial refrigerant does not start fire in Opel SUV * Testing agency says test done under extreme conditions * Honeywell/DuPont’s 1234yf is only EU-approved refrigerant * Daimler says coolant can cause fire, but test controversial By Christiaan Hetzner FRANKFURT, April 3 (Reuters) - General Motors’ German brand Opel said on Wednesday that it had found no evidence in a crash test on its new Mokka SUV that a controversial air conditioning refrigerant could catch fire in a collision and release toxic fumes. Opel’s domestic rivals Daimler and Volkswagen  are both developing expensive carbon dioxide-based air conditioning systems in order to avoid what they say is a fire hazard posed by Honeywell and DuPont’s new refrigerant HFO-1234yf, which emits poisonous hydrogen fluoride gas when it burns. Opel said a realistic test conducted together with the independent testing agency TÜV Rheinland had failed to ignite refrigerant that leaked from the system after impact. The test is the first to be published since Daimler said in September that 1234yf, the only air conditioning coolant on the market that conforms to a new European Union directive on greenhouse gases, could be the primary source for a vehicle fire. Many in the industry have questioned the relevance of Daimler’s test procedure, but its findings have nevertheless rattled global carmakers, which had so far universally agreed to employ the chemical. It could also cost the two producers of the patented HFO-1234yf billions of dollars in lost investments and revenue. The EU has ordered a phase-out of the widely used refrigerant R134a because of its potency as a greenhouse gas. Opel began installing 1234yf-based systems in its Mokka model at the start of the year but Daimler is violating the EU directive by continuing exclusively to use the non-flammable R134a. Opel research and development chief Michael Ableson said there was “no alternative in the near future to refrigerant 1234yf”. “Other possibilities such as CO2-based refrigerants are still in the development stage and are years away from entering the market,” he said in the statement. Daimler says frontal crash simulations that it conducted internally last August showed that a fire could ignite under the hood of a car when the new Honeywell refrigerant, mixed with air conditioning lubricant, came into contact with the manifold of a turbo-charged petrol engine at around 650 degrees Celsius (1,200 Fahrenheit). Opel said on Wednesday it had crash-tested a 1.4 litre turbo-charged Mokka at a speed of 50 km/h (31 mph) against a movable deformable barrier, meant to simulate driving headlong into the last car in a tailback. It said the impact had damaged the air conditioning system, causing a leak near the Mokka’s hot engine manifold, but without causing a fire. Gunnar Pflug, head of the traffic safety centre at TÜV Rheinland, said the test had been designed and conducted under TÜV Rheinland’s supervision to recreate the extreme conditions that Daimler says are necessary to induce a fire. It included reaching an engine temperature more than 100 degrees Celsius higher than that recorded by Daimler. “Much faster speeds and there would have been nothing left of the engine compartment, basically,” he said. “What we did was no standard test, this was the first of its kind.” Manufacturer Honeywell concedes that the mixture is indeed flammable and releases toxic gases when burning, but argues that Daimler’s simulations employed ‘ideal’ conditions expressly designed to create a desired effect. Daimler, Mercedes’ parent, says simulations as opposed to real crash tests were necessary because each car deforms differently during impact, even if the same test parameters are always applied. Pflug said this was only partly true. “The same parts are not always damaged exactly the same way down to the millimetre, but if it isn’t the third air conditioning fin that breaks, then it’s the second or seventh,” he said.",4032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/gm-honeywell-daimler-refrigerant/gms-opel-says-crash-test-shows-new-refrigerant-is-safe-idUSL5N0CQ3GL20130403

The company, whose products include cockpit electronics, building security systems and turbochargers, reported a 17 percent rise in profit as cost cuts more than made up for flat revenue. Shares of Honeywell were up 4 percent at $74.10 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. General Electric Co (GE.N), in contrast, warned on Friday of slowing profit growth in its industrial businesses due to weakness in Europe and sliding turbine sales, pushing down its stock. “Despite macro headwinds, Honeywell’s guidance still demonstrates an outperformance versus peers,” Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Peter Arment wrote in a note to clients. Declining industrial activity in the United States and Europe has hurt large conglomerates in the past year. Factory activity grew at the slowest rate in three months in March, the Institute for Supply Management said. Honeywell has been trying to improve productivity across its four divisions and consolidate its businesses to boost profit. Chief Executive David Cote said a decline in raw material costs and general cost cuts pushed up margins. Gross margins rose to 16.2 percent in the quarter ended March from 15.2 percent a year earlier. The company has set a target of expanding gross margins to as much as 18 percent by 2014. While sales in Europe and the United States remain subdued, Honeywell expects its business in China to pick up after a weak start to the year. “Inventory levels (in China) are returning to normal and order rates are improving, particularly in our long cycle businesses, signaling a modest recovery over the remainder of the year,” Cote said on a post-earnings conference call.

Industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc  and travel technology company Amadeus IT Holding SA are weighing offers in the second round of bidding for Arinc, the sources said, adding to the roster of companies participating in the auction previously reported by Reuters. Lockheed Martin Corp, Rockwell Collins Inc  and Thales SA, as well as a handful of private equity firms, also made it through to the second round, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month. With fully-financed bids expected at the end of July, Arinc management is spending more time speaking with the aerospace and industrial companies and making more information available to them, rather than the private equity bidders, sources told Reuters this week. Carlyle is hoping that industry players seeking to capture synergies with Arinc and expand their business lines may be willing to pay more than financial investors that will capitalize on Arinc only as a standalone investment, the sources said. Private equity firms Blackstone Group LP, BC Partners Ltd, Warburg Pincus LLC, Hellman & Friedman LLC and Advent International Corp are through to the second round of bidding, sources told Reuters previously. Onex Corp is another buyout firm involved in the process, people familiar with the matter said this week. The sources asked not to be identified because details of the auction are confidential. Carlyle and Honeywell declined to comment, while representatives for Arinc, Amadeus and Onex did not respond to requests for comment. Annapolis, Maryland-based Arinc, founded in 1929, designs systems that help airline pilots communicate with the ground. It also provides transport communications and systems for the defense, government, healthcare, networks and security sectors. Carlyle’s strategy of focusing on selling Arinc to industry players for a higher price tag is not without risk. It could result in private equity firms trying to lowball the auction should the strategic bidders decide to walk away. Carlyle tried to sell Arinc in 2010 but failed to strike a deal. It did not want to sell cheap to another private equity firm, and rival aerospace companies expressed little interest in Arinc as a whole, partly due to concerns over its government consulting services, sources said at the time. Many defense companies had long offered services that included advising government agencies on programs on which the companies ended up bidding, creating conflicts of interest. That prompted the U.S. Congress to pass a law requiring the Department of Defense to tighten rules on potential conflicts. Arinc addressed this by selling its government consulting division to Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp, another Carlyle-backed company, for $154 million last year. Private equity firms buy companies in order to sell them later at a profit. While they can exit their investments in other ways - through sales to other buyout firms or initial public offerings - finding an industry buyer willing to pay top dollar can be the most lucrative route. Warburg Pincus, for example, stands to make close to three times its investment in eyecare company Bausch & Lomb Holdings Inc after reaching an agreement in May to sell it to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International for $8.7 billion. In February, Carlyle co-Chief Executive William Conway lamented what he described as an absence of “aggressive acquirers of assets that we own” despite favorable financing conditions. But he was optimistic that buyers would eventually come forward. “We have been stunned that the strategic players have not become more aggressive. Now we are beginning to see a little bit of activity in that regard,” Conway said on an investor call. Carlyle bought Arinc in 2007 from a group of U.S. airlines for an undisclosed sum. It believes it can fetch between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion for it, people familiar with the matter have said.",7112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/carlyle-arinc-bidders/carlyle-bets-on-strategic-bidders-in-arinc-sale-sources-idUSL6N0FH00N20130711
153,HON,WRAPUP 2-Battery in Honeywell locator eyed in 787 fire probe -source,"* Different type of battery than in earlier groundings * Honeywell says no previous experience of problems * Boeing shares recover much of what they lost Friday * But analysts wary of any new 787 technology issue By Andrea Shalal-Esa and Alwyn Scott WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - Investigators are looking into whether the fire on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner in London last week was caused by the battery of an emergency locator transmitter built by Honeywell International Inc, according to a source familiar with the probe. Passengers and investors appeared to take the news in stride, as airlines continued to fly the plane on Monday and Boeing Co shares regained most of what they lost on Friday on news of the fire on a parked 787 at Heathrow airport. Boeing shares closed up 3.7 percent at $105.66. Honeywell said it had joined the investigation but declined to discuss details beyond saying it had no previous experience of difficulties with this type of transmitter. Some analysts voiced concern about the impact of another technology problem with the new, high-tech airliner. The overheating in January of two battery packs that provide backup power to the plane caused regulators to ground the plane for three months and caused fleet-wide retrofits and delivery delays. “Unless the company can say for sure that the incident is isolated to this particular aircraft, it’s not welcome news,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with the Virginia-based Teal Group. “The one systematic problem to plague the Dreamliner is that so many of its technologies are new that it is very difficult for the regulators to fully grasp all the changes,” he said. Boeing only resumed deliveries of the planes in May after one of the plane’s lithium-ion batteries caught fire and another overheated, requiring a redesign of the battery system and the retrofitting of more than 50 planes. Britain’s Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB), which is leading the probe into the blaze on the Ethiopian Airlines  jet, could take days if not weeks to determine the cause, although a source familiar with the investigation said an initial report could emerge this week. Investigators are studying an emergency locator transmitter, or ELT, which is positioned in the upper rear part of the new airliner and sends a signal that leads rescuers to downed aircraft, said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record. Another source identified Ultralife Corp as the supplier of the battery that powers the Honeywell ELT. Newark, New York-based Ultralife was not immediately available for comment. LITHIUM-MANGANESE U.S. aviation and safety officials said it was the first time they could recall such a transmitter being investigated as the possible cause of an airplane fire. The emergency transmitter is powered by a non-rechargeable lithium-manganese battery. The fact that it is not powered by a lithium-ion battery could allay concerns about a re-occurrence of problems that caused the earlier grounding. Lithium-manganese batteries can be found in some flashlights, digital cameras and military applications. Honeywell on Monday said its ELTs have been Federal Aviation Administration certified since 2005, are in use in numerous types of aircraft and “we’ve not seen nor experienced a single reported issue on this product-line.” The company said it is participating in the investigation and that it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the fire, which left visible scorch marks on the outer skin of the plane. The fire occurred in an area where galley equipment such as water boilers and heaters also are located. “It’s far too premature to speculate on the cause, or draw conclusions,” said Honeywell spokesman Nathan Drevna. Honeywell said it had sent technical experts to London to assist with the investigation and would continue to work closely with Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Boeing declined to comment, or to identify the manufacturer of the battery that powers the transmitter. An NTSB representative said the agency would not provide updates since the investigation was being led by British authorities. Boeing shares rose on Monday as concerns waned about another fleetwide grounding. The 3.7 percent gain followed Friday’s 4.7 percent tumble on news of the fire, knocking $3.8 billion off the company’s market value. Honeywell shares edged down slightly on Monday, closing off seven cents at $82.30. Analysts remained cautious. “Anything that’s electronic in nature is more concerning than ... some kind of human error,” said Jason Gursky, an analyst at Citigroup in San Francisco. “The most important thing to keep in mind from an impact perspective is whether this is a systemic issue, or bad assembly, or a bad part, or somebody left the coffee pot on,” said Gursky The Heathrow fire has also has raised questions about the cost and method to be used in repairing the carbon fiber-reinforced skin of the aircraft. Britain’s AAIB on Saturday said it found no evidence the fire was caused by the 787s lithium-ion batteries that were implicated in the grounding earlier this year. A 25-strong team of experts, including inspectors from the AAIB and the NTSB are investigating the damaged Dreamliner in a hangar at Heathrow airport, some 15 miles west of central London. The FAA and Boeing also are helping in the investigation. A source close to Boeing said the company had officials “on the ground” at Heathrow but that the AAIB-led team were “operating on their own timescale” and had not provided details of when any further public statements would be made. Airlines, including Ethiopian Airlines, Britain’s Thomson Airways, U.S. carrier United Continental, and Poland’s LOT, said they would continue to fly their Dreamliners, while others, such as Virgin Atlantic said they would stick to their plans to buy the aircraft. “Personally I’d fly on a Dreamliner tomorrow - I don’t think it’s a problem for the whole fleet like the battery issue clearly was,” said Howard Wheeldon, an aerospace analyst at Wheeldon Strategic Advisory. “I’d expect the AAIB to know what caused the fire by the end of this week but the question for Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines is ‘is the plane repairable’?”",7152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-dreamliner/wrapup-2-battery-in-honeywell-locator-eyed-in-787-fire-probe-source-idUSL6N0FL3HB20130715

155,HON,UK Dreamliner fire probe confirms looking at Honeywell part,"LONDON (Reuters) - British investigators said on Tuesday a transmitter made by U.S. firm Honeywell was one of several components that may have caused a fire on a Boeing Dreamliner in London last week. “We can confirm that Honeywell have been invited to join the investigation,” a spokesman for Britain’s Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB) said on Tuesday. “The emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is one (of) several components being looked at in detail as part of the investigation and it would be premature to speculate on the causes of the incident at this stage.” Britain’s AAIB is leading the probe into a blaze on an Ethiopian Airlines jet that broke out last Friday and has already allayed fears about a return of problems with overheating batteries that grounded the Dreamliner for months earlier this year. A source familiar with the probe told Reuters on Monday that investigators were now looking into whether the fire, which occurred at London’s Heathrow airport, was caused by the battery of an ELT built by Honeywell. Honeywell said at that point only that it had joined the investigation into the fire, declining to discuss details beyond saying it had no previous experience of difficulties with this type of transmitter. The company’s British spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The ELT, which is positioned in the upper rear part of the new airline, sends a signal that leads rescuers to downed aircraft. It is powered by a non-rechargeable lithium-manganese battery. The AAIB, which is leading the probe into the fire, said on Saturday it found no evidence the fire was caused by the lithium-ion batteries that were implicated in the 787’s grounding earlier this year. But the focus on the emergency beacon raised alarms for some analysts, who said more technology problems with the new, high-tech airliner would be troubling. “It’s good to see the AAIB are getting closer to finding out what happened but what we really need to know now is if this is a one off or a problem for the whole Dreamliner fleet - that is the crucial point for Boeing and airlines,” said Howard Wheeldon, an aerospace analyst at Wheeldon Strategic Advisory. The Dreamliner in question has been moved to a hangar at Heathrow where it is under technical investigation. A 25 strong team of experts, including inspectors from the AAIB and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the damaged Dreamliner. Ethiopian Airlines, one of Africa’s top five carriers, said it would continue to fly its Dreamliner fleet. It has ordered a total of 10 Dreamliners, of which four have been delivered. Airlines, including Britain’s Thomson Airways, U.S. carrier United Continental, and Poland’s LOT, said they would also continue to fly their Dreamliners, while others, such as Virgin Atlantic confirmed they would stick to their plans to buy the aircraft. Boeing reiterated it was acting as an advisor to the investigation and has a team on the ground working in support of authorities. “We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity,” a Boeing spokesman said.

That device is powered by a lithium manganese battery, a long-life battery that has been around for decades and used widely in the military as well as products like digital cameras, walkie-talkies and pacemakers. The following are some facts about these batteries: - Lithium manganese dioxide batteries (LiMnO2) are disposable, or “primary” batteries, that have a shelf life of 10 years or more. They offer double the voltage and last at least two times longer than cheaper alkaline counterparts. - They should not be confused with lithium-ion batteries, a powerful family of rechargeable batteries. These devices are used widely in smart phones, electric cars and in other parts of the Dreamliner. In its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, General Motors Co (GM.N) uses a lithium-ion battery with a manganese chemistry. - Lithium manganese battery cells come in a number of shapes, including the cylindrical form often used in consumer products. - About half of each cell is made up of manganese dioxide while lithium accounts for 3 to 4 percent, according to a fact sheet from Saft Groupe S1A.PA dated November 2012. - Other makers of lithium manganese batteries include Ultralife (ULBI.O), identified by a source as the supplier to Honeywell, Sony (6758.T), Panasonic (6752.T) and Eagle Picher EGLP.PK.

161,HON,Honeywell says would remove 787 beacons if asked as fire probed,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) on Wednesday said it would temporarily remove its emergency locator beacons from Boeing (BA.N) 787s if asked to do so under recommendations that sources said British authorities could release within days as part of an initial report on a fire on a Dreamliner jet in London last week. Investigators have been looking at several components, including a lithium manganese battery in the Honeywell emergency locator transmitter (ELT), as possible causes for the fire that caused extensive damage to a parked Ethiopian Airlines ETHA.UL 787 in London last Friday. The battery is made by New York-based Ultralife Corp (ULBI.O), a source told Reuters on Monday. Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which is leading the investigation, may suggest temporarily removing the devices from the new Boeing Dreamliners while the probe continues, according to one source familiar with the probe who was not authorized to speak publicly. A second source familiar with the investigation said the AAIB could issue a report in the next few days that includes some recommendations, without giving details on the proposals. Honeywell’s emergency beacons are in use on a wide range of airplanes. The latest fire on board Boeing’s new composite airliner comes on the heels of a three-month grounding linked to problems with much larger lithium-ion batteries on the plane. Sources close to the investigation say it is turning out to be more complex than initially expected given that the fire caused severe damage to the upper portion of the jet’s rear fuselage. As in the earlier probe, investigators are finding it difficult to pinpoint the cause of the fire. A spokeswoman for the AAIB on Wednesday reiterated that Honeywell’s ELT was one of several components being looked at in detail as part of the investigation, but said it would be premature to speculate on the causes of the incident. AAIB has declined to identify any other components that might be under scrutiny. Boeing says its highest priority is the safety of the new airplanes, and it is working closely with authorities to “understand exactly what happened - and why,” wrote Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in a blog posted on Wednesday. “While the investigation continues, the 787 fleet is flying as normal. We’re confident the 787 is a safe airplane and we stand behind its overall integrity,” Tinseth wrote. The AAIB’s possible move to remove ELTs was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said that ELTs are not required for a plane to be certified for passenger flight. The Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, said the AAIB is preparing to ask the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency to assess the necessity of the devices on 787s. Officials at the FAA and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which have both sent representatives to London to assist with the investigation, declined comment, referring queries to the AAIB. A spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency said he had no information on the elements contained in the WSJ report Honeywell said the report was based on “anonymous speculation” and said its officials had not been contacted by British or U.S. authorities involved in the investigation. However, spokesman Steve Brecken said Honeywell always puts safety first and “would support an action like this as a precautionary measure if our team, or the AAIB and NTSB, determine it’s necessary to do so.” Honeywell says it has built over 3,000 emergency beacons since they were first certified in 2005, and insists that it has not seen or experienced a single reported issue with them. The FAA did issue a special airworthiness notice in 2009 in which it advised airlines to replace the antenna used by an earlier version of the Honeywell transmitter because it had failed in tests. Other global regulators published similar advisories at the time. Asked about that notice, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said there was no indication of fire risk linked to the earlier antenna problems. The ELT, which is positioned in the upper rear part of the 787, sends a signal that leads rescuers to downed aircraft. ELTs are largely redundant on most large jets since their routes are closely tracked by radar or air traffic controllers , except for long-range polar routes, said one aviation expert. All planes also come with flight data recorders and voice data recorders that have sonar “pingers” that are activated in the event of a crash into water, when the ELT devices would not work anyway, said the expert. The FAA also had no comment on the Journal’s report that some FAA officials were arguing to shift jurisdiction for the fire investigation to the U.S. agency, since the Ethiopian plane was parked, rather than in flight, and was certified by the FAA.

162,HON,"UPDATE 6-Beacon focus of Boeing fire probe, Boston plane upsets investors","* UK recommends turning off beacons on 787s * Reports urges review of transmitters on all planes * Probe turns to humidity, condensation - sources * Honeywell expects no financial impact * Boeing stock gains eroded by Boston incident By Rhys Jones and Alwyn Scott and Andrea Shalal-Esa LONDON/SEATTLE/WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - British aviation investigators identified an emergency beacon made by Honeywell International Inc as a likely source of last week’s blaze on a Boeing Co 787 Dreamliner and called for it to be turned off, spurring a rally in Boeing shares by relieved investors. Later on Thursday a Japan Airlines 787 returned to Boston’s Logan airport after receiving an in-flight maintenance alert about a fuel pump. A spokesman for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said the incident was not an emergency but nervous investors marked Boeing shares down 1.5 percent in afterhours trade. Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the locator beacon and its battery was the only system on a parked Ethiopian Airlines plane at Heathrow that was near the fire and had the power to start it. Boeing said the beacon could be removed in about an hour from its newest model plane, which was grounded for more than three months earlier this year because of overheating of  lithium-ion backup batteries in two January incidents. Shares of Boeing closed 2.7 percent higher at $107.63, near the high of $108.15 reached a week ago before the fire. The Boston incident then saw the shares slip to $106. The AAIB said it remained unclear whether the fire was triggered by a malfunction in the beacon’s lithium-manganese battery or some external force - such as an electrical short circuit - and said the probe would continue. In its report, the AAIB also called on the FAA and other regulators to review use of such emergency beacons that use lithium-based batteries on all other aircraft. UK officials said last week’s fire was unrelated to the January incidents that grounded the 787. Investigators never determined what prompted the batteries involved in those cases to melt down, but Boeing resolved the issue by fireproofing the box they come in, and finding a way to vent any possible fire outside the plane. And there was no indication the return to Boston of the Japan Airlines plane was in anyway connected to previous incidents involving the Dreamliner but it underscored the caution now surrounding the high-tech aircraft. “The pilot decided to turn back out of an abundance of caution,” Richard Walsh, spokesman for Boston’s Logan International Airport told Reuters. Carol Anderson, a spokeswoman for Japan Airlines, said Flight JL007, bound for Tokyo with 184 passengers on board, got a maintenance message related to the fuel pump about three hours after leaving Boston. The plane returned to Boston as a standard precautionary measure, landing safely at the airport at 6:16 p.m. (2216 GMT), and there was no sign of smoke, Anderson said. It was a fire in a parked Japan Airlines 787 at Boston in January that helped lead to the earlier groundings of the Dreamliner, a plane that combines light-weight composite parts and new electrical systems to achieve its fuel efficiency. While the UK report focused on the beacon made by U.S. conglomerate Honeywell, aviation experts said there could also be issues with the 787’s higher humidity or other environmental factors. Water can conduct electricity, so high moisture levels could increase the likelihood of short circuits. “The investigators are looking at everything, humidity, condensation and ... how things are installed. It’s a comprehensive effort,” said one industry source. Boeing’s new plane has a relatively high humidity, which helps keeps passengers more comfortable, and investigators are now looking at whether there is enough insulation to prevent moisture from condensing and short circuiting systems such as the beacon, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. A source close to Boeing, speaking on condition that he not be named, said the 787 may need better isolation of electrical components from the plane’s high humidity, something industry people refer to as “rain in the plane.” Analysts said they were watching for further developments. “There’s nothing about this finding that indicates a lack of safety with the plane, but on the other hand there’s no conclusive proof that a system unrelated to the plane is to blame,” said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group. Analyst Yan Derocles of Paris-based Oddo Securities agreed. “We have to wait for the conclusions and at that point it could be a problem for Boeing, because the succession of incidents could chip away at confidence in the 787,” he said. Boeing said the locator beacon is not required by U.S. Federal Aviation Administration regulations, although some other nations do mandate their use. “If the AAIB recommendation is adopted by regulators, 787 operators would operate their airplanes without a functioning ELT. ELTs are not required as part of the airplane design. There was no requirement to operate the ELTs during 787 flight test,” said Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel. The beacons, also called emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) are positioned in the upper rear of the 787, and can lead rescuers to a downed aircraft. They are powered by non-rechargeable, lithium-manganese batteries used for decades in products like digital cameras, walkie-talkies and pacemakers. Honeywell said it would help Boeing and the airlines as needed, but cautioned that it was premature to jump to conclusions about the fire. It said it did not expect any financial impact from the AAIB’s recommended action. Honeywell shares rose 0.6 percent on Thursday to close at $82.97. The AAIB report said the fire broke out in the upper portion of the 787’s rear fuselage where the ELT devices are located. “There are no other aircraft systems in this vicinity which, with the aircraft unpowered, contain stored energy capable of initiating a fire in the area of head damage,” it said. It said large transport aircraft do not have fire detection or suppression in the space above the cabin ceiling, “had this event occurred in flight it could pose a significant safety concern.” Boeing said it supported the AAIB’s recommendations and reiterated its confidence in the Dreamliner’s safety. In Washington, the FAA said it was reviewing the report. The battery linked to the London fire is made by Newark, New York-based Ultralife Corp, according to an industry source. Ultralife did not return calls or emails seeking comment. Its shares fell 1.8 percent to $3.76. The AAIB said Honeywell had produced some 6,000 ELTs of the same design, which are fitted to a wide range of aircraft, and this had been the only significant “thermal incident.” The battery cells in the beacon showed signs of “disruption” the AAIB report said. “It is not clear however, whether the combustion in the area of the ELT was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short.”",7182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-dreamliner/update-6-beacon-focus-of-boeing-fire-probe-boston-plane-upsets-investors-idUSL6N0FO3FJ20130718

Honeywell said it would offer assistance to Boeing and the airlines that operate the 787 if needed. It said the temporary action was straightforward and it did not anticipate any material financial impact to the company. Honeywell noted that the UK probe was continuing. The report said it was not clear whether the battery in the emergency beacon caught fire because of some internal release of energy or something external like an electrical short. “The investigation continues, and it’s premature to jump to conclusions,” said spokesman Steve Brecken. He said Honeywell also supported conducting safety reviews for installations of any lithium battery-powered electronic locator transmitters from the variety of manufacturers who sell them.

He said the device’s main purpose is to alert and guide rescue crews to the location of an airplane in the event of an accident, but the equipment was not required as part of the airplane design. “It is not a U.S. Federal Aviation Regulation requirement, but it is required by some foreign regulators for their airlines or their airspace,” Birtel said.

165,HON,Factbox: Honeywell rescue beacon had trouble before Boeing fire,"(Reuters)  Aviation investigators were examining the lithiumbased battery of an emergency rescue beacon made by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) as a possible cause of or contributor to a fire that badly burned a Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 in London last week. A different model of the Honeywell emergency locator transmitter (ELT) faced scrutiny from regulators in 2009. Here are some facts about the beacon and its regulatory history: The device is located in the rear fuselage section of the 787. The Ethiopian Airlines ETHA.UL jet that caught fire on July 12 was parked at Heathrow Airport for eight hours before the fire was noticed. The fire caused “extensive heat damage” in the upper part of the rear fuselage and smoke throughout the cabin, according to the U.K. Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which is leading the probe of the fire. The blaze scorched the outer hull near the vertical tail fin, the area where the beacon is located. No one was aboard the plane and there were no injuries. The 13 airlines that currently fly the 787 continue to use it. The AAIB said it was looking at several of the 787’s components as potential causes of the fire. The Honeywell ELT uses a nonrechargeable lithiummanganese battery, a longlife unit that has been around for decades and is used widely in the military as well as in products like digital cameras, walkietalkies and pacemakers. In December 2009, Canada, where the beacon was originally manufactured, called for suspect parts to be modified or replaced after tests found that two units were unable to broadcast the emergency homing signal on the right frequency. Honeywell traced the problem to “improper grounding of the cover to the internal frame” and issued a service bulletin that contained a fix. Canada issued an airworthiness directive and other regulators also put out statements noting concerns about the devices. The 2009 Transport Canada directive said if the problem was uncorrected, it could “expose aircraft occupants to unnecessary safety risk during an actual emergency situation.” The directive involves an earlier model from the beacon available for the 787 that entered service in October 2011. Airlines buy the beacons directly from the manufacturer and most airlines carry them, industry sources say. Honeywell said on Wednesday that the ELT in the Ethiopian Airlines 787 was a different model than those cited in 2009.

166,HON,Honeywell cost cutting drives profit higher,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) reported a stronger quarterly profit as it cut costs and sold more security systems for buildings and turbochargers for cars and trucks, nudging its shares to a lifetime high. The 13 percent increase in profit, helped by higher margins and a lower tax bill, beat analysts’ expectations and the company raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast. Honeywell, a supplier to Boeing Co (BA.N), has said it expects no material financial impact from an investigation into whether one of its emergency beacons was the cause of a fire aboard a parked 787 Dreamliner last week. British aviation investigators have identified the beacon as the likely source. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) will make recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after completing a probe into the fire. Asked about the investigation on a post-earnings conference call, Honeywell Chief Executive David Cote said: “Wait until they’ve done the job, and when you look at the AAIB and the FAA they will do a good job sorting this whole thing through.” Honeywell, which also supplies the U.S. military, has attempted to reduce costs and improve productivity to counter the impact of a weak European market and sequestration-related budget cuts by the U.S. government. Cost reductions also came in handy for Honeywell’s rival, General Electric Co (GE.N), on Friday as it beat quarterly profit expectations by a penny. Cote, credited with rebuilding Honeywell over the last decade through an aggressive cost-containment strategy, said the company would focus on revenue growth by developing new products and expanding production capacity. “While investing for productivity is important, it sure is a lot easier to expand margins when sales are growing,” he said. On Friday, Honeywell reported second-quarter earnings of $1.28 per share, topping the average analyst estimate by 7 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also raised the low end of its current-year pro-forma earnings-per-share forecast to $4.85 from $4.80. The top end was unchanged at $4.95. Analysts said Honeywell’s second-quarter earnings beat was driven by a lower tax rate, which added 6 cents to earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter fell to 23.1 percent from 26.0 percent a year earlier. Pension and post-retirement benefit payments fell to $42 million during the second quarter from $308 million a year earlier, while the company’s operating income margin rose to 14.3 percent from 13.6 percent. “Tax and pension helped EPS substantially, but the company also continued to fund some additional restructuring, helping overall earnings quality,” J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to clients. For the third quarter, the company forecast earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 per share, in line with analysts’ expectations of $1.24 per share. It forecast revenue in a range of $9.8 billion to $10.0 billion, also roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts. Honeywell shares edged up 0.5 percent to $83.38 on the New York Stock Exchange, having earlier touched an all-time high of $84.80. Its stock has risen more than 40 percent in the last 12 months.

167,HON,"Exclusive: Probe of Boeing's 787 focuses on condensation, emergency beacon","WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Officials investigating the fire on a parked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 are focused on how condensation and increased humidity could have sparked the blaze at London’s Heathrow Airport last week, three sources familiar with the probe said. British authorities said on Thursday an emergency beacon made by Honeywell International Inc was the likely source of the fire, and called for the device to be turned off. But the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was still trying to understand what sparked the fire. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is close to taking steps to follow the AAIB recommendations. The July 12 fire rekindled concerns in the industry about Boeing Co’s advanced carbon-composite Dreamliner, which was grounded for more three months earlier this year after two incidents involving overheated lithium-ion batteries. The AAIB said the London fire is not related to those batteries. Investigators are still trying to determine if condensation on the plane may have seeped into the Honeywell emergency locator transmitter (ELT), triggering a short circuit in the unit’s battery, which is made by Ultralife Corp, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly because the probe is still ongoing. Condensation is normal on big airliners, but the 787 has a higher level of humidity to make passengers more comfortable. The Dreamliner is pressurized at about 6,000 feet, compared to 8,000 for most other airliners. Water conducts electricity, so high moisture levels could raise the likelihood of short circuits. Long term exposure to moisture can cause corrosion on electrical wires and batteries. The 787 carries humidity controls made by CTT Systems AB of Sweden. The company had no immediate comment. CTT’s website said its system controls condensation on aircraft, including the 787, and is in use on other aircraft. Officials are also looking at the placement of the emergency locator transmitter, which is bolted onto a bracket attached to the frame of the airplane - this is exactly where condensation tends to build up, one of the sources said. “Condensation, humidity and installation - that’s the focal point of the investigation,” the source said. The emergency beacon must pass a test to prove it can be submerged under one meter of water for one hour. It is unclear what effect any condensation buildup inside the plane would have on the device, which is encased in aluminum, and its battery, the source added. Honeywell makes the beacon, which is not required by U.S. aviation regulations but mandated by some countries. Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said all 68 787s in operation have the beacons because all its airline customers chose that option. Boeing installs the beacons in different areas of the plane, depending on an airline’s preference and its home country’s regulations. Birtel said Boeing had no plans to switch suppliers and that the company will “continue to work with the investigators and regulators to devise acceptable mitigating action if required.” The emergency beacons are powered by non-rechargeable, lithium-manganese batteries used for decades in products like digital cameras and pacemakers, because of their long life. Last week’s fire came less than three months after Ethiopian Airlines and others resumed flying the brand-new all composite plane, following the FAA grounding. Investigators are also looking at what effect the long grounding may have had on the batteries and electrical systems used on the plane, said one of the sources. The Ethiopian Airlines plane sat outside in the hot African sun for months, raising questions about whether that could have affected the battery in the locator beacon, said the source. Thursday’s AAIB report did not mention the condensation issue but said a detailed examination of the burned ELT and “the possible mechanisms for the initiation and sustaining of the fire” were continuing. It also noted that there was no equipment to detect or suppress fire in the area where the blaze broke out. Two of the sources emphasized that investigators were continuing a comprehensive review of a variety of components and issues. But they said the complex interaction of humidity and wiring on the plane was a clear focus. One question that investigators are wrestling with is whether there is enough insulation to prevent moisture from condensing and short circuiting systems such as the beacon, one of the sources said. Another source, who is close to Boeing, said the 787 may need better isolation of electrical components. Investigators have yet to determine what prompted the lithium-ion power batteries involved in the earlier fire and overheating to melt down. Boeing resolved the issue by redesigning those batteries to better guard against heat buildup, encasing them in fireproof steel boxes and cutting a vent in the plane to dump smoke and heat away from passengers.

171,HON,FAA to airlines: remove or inspect Boeing 787 beacons,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday instructed airlines to remove or inspect emergency beacons in Boeing Co’s 787 Dreamliners, following a fire earlier this month that was traced to one of the units, made by Honeywell International Inc. The airworthiness directive goes farther than the guidance from the FAA last week, when it said airlines should inspect the units on 787s for pinched wires in the casing and evidence of heat or moisture. The agency is now aligned with Boeing, which advised airlines last week to inspect or remove the device, known as an emergency locator transmitter or ELT. The issue arose after fire broke out on a 787 owned by Ethiopian Airlines after it had been parked for eight hours at a remote stand at London’s Heathrow airport. The fire caused extensive damage in the rear of the plane and scorched the top of the outer skin of the fuselage just forward of the vertical tail fin. The Dreamliner’s fuselage is made of carbon-fiber composite, a material that burns at a lower temperature than the aluminum alloy used in traditional aircraft designs. The fire has set up the first test of a major repair of the jet, which industry experts say airlines will be watching closely to determine both the length of time required and the cost to fix the jet’s body. On Wednesday, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said the plane maker was in discussions with Ethiopian Airlines about how to conduct the repair, and that no decisions had been made yet. McNerney said “it was a little premature” to say how long the repair would take.

177,HON,U.S. puts conditions on Honeywell's Intermec purchase,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Friday cleared Honeywell International’s proposed purchase of mobile computing device maker Intermec on the condition that Honeywell license to a competitor certain key patents used in barcode scanners. “Although divestiture of assets is the preferred remedy in merger cases, licensing requirements can preserve competition in markets where access to needed technology is the main barrier to entry,” said Deborah Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement. The FTC will require New Jersey based conglomerate Honeywell to license to Italy’s Datalogic IP TECH s.r.l. patents used to make two-dimensional bar code scanners for the next 12 years. “The proposed order gives Datalogic access to the patents it needs to enter the U.S. market immediately and restore the competition lost due to the merger,” Feinstein said. Intermec, headquartered in Everett, Washington, makes radio frequency identification (RFID) readers as well as retail barcode scanners and other related items. The $600 million deal was approved by the EU in June. Regulators there said the transaction would not raise competition concerns because of the existence of credible competitors in relevant markets. The merger was approved by Intermec shareholders in March. On the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell closed 0.33 percent higher at $84.06 and Intermec rose 1.3 percent to $10.01.

182,HON,Honeywell seeks clarity on U.S. airline display panel proposal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell on Tuesday said it wanted U.S. air safety regulators to explain a new proposal to compel airlines to change cockpit instrument panels the company makes for Boeing planes over concerns that Wi-Fi signals could wipe out crucial readings and create a risk of crashing. Honeywell noted that the Federal Aviation Administration was content to make replacement of the cockpit displays optional. But on Tuesday, the FAA proposed compelling airlines to make about $10,000 in changes to each display panel. The agency cited concerns that Wi-Fi signals from passenger mobile devices could wipe out speed and altitude readings for up to six minutes. Honeywell Aerospace Chief Executive Tim Mahoney, in an interview at Reuters offices in New York, said the problems, which include cockpit display screens flickering or blanking completely, occurred only once in a test last year, and that Honeywell and Boeing Co had already advised airlines to replace the displays. “The one case that was experienced on the ground was addressed and we worked with Boeing and that was concluded in 2012,” Mahoney said. “Honeywell needs to better understand what if anything has changed that would have changed that disposition” from advising airlines to change the displays to requiring it. If enacted, the proposed FAA rule would affect displays on 139 Boeing 737 and 18 777 planes in the U.S., the FAA said, pegging the cost refitting all the U.S. planes at $1.6 million. More aircraft would be affected if foreign regulators adopted the rule. The 737 is Boeing’s best-selling jet and about 5,500 are in service around the world. The FAA said it proposed the rule in part because the safety issue “is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type of design.” A spokesman for the agency said officials were checking about further justification for the rule. Mahoney said it was not known how many airlines had already switched to an updated display that guards against the Wi-Fi problem. Boeing said it put updated displays on 737s and 777s starting in September of 2012 and that the proposed rule simply “mirrors” the advice Boeing gave to airlines last November. Honeywell already is subject to an FAA action involving a radio beacon it sells that is suspected of causing a fire on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner earlier this year. The FAA on September 18 required inspections of the beacons on some 3,800 aircraft because of the fire risk. The beacons help rescuers locate wreckage if a plane crashes. The proposed FAA action comes as airlines are beefing up onboard Wi-Fi systems to provide passengers more bandwidth and better coverage on long-haul trips over water. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines American Airlines, US Airways and other carriers already offer Wi-Fi service to passengers on at least some aircraft, typically through providers such as Gogo Inc. JetBlue Airways recently got the regulatory green light to put a high-speed satellite-linked broadband service on its jets. This month, an FAA advisory committee is due to recommend the possible loosening of restrictions on use of personal electronic devices on board aircraft. Right now, devices must be powered down during takeoff and landing. The advisory group includes representatives from airlines, government, pilots, consumer electronics firms and plane makers, including Boeing and Airbus. Amazon.com, which makes the Kindle e-reader, is the only device maker on the 28-member committee, according to its charter. Device makers Apple, Google and Samsung are not on the committee. The proposed FAA rule would affect the “phase 3” version of the Honeywell Aerospace cockpit display and related software. Planes typically have several of the displays, which show flight data such as speed, altitude, aircraft pitch and roll, and heading. In testing, the FAA said, the phase 3 displays blanked out for up to six minutes, showing they were susceptible to radio signals from Wi-Fi even when the power of the Wi-Fi signals were below levels that the displays were designed to withstand. If a screen went blank on takeoff or landing it could cause “loss of control of the airplane at an altitude insufficient for recovery,” the FAA said. The FAA will accept public comment on the rule until November 8. Under an FAA rule issued this month, Honeywell’s emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) are being inspected by airlines around the world for faults that could spark a fire. The FAA followed Transport Canada in requiring the inspections after an Ethiopian Airlines 787 Dreamliner parked at London Heathrow Airport caught fire in July. Mahoney said inspections had turned up other examples of problems with other ELTs, but those have not started fires. The investigation by the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the Ethiopian Airline fire is likely to last another few months, Mahoney said. “The rigorous investigation is continuing” and includes the possible effect of the higher humidity on 787s compared with other jets, along with mechanical and electrical interference in the area of the 787 where the fire started, he said.

184,HON,"CEOs take familiar, frustrating path to Washington on budget woes","(Reuters) - Some of America’s leading CEOs are beating a familiar path to Washington to support a stopgap bill to raise the U.S. borrowing limit and avert a government shutdown, warning lawmakers that the specter of the first debt default in the country’s history and a credit downgrade is damaging the economy. The business leaders, all members of a group called “Fix the Debt,” said they went to Capitol Hill last week with a simple message for Republicans and Democrats, but it is the same as the one they delivered in budget standoffs of 2011 and 2012. “Engage in whatever political machinations you wish, but do not default,” said Honeywell International Inc Chief Executive David Cote. “Don’t throw away a credit history built up since George Washington.” For these corporate leaders, it’s a bit like the movie “Groundhog Day,” where the main character lives the same day over and over, wondering whether there is a way out of the scene. The U.S. government faces the possibility of a partial shutdown of operations on October 1 as Congress struggles to pass an emergency spending bill. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives want a one-year delay in the October 1 start of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation, in return for raising U.S. borrowing authority by enough to let the Treasury borrow through the end of 2014. Even though many of the CEOs believe federal spending is excessive and the deficit puts U.S. economic health at risk, they want Congress to pass an emergency measure. On Friday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 235 other business groups joined the push. In a joint letter to Congress, they urged lawmakers to fund the government past the deadline and to “act expeditiously to raise the nation’s debt limit.” The letter also said, “It is not in the best interest of the employers, employees or the American people to risk a government shutdown that will be economically disruptive and create even more uncertainties for the U.S. economy.” The “Fix the Debt” group calls for any short-term debt deal to be followed by fiscal reform to reduce the deficit. The CEOs insist that avoiding a shutdown cannot be the final goal and say a comprehensive bipartisan agreement on politically sensitive tax and spending reforms is needed. They concede it will be tough to achieve in the deeply divided and gridlocked Congress. “There’s plenty of different plans; what we haven’t done is land on one that everybody buys into,” said Bob Moritz, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Honeywell’s Cote, Tenneco Inc CEO Gregg Sherrill and Paul Stebbins, executive chairman of World Fuel Services Corp, plan to take an even bigger group of chief executives to Washington in October. “It’s not for us to articulate precisely what the negotiated settlement should look like,” Stebbins said. “But we’re telling them that the dysfunction is doing deep damage to the country and to the world’s perception of us.” With current funding scheduled to expire at the end of September and the government fast approaching the $16.7 trillion debt limit imposed by Congress earlier this year, Stebbins said the group urged lawmakers to pass the continuing resolution and not delay Obamacare. “It’s just reckless to try to hold it hostage - to hold the whole country hostage - because you don’t like a law,” Stebbins said. Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s CEO Lloyd Blankfein said that although he was optimistic an agreement to raise the debt ceiling would ultimately pass, concerns that Congress would fail to act in time were hurting markets and the economy. “Saying we’ll blow up the credit rating is not responsible,” Blankfein said on Wednesday on a panel of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York. NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer, however, said markets have so far taken little notice of the debt ceiling debate. Niederauer said that anxiety over a potential government shutdown is “the only thing that’s stopping the U.S. economy from really being unleashed in a positive way.” The last close-call on a government shutdown in December 2012 and early 2013 dealt a blow to small-business confidence, hurting lending and job growth, said Richard Hunt, head of a trade group called the Consumer Bankers Association. Hunt told reporters on Wednesday that experienced lawmakers understand the implications of shutting down the government, but some newer members do not seem to realize how wide-ranging the effects could be. “Some of these people who just got elected believe they are here to save the country, and they’re not worried about a two- or three-day shutdown,” Hunt said. “So we need to make sure we have adults in both parties right now.” ",9272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fiscal-ceos/ceos-take-familiar-frustrating-path-to-washington-on-budget-woes-idUSBRE98Q0W420130927
185,HON,Honeywell projects big jump in automotive turbos by 2018,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The use of turbo chargers to boost power in smaller automotive engines is expected to increase rapidly over the next five years, with the greatest growth anticipated in China, according to Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), a major player in the sector. Driving the growth spurt are twin pressures on the global auto industry to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, which in turn are driving an industry-wide reduction in engine size. “Turbo charging is a no-compromise solution,” said Terrence Hahn, president and CEO of Honeywell Transportation Systems. The devices, which force-feed a more compressed air-fuel mixture that burns more efficiently in gasoline and diesel engines, can help improve performance and acceleration in smaller engines, Hahn said, “but not at the cost of fuel efficiency.” Honeywell, the world’s largest turbo charger manufacturer, forecasts that the devices will be installed on nearly 40 percent of vehicles sold globally in 2018. That projection, which is in line with independent sector forecasts, amounts to more than 32 million vehicles, up 33 percent from about 24 million this year. Nearly one-third of those vehicles, about 10 million in 2018, will be sold in China, compared with 4 million this year, Hahn said in an interview with Reuters. In comparison, turbo charged vehicles in North America are expected to grow from about 3.9 million to 6.5 million over the same period, he said. China’s higher turbo volume projection is partly a function of an overall vehicle market that continues to outpace North America and Europe. Hahn said tighter emissions regulations and higher taxes on larger engines in China are additional incentives. Reflecting the rising popularity of turbo chargers in all major markets, Honeywell has more than 500 new applications that are expected to reach production within the next 24 months, Hahn said. In addition to Honeywell, there are a handful of other players in the sector, notably BorgWarner Inc (BWA.N), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011.T) and IHI Corp (7013.T). The devices are used on a broad range of vehicles, from subcompact cars to heavy-duty trucks. Hahn declined to specify how much revenue the turbo charger business generates for Honeywell. But industry research firms project global revenues for the sector of more than $12 billion by 2017.

186,HON,Honeywell cuts revenue forecast as defense unit lags,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) on Friday reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, due in part to supply problems at its defense unit, and the U.S. manufacturing conglomerate cut its full-year sales forecast. Shares of Honeywell, which also makes cockpit electronics and systems to manage the climate and security of large buildings, fell more than 3 percent. Third-quarter sales dropped 11 percent in the Defense & Space Division, which supplies parts and equipment to military and government projects. Honeywell attributed the decline mainly to supply chain problems and the U.S. government sequestration program, a series of spending cuts on federal projects. “We just didn’t get parts or components for a number of the products we needed to have in order to ship them, or we had quality issues,” Chief Financial Officer David Anderson said in an interview. “It’s not lost sales; it’s just delayed revenue.” The supply problems have largely been fixed and should not resurface, Anderson said. Honeywell has been working to increase productivity and cut costs in the past year, part of a wide-ranging plan to improve results. As a result, the company raised the bottom end of its full-year profit outlook by 5 cents a share. The company has been able to increase labor performance due to its restructuring programs, in some cases doubling productivity, Anderson said. “It’s in our DNA to aggressively manage our cost structure,” he said. Honeywell now expects to earn $4.90 to $4.95 per share in 2013. The top end of the forecast matches analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, though, now expects 2013 revenue of $38.8 billion to $39 billion, down from a previous forecast of $38.9 billion to $39.3 billion. The delayed closing of Honeywell’s $600 million purchase of mobile computing device maker Intermec was the major reason for the lowered revenue forecast. The deal closed in September, but Honeywell had expected that to happen earlier in the year. The company posted third-quarter net income of $990 million, or $1.24 per share, compared with $950 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3 percent to $9.65 billion, but missed analysts’ expectations of $9.92 billion. Chief Executive Officer David Cote said on a conference call with investors that performance should continue to improve next year. Shares of the Morris Township, New Jersey-based company were down 3.1 percent at $84.21 in midday trading. (The story has been filed again to change “lot” to “lost” in the fourth paragraph.)

Honeywell has been working to increase productivity and cut costs in the past year, part of a wide-ranging plan to improve results. As a result, the company raised the bottom end of its full-year profit outlook by 5 cents a share. The company has been able to increase labor performance due to its restructuring programs, in some cases doubling productivity, Anderson said. “It’s in our DNA to aggressively manage our cost structure,” he said. Honeywell now expects to earn $4.90 to $4.95 per share in 2013. The top end of the forecast matches analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, though, now expects 2013 revenue of $38.8 billion to $39 billion, down from a previous forecast of $38.9 billion to $39.3 billion. The delayed closing of Honeywell’s $600 million purchase of mobile computing device maker Intermec was the major reason for the lowered revenue forecast. The deal closed in September, but Honeywell had expected that to happen earlier in the year. The company posted third-quarter net income of $990 million, or $1.24 per share, compared with $950 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3 percent to $9.65 billion, but missed analysts’ expectations of $9.92 billion. Chief Executive Officer David Cote said on a conference call with investors that performance should continue to improve next year.

189,HON,Business jet sales to top $18 bln as buyers seek bigger planes,"NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Sales of business jets are expected reach $18.4 billion this year, up about 8 percent from last year, a sign of further economic strengthening despite some pockets of weakness notably in Asia, according to a forecast by Honeywell Aerospace. The forecast expects continued recovery from the economic low of 2009, and for growing demand for bigger jets with longer range, including those made by Bombardier Inc and Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp. The higher cost of the bigger jets will keep overall spending moving higher even as actual number of jets sold is expected to be down about 1 percent compared with last year because of problems in the supply chain that hampered manufacturing, Honeywell said. The survey forecast up to 9,250 new business jets will be delivered through 2023, worth more than $250 billion. The number of jets expected to be purchased in Asia in the next five years fell in the latest survey from a year ago. Also, the Asian share of global demand over the next five years should drop to 5 percent from 7 percent, according to the survey, which tallies purchase expectations from more than 1,500 business jet operators around the world. Asian buyers are expected to buy jets equivalent to 24 percent of their fleet in the next five years, down from an expected 34 percent in last year’s survey. “Purchase expectation in China held strong,” said Rob Wilson, president of Honeywell’s business and general aviation division. “It was the Asia component around China that dropped,” including relatively slow growth in India. The share of global demand in Latin America held steady at 18 percent the survey said, showing continued economic strength. Jet buyers are expected to replace or add to the equivalent of 39 percent of their fleets over the next five years, also unchanged. However most of those purchase were expected in the next three years, in part because of older fleets in the region, especially in Brazil. The share of global jet purchases in North America jumped to 61 percent in the latest survey from 53 percent a year ago, partly because of economic recovery and also reflecting weakness in Asia and Europe. The fleet turnover expectation rose to 28 percent over five years, compared with 25 percent previously. Europe’s share of global demand fell to 12 percent from 18 percent, the survey found, reflecting a “fairly long period of weak growth,” Wilson said. “That may improve.” European purchase expectations declined to 25 percent, well below the 30 to 33 percent figure reported in the past three years. The European responses to the latest survey may be skewed, Wilson noted, because there were only minimal survey response from operators in Russia, which is typically a strong market.",10212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/aviation-businessjets/business-jet-sales-to-top-18-bln-as-buyers-seek-bigger-planes-idUSL1N0IB11P20131021
190,HON,Germany paves way for EU to rule on Honeywell car refrigerant,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s final report on risks posed by a new car coolant made by Honeywell (HON.N) has been issued to the European Commission, clearing the way for a decision on whether Berlin had sufficient cause to allow Daimler (DAIGn.DE) to ban it and flout EU law. Daimler banned from its luxury cars the air-conditioning refrigerant made by Honeywell and its partner DuPont DD.N which has a far lower potential to warm the climate than an older chemical still used by Daimler’s Mercedes brand despite an EU-wide phase out that began in January. The EU’s scientific research arm JRC is expected to analyze the report by the German federal motor transport authority KBA in the next few weeks and advise whether the coolant is indeed flammable enough to cause material risks, as Daimler says. The new Honeywell chemical, dubbed HFO-1234yf, is designed to fulfill an EU directive, which governs the use of harmful greenhouse gases in mobile A/C, or MAC, systems in cars. “The ball is now in Brussels’ court,” a spokesman for Germany’s transport ministry said on Wednesday. The Commission was not available for comment, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed that it had received a copy of the KBA’s report, which it was now examining. At stake is not just a potentially embarrassing infringement process against Berlin for allowing Daimler to disregard the EU’s so-called “MAC Directive”, but - should it be deemed hazardous - the possible loss of billions of dollars in future revenue for Honeywell and Dupont, who have secured an effective monopoly on its supply until 2030. In mid-October, DuPont’s President of Chemicals and Fluoroproducts, Thierry Vanlancker, called on German authorities to conclude their investigation into the safety of HFO-1234yf quickly, because the EU was still waiting on the final report by the KBA before making a decision. The KBA said in early August the refrigerant posed no material risk to occupants even if it is more dangerous than the older alternative HFC-134a that is being phased out to meet the MAC directive. Honeywell said in a statement that the “overdue” final report showed HFO-1234yf could be used safely in cars but served also as a reminder that a single carmaker delayed compliance with the MAC Directive for far too long. Daimler, which is developing an A/C system that uses carbon dioxide as a refrigerant, said on Wednesday the report confirmed the greater dangers the carmaker cited versus HFC-134a.

193,HON,Honeywell CEO urges sharply lower U.S. corporate tax rate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate tax rate should be lowered to encourage competitiveness with rivals around the globe, the chief executive of conglomerate Honeywell (HON.N) said on Thursday, days after a U.S. senator proposed sweeping changes to the tax code. David Cote, CEO of New Jersey-based Honeywell since 2002, said it is in the best interest of the United States to have a tax policy that allows its companies to better compete in emerging economies that are projected to grow more quickly than developed peers. “We need to have a globally competitive tax system for our companies,” Cote said in an interview. “If you put U.S. companies at a disadvantage when they’re competing in emerging economies, we’re making a huge mistake.” Honeywell, which makes products ranging from thermostats and break pads to aerospace and medical components, derived more than half its $37.66 billion in revenue last year from outside the United States. Cote said he intends to bring the same attention to the tax debate as he does to the “Fix the Debt” campaign, in which CEOs spent most of last year lobbying President Barack Obama and Republican lawmakers to reach a deal to reduce the national debt. The current U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent is too high and should be lowered to help his and other companies compete, Cote said. “Feel free to tax distribution, when I get paid, when my people get paid, when shareholders get paid,” Cote said. “But don’t tax the companies that are in the middle of trying to compete with new and growing firms.” Democratic Sen. Max Baucus on Tuesday issued a “discussion draft” - effectively a memo, not proposed legislation - that he hopes will motivate U.S. multinationals to bring home billions of dollars in profits stored offshore at a low 20 percent tax rate. The plan would also make taxation on some, but not all, foreign profits compulsory. Cote said he “loves the fact” that Baucus has opened the tax reform debate. But he added that he would have a “tough time” supporting parts of the proposal that could boost overseas corporate taxes. The issue could prompt a “schism” among domestic-focused U.S. companies and multinationals, he said. Companies that operate primarily in the United States have been inclined to favor high corporate tax rates on overseas earnings to lower their own tax bills. For instance, industrial gas supplier Airgas Inc ARG.N, which operates through the contiguous United States, has said it prefers the business community advocate for lower U.S. domestic rates before lower overseas rates. Cote is set to be awarded membership in the Horatio Alger Association next year for his philanthropic and educational work. He started his working career washing windows and cleaning bathrooms at his father’s gas station at the age of 12, tasks that, while menial, cultivated a spirit of hard work and customer service that stick today, Cote said. “Our customers could go anywhere they wanted to buy gas. At the end of the day, if we did the job right, they came back,” he said. Cote’s rise to become one of the world’s most-influential CEOs mirrors, in some ways, a Horatio Alger novel, a fact the association mentioned when it chose him. Cote said that with his award, he and Honeywell intend to sponsor scholarships and Honeywell internships for disadvantaged youths. The amount of scholarships and the number of internships have not yet been determined. “When you look at the caliber of these kids that are coming up and the drive they’ve had to exhibit in order to get through what they’ve been through, those are the kind of people you want to be supporting in our society,” Cote said.

195,HON,Honeywell 2014 sales forecast falls short of estimates,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), a maker of cockpit electronics and climate-control systems, forecast slightly lower 2014 sales than analysts had expected, citing a sluggish recovery in the global economy. Honeywell’s shares fell marginally in early trading after the company said it expected economic conditions next year to be similar to 2013 — a year in which U.S. government cost cutting hit sales. Global economic growth of slightly less than 1 percent expected next year was “not as robust as we would like,” Chief Financial Officer David Anderson said on a conference call with analysts. New Jersey-based Honeywell, which makes products ranging from thermostats and brake pads to aerospace and medical components, derived more than half its $37.66 billion in revenue last year from outside the United States. Chief Executive David Cote has been an advocate of a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate as a way to make the country more competitive in emerging markets. Honeywell on Tuesday forecast 2014 sales of $40.3 billion to $40.7 billion. Analysts on average had expected $41.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Although the forecast missed estimates, Honeywell was generally upbeat about the year ahead. Sales, profit margins, earnings per share and free cash flow are expected to increase in 2014, Cote said in a statement. “We consider Honeywell guidance to generally be conservative,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard wrote in a note to clients. The company forecast earnings of $5.35 to $5.55 per share for 2014. The upper end of the range matches the average analyst estimate. Honeywell maintained its 2013 sales estimate of $38.8 billion-$39 billion, a forecast that it cut in October, citing the delayed closure of its $600 million purchase of mobile computing device maker Intermec. U.S. government cost cutting and supply chain problems at Honeywell’s defense and space business, which supplies equipment to the U.S. military and government, have also hit sales this year. The supply problems had largely been fixed, Honeywell said in October. Sales in Honeywell’s aerospace business, which accounts for about a third of the conglomerate’s total revenue and includes the defense and space business, would be flat to up 2 percent in 2014, Anderson said. Honeywell said it would focus on cost cutting to drive margin growth. The company expects to make about $125 million in savings in 2014 as a result of a long-running restructuring program that has helped to rebuild the company over the last decade. Honeywell's shares were down 0.4 percent at $87.06 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 40 percent in the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P; 500 index .SPX, which is up 25 percent.

196,HON,"UPDATE 2-3M sets year's biggest U.S. buyback plan, raises dividend","(Adds details, background; updates shares) By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Mridhula Raghavan Dec 17 (Reuters) - 3M Co, whose products range from Post-It notes to films used in flat-panel TVs, said it could buy back up to $22 billion of shares in the five years through 2017, joining a list of companies announcing big capital returns to shareholders. 3M’s repurchase plan brings the total buyback authorizations  announced by U.S. companies this year to about $460 billion, the highest since 2007 and the onset of the global financial crisis. The company’s shares rose as much as 3 percent after it also raised its quarterly dividend by a third and said it would spend between $5 billion and $10 billion on acquisitions through 2017. Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said the dividend increase signaled confidence, while the acquisition plans represented “a major shift in tone from this historically conservative team.” 3M said on Tuesday it expected its 2013-2017 share repurchases to be in the range of $17 billion to $22 billion, up from its previous estimate of $7.5 billion to $15 billion. The top end of the new range represents about 25 percent of 3M’s market value - making its plan the largest possible capital return in percentage terms among U.S. companies that have announced buybacks this year. Other companies announcing big buybacks this year include Microsoft Corp, Boeing Co and Deere & Co . Companies typically buy back shares to increase the value of the stock remaining. However, share prices of many companies, including 3M, are at or near record highs. “At this point in time, there does appear to be excess cash (and) corporations do not want to sit on such a large asset, especially considering the low return that their market instruments are making,” S&P; Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt told Reuters. 3M did not say how it would fund the buyback. It had cash and equivalents of about $2.3 billion as of Sept. 30. JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa noted that 3M’s repurchase plan translated to only about $4 billion per year. 3M said in July it expected 2013 share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The company said on Tuesday it would raise its quarterly dividend to 88.5 cents from 63.5 cents, which works out to an additional payout of $585 million if maintained for a year. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M forecast 2014 organic sales to rise by 3-6 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. Analysts on average were expecting the company to report 2013 revenue of $31.01 billion. 3M said it expected earnings of between $7.30 and $7.55 per share next year. Analysts on average expected $7.40 per share on revenue of $32.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 3M shares were up 2.4 percent at $130.71 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock, which hit an all-time high of $134.15 in November, has risen by more than a third this year.

199,HON,"Exclusive: U.S. investigating Honeywell over export, import controls","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating export and import procedures at Honeywell International Inc after the firm included Chinese parts in equipment it built for the F-35 fighter jet, three sources familiar with the matter said. Reuters last week reported that the Pentagon twice waived laws banning Chinese-built components in U.S. weapons in 2012 and 2013 for parts supplied by Honeywell for the $392 billion Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 program. New details have now emerged about one of those waivers, which involved simple thermal sensors that Honeywell initially produced in Scotland before moving that production line to China in 2009 and 2010. The other waivers involved high-performance magnets built in China and elsewhere. Federal agents from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, a law enforcement arm of the Pentagon, are working with prosecutors on the case, a person briefed on the matter said. The DCIS and the Pentagon declined to comment. The precise nature of the investigation could not be confirmed. Typically, however, DCIS export investigations focus on whether a company violated the Arms Control Export Act by sending overseas products or technical specifications for items on the U.S. Munitions List without first obtaining a U.S. government license. The sensors and F-35 specifications in this case may be subject to the U.S. Munitions List. In terms of import violations, DCIS often investigates whether companies have engaged in fraud by misleading the Pentagon as to the origin of foreign parts. The case throws a spotlight on the reliance of American companies, even in sensitive areas, on China as a manufacturing base for basic components. In the past 20 years, much production has been shifted out of the United States to lower cost areas, particularly China. The sensors are part of the power thermal management system that Honeywell builds to cool the F-35, start its engines and pressurize the cabin, said Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon’s F-35 program office. Honeywell spokesman Scott Sayres said the company decided in late 2012 - after consulting with Lockheed and the Pentagon - to move production of the sensors used on the F-35 from China to a plant in Boyne City, Michigan. It funded the move at its own cost, he said. Honeywell made the move after the origin of the sensors was discovered during a comprehensive review of the supply chain for the F-35, the newest U.S. warplane. That was carried out by Lockheed after another key supplier, Northrop Grumman Corp, discovered it had used non-compliant magnets made in Japan in building the jet’s advanced radar system. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall also issued a waiver for those parts. Sayres said the sensors were part of a basic circuit card used in products sold commercially around the world. “We firmly believe Honeywell has complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations relating to the manufacture of the component in China,” Sayres said. Officials at the Justice Department and Pentagon declined to comment on the reported Honeywell investigation. One of the three sources familiar with the probe, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said it was focused on Honeywell’s processes and procedures, rather than the components involved. They were seen as low risk items that did not pose any security risk for the F-35 program. The sources also cautioned such investigations can take months or years to complete, and said no determinations had yet been made about Honeywell’s actions. Honeywell’s Sayres declined to comment on the Justice Department probe, telling Reuters: “As a general practice, we do not comment on the existence or nature of any active government investigations.” Honeywell decided to move the sensor production to China to save money, and simplify its supply line, he said. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, is also looking into the sensor issue and two others involving the F-35, as part of a report due March 1. U.S. lawmakers ordered the GAO report because they are concerned American firms are being shut out of the specialty metals market, and that U.S. weapons could become dependent on parts made by a potential future adversary. Pentagon spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said the Pentagon’s Kendall had granted national security waivers to allow foreign-built parts on other aircraft in the past, but had no immediate details about those cases. DellaVedova, the spokesman for the F-35 program office, said the thermal sensors were simple parts that did not include any software and were not programmable. He said there was no security risk associated with use of the sensors. He said all the Chinese-built sensors would eventually be replaced on the F-35s, but the process had not yet been completed. He had no immediate information on how many Chinese-built sensors were installed on the planes. “This will all be taken care of,” DellaVedova said.

200,HON,Honeywell profit beats estimates as sales rise 8 percent,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and revenue on Friday, as sales grew across its major segments. The diversified U.S. manufacturer of aerospace parts and climate control systems backed its 2014 financial targets, set last month, but forecast first-quarter earnings below Wall Street’s estimates. “While we think it’s prudent to remain cautious on the global economy at this time, we’re increasingly confident in our 2014 outlook based on the momentum from the fourth quarter,” Honeywell Chief Executive Dave Cote said in a statement. Honeywell shares rose 1 percent to $90.70 in pre-market trading. Edward Jones analyst Christian Mayes characterized the results as a “pretty good quarter,” and said investors would likely now focus on the company’s investor day in March, when Honeywell is expected to reveal five-year financial targets. “That’s where the focus where the stock is going to go,” said Mayes, who rates the shares a “buy.” “People will probably be excited about the numbers that will be revealed, given their history of doing so well and meeting the last targets.” Honeywell’s fourth-quarter net income rose to $947 million, or $1.19 per share. That is up considerably from $251 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company recorded a large pension expense. Excluding one-time items, Honeywell’s earnings of $1.24 per share beat the average estimate of analysts by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 8 percent to $10.39 billion, nearly $200 million ahead of estimates. In its two largest segments, aerospace and automation and control solutions, profit rose 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Earnings increased 30 percent in its smaller performance materials and technologies segment, whose products include chemicals used in oil and gas production. Analysts were also impressed with the performance of the company’s relatively small transportation systems business, which makes turbochargers and where profit soared 41 percent. Honeywell said earlier this month it was selling its friction materials business, which makes brake pads, to Federal Mogul Corp FDML.O for about $155 million. Edward Jones’ Mayes said transportation systems could have higher profit margins after the sale of the friction materials business. Honeywell confirmed its 2014 financial targets, which include 8 percent to 10 percent growth in earnings per share and a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in sales. However, the company forecast first-quarter earnings in a range of $1.23 to $1.27 per share, below Wall Street’s expectation of $1.29.

204,HON,"Honeywell targets over $50 billion sales by 2018, M&A; ramp-up","(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) on Wednesday set a target of increasing overall company sales to more than $50 billion by 2018 as it seeks to spend $10 billion on acquisitions and continue to expand profit margins. Honeywell, a U.S. diversified manufacturer of aerospace parts and climate control and security systems, also said it expects earnings to grow at a double-digit pace in percentage terms over the next five years. Honeywell, which reported $39.1 billion in sales in 2013, unveiled the new five-year targets as it hosted an investor conference in New York. Shares of Honeywell, which also backed its first-quarter and 2014 forecasts, rose about 1 percent. “They laid out a very aggressive plan,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. “They’re going to make this a bigger company, and they were very optimistic about the long-term growth.” Analysts have been eager to see Honeywell’s latest five-year targets after praising the company for reaching its goals with the most recent plan. Since the company issued five-year targets in February 2010, its shares have outperformed those of conglomerate rivals such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and the broader market. “Most investors would consider Honeywell a winner out of the last five years or so,” Morningstar analyst Daniel Holland said. “The company operationally looks a lot better than it did.” Speaking at the investor conference, Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote said Honeywell’s businesses aligned well with global trends such as increasing demand for energy efficiency and growing urbanization. Honeywell expects high-growth regions such as China to drive about half its sales growth over the next five years. “We have a real diversity of opportunity...so that we can grow almost in any environment,” Cote told the conference. Honeywell said it wanted to spend $10 billion on acquisitions that would add about $5 billion to $8 billion in sales over the next five years. Brian Langenberg, an analyst with Langenberg & Co, noted the $10 billion target for acquisitions was significantly larger than the roughly $4 billion spent in the previous five years. “That’s a big number,” Langenberg said. “It does stand out as being a meaningful statement about M&A; activity.” Cote said Honeywell would be “careful” with its deal selection, laying out criteria for deals such as a level of cost savings. “That being said, I think there’s a lot of possibilities out there for us,” he said. Excluding deals, Honeywell still expects sales to increase by $7 billion to $12 billion by 2018, an increase of 4 percent to 6 percent a year on average. “We expect the market to favorably receive Honeywell’s message of continued double-digit EPS growth on mid single-digit organic revenue growth,” analysts at William Blair said in a research note. The company sees profit margins for its business segments increasing to between 18.5 percent to 20 percent over that time, up from 16.3 percent last year. Honeywell expects to generate roughly $30 billion to $33 billion in cash flow from operations through 2018, about half of which it will return to shareholders through dividends and buying back shares. It expects to invest about $5 billion in capital expenditures, such as increasing production capacity to support its performance materials and technologies business, products which include chemicals used in oil and gas production. Honeywell shares rose nearly 1 percent to $95.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The management shuffle comes after Honeywell unveiled ambitious five-year financial targets last month including boosting company sales to more than $50 billion by 2018, from $39.1 billion last year, as it targets $10 billion in acquisitions. The executives stepping into the newly created positions of vice chairman — Roger Fradin and Andreas Kramvis — will each take responsibility for aspects of the five-year plan laid out by Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. Fradin, 60, has been leading the company’s automation and control solutions business that includes climate control and security products. His responsibilities will include Honeywell’s acquisition strategy. Kramvis, 61, has been running the performance materials and technologies segment that include chemicals used in oil and gas production. His tasks include deploying a program that drives internal efficiency, as Honeywell seeks to improve profit margins for its business segments to between 18.5 percent to 20 percent by 2018, up from 16.3 percent last year. A company spokesman said the management changes were not about succession planning for Cote, who is 61. Tom Szlosek, 50, previously vice president of corporate finance, was named CFO, replacing well-respected finance chief Dave Anderson, 64, who is retiring after 10 years in the post.

210,HON,Turbocharger sales help Honeywell profit zoom past forecasts,"(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by strong sales of turbochargers to help automobiles meet fuel-efficiency standards. The company, which also makes airplane cockpit parts, chemicals for the energy industry and scores of other electronics and equipment, said it is “cautiously optimistic” on the health of the global economy and that it still expects profit to rise at least 9 percent this year. “We are in a better spot than we were in a year ago in terms of growth,” Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said in an interview. “But I don’t think we’re experiencing any kind of meaningful positive trends.” One of the company’s brightest spots during the quarter was its Transportation Systems unit, which saw profit jump 39 percent, helped largely by demand for turbochargers, devices that boost an engine’s torque. New fuel-efficiency regulations across Europe, China and the United States have boosted demand for Honeywell’s turbochargers, as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and other major automakers aim to get more power out of engines with less fuel. “You’re seeing more legislation and regulation, and also more demand for efficiency,” Szlosek said. “That bodes well for our turbo business.” While the unit is Honeywell’s smallest, executives see it as one of the fastest-growing. Indeed, in a revised forecast announced on Thursday, Honeywell cut its 2014 margin outlook for its three other units, but raised the margin outlook for the Transportation Systems unit. The company’s Performance Materials and Technologies unit, which makes chemicals used in the oil and other sectors, has a 3 percent drop in profit during the quarter as some products came off patent. Despite the dip, Szlosek expressed confidence that the unit’s profit should trend higher as new products launch this year. The company posted first-quarter net income of $1.02 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared with $966 million, or $1.23 per share, in the year-ago quarter. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 4 percent to $9.68 billion, missing the $9.74 billion estimate from Wall Street. Honeywell last month set a target to boost annual sales to more than $50 billion by 2018 and to spend $10 billion on acquisitions. Honeywell posted $39.1 billion in sales last year. The New Jersey-based company expects high-growth regions such as China to drive about half its sales growth over the next five years, with profit margins for its business segments increasing to between 18.5 percent to 20 percent over that time, up from 16.5 percent for the first quarter. The $10 billion in acquisitions targeted by the company is more than twice as much as Honeywell spent on deals in the previous five years. Honeywell and other industrial conglomerates are eager to bolster their operations through deals but may hesitate due to high valuations of targets. Also on Thursday, Honeywell lifted the bottom end of its 2014 earnings forecast. The company now expects to earn $5.40 to $5.55 per share this year, where previously the bottom end of that range had been $5.35 per share.

Gogo Inc currently provides an air-to-ground technology that is available on about 80 percent of wired commercial aircraft in the U.S. Honeywell said the AT&T; system would have greater speed and bandwidth than do existing systems and would begin operating in 2015 in the United States.

222,HON,Honeywell to merge turbocharger business into aerospace unit,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) will merge its transportation systems unit into its aerospace division to take advantage of similarities between the businesses, the diversified U.S. manufacturer said on Monday. The transportation business, which makes turbochargers, has been Honeywell’s smallest of its four segments by sales but has seen fast growth, with profit rising 15 percent last year. Following the realignment, Honeywell will have three business segments: aerospace; automation and control solutions; and performance materials and technologies. “Born out of our aerospace business, the automotive turbocharger is a miniature jet engine,” Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote said in a statement, adding that the realignment would “leverage shared strengths and synergies.” Honeywell will report its financial results, including transportation systems within aerospace effective with its third-quarter report. Honeywell is due to report second-quarter results on Friday. The company announced the realignment as it said it completed the $155 million sale of its friction materials business to Federal Mogul Corp FDML.O.

228,HON,Web-connected cabins offer flight path for aerospace investors,"* Market seen swelling to $2.1 bln by 2023 -Euroconsult * Good for suppliers like Cobham, Thales - analysts * Not all airlines agree wireless is best choice * U.S. players include Gogo, Honeywell, Golden Eagle By Lionel Laurent LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The web-connected aircraft cabins of the future, powered by technology on show at last week’s Farnborough Airshow, are offering a path to investor returns through suppliers like Cobham Plc and Thales SA . The market for inflight wireless internet, entertainment and communications services, driven by a flying public who increasingly want to chat, tweet, stream movies and check Facebook uninterrupted, is set to grow to $2.1 billion by 2023 from $440 million in 2013, consultancy Euroconsult says. While the past is dotted with inflight internet schemes which failed to take off, such as Boeing Co’s Connexion, there are more reasons to be bullish as installation costs have come down and the use of social media has skyrocketed. “It’s gone from the days when you were completely cut off in an aeroplane, to where very shortly every carrier will be offering real-time television,” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Agency Partners. “You’re talking about an installed base of literally tens of thousands of aircraft, starting with wide-bodies and working your way down ... It’s going to be a must-have.” Analysts say this is good for parts makers such as UK-based Cobham, which makes compact, lightweight satellite-communication systems for both small and large planes. Cobham, named after its aviator founder who pioneered mid-air refueling in the 1930s and 40s, showed off its antenna technology at Farnborough. Other key players include France’s Thales, Europe’s largest defence electronics firm and one of the leading providers of in-flight entertainment and streaming systems, competing with the Avionics arm of Japan’s Panasonic Corp. Thales bought LiveTV - a provider of in-flight entertainment and broadband services - from JetBlue Airways Corp  earlier this year. Florida-based LiveTV has more than 500 employees and expects 2014 revenue of over $150 million. Such investments underscore the reasons for investors to be optimistic on take-up of the technology in the still-booming commercial aviation market: installation costs are falling, systems are becoming lighter and satellite coverage is becoming available to most areas where air traffic is dense, according to Euroconsult. The downsides? There is no consensus yet on how to charge for such services, onboard satellite communications equipment is still costly and the certification process is relatively long. Not all airlines agree wireless technology is the right service to offer passengers. Its main competitor comes from the in-flight entertainment industry, whose movie and game systems are hard-wired into aircraft seatbacks. At a global travel fair in March, Lufthansa  announced plans to wirelessly stream movies on long flights, but Qatar Airways called the technology untested and said it would stick to traditional seatback screens. The stakes are high for airlines because in-flight entertainment is increasingly seen as a lucrative shopping platform as well as a place to watch games and films. Meanwhile, broader aviation trends are strong, with Boeing and Airbus Group NV betting the world will need some 30,000 to 36,000 new aircraft over the next 20 years. It is tough to pick out cheap aerospace stocks as a result, with the STOXX Europe 600 aerospace and defence index  up some 95 percent from 2011 lows, compared with a rise of about 50 percent for the broad Euro STOXX 50 index. Thales - about 30 percent of whose sales come from civil aerospace including cockpit systems - trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.98, while Cobham, which gets 19 percent of its revenue from the commercial aeronautics sector, is trading at 13.87, according to Thomson Reuters data.

229,HON,Honeywell lockout of union at Illinois uranium plant nearing one month,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - A lockout of about 135 union employees at a Honeywell International Inc uranium conversion plant in Illinois is poised to extend past a month as the two sides remain apart on several issues. Production and maintenance employees at the Metropolis, Illinois, plant who are members of United Steelworkers Local 7-669 have been locked out since the start of August, after a three-year contract expired. Talks are not expected to resume this week while the company reviews the union’s latest proposal, said union spokesman John Paul Smith. “When it comes down to it, we are no closer to an agreement than we were on Aug. 1,” Smith said. Honeywell said it is committed to bargaining in good faith, but is also concerned about the plant’s long-term competitiveness. The plant accrued $300 million in operating losses over the past 10 years and is “just now starting to break even,” a company spokesman said. The diverse manufacturer, whose products also include climate control systems and aviation components, posted $39.1 billion in revenue last year. “The company believes that with the right investments and the right labor contract, the plant will become and remain profitable,” spokesman Peter Dalpe said in an emailed statement. Honeywell’s Metropolis plant is the only U.S. facility that converts uranium oxide into to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants. Honeywell has continued to operate the plant after the lockout, with the remaining roughly 135 plant employees who are non-union, as well as with contingent workers. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken more precautions since the lockout began, including continuously staffing the plant during the first 72 hours and increasing safety inspections to once a week from the typical schedule of about once a month. No “significant issues” have been found, but the NRC will continue the stepped-up inspection schedule until the work stoppage is resolved or the agency is satisfied the plant can operate long-term without any issues, said NRC spokesman Roger Hannah. “We’re satisfied they have the appropriate training, but we want to make sure those people can perform those functions for an extended period of time without any issues,” Hannah said. Honeywell also locked out workers for 14 months between 2010 and 2011 during a contract dispute. Since then, the number of union workers has dropped from 228 to its current level. The two sides remain apart on use of subcontractors, pay, healthcare benefits and work rules including grievance procedures, Smith said. Honeywell also closed the plant for a year starting in mid-2012 to make more than $40 million worth of safety upgrades required by the NRC in the wake of the disaster at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant. Some employees were let go during that time, but Honeywell spokesman Dalpe said the investment preserved jobs “that would have been lost otherwise.”   (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Alwyn Scott and Lisa Shumaker)",8252014,http://www.reuters.com/article/honeywell-intl-workers/honeywell-lockout-of-union-at-illinois-uranium-plant-nearing-one-month-idUSL1N0QV13H20140825

234,HON,"UPDATE 1-U.S. orders airlines to replace cockpit displays on 1,300 Boeing airplanes","(Adds Boeing, Honeywell comment) Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is requiring airlines to replace cockpit displays on more than 1,300 Boeing Co airplanes to avoid interference from Wi-Fi and cellular devices. Airlines will need to replace certain cockpit display units made by Honeywell International Inc used on Boeing's 737 and 777 jets within five years, according to an FAA document. (bit.ly/1qTpOYb) The FAA said the display units were susceptible to interference from Wi-Fi frequencies. Independent tests conducted by the agency and Boeing both showed blanking on the screens when Wi-Fi devices were used near them. The displays are also susceptible to transmissions from mobile phones, weather radar and mobile satellite communications, the FAA said. Honeywell spokesman Steve Brecken said no display units had blanked in-flight due to Wi-Fi interference. “The only know occurrence was during a developmental test conducted on the ground. We worked with Boeing and addressed any concerns in 2012 with new display hardware,” he said. The display units provide crucial flight information including airspeed, altitude and navigation information, and cost thousands of dollars each. Replacing all the units is expected to cost airlines nearly $14 million, according to the FAA document. “Boeing made these recommendations to operators in November 2012. The FAA’s directives make them mandatory,” Boeing spokesman Miles Kotay said. A number of airlines and Honeywell asked the FAA to delay or reduce the effects of the directive, but the regulator said the move was necessary to avoid loss of information during take-offs or landings, which could result in “loss of airplane control at an altitude insufficient for recovery.”   (Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer and Supriya Kurane in Bangalore; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Stephen Coates)",10012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-faa/update-1-u-s-orders-airlines-to-replace-cockpit-displays-on-1300-boeing-airplanes-idUSL2N0RW06I20141001

The S&P; 500’s streak of weekly losses was its longest since August 2011, and the index still is off 6.2 percent from its Sept. 18 record high. The drop follows worries over the health of the global economy, the spread of the Ebola virus, as well as factors including lower oil prices and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s next steps. However, the broad index this week steered clear of correction territory, a 10-percent drop from its high. Friday’s earnings offset some of the concerns about the impact of weak global demand on U.S. corporations. Honeywell  shares gained 4.3 percent to $90.06 after results.  General Electric shares rose 2.4 percent to $24.82 on its earnings. The S&P; 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since Oct. 8 and some investors said the recent selloff may have run its course. “This should be it. The market should do well once we get by some of these geopolitical risks that are on top of us right now, the Ebola thing and the mid-cycle elections,” said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston, which oversees more than $11.3 billion. “I would think the market is going to be strong into the close this year.” Small caps closed lower. The Russell 2000 index was down 0.4 percent after a three-day streak of more than 1 percent gains, its best since July 2012. The index gained 2.8 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 263.17 points, or 1.63 percent, to 16,380.41, the S&P; 500 gained 24 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,886.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 41.05 points, or 0.97 percent, to 4,258.44. For the week, the Dow and S&P; were down 1 percent while the Nasdaq was down 0.4 percent. Housing shares were among the day’s best performers after a Wall Street Journal report said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are close to an agreement that could boost mortgage lending. Shares of D.R. Horton rose 6.2 percent to $21.56, while shares of Toll Brothers gained 2.5 percent to $31.23. Also lifting the sector were increases in U.S. September housing starts and permits. The S&P; energy index was up 0.9 percent, helped by shares of Schlumberger, up 3.7 percent to $93.97. The world’s largest oilfield services company’s third-quarter profit beat estimates. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Mead Johnson Nutrition, up 9.9 percent to $100.23, after sources told Reuters that French food giant Danone has decided to pursue a takeover. The largest percentage was Urban Outfitters, down 14.3 percent at $29.62, after it warned on its sales.

237,HON,"Aviation suppliers feast on industry backlogs, air travel growth","(Reuters) - A commercial jet manufacturing boom is fueling suppliers’ profits, with U.S. corporate results on Friday underscoring strong demand from the aviation industry in a rocky global economy. The latest earnings may steady investor confidence in manufacturers exposed to the sector, offsetting concern about other markets such as energy as well as general worry about stagnating growth outside the United States. On Friday, General Electric Co (GE.N) reported a 16 percent profit rise for its aviation unit and a bulging order book of jet engines. Honeywell International’s (HON.N) aerospace revenue beat some analysts’ forecasts, while the division’s profit margins improved.  Shares of Cessna maker Textron Inc (TXT.N) soared more than 9 percent after it raised its full-year profit forecast.  “The aerospace segment is the place to be in industrial,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital, which holds Honeywell and GE shares. “If you’re in the right industries ... you’re going to be sort of protected from whatever macro pain is coming from Europe or even China.” Friday’s results could bode well for other diverse manufacturers with aerospace businesses, such as Parker Hannifin (PH.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N), said John Heslin, vice president at Tradition Capital Management, who follows industrial companies. “While growth will be up and down for the economy, we think a more stable end (market) will be aerospace, which has legs,” Heslin said. Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA) forecast demand for air travel will increase about 5 percent a year over the next two decades, in line with historic trends.  Fuel efficient jets being developed have brought the big plane makers an avalanche of orders, boosting their backlogs to more than $700 billion combined, or about eight years worth of production.  The demand is cascading down the supply chain to companies like Honeywell and GE that build key components such as avionics and engines. Boeing and Airbus now buy about two-thirds of the planes’ content from suppliers rather than building it themselves.  “The data on aerospace remains strong,” said Scott Lawson, vice president of Westwood Holdings Group. “It’s one of the segments best positioned for a modest dip in the economy, or for growth if there is no dip.” Equipment orders jumped 35 percent at GE’s aviation division to $6.8 billion in the third quarter. The conglomerate’s GE9X engine for Boeing’s new 777X airplane helped drive the order book, GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said. “We’re enjoying a lot of the cyclical upturn that has happened in aerospace,” Bornstein said in an interview. Honeywell and GE also posted “very strong” demand for spare parts, said Sterne Agee analyst Peter Arment. Such “aftermarket” revenue is generally more lucrative than sales of original equipment. “It just shows you that global utilization rates for aircraft remain very healthy,” Arment said.

It also raised the low end of its full-year forecast range for both profit and revenue, and said it is looking for acquisitions after having bulked up its ability to evaluate and fund deals of various sizes. “The pipelines of potential deals are as strong as they’ve ever been. It’s just a matter of time and the stars lining up,” Tom Szlosek, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Honeywell, said in an interview.

Despite Friday’s gain, the S&P; index was still on track for its fourth straight weekly decline, its longest streak in more than three years, and is down nearly 6 percent from its record high following recent worries over the health of the global economy and spread of the Ebola virus. Among the day’s biggest positive influences, General Electric shares rose 2.7 percent to $24.91 after the company third-quarter earnings topped analyst expectations, pushing the S&P; industrial sector up 1.8 percent. Honeywell shares gained 4.3 percent to $90.07 after its quarterly results, to help send the S&P; industrials sector  up 2.3 percent as the best performing S&P; sector. Housing shares were among the day’s best performers after a Wall Street Journal report that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are close to an agreement that could boost mortgage lending. Shares of D.R. Horton rose 5.7 percent to $21.46, while shares of Toll Brothers gained 2.7 percent to $31.29. Also lifting the housing sector was data showing U.S. housing starts and permits rose in September. “We have managed to avoid a technical correction of ten percent, though we got very close, and now the market is going to look to build a positive narrative for asset allocation into equities that is predicated upon relatively cheap valuations,” said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. The S&P; energy index was up 0.2 percent, off its highs. Schlumberger rose 2.8 percent to $93.18 after the world’s largest oilfield services company’s third-quarter profit beat estimates. At 2:05 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 216.8 points, or 1.35 percent, to 16,334.04, the S&P; 500  gained 19.11 points, or 1.03 percent, to 1,881.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 35.26 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,252.65. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Textron , which rose 9.8 percent, after the company raised its profit forecast, while the largest percentage decliner was Urban Outfitters, down 14.6 percent, which warned on its sales. Advancing issues were outnumbering declining ones on the NYSE by 2,063 to 964, for a 2.14-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,483 issues were rising and 1,160 falling for a 1.28-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. S&P; 500 earnings growth now is estimated at 6.9 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data through Friday, while revenue growth is seen at 3.8 percent.

245,HON,"UPDATE 1-EU says Honeywell, DuPont car refrigerant deal may be illegal","(Adds Honeywell and Dupont’s comments) By Foo Yun Chee and Barbara Lewis BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. firm Honeywell International Inc’s joint venture with chemicals company DuPont to produce a new refrigerant for car air conditioning systems to meet new environmental rules may be anti-competitive, the European Commission said on Tuesday, following a near-three year probe. The Commission said the agreements between the two companies related to the new coolant, known as R1234yf, may have blocked rivals keen to participate in its development and production. The coolant, which is designed to meet an EU directive aimed at reducing the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases in car air conditioning systems, has pitted EU regulators against Germany and its powerful car makers led by Daimler. Last month the Commission ordered Germany to stop its carmakers using a banned refrigerant with a higher “global warming potential” than the Honeywell-Dupont product within two months or face court action and possible fines. The new R1234yf coolant is already used in about 2 million cars globally. When Honeywell and Dupont announced a joint venture to construct and operate a global manufacturing plant for the new refrigerant they said they had developed the product jointly but would market and sell it separately. “The cooperation they entered into in 2010 ... may have limited its (the R1234yf refrigerant’s) availability and technical development, in breach of EU antitrust rules,” the Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. It sent a so-called statement of objections or charge sheet setting out its concerns to the companies. Honeywell rejected the charges, saying it had complied with EU rules. “The allegations outlined in the statement of objections are baseless and conflict with the EU’s own laws that encourage collaboration on development,” the company said in a statement. DuPont said it was disappointed with the Commission’s move  and that it would defend its case vigorously. The firms can ask for a closed-door hearing to argue their case. If found guilty, they could face fines of up to 10 percent of their global turnover.

247,HON,U.S. agency sues Honeywell over employee wellness testing,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued Honeywell International Inc to stop the company from imposing penalties on employees who refuse to undergo testing under its corporate wellness program. The lawsuit is the third case since August filed by the federal agency challenging a corporate wellness program, with Honeywell the biggest company to be targeted. Wellness programs that encourage healthier habits have become increasingly popular in Corporate America, as they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs. Such programs are also encouraged under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Honeywell employees could be penalized up to $4,000 each, through surcharges and lost contributions to health plans, if they or their spouses do not comply with the biometric testing, according to the lawsuit, filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in Minnesota. According to the lawsuit, employees and spouses are screened for blood pressure, cholesterol, blood-sugar levels, waist circumference and nicotine. Honeywell had informed employees that testing was to occur from Oct 22-31, the lawsuit said. The testing program violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, according to the lawsuit. The EEOC enforces federal labor laws having to do with discrimination.  The agency asked for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining Honeywell from seeking to impose the penalties. A hearing is set for Monday, according to court documents. Honeywell employs about 51,000 people in the United States, according to its most recent annual U.S. securities filing. Of Honeywell employees and spouses enrolled in a health plan, 77 percent of participated in the company’s wellness program last year, up from 36 percent in 2011, the company said. The company said in a statement that the EEOC was “woefully out of step with the healthcare marketplace” and unfamiliar with the details of its wellness plan. Biometric testing provides “valuable private information to each employee about potentially life threatening issues,” the company said. “Honeywell wants its employees to be well informed about their health status not only because it promotes their wellbeing, but also because we don’t believe it’s fair to the employees who do work to lead healthier lifestyles to subsidize the healthcare premiums for those who do not,” the company said in a statement. A survey by the National Business Group on Health found that 95 percent of employers offer a health risk assessment, biometric screening or other wellness program in 2014. About three-quarters of employers use incentives to engage employees in these programs, according to the organization, which seeks to represent large employer views on health policy. Employers have been seeking guidance from the EEOC about how federal law applies to wellness programs, according to the group’s president, Brian Marcotte. “This seems like a big step backward from what has been encouraged by the ACA,” Marcotte said.

U.S. District Judge Ann Montgomery in Minneapolis denied the EEOC’s request for a temporary restraining order, according to a court filing on Monday.

252,HON,"Honeywell sees benefit from lower oil prices, gives muted sales view","(Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) said on Monday it expected an overall benefit from the decline in oil prices even as it gave a 2015 sales forecast that slightly trailed Wall Street’s target. Low oil prices have pressured shares of some industrial manufacturers that supply to customers in the energy sector, and have weighed on Honeywell’s PMT segment that sells various process technologies. But Honeywell Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said only a small portion of that unit sells to “upstream” exploration customers, the area where spending is in question, and the company’s backlog is “holding up.”  Importantly, he said, more of Honeywell’s business is in the midstream or downstream area, including refiners, which are poised to gain should low prices boost demand. Further, low oil prices stand to reduce freight, utilities, and other operating expenses at the company, Szlosek said. “Overall, while we continue to watch this closely, we see lower oil as good for the Honeywell portfolio,” Szlosek told analysts on a conference call. Honeywell, which in March said it was targeting $10 billion in acquisitions through 2018, has increased resources in its efforts to explore potential deals, Szlosek said. The company, which also makes aircraft parts and climate control systems, projected sales in a range of $40.5 billion to $41.1 billion next year. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $41.92 billion for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  On an organic basis excluding acquisitions, the company expects sales to rise about 4 percent next year. Honeywell, which derives more than half of its total revenue from outside the United States, said it was expecting global economic growth of 3.1 percent next year, up from 2.7 percent expected for 2014.

It cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to a range of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion from $10.3 billion to $10.4 billion, due to its decision to fund incentive programs in its aerospace business in the quarter.

255,HON,"Honeywell sees benefit from lower oil prices, gives muted sales view","(Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) said on Monday it expected an overall benefit from the decline in oil prices even as it gave a 2015 sales forecast that slightly trailed Wall Street’s target. Low oil prices have pressured shares of some industrial manufacturers that supply to customers in the energy sector, and have weighed on Honeywell’s PMT segment that sells various process technologies. But Honeywell Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said only a small portion of that unit sells to “upstream” exploration customers, the area where spending is in question, and the company’s backlog is “holding up.”  Importantly, he said, more of Honeywell’s business is in the midstream or downstream area, including refiners, which are poised to gain should low prices boost demand. Further, low oil prices stand to reduce freight, utilities, and other operating expenses at the company, Szlosek said. “Overall, while we continue to watch this closely, we see lower oil as good for the Honeywell portfolio,” Szlosek told analysts on a conference call. Honeywell, which in March said it was targeting $10 billion in acquisitions through 2018, has increased resources in its efforts to explore potential deals, Szlosek said. The company, which also makes aircraft parts and climate control systems, projected sales in a range of $40.5 billion to $41.1 billion next year. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $41.92 billion for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  On an organic basis excluding acquisitions, the company expects sales to rise about 4 percent next year. Honeywell, which derives more than half of its total revenue from outside the United States, said it was expecting global economic growth of 3.1 percent next year, up from 2.7 percent expected for 2014. It projected earnings in a range of $5.95 to $6.15 per share for 2015, or growth of 8 percent to 12 percent. Analysts were looking for $6.11 per share. The Morristown, New Jersey-based company backed its 2014 profit forecast. It cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to a range of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion from $10.3 billion to $10.4 billion, due to its decision to fund incentive programs in its aerospace business in the quarter.    Honeywell’s shares were off 0.3 percent at $95.63 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen about 5 percent this year.

Sales in the company’s automation and control business increased 2.8 percent, partially offseting a 5.8 percent decline in its aerospace business and helping total sales beat average analyst estimate. Honeywell shares rose as much as 4.6 percent to a record $103.92 on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. economy has been a source of strength for the company, Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek told Reuters. “The U.S. actually was a nice high-growth region for us in the second half of the year,” Szlosek said in an interview. “It was across the portfolio... I think the macros are looking up for the U.S.” Honeywell forecast earnings of $1.36-$1.41 per share on revenue of $9.4 billion-$9.6 billion for the first quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.40 per share on revenue of $9.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The U.S. economy managed to stay strong despite global weakness. The International Monetary Fund predicted on Tuesday that growth in the United States would continue to strengthen in 2015, raising its growth projection to 3.6 percent from 3.1 percent. Honeywell reported net sales of $10.27 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts had expected $10.21 billion. “Pleasingly, sales came in above expectations - small, but important since sales weakness has in the past been punished by the market,” Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe wrote in a note. Sales from the company’s aerospace business were hurt by discounts to aircraft makers and a strengthening dollar. The dollar rose nearly 13 percent in 2014, its biggest yearly gain since 1997, when measured against a basket of major currencies. Honeywell gets more than half its total revenue from outside the United States. Net income attributable to Honeywell rose about 1 percent to $956 million as the company had to pay less tax. Tax expenses fell 30.7 percent to $329 million. Excluding items, the company earned $1.43 per share, topping average analyst estimate of $1.42 per share. Honeywell shares had risen 9.1 percent in the past year through Thursday, against a 11.8 percent rise in the S&P; 500 Index.

258,HON,UPDATE 3-GE industrial profit rises despite flagging oil unit sales,"(Adds Immelt comment, Honeywell results) By Lewis Krauskopf Jan 23 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a 9 percent rise in quarterly industrial profit on Friday as its businesses that sell power-generating turbines and jet engines helped offset weak sales in its oil and gas unit. Investors have been concerned that plunging oil prices will hurt GE’s sales of oil equipment if customers slash spending. Orders in the unit also fell. “It’s going to be an albatross ... as long as energy prices stay low,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. “The sentiment on GE is very negative here, and I don’t see anything in the quarter that is going to change that.” GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said the U.S. conglomerate, which is shifting its focus even more to industrial operations and away from finance, recognized the risks from low oil prices. But he pointed to other areas of strength, including the improving U.S. economy. “The GE world remains balanced,” Immelt said on a conference call with analysts. “Our job is to manage the company through volatility.” Fourth-quarter net income rose 61 percent to $5.15 billion, or 51 cents per share, from a year earlier, when results suffered from GE’s move to resolve financial obligations to Japan’s Shinsei Bank. Excluding pension-related costs, earnings of 56 cents per share were 1 cent ahead of the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4 percent to $42 billion, just missing Wall Street estimates of $42.16 billion. Shares of GE rose 1.8 percent in morning trading, while rival Honeywell International Inc, whose sales and earnings both narrowly beat expectations, gained 3.4 percent. GE’s organic industrial revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and deals, increased 9 percent. Sales in the power and water unit, which sells a variety of turbines and is GE’s biggest industrial segment, rose 22 percent, while the aviation division’s sales increased 4 percent. Revenue at the oil and gas division slumped 6 percent but was flat on an organic basis. Orders at the unit, which sells oil and gas equipment and services, fell 4 percent on an organic basis, but its quarterly profit edged up 1 percent. GE’s profit margin for the industrial businesses, which Wall Street watches closely, rose by 0.5 percentage points to 18.8 percent. The company is cutting costs and simplifying operations to lift margins. Through Thursday, GE shares were off 4 percent so far in 2015, against a slight increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.

260,HON,"Honeywell, OneWeb partner to offer satellite internet to aircraft","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc said on Monday it has teamed up with satellite internet startup OneWeb Ltd to expand the high-speed data services it offers to aircraft. OneWeb, whose investors include Richard Branson’s Virgin Group and Qualcomm Inc, plans to build a network of 648 low-orbit satellites capable of beaming fast internet around the world starting in 2019. Honeywell will use OneWeb’s bandwidth to provide aircraft services such as streaming maintenance data from engines and other equipment to the ground, transmitting weather and navigation data to pilots and supplying fast internet connections to passengers. The system also could stream black box flight data or cockpit video, ideas regulators are discussing, Honeywell said. Honeywell already supplies some services through satellite providers such as Iridium Communications Inc and Inmarsat Plc. But the faster speeds and low latency that OneWeb promises - at least 50 megabits per second per aircraft, and possibly much more - could in theory increase Honeywell’s market by three to five times, Carl Esposito, vice president of marketing and product management at Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview.     “It’s a big opportunity,” he said. Because of the high bandwidth, “it really is transformational across the entire aircraft.”  The deal does not rule out or alter other partnerships. “It is very complementary to the solutions we’re already providing,” he said. Honeywell will also sell equipment that connects the aircraft to the satellite.  Honeywell says the agreement will allow it to target a wider range of aircraft, including smaller business and military planes, along with commercial jetliners. OneWeb says its system will be capable of providing 10 terabits of data per second, and much of that bandwidth will go to ground-based users in developing countries seeking internet access. Aircraft add another, potentially lucrative market, although the prices of OneWeb and Honeywell’s services have not been set.  OneWeb does not see a threat from other technology companies that provide global broadband such as Facebook Inc, Google Inc and SpaceX. “There’s an insane appetite for bandwidth,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Wyler said. “We’re going to make a dent in it with our system. But we’re not going to complete it.” OneWeb plans to start launching its small satellites in 2017, placing them about 750 miles above Earth.

266,HON,UPDATE 3-Obama administration to remove hurdle to 'wellness' penalties,"(Adds comment from Honeywell) By Sharon Begley NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - In what would be a significant and hard-fought victory for U.S. businesses, the Obama administration said on Thursday it will propose new rules for workplace wellness programs that would treat as voluntary even plans that penalize workers thousands of dollars for not participating. That decision, which will be published in the Federal Register on Monday, opening 60 days for public comment, would likely remove the government’s legal challenge to the wellness program at Honeywell International Inc. Last year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued Honeywell, arguing that penalties in its workplace wellness program, which can reach $4,000 a year for workers who choose not to participate, made it involuntary. The “voluntary” standard is critical because a landmark anti-discrimination law largely prohibits employers from asking questions about the health of workers unless the queries relate to their ability to perform a job. Wellness programs, which the vast majority of large U.S. firms have instituted, often require employees to answer detailed questions about their family medical histories and to undergo employer-specified medical exams, such as for cholesterol and glucose levels, blood pressure, weight and waist size. The programs have expanded since President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law of 2010, which allows employers to charge non-participants 30 percent more for health coverage, including premiums and deductibles. That can amount to thousands of dollars a year. The EEOC therefore had to reconcile that Obamacare provision with the prohibition on involuntary wellness programs, which is part of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Although that landmark law “limits the circumstances in which employers may ask employees about their health or require them to undergo medical examinations, it allows such inquiries and exams if they are voluntary and part of an employee health program,” the EEOC said in a statement. The agency added that the “proposed rule makes clear that wellness programs are permitted under the ADA,” and that “companies may offer incentives of up to 30 percent of the total cost of employee-only coverage in connection with wellness programs.” The EEOC proposal would bar employers from firing, disciplining, coercing, or denying health coverage to employees who decline to participate in a wellness program. About 98 percent of U.S. companies with 200 or more workers, and 73 percent of smaller firms, offered wellness programs in 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Those numbers are up from 62 percent of larger firms and 26 percent of smaller firms offering such programs in 2006. Wellness programs are generally managed by outside companies in what has become an $8 billion-a-year industry, research firm IBISWorld reported last month. Reuters reported in November that leading U.S. corporations represented by the Business Roundtable, angered by the EEOC’s legal action against Honeywell, were threatening to pull their tacit support for Obamacare unless the government backed off . Since then, the Business Roundtable has made meeting government officials about the issue “a top priority,” a senior official for the group said. The Roundtable argues that wellness programs with hefty penalties are voluntary “because employees can elect to participate or pay the penalty,” said its outside counsel, Nancy Taylor. The EEOC apparently agreed. “Employers are going to be pretty happy about the proposed regulation,” said Seth Perretta, a principal at Groom Law Group in Washington and an expert in employment law. In a statement, Honeywell called the EEOC proposal “a positive step toward enabling the implementation of the President’s health care law and the desire of all Americans to lead healthier lives,” and said no employee has been denied healthcare coverage “or disciplined in any way as a result of their voluntary decision not to participate in our wellness programs.” Patient advocacy and anti-discrimination groups, however, criticized the idea that a wellness program can be voluntary if opting out brings hefty financial penalties. The EEOC proposal “appears to diminish the protections that workers have against being coerced to disclose medical information to their employers when that information is unrelated to their ability to do their jobs,” said attorney Jennifer Mathis of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. If the EEOC proposal takes effect, employees who feel they are being coerced into workplace wellness programs could try to challenge it in court. In general, however, courts defer to federal agencies on such questions.

Selling followed sharp overseas stocks declines and was broad, with all 10 major S&P; 500 sectors losing ground. Among the biggest drags, the S&P; financials index  was down 1.3 percent, with shares of Dow component American Express falling 4.4 percent to $77.32 after revenue missed analysts’ estimates, partly due to the currency impact. The Dow and S&P; 500 both snapped two weeks of gains. For the week, the Dow was down 1.3 percent, the S&P; 500 down 1 percent and the Nasdaq down 1.3 percent. Both Honeywell International and General Electric  blamed the strong dollar for lower revenue. Shares of Honeywell were down 2.1 percent at $101.70, while GE shares were down 0.1 percent at $27.25. China’s securities regulator warned investors to be cautious as Chinese shares hit seven-year highs. China allowed fund managers to lend stocks for short-selling and expanded the number of stocks investors can short. China H-Share index futures fell 3.4 percent. Global equities lost ground as the weakness in China carried through to European and U.S. markets. “We saw selling overseas, and that spilled over into the U.S. We’ve had a nice rally over the last few weeks to the upper half of the trading range, and it’s moving back over,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. “It’s still too early to tell what earnings are going to be for the quarter, but there haven’t been that many upside surprises. And that’s what we need to see.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 279.47 points, or 1.54 percent, to 17,826.3, the S&P; 500 lost 23.81 points, or 1.13 percent, to 2,081.18 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 75.98 points, or 1.52 percent, to 4,931.81. Market participants were also concerned Greece could leave the euro zone as it tries to reform its economy and deal with heavy debt. Greece dismissed reports it needed to tap remaining cash reserves to meet salary payments. The U.S. earnings season has been mixed so far with more companies beating lowered expectations. The impact of the stronger dollar will be highlighted next week with quarterly reports from United Technologies Corp, Boeing and other top companies.

The company also cut its full-year revenue forecast to $39 billion-$39.6 billion from $40.5 billion-$41.1 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $40.52 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Honeywell gets more than half its revenue from international operations and exports. The dollar .DXY rose 9 percent against a basket of currencies in the first three months of the year. The company sold its friction materials business, which makes auto parts such as drum brake linings, hydraulic components and brake fluid, to Federal Mogul for about $155 million last year. Honeywell’s transportation unit, which included the friction materials business, accounted for about 10 percent of total revenue in 2013. Sales in the company’s aerospace business — its largest — fell 6 percent to $3.61 billion in the first quarter, while sales at its automation and controls business fell 3 percent. Excluding the impact of the dollar and the sale of the friction materials business, sales in the aerospace business rose 1 percent. Revenue for the first quarter fell to $9.21 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $9.48 billion.

Foreign currency swings hurt sales by 4 percentage points, with sales otherwise growing 3 percent on an organic basis. Sales fell 7 percent at the company’s Otis elevators business, which generates major business internationally. United Tech follows manufacturers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) in reporting that its sales were hurt by a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of foreign sales upon conversion into the greenback. “It’s the same theme that is playing out when you look at other industrials,” UTC Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said in an interview. “Most have missed on the top line, but the bottom line is okay because the analysts calibrated (earnings) impact of currency reasonably well.” United Tech expects the dollar to hurt sales by about $2.5 billion this year, although it backed its 2015 forecast.

286,HON,Honeywell to buy Melrose's utility metering business for $5.1 billion,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) has made its largest purchase in more than a decade, agreeing to buy the utility consumption metering business of Britain’s Melrose Industries Plc (MRON.L) for about $5.1 billion. The move, announced on Tuesday, is the first major deal for Honeywell, the U.S. diversified industrial manufacturer, since it laid out a five-year plan in March 2014 to target at least $10 billion in acquisitions. Investors have been eager to see how industrial companies use their capital as many of their markets struggle for growth. The acquisition will give Honeywell access to Elster Group’s metering technology and customers in the highly regulated heating, controls and metering industries, including smart meters and data analytics. “It’s a very good strategic deal,” Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment said. “You’ve seen growth of smart-metering technologies for the last ten years and I think there’s a long way to go.” Honeywell shares rose nearly 2 percent at $103.61 in mid-day trading, while Melrose was up nearly 10 percent. The acquisition is Honeywell’s largest since its merger with Allied Signal in 1999 and the biggest under David Cote, who became chief executive officer in 2002. But the company, whose products range from aircraft systems to climate control, is still on the prowl. Asked on a conference call with analysts if the company was done striking deals this year, Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said: “I don’t think we’re done ... We’re going to keep going.” In fact, the Elster deal provides a new platform for acquisition targets, Honeywell executives said. Elster’s sales are estimated to be $1.8 billion this year, with roughly two-thirds in natural gas, and the rest in electricity and water markets. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley said the price for Elster, which Honeywell put at 12.6 times estimated 2015 core earnings, was reasonable. The all-cash deal is expected to close in the first quarter and have a “minor” negative impact on earnings next year, Honeywell said. A source familiar with the matter said Honeywell had approached Melrose earlier this year. The two sides quickly began talks and no other bidders were involved, the source said. Melrose, an engineering turnaround specialist that buys businesses with the intention of selling them at a profit, said it would return more than 2 billion pounds to shareholders after the sale. Melrose Executive Vice-Chairman David Roper said the sale of the entire Elster business, which the company acquired in 2012, happened sooner than planned. The market had expected the business to be sold in parts. “I think we’ve always said that if an opportunistic bidder comes along and offers tomorrow’s price today, we will talk to them,” Roper said. The sale leaves Melrose with only one business, Brush, a manufacturer of electricity generating equipment. Melrose CEO Simon Peckham said the company was scouting for an acquisition in the range of 2 billion pounds, preferably in northern Europe or North America. Rothschild [ROT.UL] acted as lead financial adviser on the deal for Melrose, while JP Morgan (JPM.N) also advised Melrose, and Investec acted as joint broker.

291,HON,Honeywell unit probed in toxic gas leak in Illinois,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it has begun a special inspection at Honeywell Metropolis Works in Illinois to assess a uranium hexafluoride leak that occurred during maintenance activity on Saturday evening. No one at the facility was injured, and the company reported that no uranium hexafluoride was released past the site boundary, the commission said in a statement on Monday.  Uranium hexafluoride is a toxic gas and is usually stored in large canisters. Honeywell officials indicated the leak was on the sixth floor of the plant’s feed materials building, the NRC said. Monitoring devices located at the site boundaries detected no radiological release beyond regulatory limits. The special inspection will look at the sequence of events leading up to the release, verify the company followed its procedures for mitigating the release and notifying local and state agencies. Honeywell Metropolis Works is the only U.S. facility that converts uranium ore into uranium hexafluoride, an essential compound used to produce enriched uranium as fuel in nuclear power plants, according to the company’s website. The primary risks associated with uranium conversion are chemical and radiological, according to the NRC’s website. “Honeywell takes this incident seriously and is cooperating fully with the NRC inspection,” a company spokesman said in an email on Tuesday. The company, a unit of Honeywell International Inc, alerted the NRC and other regulatory agencies promptly and the plant’s emergency equipment and response teams worked as designed to contain and stop the leak without injuries, he added.

S&P; materials, down 1.8 percent, led the decline for the S&P; 500, but the selloff was broad-based, with all 10 major sectors lower. More worries about slower growth in China pushed commodities to two-week lows, with copper prices and industrial metals leading losses. U.S. crude oil also settled lower. Shares of Volkswagen suppliers BorgWarner, Honeywell  and Delphi Automotive fell after the German carmaker admitted to cheating on vehicle emission tests. BorgWarner shares were down 7.6 percent at $39.37, while Honeywell fell 1.7 percent to $96.04 and Delphi lost 3.6 percent to $74.44. Biotech stocks fell for a second day after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she would propose a $250 monthly cap on prescription drugs. The Nasdaq Biotech Index  was down 1.7 percent. “It’s China. It’s the Fed. It’s slowing global growth. The news on Volkswagen is overhanging the auto industry.

The Fed’s decision last week to keep rates near zero has left investors guessing when the central bank will make its big move, increasing volatility in the market. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday a rate hike later this year was still possible. Lockhart is scheduled to speak again later on Tuesday. Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks on Thursday. The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped 11.4 percent to 22.44, above its long-term average of 20.

295,HON,Flagging oil sector keeps pressure on industrial manufacturers,"(Reuters) - The flagging oil sector and volatile emerging economies are keeping pressure on U.S. industrial manufacturers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International (HON.N), which are cutting costs or squeezing supply chains to help churn out stronger profits. The latest corporate reports, including Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) posting tepid order growth, served as fresh signs of weakness in key pockets of the industrial market that have plagued many manufacturers this year. New data from the Federal Reserve also showed that U.S. industrial production fell for a second straight month in September on renewed weakness in oil and gas drilling, amid the steep slide in crude oil prices. Honeywell still expects earnings per share to outpace core revenue growth this year, and GE expects the same for its industrial business. GE shares were up 3.7 percent in afternoon trading after the company reported better than expected quarterly profit, while Honeywell was off 2.1 percent. “We have seen this across the board where oil and gas has been this tremendous headwind,” Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said. “There’s growing concerns there could be continued weakness in the businesses, but these companies have done a lot with restructuring.” General Electric, which through acquisitions built an $18 billion business supplying oil and gas sector customers, warned that its oil segment could see revenue and profit fall as much as 15 percent in 2016 if the sector remains shaky. GE’s oil segment orders tumbled 38 percent in the third quarter and revenue dropped 16 percent. But GE, aiming to cut $1 billion in segment costs between this year and next, held the division’s profit flat, when excluding currency swings. Even with the oil pressures, GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bornstein told analysts on a conference call he expected overall earnings per share to rise by at least 10 percent next year. “I think we feel reasonable about the outlook for 2016,” Bornstein said in an interview. “I don’t think we can be more confident than being reasonable.” Oil weakness also undermined Honeywell’s results, and the company lowered its 2015 revenue forecast.  For 2016, Honeywell said sales in the performance materials and technologies business would be hurt due to declining orders from oil and gas customers. In an interview, Honeywell Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said as part of its efforts to operate efficiently, the company keeps a “regular pipeline of restructuring opportunities” for its supply chain, such as looking for inefficient factories to close or combining those not at full capacity. “You’re not going to see us announce a massive layoff because there’s top-line pressure,” Szlosek said. “We’ve been dealing with top-line pressure in our businesses for the better part of 18 months now.” ",10162015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-industrialoutput-results/flagging-oil-sector-keeps-pressure-on-industrial-manufacturers-idUSKCN0SA2K020151016

The company, which got about 11 percent of its sales from the energy industry in 2014, also cut its full-year revenue forecast, sending its shares down as much as 3.2 percent to $95.33 on Friday. As oil and gas companies slash capital spending due to weak crude oil prices, Honeywell’s business that caters to the energy and chemicals industries among others was particularly hit. Sales in the performance materials and technologies business, fell 13 percent in the third quarter. The business accounted for a quarter of Honeywell’s total sales. Sales fell 2 percent in Honeywell’s aerospace business, its largest, and declined 3 percent in its automation and controls business. Honeywell said sales in the performance materials and technologies business would be hurt in 2016 also due to declining orders from oil and gas customers. “There are some pockets that have unfortunately created this temporary drag on us,” Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said in an interview, referring to the company’s oil and gas-related business. General Electric Co (GE.N) on Friday also said revenue in its oil and gas business dropped 16 percent in the latest quarter due to weak crude oil prices. Honeywell, which has been cutting jobs and selling or merging businesses to reduce costs, said third-quarter operating margins rose to 18.3 percent from 16.2 percent a year earlier. But, margin expansion in 2016 would be limited “given its peak operating levels”, William Blair analyst Nick Heymann said. “We ... expect a pickup in end-market demand will be a necessity if the company is to drive growth in the longer term”, Heymann wrote in a note to clients. Honeywell cut its 2015 revenue forecast to $38.7 billion from a range of $39 billion to $39.6 billion. Revenue declined 5 percent to $9.61 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, also hurt by a strong dollar. Core sales growth slowed to 1 percent from a rate of 2-5 percent in the previous five quarters. Core sales excludes the impact of currency, M&A; and the pass-through of changes in raw material prices. Lower costs helped net income attributable to Honeywell rise 8.3 percent to $1.26 billion, or $1.60 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.55 per share and revenue of $9.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GE’s shares were nearly flat at $28.10 premarket after the company posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Industrial tools maker Grainger fell 5.3 percent to $209.88 after reporting a smaller-than-expected profit. Honeywell fell 1 percent to $97.48 after results. “Today’s earnings are mixed. They don’t paint a strong one-directional picture of improvement or deterioration,” said Doug Burtnick, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Burtnick said he expects the day’s trading to be mostly muted. “This could, without some other piece of news, be one of those settle-in and not very exciting kind of day.” At 8:55 a.m. ET (1255 GMT), S&P; 500 e-minis were down 1.25 points, or 0.06 percent, with 166,184 contracts traded.

Global stocks advanced on Friday, taking cues from Thursday’s rally in U.S. stocks triggered by strong results from Citigroup and positive data. S&P; 500 companies are expected to report a 4 percent fall in third-quarter profit, the biggest decline in six years, according to Thomson Reuters data. The dollar rose after Thursday’s data rekindled hopes that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates this year. The Fed, which kept rates at near-zero levels at its September meeting, is waiting for signs of stabilizing inflation and sustained economic recovery before it pulls the trigger. U.S. industrial production in September, due at 9:15 a.m. ET (1315 GMT), is expected to have shrunk 0.2 percent, after falling 0.4 percent in August.

The European Commission last year launched legal proceedings against Germany, which has backed Daimler’s refusal to use the R1234yf coolant developed by U.S. conglomerate Honeywell  in partnership with Dupont. Daimler, which has said the coolant can cause fire in front-end collisions, said on Tuesday it will install a “specific protective system” in vehicles switching to R1234yf to ensure safety. The world’s third-largest maker of luxury cars has insisted on using R134a, a global warming agent that is more than 1,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide, but does not burst into flames. EU rules will require carmakers from 2017 to use coolants with a global warming potential no more than 150 times that of carbon dioxide. The Stuttgart-based manufacturer also said it will phase in carbon dioxide (CO2) as a refrigerant in S-Class and E-Class models starting next year. The two-track approach is required as it is not feasible to roll out CO2-based air conditioning technology across the fleet by January 2017, Daimler said. The Commission was not immediately available for comment.

316,HON,US STOCKS-Wall St lifted by muscular oil rally but some still wary,"* U.S. crude rises more than 6 percent * Energy top gainer among S&P; sectors * Health insurers up; govt proposes hiking Medicare payments * Indexes up: Dow 1.37 pct, S&P; 1.28 pct, Nasdaq 1.36 pct   (Updates to afternoon) By Noel Randewich Feb 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Monday, helped by a robust rally in oil prices that lifted recently-crushed energy stocks, including Chevron and Schlumberger. As it has for months, Wall Street followed the lead of global oil prices in a trend that has left the S&P; 500 down 5 percent so far in 2016, following a partial recovery last week. Monday’s stock gains were broad, with all 10 major S&P; sectors higher, but investors shell-shocked by this year’s market turbulence remained wary. “I don’t think we’re through the mess,” said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. “You still have concerns about China and where growth goes there, and that’s why you’re still going to have this volatility.” U.S. crude prices settled up more than 6 percent, while prices of industrial metals such as copper and zinc rose as investors worried about potential shortages. At 2:33 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.37 percent at 16,616.04 points and the S&P; 500 had gained 1.28 percent to 1,942.33. The Nasdaq Composite  added 1.36 percent to 4,565.73. The S&P; energy sector rose 2.2 percent, boosted by Chevron’s 3-percent increase. The materials sector  rose 1.8 percent. Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan  were the biggest influences, both surging 12 percent. Recent turmoil in global markets and macroeconomic uncertainty has left investors split over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Among S&P; 500 companies, there have been 75 negative EPS pre-announcements for the first quarter, compared to 16 positive pre-announcements, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UnitedHealth, Anthem, Humana, Aetna  and other insurers were up after the U.S. government proposed raising payments to health insurers who offer Medicare Advantage health benefits to elderly and disabled Americans. UnitedHealth was up 3.06 percent, providing a major boost to the Dow. Shares of Aerospace component suppliers Honeywell International Inc fell 1.8 percent and United Technologies Corp, a Dow component, rallied 5.7 percent after CNBC reported the two have held merger talks. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,421 to 610. On the Nasdaq, 2,046 issues rose and 712 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 18 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 27 new lows.

The announcement comes a day after United Tech disclosed merger talks with Honeywell and said a deal would “face insurmountable regulatory obstacles”. United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, said on Monday that a merger could either be blocked outright or conditioned on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review period that would destroy shareholder value. “A combined Honeywell and United Technologies would maintain a strong investment grade rating, and have higher free cash flow,” Honeywell said. A merger of the two firms would create a behemoth with combined sales of more than $90 billion, a company responsible for a huge amount of equipment on commercial airliners, ranging from jet engines to airplane cockpits and landing gear. United Tech and Honeywell first began exploring a merger as early as 1993, but the talks were revived after a broad strategic review initiated by United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes when he took over last year, Reuters reported on Monday, citing sources.

320,HON,Wall St. stumbles as oil slumps again,"(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks slid on Tuesday, hurt by pressure from a renewed drop in oil prices, undercutting momentum that had helped the market rebound from a sluggish start to the year. The major U.S. indexes closed down more than 1 percent. Crude prices CLc1 LCOc1 settled down more than 4 percent as Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi effectively ruled out production cuts anytime soon. Equity markets this year have been tightly linked to the daily fluctuations of battered oil prices. Energy shares .SPNY tumbled 3.2 percent on Tuesday, leading declines among S&P; sectors. “The markets are really worried that we are missing something here, that the global slowdown may be more significant than we are recognizing and that slowdown could be causing oil prices to drop, and commodities prices in general,” said Tracie McMillion, head of asset allocation at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 188.88 points, or 1.14 percent, to 16,431.78, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 24.23 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,921.27 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 67.02 points, or 1.47 percent, to 4,503.58. In a sign of the spreading toll from low oil prices, JP Morgan (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank by assets, will increase provisions for expected losses on energy loans by $500 million, or more than 60 percent of its existing reserves. Its shares dropped 4.2 percent.  Financial shares .SPSY, the worst performing group this year, fell another 1.8 percent on Tuesday. Nine of the 10 S&P; sectors finished negative. After posting its strongest week of the year last week, the S&P; 500 had climbed another 1.5 percent on Monday. It remains down 6 percent this year. “Having the market take a little bit of profit wasn’t a surprise to us,” said John Traynor, chief investment officer of People’s United Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Connecticut. “We think this is just a small setback in an ongoing recovery. We have been telling clients that we are in a bottoming process.” Fitbit (FIT.N) plummeted 20.8 percent to $13.08 after the wearable fitness device maker forecast profit below estimates. Western Digital (WDC.O) dropped 7.2 percent to $42.77 after it cut the price of its planned acquisition of rival U.S. hard-disk maker SanDisk Corp SNDK.O by more than $3 billion after losing a big investment from China’s Unisplendour Corp Ltd (000938.SZ).

323,HON,Thales shuns big mergers after U.S. aero firms try to team up,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Thales (TCFP.PA) ruled out its participation in a “Big Bang” merger as the aerospace industry digested news of inconclusive talks between two of its largest suppliers, United Technologies (UTX.N) and Honeywell (HON.N). The existence of recent talks between the U.S. groups to create a components and engines giant with $90 billion of sales became public overnight, but United Technologies said a deal would “face insurmountable regulatory obstacles.” The shape of the potential tie-up echoed, on a larger scale, abortive talks between Thales and French aero engines maker Safran (SAF.PA) in 2007. They broadly compete with Honeywell and United Technologies respectively. But Thales Chief Executive Patrice Caine told reporters he had no intention of revisiting the discussions and highlighted the difficulties of carrying out “Big Bang” transactions. He also ruled out bidding for Safran’s Morpho Detection airport security business, which is reportedly up for sale. Thales would focus on add-on acquisitions without major execution risk and with a high chance of boosting profitability. Thales makes civil and military aircraft avionics, satellites, rail signalling systems and radar. Shares in Europe’s largest defence electronics group rose more than 6 percent as strong 2015 defence earnings helped lift operating profit 23 percent to 1.22 billion euros ($1.3 billion), and advance payments from orders more than doubled its cashflow.     Thales raised its dividend 21 percent to 1.36 euros after posting higher-than-expected core profit and record orders for 2015, kicking into a higher gear after years of lacklustre growth. The company’s order intake jumped 31 percent to 18.88 billion euros, lifted by radar contracts for recent French Rafale fighter sales to Egypt and Qatar, as well as a major London Underground signalling contract. Caine dismissed talk of a downturn in civil aerospace markets, saying airline traffic continued to support rising aircraft production.  He said a UK vote to leave the European Union in a June referendum would be neutral for the company’s UK defence business but would “raise concerns about the dynamism of Europe”. For 2016, Thales predicted operating income of between 1.3 billion euros and 1.33 billion, on the high side of analyst forecasts, and mid-single digit organic sales growth. It also said it planned to erase losses at its transport division.

330,HON,How Honeywell turned the tables on United Tech,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) Chief Executive David Cote was sporting the casual jeans and sweater he often likes to wear in the office when he was visited by his then-counterpart at United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in 2012, Louis Chenevert. With Honeywell’s stock trading at around $55, Chenevert had come to discuss offering $65 per share to merge the two U.S. aerospace and automation giants. The idea was not new. The two companies had flirted with it for years, even before General Electric Co’s (GE.N) failed bid to acquire Honeywell in 2000. But the talks never advanced beyond initial approaches. That time was no different. Cote responded negatively, telling Chenevert he believed Honeywell’s stock would be worth $100 in a few years. He was proven right. While Honeywell’s stock has risen more than 80 percent since then, and is near all-time highs, UTC’s stock has risen only by a third, and is down a third from its 2015 peak. Cote, 63, sensed an opportunity to turn the tables by unveiling a $90.7 billion bid this week.  Even after running Honeywell for 14 years, Cote’s appetite for the top job is undiminished. He proposed a deal in which Honeywell would be the buyer and lead the merger, with Cote holding both CEO and chairman titles of the combined company.   This account, based on two sources briefed on the meeting and public filings, shows why Honeywell, which had previously shied away from a deal, was happy to confirm its interest in UTC this week from a position of strength. It also illustrates the challenges UTC now faces in resisting a deal. “It is very opportunistic of Dave. I don’t blame him, but it’s not going to happen,” Greg Hayes, UTC’s CEO since 2014, said on CNBC this week. UTC argues that a merger with Honeywell would face insurmountable antitrust obstacles and strong customer opposition, citing concerns expressed by Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N). Honeywell says antitrust issues are limited and can be addressed through asset sales. Honeywell has also argued that the combined company, which would have a market capitalization of more than $160 billion, would be able to offer a more comprehensive suite of products and services to customers, with the annualized cost synergies reaching $3.5 billion. UTC disputes that figure, and points out that the asset sales required to receive antitrust approval and customer concessions would destroy a lot of value. “If Honeywell wants to buy at a full and fair price, then yes, I would want to sell,” said Daniel O’Keefe, portfolio manager at mutual fund manager Artisan Partners, which owns a $212 million stake in United Technologies. Honeywell, which has a scheduled investor day on March 2,  has no plans to go hostile with its bid, according to the sources. However, UTC’s stock has been rising every day since Honeywell’s approach was disclosed on Tuesday, and is now up 10 percent since then, as investors bet on a deal happening. As a result, UTC will have to present a compelling standalone plan at its annual investor day on March 10 to keep its shareholders on board. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company has already been going out of its way to maintain investor support. UTC removed Chenevert in late 2014 after he refused to consider a sale of storied helicopter maker Sikorsky, according to the sources. Chenevert, who now works at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), did not respond to requests for comment. Chenevert was succeeded by Hayes, whose first act was to announce a strategic review of all options. He reached out to Honeywell again in April 2015 to explore a merger, but cooled on the idea after he saw the antitrust environment become more stringent and UTC’s stock lost value on disappointing earnings. UTC later sold Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) for $9 billion and agreed to use the proceeds to fund additional share repurchases.   At a time when peers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) have been slimming down to focus on core businesses, UTC has retained its diversity. It makes everything from air conditioners to elevators and fire equipment, to a broad range of aerospace equipment, including tires, cockpits and engines. But UTC’s businesses are not all faring equally. Its underperforming Otis elevator division, for example, is facing steep engineering and development costs as the company tries to refresh its product line. In light of UTC’s latest snub of Honeywell, it will also have to explain why separating its aerospace from its buildings divisions does not make sense. Hayes has no intention of breaking up the company, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Instead, it will focus on initiatives such as its investment in its Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines. “In terms of capital allocation and portfolio management, UTC has done a pretty good job of looking after shareholders and its assets. But you could argue that the company could be broken up,” Artisan Partners’ O’Keefe said. The fact that UTC and Honeywell have the same top six shareholders - Vanguard Group, BlackRock, MFS Investment, Wellington Management, JPMorgan Asset Management and State Street - means that both companies are largely playing to the same audience. Vanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan and Wellington declined to comment. MFS and State Street did not respond to requests for comment.     The advanced notice period to propose board members at UTC’s annual meeting expired on Jan. 28, so any activist investor would have to wait a year to submit a slate of board directors. As of Dec. 31, no major activist hedge fund was invested in the company’s shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The fact that UTC and Honeywell have the same top six shareholders - Vanguard Group, BlackRock, MFS Investment, Wellington Management, JPMorgan Asset Management and State Street - means that both companies are largely playing to the same audience. Vanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan and Wellington declined to comment. MFS and State Street did not respond to requests for comment.     The advanced notice period to propose board members at UTC’s annual meeting expired on Jan. 28, so any activist investor would have to wait a year to submit a slate of board directors. As of Dec. 31, no major activist hedge fund was invested in the company’s shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

336,HON,Proposed Honeywell-United Tech deal could result in greater pricing power,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc’s (HON.N) proposal to buy rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) would create an industrial giant bigger than aircraft makers Boeing Co (BA.N) or Airbus Group (AIR.PA), potentially changing the balance of power between manufacturer and supplier. Pricing power is a key concern of the big aircraft makers, and it is a central issue in the battle between United Technologies and Honeywell. United Technologies on Friday rejected Honeywell’s $90.7 billion offer, citing customer concerns among other big issues. With nearly $100 billion in annual sales and significant combined market share for such key aircraft components as wheels, brakes, power units, ventilation systems, electronics and small engines, a combined Honeywell/United Technologies would have the heft to fight price-cutting demands from customers, industry experts said.  Boeing and Airbus have encouraged small and mid-sized suppliers to merge, so they would have more financial and management depth to serve the plane makers as they ramp up production over the next several years.  That growth requires investments in machines and people that small companies may not be able to support. At the same time, however, the two aircraft makers have pushed suppliers for price cuts, according to industry executives and filings by some suppliers. Honeywell on Friday portrayed a combined Honeywell/United Technologies as a company that would have the resources to hold its own in this environment. Honeywell Chief Executive Dave Cote, in a presentation made to United Technologies on Feb. 19 and made public on Friday, said the two companies together would enjoy “significant commercial opportunities to drive revenue growth.” A heftier research and development budget could fund investment in new technology. And they could boost profit margins by slashing annual costs by $3.5 billion, cutting redundant staffs and purchasing materials at higher volumes, Honeywell said. Boeing and Airbus aren’t waiting for a deal to materialize to express concern about Cote’s vision. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said the deal would not be in his company’s interest. Boeing said it would scrutinize the implications, saying in a statement: “Healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important to Boeing and our commercial and military customers.” The aircraft makers have used leverage afforded by their supply contracts to renegotiate pricing for components under certain conditions, including when a company is sold.  Those negotiations can be protracted and complex, even when a big merger is not at stake. Boeing and another large supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), for example, have been in talks since November 2014 on new contracts governing parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft, according to regulatory filings and people familiar with the discussions.  While it may be impractical to shift fuselage, wing section and other large components to new suppliers, Boeing can “trim around the edges” by moving smaller parts, said a source familiar with the talks. “And those smaller parts are more profitable.” United Technologies, in a lengthy statement opposing the Honeywell overture, argued that the aircraft makers would see to it that the combined companies had to cut prices by 5 to 10 percent.  United Technologies also said Honeywell’s per share offer of $42.63 in cash and 0.614 Honeywell share “grossly undervalues” the company. Regulators could compel Honeywell and United Technologies to sell some operations to address antitrust issues. United Technologies in its formal response cited the potential for divestitures that would diminish the value of the combined companies.

338,HON,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-United Tech rejects Honeywell's $90.7 bln offer,"(Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate United Technologies on Friday rejected a $90.7 billion offer by rival aerospace supplier Honeywell International Inc, saying that pursuing a merger would be “irresponsible” toward its shareholders. In an unusual move, the two companies sparred publicly about a deal that, if realized, would create one of the largest U.S. companies with almost $100 billion in annual sales.  Major customers also weighed in, with Boeing saying it would careful scrutinize a deal and underscoring the need for “healthy competition” in its supply chain. United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) said the two companies had talked about a possible combination for years. But it said the regulatory environment had changed and a merger now would either be blocked outright, or any synergies would be far outweighed by regulatory delays, required divestitures, and customer concerns and concessions. “It would be irresponsible for UTC to move forward with the proposed combination,” the company said in a regulatory filing. United Tech’s filing came hours after Honeywell (HON.N) spelled out the details of its $90.7 billion offer to acquire United Tech, putting pressure on the reluctant aerospace supplier to come to the negotiating table. Honeywell Chief Executive Officer David Cote, in a presentation he made to United Tech’s top executives last week and then made public on Friday, said a combined company would have double-digit earnings growth after it slashed costs. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, closed 0.4 percent lower at $97.69. That is well below Honeywell's $108 per share offer, suggesting Wall Street, like United Tech, was skeptical about the combination.  “Game on.... There is clear momentum in this saga, and a ratcheting up of the tensions,” wrote Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets. He cited concerns about business overlap, and said there were unresolved questions about achievable synergies, management roles, cultural fit, and merger premiums. Jeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official, said he was not convinced that the regulatory environment was as tough as United Tech said. Divestitures were always possible, but United Tech likely did not want to cede control to Honeywell, he said. United Tech is the parent of Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, while Honeywell makes thermostats, auto turbochargers and airplane cockpit electronics. Areas of overlap between the companies include small aircraft engines, airplane power units and environmental systems as well as wheels and brakes, CRT Capital analyst Peter Arment said in a note to clients.  Honeywell would likely have to divest many assets and raise its offer before a deal was done, Arment added.  U.S. and European regulatory scrutiny would push the deal’s completion well into 2017, and potentially into 2018, according to sources familiar with the deal. Honeywell said its offer includes $42.63 in cash and 0.614 of its shares for each United Tech share. The proposal represents a 22 percent premium to United Tech's closing price on Feb. 19, the last trading day before the talks were made public. (bit.ly/1oMD1tg) Honeywell shares closed 1.1 percent lower at $103.03. The companies said earlier this week they had held merger talks but did not offer details. United Tech had said a deal would “face insurmountable regulatory obstacles.” “It just cannot happen,” United Tech CEO Greg Hayes said on CNBC television this week. “There’s just no way to get it done.”  A merger could either be blocked outright or made conditional on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review that would destroy shareholder value, United Tech has said. Honeywell, however, said potential regulatory issues would be “easily resolved.”  In its presentation, Honeywell said a deal with United Tech would save $3.5 billion each year by cutting spending on raw materials, consolidating real estate and in other ways. Under the offer, Cote would lead the combined company.  United Tech said the merged firm’s revenues could fall by $5 billion to $10 billion since the change in “control” would force it to reopen contracts with major aircraft makers, said a source close the matter. That would allow those customers to negotiate lower prices, or even find new suppliers, the source said. A merger would create a behemoth responsible for much of the equipment on commercial airliners and many military aircraft, raising concerns for companies like Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N), as well as the Pentagon. The combined company would generate about 28 percent of sales from commercial aerospace customers, and 13 percent from the defense and space sector, according to Honeywell’s presentation.

While manufacturing activity contracted in February, steadying new orders growth and improving inventories offered signs of stability. Construction spending in January surged to the highest since 2007, while strong auto sales also boosted sentiment. The data strengthened expectations the U.S. economy is gaining steam after slowing in the fourth quarter. “What was the spin since last August? That the Chinese slowdown is going to affect the rest of the world,” said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. “Now we’re seeing there’s virtually no chance we’re going to have a recession.” Swings in the price of oil have been tightly linked to stock prices in recent months and on Tuesday they continued their recovery from recent lows, with U.S. crude up 2 percent. In a sign that investors are becoming more confident, the CBOE Volatility index fell 11.73 percent to its lowest since Dec. 31. At 2:28 pm (1928 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 1.79 percent to 16,811.35 and the S&P; 500  had gained 1.9 percent to 1,969.01. The Nasdaq Composite added 2.34 percent to 4,664.82. The S&P; 500 and the Dow were on track for their best one-day percentage gain since Feb. 12. The S&P; has partly recovered from a steep selloff this year and on Tuesday was back above its 50-day moving average, seen as a sign of improving sentiment. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 2.92 percent rise in financials. The sector is still the worst performer this year, down about 9 percent on uncertainty about interest rates and fears of defaults by energy companies. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup both rose more than 5 percent. The technology sector rose 2.69 percent. Apple  was up 3.80 percent at $100.36, giving the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq.

349,HON,UPDATE 6-U.S. curbs China's ZTE exports over Iran business allegations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new U.S. export restriction against China’s ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged Iran sanctions violations is likely to disrupt the telecom manufacturer’s sprawling global supply chain and could create substantial parts shortages, according to sanctions experts. Under the measure announced by the Commerce Department on Monday, U.S. manufacturers will be banned from selling components to ZTE, which is a major global supplier of telecom-networking equipment. In addition, foreign manufacturers will be prohibited from selling products containing a significant amount of U.S.-made parts to the Chinese company. The Commerce Department, confirming the decision that was first reported by Reuters on Saturday, said ZTE planned to use a series of shell companies “to illicitly reexport controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws.” It said ZTE acted “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” While ZTE suppliers can apply for an export license to ship any American-made equipment or parts, the Commerce Department said such license applications generally will be denied.    The export restriction, which does not stop ZTE from selling handsets in the United States, is expected to have a global impact. “It is going to have a large ripple effect. It’s very significant to many companies both in the U.S. and (outside the) U.S.,” said Doug Jacobson, an export attorney at law firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, who said he has been fielding calls from clients who supply ZTE since Reuters broke news of the impending export restrictions. For example, a Taiwanese chipmaker that uses American-made components to make processors for ZTE handsets would likely have to cut off those sales. If the Taiwanese supplier only procures components from outside the United States it can continue to sell to ZTE, experts said. “I am telling all my clients today that anything (for ZTE)not already on board an airplane going to China, you cannot ship it starting tonight. They have to scrub and screen their customers lists – pending orders and future orders – to make sure that any transactions with ZTE are flagged and stopped.” ZTE, which has annual sales of more than $15 billion and is the only Chinese smartphone maker with a meaningful presence in the U.S. market, can appeal the decision. ZTE is among the largest companies that the Commerce Department has hit with a near-total export ban, according to public records. In 2014, the department restricted exports to Russian energy companies Lukoil OAO and Gazprom OAO, but those restrictions only stopped American companies from supplying certain types of oil-production projects, such as Arctic offshore and deepwater drilling.   ZTE is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, with a 7 percent market share, behind Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), according to research firm IDC. It sells handset devices to three of the four largest U.S. mobile carriers - AT&T; (T.N), T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N). Although ZTE is not being banned from selling handsets in the United States, the restriction could disrupt handset production if ZTE sources U.S.-made parts to manufacture its handsets, experts said. AT&T; declined to comment, and T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment. A ZTE website states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM (IBM.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are “key strategic partners.”  Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they were ZTE suppliers, but did not elaborate on specific products sold to the Chinese company or how sanctions would affect their businesses. Texas Instruments (TXN.O), which has also said it provides processors for the Chinese company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The impact of the new restrictions on these three companies was not immediately clear as most of them produce components both in the United States and overseas. Microsoft, in an emailed statement, said, “We follow U.S. law and will review new U.S. restrictions.” A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if ZTE purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. decision could even prompt suppliers to halt sales of non-U.S. components that are still allowed, said Kay Georgi, an export attorney at law firm Arent Fox LLP. “When you get placed on one of these lists nobody wants to do business with you at all,” Georgi said.  The United States has long banned the sale of U.S.-made technology products to Iran as part of its sanctions, even as China maintains close diplomatic, economic, trade and energy ties with Tehran. Last year, the United States and major world powers reached a deal with Iran to loosen economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. “We hope this sends a strong message to ZTE, to China, and to other Chinese telecommunications companies who present serious national security risks not only by evading export controls, but by purposefully compromising supply chain security,” said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee.

350,HON,UPDATE 3-United Tech looks for a big deal after rebuffing Honeywell,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), maker of jet engines, aircraft components and building systems, said it is open to doing a large acquisition despite rejecting a merger proposed by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N). “I wouldn’t be afraid to do a big deal,” Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said at an investor meeting on Thursday. But “it’s got to be something that’s actionable ... and the regulatory hurdles have to be manageable.” Hayes said there was appetite in UTC’s commercial businesses, including elevators, fire and security systems, and possibly its aerospace systems business, to make a sizable acquisition. UTC recently scotched an approach by Honeywell because the deal faced “very real” obstacles from regulators and customers, Hayes said. Without an acquisition, the company is poised for “huge growth” based in part on urbanization and rising disposable incomes in the developing world, he said. “We don’t need M&A; for growth,” Hayes said, noting the company was not looking to increase debt for a short-term stock gain. Asked if the company was concerned about pressure from activist investors following the Honeywell approach, Hayes pointed to two board appointments the company made in December: T. Rowe Price Group Inc Chairman Brian Rogers and Frederic Reynolds, former Chief Financial Officer of CBS.  “We brought these guys on because we needed the voice of the investor on the board,” Hayes said. UTC forecast compounded annual revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent through the end of the decade. Its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine division is poised for revenue growth in excess of 10 percent a year over that period. The investment in aerospace systems and Pratt has positioned those units for “nearly a trillion dollars in future business over next 25 years,” Hayes said, referring to sales. Pratt engines, both those already in service and those already sold, will account for $750 billion of the total, he said. The Otis elevator unit is aiming to boost growth, after recent years when efforts to widen profit margins cost it market share.  The company said it cut its forecast for heating, ventilation and air conditioning sales this year to low single-digit growth from mid single-digit growth, mainly due to slow sales in the Middle East. “The work there has come to pretty much of a halt due to what’s going on in the oil industry,” said Bob McDonough, president of the Climate, Controls and Security business.

353,HON,Honeywell names chief operating officer seen as CEO-in-waiting,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) on Monday named Darius Adamczyk as its first president and chief operating officer, a newly created role seen as a step toward designating a successor to Chief Executive Dave Cote, who has led the company for 14 years. Adamczyk, 50, a Polish immigrant who did not speak English when he arrived in the United States at age 11, earned degrees in electrical and computer engineering at Michigan State University and Syracuse University before earning an MBA at Harvard, Honeywell said. “Darius is an eight-year veteran of Honeywell and an accomplished executive with a strong track record in numerous Honeywell businesses,” Cote said in a statement. The heads of Honeywell’s businesses, which include aerospace, building controls and security and performance materials, will report to Adamczyk, who will report to Cote, the company said. The change is effective immediately. Adamczyk has run Honeywell divisions, including most recently its $9.3-billion performance materials unit, whose products range from refrigerants to oil refining technology, Honeywell said. Analysts praised the appointment but the stock was little changed at $112.86 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

377,HON,Honeywell to spin off its $1.3 billion resins and chemicals business,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace parts and climate control systems, said it would spin off its $1.3 billion resins and chemicals operations into a standalone company, as it focuses on higher-growth businesses. The new company, to be named AdvanSix Inc, will be spun off by early 2017, Honeywell said on Thursday. The resins and chemicals business is part of Honeywell’s advanced materials division, whose sales fell 10 percent to $3.51 billion in 2015. Sales of resins and chemicals fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials that are exposed to the rise or fall in oil prices. The decision to spin off the business comes two months after Honeywell scrapped its $90.7 billion offer to buy rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), citing the latter’s unwillingness to engage in talks. Honeywell has been focusing on higher-margin businesses such as its aerospace division, its biggest, which makes aircraft engines and parts. The aerospace business, whose customers include Boeing Co (BA.N) and Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), accounted for almost 40 percent of the company’s total revenue of $38.58 billion in 2015. The new company would be a leading producer of a polymer resin used to make engineered plastics, fibers and filaments used in automotive and electronic components, and food and industrial packaging, Honeywell said. The spun-off company will also make ammonium sulfate fertilizers and chemical intermediates, including phenol and acetone. Erin Kane, vice president of the resins and chemicals business, will be chief executive of the new company. Honeywell said it was maintaining its 2016 financial guidance for now. The company’s shares were up slightly at $114.39 in early trading. Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had risen about 10 percent this year.

382,HON,Honeywell won't rule out aerospace M&A; targets,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) would not rule out bidding for another major aerospace supplier, among other possible acquisition targets, after merger talks collapsed in March with rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), the company’s chief executive said on Monday.  CEO David Cote said in an interview that Honeywell has around 100 potential acquisition targets in the pipeline at any time that he regularly reviews, but stressed that he was not in a rush to make an acquisition. “I’ve got a pretty rigorous process for this,” he said on the sidelines of the International Economic Forum of the Americas conference in Montreal.  “When it comes to M&A; for us we still have a lot of money, which is a nice position to be in,” he said.  “If we can’t (do a good deal), I’m not going to get hung up on ‘I have to deploy the money’.” In March, Honeywell scrapped a $90.7 billion offer to buy United Technologies in a merger that would have created a behemoth with combined sales of almost $100 billion, citing UTC’s unwillingness to engage in negotiations. Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA), a major customer of both Honeywell and UTC, expressed concern that the merger would not be in its interests. Cote, 64, said the failed talks with UTC would not dissuade him from considering other aerospace companies. His greater concern is being disciplined on price.  “If you overpay, you’re dead,” he said.

391,HON,"Exclusive: Toyota Industries, Honeywell in bid to buy Intelligrated - sources","(Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Industries Corp (6201.T) is competing against U.S. diversified industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) to acquire U.S. distribution systems and logistics company Intelligrated Inc, people familiar with the matter said. The strong interest in the company follows German forklift truck maker Kion Group AG’s (KGX.DE) agreement last week to buy Intelligrated’s larger peer Dematic for $3.25 billion to expand into automated warehouses and supply chains that have ballooned with the growth of e-commerce. A deal for Intelligrated could come in days and value the privately held company at around $1.5 billion, including debt, the people said this week. There is no certainty, however, that any acquisition agreement will be reached, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Honeywell declined to comment. Toyota Industries and Intelligrated did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Intelligrated, based in Mason, Ohio, manufactures, services and installs high-speed automated material handling equipment in customer distribution centers that primarily serve online retailers. Private equity firm Permira Advisers LLC acquired Intelligrated in 2012 for more than $500 million from Gryphon Investors, another private equity firm. Reuters reported in March that Permira was working with Centerview Partners Holdings LLC and Nomura Co Ltd (9716.T) on an auction for Intelligrated. Due to increased online sales and demand for faster delivery times, the market for supply chain automation is expected to grow by 10 percent by 2019, Kion said in its presentation on the Dematic deal last week.

392,HON,Singapore's Temasek eyes U.S. investments to offset first portfolio drop in 7 years,"* Temasek to report annual results later this week * Temasek portfolio expected to show first drop in value in 7 yrs * Portfolio hit by drop in StanChart value, China slowdown * U.S. focus on health, tech and consumer segments-sources By Anshuman Daga and Saeed Azhar SINGAPORE, July 4 (Reuters) - Singapore sovereign investor Temasek is set to pounce on U.S. deals and look for co-investments with private equity partners to offset its first annual decline in the value of its assets in seven years, bankers and people familiar with the strategy said. Temasek, one of Asia’s most active state investors, has seen its nearly 16 percent stake in London-based Standard Chartered  drop 55 percent in value over the past financial year while its Asian investments have been hit by China’s economic slowdown. The 10 percent drop in sterling against the Singapore dollar that followed Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has also depressed the value of the Standard Chartered stake. Temasek said it will offer details of its performance when it reports results this week, as well as give some indication as to where it sees future investment opportunities. The investor promoted former M&A; lawyer Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara as president of its international business and head of its Americas team on May 1 with a view to accelerate its investment in that region, especially in technology, consumer and healthcare, the people familiar with Temasek’s strategy told Reuters.. Since the appointment, Dhilan has been actively meeting companies in Silicon Valley, where he is spending a considerable part of his time every month, the people said. “Dilhan is a very smart guy, I am sure he will hire some people and build a team,” said a senior banker, who works closely with Temasek. “They have a lot of dry powder that can be deployed.” Temasek doesn’t disclose its net cash position. Last month, Temasek formed an advisory group comprising executives from global firms such as PepsiCo and Honeywell International as it seeks U.S. investments. Singaporean and Chinese firms make up over half of Temasek’s S$266 billion ($197 billion) portfolio. Enrico Soddu, head of data and research at the Sovereign Wealth Centre in London, expects the value of the portfolio to have fallen by 5-10 percent from a year earlier, mainly hit by China. This would be the first decline since 2009. The portfolio rose by nearly a fifth in the year ended March 2015. Temasek has done few big deals in the West in recent years. It was stung by an investment into Bank of America-Merrill Lynch  in the run up to the global financial crisis, an investment that proved loss-making. This year, it sold its $1.6 billion stake in shipping firm Neptune Orient Lines and last month pared its stake in China Construction Bank. It also invested in Alibaba  and Korea’s Homeplus. But it failed to beat its own internal benchmark called ‘Wealth added’ in five of the last eight financial years. Temasek’s returns have fallen below its risk-adjusted hurdle in five of the last, as per its last annual report. “They are certainly recognising that they need more experience and more skill sets to invest in developed markets,” said Soddu. Ten companies, including Singapore Telecommunications , DBS Group and China Construction Bank, account for half of Temasek’s assets. Temasek, the biggest shareholder in Standard Chartered , is willing to give the bank’s management more time on its turnaround before taking a decision on the stake, people familiar with the matter said.

395,HON,Honeywell cuts 2016 sales forecast on weak aerospace demand,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) lowered its 2016 sales forecast after weak demand in the second quarter led to an unexpected drop in revenue at its aerospace division. The company also said Britain’s vote to leave European Union could weigh on economic growth in both regions long term and that it would “stay conservative” in terms of investments in the region that accounted for 22 percent of its 2015 sales. Honeywell's shares dropped as much as 5 percent on Friday and were the third-biggest drag on the benchmark S&P; 500 index .SPX. Sales in the aerospace division, Honeywell’s second-biggest revenue contributor, fell 1 percent in the quarter, while the company had expected sales to range from being flat to up 1 percent. Honeywell said it had to pay higher incentives to commercial planemakers to select its equipment and that it was also hurt by low demand for business jets as also for helicopters due to weak energy markets. “We saw this quarter the demand environment in business jet is lower than we anticipated and we expect this trend to continue in the second half (of 2016),” Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said on an analyst call. Honeywell’s revenue rose 2.2 percent to nearly $10 billion, but was shy of analysts’ estimates of $10.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It lowered it 2016 sales forecast to $40.0-$40.6 billion from $40.3-$40.9 billion. Honeywell’s weak aerospace sales meant the division, which makes cockpit and navigation systems among other parts, for the first time lost its rank as the top contributor to sales to the automation and control solutions (ACS) business. Sales in the ACS business, which makes industrial safety products and controls for heating and cooling systems, rose 9 percent, helped by acquisitions. The division contributed for 39 percent of second-quarter revenue, one percentage point more than the aerospace business. Honeywell said it would realign the ACS business into two new divisions – home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions – to better organize the business after the acquisitions. Net income attributable to Honeywell rose 7.4 percent to $1.28 billion, or $1.66 per share, in the second quarter. That beat analysts’ estimates of $1.64 per share. Honeywell bumped up the bottom end of its full-year earnings forecast to $6.60 per share from $6.55. It kept the top end at $6.70 per share.

GE, long considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, dropped 2.1 percent after its earnings report, while Honeywell fell 3.8 percent after lowering its full-year sales forecast. GE was the biggest loser on the Dow and the top drag on the S&P; 500. It led the industrials sector down 0.8 percent. Boeing and Caterpillar fell 1 percent. “The markets are biding time to see what the next set of earnings bring,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. The weak results in the industrial sector was a “concern” and is a theme that markets could start to jump on, Bakhos said. At 10:58 a.m. ET (1458 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.75 points, or 0.04 percent, at 18,523.98. The S&P; 500 was up 4.49 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,169.66. The Nasdaq Composite was up 15.89 points, or 0.31 percent, at 5,089.80. Eight of the 10 major S&P; indexes were higher, led by the telecoms sector’s 1.6 percent gain. AT&T; was up 1 percent following its in-line results overnight. Verizon was up 1.3 percent. The company is the front-runner for Yahoo’s core business after outbidding others including AT&T;, Reuters reported. Yahoo was up nearly 1 percent. The S&P; 500 and Dow are trading at record highs on upbeat sentiment over second-quarter corporate earnings, with analysts now expecting smaller profit declines and more companies topping those estimates. The S&P; and the Nasdaq are on pace to mark their fourth-straight week of gains, while the Dow its third week. Overall, analysts now expect earnings of S&P; 500 companies to decline 3.3 percent in the quarter, less than the 5 percent drop estimated at the start of the earnings season. Of the 103 S&P; 500 companies that have reported as of Thursday, 67 percent have beaten estimates, slightly higher than the 63 percent over the whole of a typical quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,651 to 1,129. On the Nasdaq, 1,568 issues rose and 1,006 fell.

407,HON,Areva restructuring takes shape with assets transfer to NewCo,"PARIS (Reuters) - French nuclear group Areva AREVA.PA said on Tuesday it had formally started the process to transfer its nuclear fuel cycle activities to a new company. The move follows a decision last year to reorganize the company hit by low demand for nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in Japan 2011.  As part of a restructuring, under which 87 percent state-owned Areva will sell its nuclear reactor unit to utility EDF (EDF.PA), Areva was expected to transfer its uranium mining, nuclear fuel production and decommissioning activities into a new company, provisionally named NewCo. Areva said in a statement that it will convene an extraordinary general meeting on Nov. 3 to approve the draft partial transfer agreement, adding that it was valuing the NewCo post-transfer at 2 billion euros ($2.23 billion).    Areva said it will also convene a meeting with Areva bondholders on Sept. 19 to approve the proposed partial transfer of assets from AREVA SA to the NewCo and the simultaneous transfer of the bond debt. The company confirmed a planned capital increase of 5 billion euros, divided into 2 billion euros for AREVA and 3 billion euros for the NewCo, in line with financing requirements of the two companies. “Discussions with third party investors have progressed in recent weeks and several expressions of interest have been made,” it said.  If the plans are approved by European regulators and implemented, France will hold at least two-third of NewCo’s capital either directly or through AREVA alongside third-party investors, while AREVA will hold a minority stake. With 3 billion euros capital increase, NewCo will focus on more profitable activities, deploy its strategy, while bearing bond maturities before seeking to finance its business on the markets in the medium term, Areva said. “The group has updated NewCo’s mid-term financial outlook,” it said. “The profitability level target for 2020 is now between 22 percent and 25 percent for the EBITDA / revenue margin, and over 8 percent for operating income / revenue margin.”  ($1 = 0.8977 euro) ",8302016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-areva-restructuring-newco/areva-restructuring-takes-shape-with-assets-transfer-to-newco-idUSKCN1152Q5

413,HON,Honeywell lowers upper end of 2016 profit forecast,"(Reuters) - Aero parts supplier Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) lowered the upper end of its 2016 sales and profit forecast range, partly due to fewer business jet and general aviation shipments in its aerospace division. Honeywell’s shares were down 4.5 percent at $110.40 in extended trading on Thursday. The company, which makes parts for Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), Textron Inc (TXT.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) business jets, said in July that demand would remain weak in the second half of 2016. Honeywell had to pay higher incentives to commercial planemakers in the second quarter to select its equipment. The company was also hurt by lower demand for helicopters due to weak energy markets. The company said on Thursday it also experienced continued program delays in its defense and space division, part of its aerospace business, its biggest unit.     Honeywell expects 2016 earnings per share of $6.60-$6.64, down from its previous forecast of $6.60-$6.70.  Honeywell’s core organic sales are now expected to be down 1-2 percent for 2016, compared with a 1 percent decline it had estimated previously. Honeywell said the revised forecast also reflected the separation of its automation and control solutions business into two new reporting segments - home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions – and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The company also said it had recast results for the first and second quarter to reflect the adoption of new accounting standards for stock compensation, ahead of the mandatory effective date in 2017. The company has recorded tax benefits of 3 cents in the first quarter and 4 cents in the second quarter. Honeywell said that benefits from the accounting change and sale of the Honeywell Technology Solutions government services business will used to fund restructuring and other charges in the third quarter.

430,HON,"UPDATE 1-Chinese, Japanese, Kazakh firms in talks about Areva stake -source","PARIS (Reuters) - Chinese, Kazakh and Japanese firms are in talks to invest in Areva AREVA.PA, according to a French government source, a partnership deal that could help persuade regulators that a rescue plan for the nuclear group is not illegal state aid. The source said talks are set to end in two to three weeks.  A second industrial source said that once the partnership investment deal is sealed, the European Commission will be ready to approve Areva’s government-led restructuring by the end of December ahead of a planned 5 billion euro ($5.4 billion) mainly state-funded capital increase early next year.  French online news website BFM Business, citing sources close to the group, reported on Tuesday that China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and Kazakhstan’s Kazatomprom were each set to buy an 11 percent stake in Areva. Japan’s MHI is a long-time Areva industrial partner with whom Areva is developing a new reactor model. Kazatomprom is a major uranium miner, with which Areva has a mining joint venture, while CNNC also has partnerships with Areva under which it may build a nuclear fuel recycling plant in China.  BFM reported that the three foreign investors would inject 400 million euros each, that they would be able to chose board members, and that the French government’s stake in Areva would fall to 67 percent. Areva declined to comment on the BFM Business report.      CNNC, Mitsubishi and Kazatomprom were not immediately available for comment. The three-way investment would be for a one-third stake in Areva “NewCo”, the as yet unnamed uranium mining and nuclear fuel business of Areva, which will be split off when the rest of the firm is absorbed by EDF (EDF.PA), the state power utility, under the rescue plan.  A major global player in the nuclear fuel industry, NewCo is set to get three billion euros of the five billion euro capital injection in order to repay debt and restore equity wiped out by years of losses. The nuclear reactor building unit of the virtually bankrupt state-owned group, Areva NP, will be bought by fellow state-owned utility EDF for 2.5 billion euros, which signed a binding takeover deal last week. A third part of Areva - Areva SA - will get a 2 billion euro capital increase and will hold the troubled Olkiluoto reactor construction project in Finland and other legacy activities that are earmarked for sale, including Areva’s 50 percent state in Areva-Gamesa GAM.MC offshore wind joint venture Adwen, and Areva’s military nuclear business.  BFM Business also reported that the state, which owns 87 percent of Areva, would buy out Areva’s current minority shareholders. They include the Kuwait Investment Authority (which holds 4.82 percent), EDF (2.24 percent), Areva staff (1.23 percent) and oil group Total (0.95 percent), according to ThomsonReuters data. Then the company would be delisted. Once the three foreign investors sign the deal to buy their one-third stake in Newco, the European Commission is expected to give the green light for Areva’s restructuring and capital increase in which the French state will contribute the lion’s share.  Without the participation of third-party investors in the capital increase, the European Commission would qualify the injection of French state funds as illegal state aid. A source familiar with the situation said the government hopes to get EU clearance for the deal at the latest before Christmas. Areva chairman Philippe Varin is set to address a French parliament committee hearing on Wednesday.

431,HON,Honeywell forecasts 2017 organic sales growth of 1-3 percent,"(Reuters) - Aerospace parts maker Honeywell International Inc on Friday forecast 2017 organic sales growth rate to improve for the first time in three years, partly helped by the stabilizing oil and gas market. The company’s shares, which fell as much as 2.4 percent in morning trading, pared losses and were up nearly 1 percent in the afternoon. Honeywell — which makes parts for business-jet makers Bombardier Inc, Textron Inc and General Dynamics Corp — said a higher tax rate in the current quarter led to fourth-quarter earnings being forecast at the lowest end of its previous range. The company expects 2017 organic sales to grow in a range of 1-3 percent. The growth rate was up 3 percent in 2014, 1 percent in 2015 and is expected to be down 1-2 percent in 2016. Honeywell forecast higher overall demand in 2017, particularly in the oil and gas market and high-growth regions including China and India. Oil prices have rise nearly 48 percent this year to about $55 a barrel, boosted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ decision to curb oil output.  “In oil and gas, we’re seeing more positive sentiment from our customers and signs of a slight recovery...which is freeing up projects that had been delayed,” CFO Thomas Szlosek, said on a conference call. The Morris Plains, New Jersey-based company gets about 12-14 percent of its revenue from the oil and gas industry. Honeywell said organic sales at its performance materials and technologies unit, which makes catalysts and adsorbents used in petroleum refining, are expected to be up 2-4 percent in 2017. The diversified industrial conglomerate’s revenue has been hurt in 2016 due to lower capital spending by oil and gas customers and slowing business jet sales.  The company said on Friday it expects the business jet market to remain weak in 2017, but expected higher defense spending by the United States. Honeywell’s sales in the overall aerospace business, its biggest, are expected to be down 1-4 percent at $14.2 billion-$14.6 billion in 2017. The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings of about $1.74 per share, compared with its previous forecast of $1.74-$1.78. Honeywell forecast 2017 earnings per share of $6.85-$7.10, compared with the average analysts’ estimate of $7.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Up to Thursday’s close, Honeywell’s stock had risen about 13 percent this year, compared with a 10.2 percent rise in the S&P; 500 index.

433,HON,UPDATE 2-France to buy out Areva shareholders in bid for nuclear fix,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will buy out minority shareholders in Areva AREVA.PA  and delist the troubled nuclear group, the government said on Wednesday as talks with potential investors in a new nuclear fuel company being spun out of Areva neared a conclusion. The state, which owns 87 percent of Areva, said it would offer 4.5 euros per Areva SA share to minority investors which include Kuwait’s investment fund, French utility EDF (EDF.PA) and French energy group Total (TOTF.PA). Areva’s shares have fallen by as much as 90 percent from their 2007 highs as the group chalked up repeated losses. The stock was suspended on Tuesday at 5.2 euros. European Union antitrust regulators approved the French government’s plan to inject 4.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) into Areva on Tuesday, saying the rescue would not unduly distort competition. The ruling will allow Areva, whose capital has been wiped out by years of losses, to restart as a smaller firm focused on uranium mining and nuclear fuel production and recycling. Legacy Areva SA - the firm left over after this split and the sale of Areva’s reactor unit to state-controlled EDF - will get a 2 billion euro capital increase and will hold the liabilities related to the troubled Olkiluoto 3 project in Finland, which has been hit by delays. Areva said negotiations with unspecified investors in the new company were being finalised. It said last month that two investors have made a 500 million euro ($526.40 million) offer for a combined 10 percent stake in the new entity. A source familiar with the situation said the two investors are Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and JNFL. Talks are continuing with China’s National Nuclear Corporation about also taking a minority stake. “These talks are continuing and focus on governance issues, and on the issue of the balance between the different third-party investor parties,” French Industry Minister Christophe Sirugue told Reuters in an interview.  Sirugue, who said he had discussed the governance issue with Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai during his visit to France in November, added that the make-up of the board of the new company is another important issue in the talks.

476,HON,Dan Loeb’s Honeywell spin goes too far,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Daniel Loeb may be spinning his Honeywell International story a bit too far. The activist investor wants the $100 billion conglomerate to hive off its aerospace unit. That could be an option, but Loeb’s pitch that it would boost shareholder value by $20 billion is a stretch. Aerospace is Honeywell’s largest business, accounting for around 37 percent of the company’s $39 billion of revenue last year. But the unit’s sales have on average grown at just 0.6 percent annually over the past five years, according to Credit Suisse. Loeb says this is why Honeywell trades at 18.5 times estimated earnings for 2017 compared with an average 23 times at Emerson Electric, 3M and three other airplane-less rivals. That group includes two companies – Emerson and Rockwell Automation – with similar operating margins and faster growth than Honeywell’s other businesses and three with similar core-business growth but stronger profitability, namely Fortive, Illinois Tool Works and 3M. To fit in either one, Honeywell would need to improve the 17 percent margin it would have made without aerospace last year, boost growth, or improbably do both. Offloading aerospace could cost Honeywell, too. The unit’s margin exceeded 20 percent in 2016. And it provides most of the $4 billion or so in U.S. cash the company needs each year for dividends, buybacks, interest payments and the like. Much of its other cash is trapped overseas, Jefferies reckons – at least for now. New Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk is already targeting a 23 percent operating margin, though not immediately. He also intends to spend up to $18 billion on dividends, buybacks and M&A; over three years. He’ll sell businesses, too. One could be the low-margin engines-focused automotive group, which provides a fifth of the aerospace division’s top line – akin to car-parts maker Delphi’s decision this week to spin off its powertrain unit. All this is more focused than predecessor David Cote’s tilt last year at United Technologies, then worth over $70 billion. Honeywell may eventually set its aerospace unit free. But spinoffs can be costly and distracting and, for best results, Adamczyk anyway needs to refresh the company’s core businesses. Maybe the 10 percent jump in Delphi’s stock is as much of a gain as Loeb can reasonably expect – and he might get it more sustainably from the CEO’s efforts to clean house than a flashy spinoff.",5052017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-honeywell-intl-thirdpoint-breakingvie/dan-loebs-honeywell-spin-goes-too-far-idUSKBN1811XR

488,HON,Poorly understood Mars landing conditions led to probe’s demise - report,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Europe’s Schiaparelli spacecraft came very close to a successful landing on Mars last year, but engineers failed to realize how jarring the probe’s parachute descent could be, dooming the touchdown, a report released on Wednesday said. Schiaparelli flew to Mars with the Trace Gas Orbiter, which is studying gases in the planet’s atmosphere from orbit. The lander crashed during an attempted touchdown on Oct. 19. Its parachute worked as designed, but atmospheric forces at supersonic speed were not well understood, the report, commissioned by the European Space Agency, said. “The software behaved the way it was supposed to,” David Parker, ESA head of robotic exploration said in an interview. “It should have been anticipated that the (spacecraft) rotation could reach the maximum. The software could have been more robust had it been more cleverly designed.” Miscommunication between contractors Thales Alenia Space and Honeywell contributed to the problem, Parker said, adding that the ESA took full responsibility. The agency will apply the lessons learned for the follow-on ExoMars rover life-detection mission, scheduled to launch in 2020. Contributing to Schiaparelli’s botched landing was the lack of a backup avionics system, a decision made to save money and meet a March 2016 launch date, the report said. “Schiaparelli... was very close to land(ing) successfully on Mars at the planned location,” the report said. However, a powerful spin for a fraction of a second overloaded the spacecraft’s sensors, leading to the false conclusion that it had reached the ground. As a result, Schiaparelli shed its parachute early, briefly fired its landing thrusters and hit the ground at 336 mph (540 kph). The crash left a visible crater that was later photographed by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The accident investigation team’s recommendations include asking NASA, which has successfully landed spacecraft on Mars seven times, to validate the computer models being used to plan the ExoMars rover’s entry and descent to the planet’s surface in 2021.

Honeywell said in May it would decide by this fall whether to separate the business, its biggest with $14.75 billion in 2016 sales, which makes auxiliary power units and engines for aircraft. “The business has actually performed pretty well,” said Cote in an interview on the sidelines of the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal.  “And if you take a look at margin improvement and you take a look at the wins that we’ve had over a long period of time since 2013.

Cote, Honeywell’s former CEO, also said that while he would have preferred that the United States not leave the 2015 global Paris agreement to fight climate change, he did not believe the move was “catastrophic.”  While the decision would erode the ability of the United States to influence other countries, it will not stop America from achieving its own emissions reductions goals, in part because of the conversion from coal to natural gas use for power generation, he said.

Honeywell said in May it would decide by this fall whether to separate the aerospace business, which makes auxiliary power units and engines for aircraft. “The business has actually performed pretty well,” said Cote in an interview on the sidelines of the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal. “And if you take a look at margin improvement and you take a look at the wins that we’ve had over a long period of time since 2013. We’ve invested very heavily in that business.” Hedge fund investor Third Point LLC has argued in favor of the spinoff, which it said could create more than $20 billion in shareholder value. The business is Honeywell’s biggest, generating $14.75 billion in sales last year.

497,HON,Bidders for Toshiba's Landis+Gyr narrows to two - sources,"LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The field of prospective bidders for Japanese conglomerate Toshiba Corp.’s (6502.T) Swiss-based smart meter group Landis+Gyr has narrowed to two, three banking sources said on Monday. The two - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (GS.N) private equity arm and Canada’s Onex Corp (ONEX.TO) - are undertaking due diligence checks, the sources said. A consortium of buyout firm CVC Capital Partners and Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) had withdrawn its offer, as had Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), the sources said. A first round of bids for Landis+Gyr, for which bankers are preparing debt packages of around $1 billion or 5-6 times its $200 million EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), closed in May and binding offers are expected in July. Goldman Sachs and Landis+Gyr declined to comment. CVC declined to comment, while Hitachi and Onex were not immediately available for comment.  Toshiba is also preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of Landis if final bids fall short of its expectations, as the Japanese company scrambles to raise funds to cover massive losses at U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.     Toshiba hired UBS this year for the deal and later added Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan to help with the potential IPO. CVC and Hitachi, whose initial preemptive offer of almost $2 billion to buy Landis+Gyr was declined, as well as Honeywell decided not to pursue deals due to the likely valuation and the prospects of a listing, the sources said. One of the sources said the company was aiming for offers 12 times EBITDA, which deterred many bidders. There has been a wave of M&A; activity in the metering industry. CVC is selling German metering and energy management group Ista, which could be worth up to 4.5 billion euros, while German metering group Techem could be put up for sale this year. Toshiba bought Landis+Gyr in 2011 for $2.3 billion jointly with state-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, which holds the remaining 40 percent in the company. Landis+Gyr, in which Toshiba has a 60 percent stake, employs more than 5,700 staff and is active in over 30 countries.

The company’s shares rose as much as 1.8 percent to a record high of $137.37.  Sales in Honeywell’s aerospace business, which activist investor Daniel Loeb wants to be spun off, fell about 3 percent to $3.67 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, but the drop was much smaller than the company’s forecast of 5 to 7 percent.  The unit, which makes jet engines and provides spare parts, repair, overhaul and maintenance services, benefited from strength in its commercial aviation after-sales business and growth in U.S. defense volumes, the company said. Honeywell is reviewing Loeb’s demand and the company is expected to announce a decision by early fall. Loeb, who runs hedge fund Third Point LLC, has said a spin off could create more than $20 billion in shareholder value.    Meanwhile, Honeywell said it was looking to scale up its smaller businesses.The company may look at M&A; opportunities to boost its performance materials and technologies (PMT) business and safety and productivity solutions (SPS) unit, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Szlosek told Reuters. “Our most prominent (M&A;) opportunities are in PMT and in safety and productivity solutions.”  Szlosek said the recent Intelligrated deal could be a platform to embark on a whole new path of M&A; around the supply chain, logistics and freight management. The company acquired Intelligrated Inc, which installs automated material handling equipment in fulfillment centers and warehouses that serve online retailers, for $1.5 billion.   Sales in Honeywell’s PMT unit, which makes catalysts and adsorbents used for petroleum refining, dropped about 8 percent to $2.24 billion in the quarter. Honeywell had forecast a decline of 10 percent to 12 percent.     The unit benefited from higher sales of Solstice low global-warming potential refrigerant products.  Honeywell also raised the low end of its 2017 earnings per share forecast by 10 cents to $7.00, keeping the high end unchanged at $7.10. It now expects sales of $39.3 billion to $40 billion, up from its previous forecast of $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion.

519,HON,ATR challenges Pratt's hold on turboprop engine market,"PARIS (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney’s (UTX.N) grip on the regional turboprop market could come under threat after Europe’s ATR said it would look closely at alternative engines for its planes in future. Christian Scherer, who took over as chief executive of the world’s largest maker of civil turboprops last year, told Reuters on Wednesday he would open the door to other potential suppliers as soon as he could. Pratt, which is struggling to reassert itself in the passenger jet market, enjoys an effective monopoly in the market for smaller regional turboprops via its Canadian subsidiary. ATR and Canada’s Bombardier (BBDb.TO) dominate the market of about 100 aircraft a year and both exclusively use PW&C; engines. The most obvious beneficiary from any decision by ATR to switch engine suppliers would be General Electric (GE.N) which is developing an “Advanced Turboprop”, so far aimed at the business and general aviation markets. Planemakers and airlines typically prefer competition in the engine market in order to drive down the prices for engines and the all-important aftermarket services. Although China is vying to enter the turboprop market with its Xian MA700 aircraft, even this is being developed with engines from PW&C;, underlining the U.S. firm’s strong position. Scherer praised Pratt & Whitney Canada professionalism, but said he was concerned about its “monopolistic” position, adding he would seek to stimulate competition “at the next available opportunity”. “I don’t say we won’t continue with Pratt, but I will use the next opening I can to weaken the over-powerful position of a number of our suppliers,” Scherer said. Pratt & Whitney Canada was not immediately available for comment. Industry sources said Scherer has reviewed suppliers and recently replaced Honeywell (HON.N) as supplier of an air conditioning system in favor of Toulouse-based Liebherr Aerospace. Any change in engine supplier would not take place immediately. Franco-Italian ATR is pondering whether to update its family of two aircraft types with new engines and other improvements or go further and invest in an entirely new design. But no decision is imminent as its shareholders - Airbus (AIR.PA) and Leonardo -(LDOF.MI) can’t agree on whether to put up the roughly $3 billion needed to develop a new turboprop.

520,HON,China-Russia wide-body C929 jet to rely on western suppliers for systems,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s planned wide-body jet joint venture with Russia will see a higher proportion of work from Chinese suppliers, though for key systems like avionics it will still rely mostly on western manufacturers, the jet’s chief designer said. China has been plowing billions of dollars into developing jets to raise its profile in global aviation and to disrupt the current Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus SE (AIR.PA) duopoly, most recently with its C919 narrrowbody aircraft. It has also been vocal about wanting to support local industry. “Western suppliers need not be too worried,” said Chen Yingchun, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China’s (COMAC’s) chief designer for the C929 wide-body program with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp.  There will be more Chinese contribution to the C929 project, compared with the C919, “but all systems, like signaling, won’t be affected”, Chen said on the sidelines of an aviation conference in Beijing on Wednesday. Overseas suppliers like Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and Safran SA (SAF.PA) were instrumental in the making of China’s C919 jet. The plane took its maiden flight in May and 730 orders have been placed to date, mostly by Chinese parties. In the same month, the C929 wide-body joint venture (JV) was set up with am aim to eventually take 10 percent of the global market dominated by the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.  The JV partners are currently in the “joint concept design” stage for the C929 and are figuring out how to balance the work share, Chen said. China, at present, is responsible for the plane’s body and tail, he added.   The project is on track to seek bids for the engine by year-end, he said. Rolls Royce (RR.L) and General Electric (GE.N), who also supply wide-body jets, are expected to be contenders, but China is also trying to develop its own version with Russia. Chen also said the JV was looking to build half of the C929 using composite materials, versus C919’s 10 percent, and that talks were underway with European, U.S. and Chinese suppliers who were willing to set up facilities close to COMAC’s Shanghai headquarters to do so. The JV partners aim to complete the C929’s maiden flight and first delivery over 2025-2028.  COMAC’s first two passenger plane projects, the ARJ21 and C919, were, however, far behind schedule with the ARJ21 entering service last year, eight years after it took its first flight.

535,HON,Exclusive: Honeywell prepares to spin off businesses - sources,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) plans to spin off non-core assets and create at least two new publicly listed companies, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate seeks to streamline its business, according to people familiar with the matter. The move would represent the first major shakeup at the Morris Plains, New Jersey-based company since Darius Adamczyk succeeded David Cote as chief executive in April. It comes after Honeywell said in September it would raise its annual dividend by 12 percent. The sources said on Sunday that while Honeywell would defy calls by one of its shareholders, activist hedge fund Third Point LLC, to spin off its aerospace division, it would still seek to carve out assets worth several billions of dollars. Honeywell is considering placing its turbochargers business, which produces components that improve the performance and efficiency of cars and trucks, into one of the newly created companies, the sources said. Honeywell lists turbochargers as part of its aerospace business. The sources did not disclose which other assets Honeywell was looking to spin off and asked not to be identified because the deliberations were confidential. Honeywell is hoping to unveil the spinoff plan as early as this week, though the announcement could be delayed, the sources added. Honeywell, which has a market capitalization of $109 billion, declined to comment. Honeywell’s businesses include energy efficient products and solutions for homes, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials, and sensing, safety and security technologies for buildings, homes and industries. Third Point has argued that Honeywell is undervalued compared to peers in industrial automation, and that spinning off the entire aerospace business would create $20 billion in shareholder value. Honeywell’s aerospace business, its biggest, also makes auxiliary power units and engines for aircraft manufactured by companies such as Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), Textron Inc (TXT.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N). Last year, Honeywell approached peer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) to discuss a potential combination but was rebuffed. Last month, United Technologies struck a $30 billion agreement to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N). Analysts have said this deal positions United Technologies to also spin off assets down the line, though no such deal has been announced.

536,HON,Honeywell sees steady business jet sales over 10 years,"(Reuters) - The business jet market is expected to get a tailwind from the global economy’s steady pace of growth and as Corporate America upgrades to newer aircraft. Aero parts maker Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) said on Sunday that it expected deliveries of 8,300 aircraft worth about $249 billion between 2017 and 2027, assuming that the world economy grows at 3.1 percent on average over the next 10 years. The company said starting in 2019, business jet sales are likely to see a steady growth of 3 to 4 percent for about eight to nine years.  However, Honeywell said it expected 2017 deliveries to fall by about 30 aircraft, compared with a year earlier.     Business jet shipments have struggled to recover after the financial crisis, having been cut in half from their peak of 1,317 in 2008 to 661 in 2016, according to General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Aircraft sales fell in 2016 as economies sputtered, companies slashed their spending and oil tycoons retrenched due to weak oil prices.     Honeywell said it was expecting much of the growth in business jet sales in the coming decade to be fueled by introduction of new aircraft. “There are several new and exciting aircraft models coming to market, which will drive solid growth in new business jet purchases in the midterm and long term,” said Ben Driggs, president, Americas aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace.  More than 60 percent of business jet sales are replacement aircraft for current owners. The company said business jet operators continued to focus on larger-cabin aircraft - ranging from the super mid-size through ultralong range - which are expected to account for more than 85 percent of new business jet sales in the next five years.

538,HON,"Honeywell seeks M&A; as it keeps aero, spins off two units","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc said Tuesday it will pare its focus to four business lines, including aerospace, and spin off two businesses with $7.5 billion in revenue to help fund acquisitions. The reorganization, which reduces revenue by about 18 percent, will simplify Honeywell’s broad portfolio, boost growth and give shareholders a tax-free benefit from the new companies, Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk said on a conference call on Tuesday. It also gives the diversified manufacturer scope to change its remaining portfolio along the lines sought by hedge fund Third Point Capital, which agitated for a spin-off of aerospace. Third Point said on Tuesday it was pleased with the changes and backed Adamczyk’s leadership, though it wants him to keep improving the portfolio. Adamczyk hinted at more to come, saying the two new businesses “can grow at an accelerated rate.” The remaining businesses - aerospace, commercial building products, performance materials and safety products - are candidates for more acquisitions, he added. “I’m very excited about M&A; in all four of our businesses. And I think these two spins ... give me a lot of different levers to invest our M&A; dollars.” Analysts praised the moves, but said Honeywell had more changes to make, and warned that aerospace, with products ranging from jet engines to airplane WiFi systems, may need to merge to gain the size to compete with larger rivals. A spin-off or merger with General Electric Co’s aerospace unit would make Honeywell a stronger competitor to United Technologies and a “more powerful supplier to Boeing Co and Airbus SE,” Scott Davis, analyst at Melius Research, wrote in a note. “That’s a deal worth thinking about.” Adamczyk played down such speculation in a later interview with Reuters. “The way we compete in aerospace is not through scale,” he said. “We are going to compete through technology differentiation.” Though his comments pointed away from a big deal, Honeywell sought to gain size last year with a $90.7-billion bid for United Technologies Corp under prior CEO David Cote. Industry experts say Honeywell’s poor record on aerospace parts quality and delivery could hamper its ability to win new orders. Honeywell shares ended the day down 0.2 percent in New York trading, after falling 2.3 percent initially. Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to reorder a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry. Third Point had argued since April that a spin-off of aerospace, which accounted for about 38 percent of revenue in 2016, could generate $20 billion in shareholder value. But Adamczyk took a different route, splitting off the home and ADI global distribution businesses, wholesale distributors of security, fire and environmental systems for homes and commercial buildings, into a public company that will absorb some of $554 million in environmental liabilities.  Honeywell will also spin off a transportation business that makes automotive turbo chargers into a second company that will absorb some of $1.54 billion in old asbestos liabilities. The amounts will be determined later, Adamczyk said. The auto parts move follows other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, that are shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades. With about $16 billion in debt, or 2.5 times operating earnings, Honeywell has limited scope for additional borrowing, said Dave Berge, analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. Honeywell expects to receive about $3 billion in dividends from the spin-offs, adding to its nearly $10 billion in cash.  That “positions the company to do meaningful acquisitions,” said Harsh Acharya, analyst at Diamond Hill Capital Management Inc in Ohio.  The spin-offs are not due to close until the end of 2018, giving time to work out details - and, as Adamczyk noted, to consider other offers. “We are leaning towards the spin route,” he told Reuters. “But if we get compelling offers, we would of course consider them.” ",10102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-honeywell-intl-aerospace/honeywell-seeks-ma-as-it-keeps-aero-spins-off-two-units-idUSKBN1CF0CO

Wal-Mart rose 3.8 percent after the retail giant unveiled the buyback plan and forecast U.S. online sales would rise by about 40 percent in next fiscal year. Oil prices gained more than 1 percent, supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply. All the 11 major S&P; indexes were higher. The S&P; energy index gained 0.85 percent, while Wal-Mart led the consumer staples index 1.16 percent higher. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 50.31 points, or 0.22 percent, at 22,811.38, the S&P; 500 was up 6.6 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,551.33 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 22.53 points, or 0.34 percent, at 6,602.26. The gains come after two rather tepid days that slowed the rally in stocks this year that was driven by strong corporate earnings, hopes of tax cuts and looser regulations. But the rally has led to elevated valuations, which investors will look to justify through corporate profits in the upcoming third-quarter earnings season. Earnings at S&P; 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.8 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year. BlackRock and Delta Air Lines will kick off the earnings season on Wednesday, but the focus this week will be on big banks, with JPMorgan and Citigroup scheduled to report on Thursday. “I think it will be a good earnings season,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. “It will be focused on individual stocks as opposed to earnings season as a whole.” Nvidia rose more than 3 percent after the chipmaker unveiled the first computer chips for developing fully autonomous vehicles. Eli Lilly fell nearly 2 percent after its drug to treat non-small cell lung cancer failed in a late-stage study. Honeywell fell 1.25 percent after the manufacturer unveiled a corporate makeover that will tie its growth more strongly to aerospace technology and spin off other businesses as two publicly-traded companies. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,018 to 495. On the Nasdaq, 1,725 issues rose and 632 fell.

Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, is under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry. The company said on Monday that it will deliver results of a “comprehensive portfolio review” on Tuesday morning before New York markets open. Honeywell is expected to announce spinoffs of certain assets to focus on aerospace technology from jet engines to advanced aircraft connectivity equipment and services. That business should benefit from growing commercial and military production and rising demand for connected aircraft services, analysts and industry consultants said. Honeywell, with $39 billion in sales last year, has four major business units: aerospace, home and building technologies, performance materials and safety and productivity products. Each is a mini-conglomerate. The safety and productivity business, for example, encompasses warehouse automation systems and the Muck Boots brand of footwear. Among the expected moves is a spinoff of Honeywell’s low-margin automotive turbocharger business. Honeywell would join other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades. By retaining its aerospace businesses, Honeywell would be defying Third Point’s calls to spin off that division, which accounted for about 36 percent of total revenue in 2016. The company must persuade investors that unit is the best part to keep. It delivers 20 profit margins before interest and tax, and 4 percent revenue growth, relatively high for aerospace suppliers. Third Point and Honeywell declined to comment. Honeywell has set a target of lifting the margin in its aerospace business to about 25 percent in coming years. “Their challenge is to grow margins from an incredibly high level to a zone where no one of their size has gone in aerospace,” said Kevin Michaels, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, a consulting company based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. “At the same time they have issues to fix with customer satisfaction and underinvestment in R&D.;” Revenue growth and margins at the unit are expected to improve over the next few years as Boeing Co, Airbus and other plane makers increase production, and as new manufacturing techniques help reduce costs, analysts said. Honeywell faces challenges within aerospace. Some customers are have raised concerns about poor parts quality and spotty delivery that have put it near the bottom of supplier rankings, according to two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the problems publicly. Some consultants said Honeywell’s aerospace unit must get bigger to compete with engine and components maker United Technologies Corp. if UTC succeeds in its deal for avionics and interiors company Rockwell Collins. “The question is what’s next for Honeywell aerospace – is there something else in the works?” said an industry consultant. “They need scale to continue to compete.” Honeywell has the balance sheet strength to make more acquisitions. But Adamczyk has made clear in recent months that he wants the company to focus on fewer business lines. “I’m going to be always assessing our portfolio to make sure that we optimize it and make it better,” Adamczyk said in March. Investors, meanwhile, currently value pure-play companies over conglomerates. “What we’re hearing right now from Honeywell is exactly that theme,” said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

546,HON,UPDATE 1-France's Areva to cut Niger uranium production on price drop,"* Most uranium prices unprofitable at current low prices * Areva says output and job cuts matter of survival (Adds Areva comment) NIAMEY/PARIS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - French uranium mining and nuclear fuel group Areva NewCo will slash output and reduce staffing levels at its Niger mines in response to low uranium prices, the company and its unions said. A spokeswoman for Areva’s open-pit Somair mine close to Arlit said the mine will reduce its annual production of uranium concentrate to 1,700 tonnes in 2018 from 2,100 tonnes this year. “Market conditions are very difficult ... Somair has to adapt its industrial organization and its workforce accordingly. It is a question of survival,” she said. An official for the Niger-based Synamimes union told Reuters that Somair’s managing director had told staff that 190 jobs would be eliminated there and a freeze would be placed on contracts for 500 contractors. Areva confirmed that there would be “a reorganization and adjustment of the workforce of Somair and sub-contractors” but declined further comment. Areva said it was also continuing to study various scenarios for its underground Cominak mine. Areva NewCo holds a 63.6 percent stake in Somair and is the largest stakeholder in nearby Cominak, with 34 percent. “The managing director (of Cominak) told us there would be severe restrictions, without giving details,” Amadou Miou, the head of the Arlit section of the Synamines union, told Reuters. He said the union would study the companies’ decisions. Before the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, uranium traded above $70 per pound but the reactor fuel has been on a downward trend ever since and now trades at around $20, well below the level at which most mines can operate profitably. Other uranium mining companies such as Canada’s Cameco are also slashing production and cutting jobs. Areva NewCo was split off from state-owned integrated nuclear group Areva this year after its parent company’s equity was wiped out following years of losses. The French state recapitalised NewCo with a 2.5 billion euro capital increase in July, while Japan’s MHI and JNFL also plan to put in 500 million euros. The company plans to change its name early next year.

547,HON,"Areva's Niger uranium mines to cut staff, slash production -union","NIAMEY, Oct 11 (Reuters) - French uranium mining and nuclear fuel group Areva NewCo’s two uranium mines in Niger will cut staff and output in the face of falling uranium prices, a local union leader said on Wednesday. The state-owned company runs the open-cut Somair mine outside the northern, desert town of Arlit and the giant underground Cominak mine nearby. “The managing director (of Cominak) told us there would be severe restrictions, without giving details,” Amadou Miou, the head of the Arlit section of the Synamines union, told Reuters. “There will also be a reduction in production from 1,400 tonnes to 1,100 tonnes from January,” he said.

549,HON,UPDATE 1-Swiss helicopter maker preps $154 mln capital hike for liftoff,"* Marenco plans first aircraft deliveries in 2019 * Seeking European certification * New investors would join Russian tycoon Mamut (Adds details throughout, pictures) By John Miller and Oliver Hirt ZURICH, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Marenco Swiss Helicopter is raising 150 million Swiss francs ($154 million) in fresh capital as it prepares to deliver its carbon-fibre aircraft to customers in 2019, it said on Friday. The company is aiming for the single-engine light helicopter market dominated by Airbus, Textron’s Bell Helicopter , Lockheed-Martin’s Sikorsky and Italy’s Leonardo . Chief Executive Andreas Loewenstein, an ex-Airbus executive, said he expected the capital hike to be completed by early 2018. Rothschild is advising Marenco. Reuters had earlier reported the plan. Loewenstein said the market for versatile helicopters that can accommodate passengers, patients or payloads is ripe for a Swiss upstart with new technology since many existing helicopters’ designs date to the 1970s. “There’s a great opportunity to become a challenger in this segment,” Loewenstein said. “We aim to produce and sell well over 100 helicopters annually.” He estimated the market at 600-700 machines annually, led by Airbus. Switzerland’s long aviation history includes 78-year-old planemaker Pilatus. Still, getting tiny Marenco off the ground means overcoming competition from well-known aerospace giants with enormous pricing power and vast maintenance networks, in an industry where surprises from complex technology often lead to cost overruns. Loewenstein, whose helicopter is undergoing European Aviation Safety Agency certification, expects the capital increase’s proceeds to cover needs until Marenco breaks even, planned for 2022. His 5,500-pound aircraft seats eight, cruises at 260 km/h (162 mph) and will cost $3.3 million. Marenco makes components like rotor blades itself, while tapping suppliers for others, including turbines from Honeywell. “To be a helicopter maker, you must be capable of creating a production organisation, a support group and distribution,” Loewenstein said. “We’ve begun building these elements and want to move swiftly to the global market.” Initial orders have come from Air Zermatt, whose services include rescuing imperilled climbers from Switzerland’s 4,478-metre (14,692-foot) Matterhorn. Air Zermatt, which now flies Bell and Airbus aircraft, did not respond to a request for comment. In all, Marenco has received down payments for 12 aircraft and more than 100 letters of intent, Loewenstein said, with half from the United States and the rest from Europe, Asia and South America. The decade-old company, located on an ex-Swiss military airfield in the village of Mollis, has so far been bankrolled by Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut, who plans to remain on board. New investors could include strategic partners or family offices, Loewenstein said. “I’m not the owner, but I wouldn’t rule out an IPO when the company is more mature,” he said.

551,HON,"Honeywell sees aero margin widening, hikes 2017 revenue forecast","(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) expects its aerospace profit margins to keep widening, helped by strong demand for service and spare parts, though margins will not improve as much as they did in the third quarter, the company’s chief financial officer said on Friday as Honeywell reported results. Aerospace margins widened by an unusually strong 2.9 percentage points in the third quarter, to 21.3 percent, as Honeywell scaled back incentives to plane makers such as free product parts, Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek told Reuters.  “That’s not sustainable,” Szlosek said of the third-quarter margin improvement. He said the company’s forecast for profit margin gains in the current fourth quarter of 0.7 to 0.9 point are “indicative of what you can expect on a sustained basis.” Profit margins at aerospace suppliers have come under pressure as plane makers such as Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus SE (AIR.PA) have tried to boost their own narrower margins. Honeywell, which also makes building control systems and other industrial equipment, on Friday raised it full-year sales forecast, citing higher demand for spare aircraft parts and services that would boost its aerospace business. Honeywell’s shares were up 1 percent to $145.13 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising to a record high of $145.80 earlier on Friday.  The company said it expects revenue for the year of $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion, up from the $39.3 billion to $40.0 billion estimated previously.  Honeywell plans to keep investing in aerospace “at or above current rates” and is “very interested” in acquisitions in aircraft connectivity, mechanical products and software, Szlosek said. Sales in the aerospace business, Honeywell’s biggest, rose 4 percent in the third quarter. Sales in its performance materials and technologies (PMT) division rose 10 percent.  PMT, which makes catalysts and absorbents used for petroleum and refining among other things, is also benefiting as demand from the oil and gas industry remains robust. However, Honeywell expects hurricanes Harvey and Irma to cost about 2 cents in earnings per share in the current quarter, Szlosek said. Last week, the company said it would spin off two businesses with $7.5 billion in revenue to help fund acquisitions. Honeywell was under pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb and his hedge fund Third Point LLC to spin off its aerospace business.  Honeywell’s net income in the third quarter rose to $1.35 billion, or $1.75 per share, from $1.24 billion, or $1.60 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 3.2 percent to $10.12 billion.

The new system, available on a handheld Honeywell device around the size of a smartphone that uses Android-based software, is being deployed by the Holland and Reddaway units of YRC Worldwide Inc, the second-largest U.S. LTL firm.  It is also aimed at other large operators, Taylor Smith, president of Honeywell’s Workflow Solutions business, said.  LTL firms consolidate smaller loads into a single truck, requiring more complexity than regular long-haul “truckload” services.  The software product comes ahead of a December mandate that trucking firms switch to electronic logs from paper logs to meet federal hours of service rules.  The mandate is widely seen as the biggest change to hit the trucking sector since deregulation in 1980. Industry experts believe many “mom-and-pop” trucking outfits are reliant on paper logs to fudge the books, inflating driver productivity in a low-margin industry. Because of its complexity, the Honeywell-Omnitracs software is designed for larger firms that generally already have electronic logging systems in place. But Honeywell’s Smith said many of those larger firms are legacy platforms developed in-house that need to be upgraded.  The new system combines Omnitracs telematics data that automatically logs hours with Honeywell’s pickup and delivery software on a single device instead of multiple applications. “The older legacy platforms really tethered drivers to their trucks so they and their company could miss out on money,” Smith said. “Now they can accept loads away from their truck, which frees up drivers to be a lot more responsive.”  Earlier this month, Dallas-based Omnitracs announced it was rolling out a tablet-software package with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to help smaller truck carriers comply with the electronic log mandate. In February, Omnitracs teamed up with startup Peloton to bring to market technology that allows large trucks to save fuel by coordinating speed and braking so that the vehicles can drive closely together on the highway.

Flux makes warehouse management systems and software, managing more than 12 million square meters (129 million square feet) of warehouse space in China. Its business has been driven significantly by booming Chinese e-commerce, whose Internet-based sales require a huge increase in courier firms’ abilities to deliver. The deal will boost Honeywell’s safety and productivity business — its smallest by revenue — that makes supply chain and warehouse automation software and equipment. It also aligns with Honeywell’s strategy of seeking deals in the supply chain and freight management sectors. The company spent $1.5 billion last year to buy Intelligrated Inc, which provides automated material handling equipment to warehouses.

570,HON,"Honeywell sees higher 2018 profit, says tax bill could spur investment","(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) on Wednesday forecast higher 2018 earnings and said a sweeping tax overhaul could lead it to deploy more cash in the United States for investments, which might include acquisitions. The jet engine and industrial equipment maker’s shares rose 1.6 percent to $156.24 in early trading. Honeywell said it was still assessing any impact the potential legislation could have on its ongoing tax rate as well as its cash overseas, adding that its 2018 financial forecast does not reflect the proposed bill. “I do think that it will make us may be a little bit more focused on generating further opportunity here from a U.S. perspective on M&A;,” Chief Financial Officer Thomas Szlosek said on a conference call with analysts. President Donald Trump’s administration wants to cut the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and encourage multinationals to bring home profits held overseas. The company said it expects its largest unit - aerospace - to benefit from higher production of narrowbody aircraft even as it sees the business jet market to remain weak. “Longer term, we’re still conservatively planning for the business jet (original equipment) market to recover at the end of 2018 or in early 2019,” Szlosek said.  For 2017, Honeywell expects quarterly and annual profit at the top of its previous forecast range. Honeywell also set 2018 earnings per share forecast of $7.55-$7.80. Analysts on average expected a profit of $7.79 per share in 2018, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Honeywell typically sets a low bar for its outlook, building in some conservativeness and opportunity for beats during the course of the year,” RBC Capital Markets Deane Dray wrote in a note. Honeywell said it expected 2017 sales of $40.6 billion, up from its previous forecast of $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion. It expects capital expenditure to decline 15 percent next year. The company said it was targeting free cash flow of more than 20 percent and would buy back nearly $1.5 billion of its shares. Honeywell said in October it would spin off its homes and global distribution and transportation systems businesses. The company said on Wednesday it expects those deals to be completed by the end of the year. The two businesses have $7.5 billion in annual revenue. Up to Tuesday’s close, Honeywell’s stock had risen 32.7 percent this year.

582,HON,Honeywell to repatriate $7 billion over two years,"(Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) said on Friday that it expected to bring back at least $7 billion of the $10 billion in cash held overseas in the next two years, taking advantage of the newly enacted tax law.  Shares of Honeywell, which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats, rose as much as 1.2 percent in morning trading to hit a record of $163.85. The cash hoard will help fuel Honeywell’s M&A; strategy under new Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk, who is looking to bolster its core operations such as aerospace following the spin off its home and transportation businesses later this year. “Our preference is for attractive bolt-on acquisitions,” said Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek, who also promised “competitive” dividend and share buybacks using the repatriated cash. Although the company reported a huge loss due to a $3.8 billion tax provision in the fourth quarter, its adjusted profit narrowly beat analysts’ estimates due to strength across all of its divisions. Honeywell also raised its 2018 earnings forecast and said it was seeing a greater level of confidence from its customers, who may now have more cash on hand to spend due to the new tax law. “Their capex is our revenue, and we do expect some level of investment to accelerate (later in 2018),” Adamczyk said on a conference call.   Sales in its aerospace unit, its biggest business that makes aircraft engines for Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), Textron Inc (TXT.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N), rose 6.4 percent to $3.90 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Much of the growth in the business was driven by its commercial aviation aftermarket division as a rise in travel demand boosted sales of spare parts and services to the airline industry. Honeywell is also benefiting from increased demand from oil and gas customers in the wake of stabilizing oil prices, while its business that makes supply chain and warehouse automation equipment and software is riding an ecommerce boom. Excluding the tax-related charge, Honeywell earned $1.85 per share, compared with analysts’ expectations of $1.84, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 8.6 percent to $10.84 billion, topping estimates of $10.75 billion. The company raised its 2018 per-share earnings forecast range to $7.75 to $8.00 from $7.55 to $7.80 estimated previously. It is conservatively using the higher end of the 22-23 percent tax rate for the updated forecast, suggesting healthy upside, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said. Up to Thursday's close, Honeywell's stock had risen 37.3 percent in the past 12 months, far outperforming a 23.5 percent increase in the S&P; 500 index .SPX.

Honeywell’s forecast for the next five years represents a 5.3 percent to 10.5 percent increase over the 3,800 deliveries made between 2013 and 2017. The company, which makes jet engines, said in its market forecast that its 2018 findings show purchase-plan rates for civil helicopters is consistent with its 2017 survey. “Potential positive impacts of U.S. tax reform on new helicopter demand and lower volatility in oil and gas-related markets have helped fleet managers confirm what they told us last year,” Ben Driggs, president, Americas, Honeywell Aerospace said in a statement. The Morris Plains, New Jersey-based company expects the light single-engine helicopter models to be the most-desired product over the next five years as flying taxis as an option for urban commute is being considered by tech startups and companies.   Earlier in February, Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc (TXT.N), said it tied up with ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] to bring the first air-taxis by 2025, Bloomberg had reported. [bloom.bg/2saBLXj] Honeywell said it expects helicopter fleet utilization to increase significantly in North America but sees only a modest increase in Europe and Latin America over the next 12 months.

603,HON,GRAPHIC-GE value could slip to lowest among large U.S. industrials,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N), which was the most valuable publicly traded U.S. industrial conglomerate at the beginning of the year, could sink to the No. 4 spot after a prolonged selloff that has shaken confidence in the company. Valued at close to $580 billion at the turn of the millennium, GE has dropped to around $125 billion and it was surpassed in value by 3M Co (MMM.N) in January for the first time since the 1970s. At one point last week, the gap between GE and fellow U.S. industrial Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) was $6 billion, or 5 percent. The difference between GE and United Tech Corp’s (UTX.N) market values fell to $15 billion. (GRAPHIC: GE Market value - reut.rs/2D6JFB5) Helping to narrow the gap is a 45 percent slide in GE stock over 2017 and a 16 percent fall this year. Driven in value by a series of investments in several sectors during the 1990s, GE is now paying the price for focusing outside its traditional industrial manufacturing turf, while its rivals have enjoyed a more steady ascent thanks to a sharper focus on their industrial roots. “All the large-cap diversified industrials like Honeywell, United Technologies and 3M to name a few, have benefited from some of the money that’s come out of GE,” said JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa, who has a five-star rating on Thomson Reuters Eikon for recommendation performance. “You’re really talking about maybe a mid-teens stock at 2020 ... $20 I think is a very long-term target that really isn’t in the equation at this point,” Tusa said of GE’s shares, which closed at $14.64 on Monday. Tusa rates GE’s stock “underweight” with a price target of $14. But some analysts are optimistic about GE’s stock and future prospects. William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann believes that the worse could be over for GE, and its shares are likely to begin stabilizing before moving higher as 2018 progresses. “I think GE shares have been a bit oversold due to excessive fears about liquidity,” Heymann wrote in a note. Heymann cites higher oil prices, improving performance of GE’s aviation and healthcare businesses, and the recent nomination of three “exceptionally talented” directors to GE’s board. He has an “outperform” rating on the stock.  GE shares slid even after the company replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO last August with John Flannery. His turnaround plan, which includes cutting jobs, slashing GE’s dividend and a possible break-up of the conglomerate, is likely to take a year or more to show results. When Immelt took over in September 2001, GE was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company. But during his tenure, which ended July 2017, the stock price fell about 40 percent. Over Jack Welch’s stint as CEO from 1981 to 2001, GE’s value rose from $13 billion to several hundred billions of dollars. Welch has since written or co-written bestselling books on management. (GRAPHIC: GE share performance under three different CEOs - reut.rs/2Fh6rfu) GE’s stock trades at roughly 14 times its forecasted earnings, well below the multiples of its peers, as the graphic below shows. The number helps investors gauge the value of a company relative to its earnings. Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, best known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, saw its stock rise nearly 32 percent last year thanks to strong results that helped the company lift its yearly earnings forecast three times. Honeywell’s stock also rose around 32 percent in 2017, as the company sold more aircraft parts and as its energy customers bought more industrial equipment. Its warehouse automation equipment and software benefited from an ecommerce boom. (GRAPHIC: GE Forward Earnings - reut.rs/2FlZtGg) “We like Honeywell, given a solid management team and exposure to end markets we favor,” said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which holds about 787,600 shares in GE as of the end of 2017. United Tech, which sells the Pratt & Whitney jet engines, has a “significant long-term advantage” over GE, Grasfeder said. “We think United Tech could provide learning points for GE management and investors,” Grasfeder said. “Good leadership is critical.” ",3072018,http://www.reuters.com/article/ge-stocks/graphic-ge-value-could-slip-to-lowest-among-large-u-s-industrials-idUSL8N1QH6XO

609,HON,Honeywell targets 10 percent revenue growth in Southeast Asia this year,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) is targeting a roughly 10 percent increase in revenue from Southeast Asia this year, in part boosted by growing defense spending in the region, a company executive told Reuters. The company, which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats, is primed to benefit in the region as China’s territorial stance on South China Sea has raised the stakes for its ASEAN neighbors. “For a long time, militaries in Southeast Asia were a bit laissez faire about ordering and upgrading aircraft and so on,” Honeywell’s Southeast Asia president Briand Greer told Reuters in a recent interview. “They are not anymore; they realized that they want to have capability,” he said. Countries are spending on extending the life of old aircraft through mechanical modifications and software upgrades, a big growth segment for the firm, Greer told Reuters in a separate interview on Thursday. The company targets a growth rate of twice that of ASEAN’s gross domestic product, he said, making the region one of Honeywell’s fastest growing businesses. ASEAN contributed $800 million to Honeywell’s global revenue last year, Greer said, but declined to specify what the company got from the region’s military business. The New York-listed company had said in January it expects global sales from all its businesses to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this year, reaching up to $42.5 billion.  Greer pegs military spending in Southeast Asia to grow 4 percent this year, driven by Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. Global defense expenditure is expected to hit $1.67 trillion this year, the highest since the end of the Cold War, according to the IHS Jane’s Defence Budgets Report released in December.

616,HON,Honeywell raises full-year forecast as aerospace business soars,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday and lifted its full-year earnings forecast for the second time this year, citing higher sales in its aerospace business. Shares of the company, which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats, rose as much as up 2.16 percent to $151.33 in morning trading. Honeywell’s aerospace business, its biggest, benefited from a rise in global travel as it sold more aircraft parts and services to the commercial airline sector, while also seeing robust demand from defense and business jet customers. Sales in the division, which makes auxiliary power units, braking systems and other parts for Boeing and Airbus single-aisle planes, rose about 12 percent to $3.98 billion, while margins expanded by 10 basis points to 22.5 percent. “Growth in both air transport and business aviation was nearly double-digit, driven by robust deliveries on key platforms, including the Airbus A320, Boeing 737 and Bombardier Challenger 350,” Chief Financial Officer Thomas Szlosek said. Honeywell, which also makes engines for business jets produced by Bombardier (BBDb.TO) and Textron (TXT.N), said it was beginning to see the market recover as President Donald Trump’s tax cuts encourage corporate America to spend more on business jets. Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said Honeywell has a higher share of parts on new business jets such as Gulfstream G500 and G600, which will benefit the company when these planes get certified for sale later this year. The company said it anticipates continued double-digit growth in its defense business, as rising global defense spending boosts demand for spares, sensors and guidance systems. Honeywell now expects 2018 profit of $7.85 to $8.05 per share, compared with previous forecast of $7.75-$8.00. The company also raised its full-year sales forecast range to $42.7 billion-$43.5 billion, from $41.8 billion-$42.5 billion. “Given Honeywell’s historical ‘under promise, over deliver’ mantra, the new range is likely to still be viewed as conservative,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said. Sales in the company’s other businesses also rose. The performance materials and technologies unit, which makes catalysts and adsorbents used in petroleum refining, posted an 8 percent increase in sales amid rising oil prices. A boom in ecommerce provided a lift Honeywell’s supply chain and warehouse automation equipment and software business. On an adjusted basis, Honeywell earned $1.95 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.90 per share. Revenue rose to $10.39 billion, topping the estimate of $10.02 billion.
