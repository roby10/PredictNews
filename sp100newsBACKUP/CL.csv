1,CL,"Icahn bids for Clorox, suggests others step up","CHICAGO/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn put Clorox Co in play on Friday with a bid that values the company at more than $10 billion and suggested rivals consider paying much more for the bleach maker.  Icahn’s offer of $76.50 per share represents a 12 percent premium to the stock’s Thursday closing price and a 15.5 percent premium to its price in February, before Icahn announced his stake in the company.  In a letter to Clorox Chief Executive Donald Knauss, Icahn said he was confident the company could get “numerous superior bids” from large consumer products companies.  Investors were not heavily swayed. Clorox shares rose 8.1 percent to $73.90, more than $2.50 below the offer price.  “You could argue that people wouldn’t buy it, but I don’t see why not,” Icahn told Reuters.  Icahn, Clorox’s largest shareholder with a 9.4 percent stake, is known for pushing up the stocks in which he invests. In his letter, he said synergies resulting from any deal with a third-party strategic buyer could make even a $100-per-share offer viable to the likes of Procter & Gamble Co, Unilever Plc, Colgate-Palmolive Co, Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc, Kimberly-Clark Corp, Henkel AG and privately-held SC Johnson.  “They’ve got these great brands and that’s why it’s such a jewel for one of these companies,” Icahn told Reuters, ticking off products such as Clorox, Brita water filters and one of the products he has used personally, Kingsford charcoal.  Industry analysts were quick to shoot down such ideas, saying Clorox’s product lineup, which also includes Burt’s Bees lotions and Hidden Valley salad dressing, is not the best fit for companies that already make household and personal goods and have largely stayed away from food and Clorox’s more commoditized categories such as cat litter and charcoal.  “While many if not all can (financially) fund such a deal, why would they?” asked Weeden & Co analyst Javier Escalante. “What would a company like P&G do owning tiny Hidden Valley sauces or a Colgate owning Kingsford charcoal?”  Icahn’s offer of $76.50 per share values Clorox at $10.2 billion based on roughly 133.3 million shares outstanding as of March 31. Excluding the 12.5 million shares Icahn already owns, he would pay about $9.24 billion for the rest of Clorox’s shares and would also assume $2.125 billion in long-term debt.  The offer undervalues Clorox at just 9.5 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. In 2010, Unilever offered about 14.8 times EBITDA for Alberto Culver.  Financial buyers are the more likely acquirers, she said. Strategic buyers are unlikely to be interested given the high level of private label penetration in several of Clorox’s categories and its exposure to more mature markets, she added.  Icahn first announced a 9.08 stake in Clorox in February and described the stock as undervalued.  Asked if Icahn’s proposal constituted a real bid, a Clorox spokesman said: “That’s really a question for Mr. Icahn. We don’t know what his plans are beyond what has been published.  “Our board is going to be reviewing the proposal.”  If no other potential buyers step up to buy Clorox, “there’s no question that we would do it,” Icahn said.  Icahn has a “highly confident letter” from Jefferies & Co to provide financing, along with $3.8 billion in cash.  “While we stand ready and able to buy Clorox, we encourage you to hold an open and friendly ‘go-shop’ sale process where all the synergistic buyers are offered due diligence and invited to bid,” Icahn said in the letter dated July 14.  The activist investor, who said he has already arranged for $7.8 billion in financing through Jefferies & Co, offered to pay a $100 million break-up fee if he is unable to close the transaction, provided Clorox agrees to the deal by July 29.  Clorox posted disappointing quarterly results in May and forecast weak earnings for the next fiscal year as it grapples with rising packaging and materials costs.  Options activity heated up in Clorox earlier this week.  A total of 16,000 calls traded on Clorox on Monday, 38 times the average daily call volume, while a total of 1,562 puts traded, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.  Icahn told Reuters he has never bought Clorox options.  “The options market feels confident some deal is going to happen and that there is a possibility for a rival bid,” said Mark Sebastian, chief operating officer of options education firm optionpit.com. “Call premiums are elevated on Friday.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which looks into unusual share and options activity, declined to comment.

3,CL,Clorox rejects Icahn bid as too low,"CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Clorox Co (CLX.N) on Monday rejected as too low an offer from billionaire investor Carl Icahn that values it at more than $10 billion.  The company, known for its bleach products, also adopted a poison pill to make an unwanted takeover more expensive.  “We’re certainly not opposed to a sale, just a steal,” said Clorox Chairman and Chief Executive Don Knauss, who told Reuters in a telephone interview that he had a “mutually respectful conversation” with Icahn earlier on Monday.  Knauss declined to say what an attractive price for the 99-year old company would be and he would not comment on whether other bidders had emerged.  The company, which also sells Burt’s Bees lotions and Hidden Valley salad dressings, would be open to any “credible, adequate” idea to increase shareholder value, Knauss said.  The poison pill provision adopted by Clorox would be triggered when a person or group acquired 10 percent or more of Clorox’s common stock in a transaction not approved by Clorox’s board of directors.  The poison pill would make it more costly for Icahn to push through a deal without the approval of Clorox’s board.  Clorox, based in Oakland, California, was not the only company defending itself against Icahn on Monday. Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N said it planned to nominate at its shareholders meeting a 10-person board slate that included three new members, as the drugmaker fends off the investor.  A representative for Icahn, Clorox’s largest shareholder, was not available for comment.  “The prohibitively high cost to acquire (Clorox) under the shareholder rights plan makes it unlikely Mr. Icahn will move forward without the approval of the board,” BMO analyst Connie Maneaty wrote in a note to clients.  On Friday, Icahn put Clorox in play with an offer of $76.50 per share. That offer represented a 12 percent premium to the stock’s Thursday closing price and a 15.5 percent premium to its price in February, before Icahn announced his stake in the company.  Icahn also suggested that rival companies should consider paying even more for Clorox.  Icahn said in a letter that synergies resulting from any deal with a third-party strategic buyer could make even a $100 per share offer viable to the likes of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) or Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N).  Clorox is more heavily exposed to the United States than larger consumer products makers and other competitors.  The U.S. consumer is “certainly in a fragile state,” but we are seeing some stabilization, said Knauss, who added that the  key for Clorox was to introduce new products.  The company is planning products to help prevent the spread of infections in homes, hospitals and acute care centers, and plans greater focus on environmentally friendly products.  The product pipeline “looks better now than in the five years I have been here,” said Knauss, Clorox’s CEO since October 2006.  Shares of Clorox, which is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on August 3, closed down 2 percent at $73.04 on the New York Stock Exchange and slipped another 0.2 percent in extended trading to $72.90.

6,CL,"Latin America helps Colgate, Avon during U.S. slump","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Big gains in Latin America covered up U.S. declines at Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) and Avon Products Inc (AVP.N), with the world’s largest direct seller of cosmetics seen as having a harder road to recovery.  At Avon, revenue rose 19 percent in Latin America and fell 7 percent in North America.  Sales at Colgate, best known for its toothpaste, rose 17 percent in Latin America and fell 3 percent in North America.  “Neither of these is pretty,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj, who has “neutral” ratings on both companies’ shares. “I’d argue Avon is worse, but Avon is also viewed as much cheaper.”  Avon trades at about 13.4 times expected earnings, below Colgate’s multiple of 16.8, according to Reuters data on Thursday morning.  Shares of Avon fell 2.9 percent to $26.94, while Colgate rose 0.8 percent to $86.14.  For a graphic on the companies, click r.reuters.com/ceq82s Two years after the recession officially ended, U.S. shoppers still pause before spending more on items like updated toothbrushes and the latest lipsticks as food and gas prices have risen.  So household product makers including Colgate and Avon, both based in New York, have steadily been working on the international businesses that make up the bulk of their sales.  North America only accounts for about 18 percent of sales at both Avon and Colgate, excluding the latter company’s Hill’s pet food unit. Latin America, meanwhile, accounts for 47.2 percent of revenue for Avon and 29 percent for Colgate.  Both companies are busy tweaking areas such as pricing, advertising and operations to squeeze out better U.S. results.  In North America, Avon’s revenue fell 7 percent. The number of active representatives selling its goods declined 8 percent, the number of items sold dropped 16 percent and operating profit plunged 31 percent.  “Stabilizing the U.S., short of turning it around, is key to restore investor confidence,” and the second quarter doesn’t suggest Avon is anywhere near that point, said Weeden & Co analyst Javier Escalante.  Dibadj suggested that Avon consider leaving the United States, where he said it is not making any money and has not shown improvement for some time.  “Unfortunately for Avon, the direct selling model at the low end of the market, which is where they are, is somewhat irrelevant to the U.S. consumer,” he said. “Somebody else could probably run the U.S. better than they can.”  Chief Executive Officer Andrea Jung defended Avon’s U.S. plans during a conference call.  Dibadj and others from Wall Street had questioned what the company called “bold” changes. For example, some representatives who report to district sales managers will now report to sellers in the field with more experience, who in turn will report to the district sales managers.  The U.S. business can grow at or slightly ahead of the pace of the overall beauty industry longer term, said interim Chief Financial Officer Chuck Cramb, who also oversees developed markets after a February management shuffling.  Colgate earned $1.26 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose slightly more than expected to $4.19 billion.  Colgate, which is still under some promotional pressure, expects prices in the United States to be basically flat this quarter and rise in the fourth quarter, said CEO Ian Cook.  The company still expects mid-single-digit percentage growth in earnings per share in 2011, excluding a charge for Venezuela accounting.  Avon earned 49 cents per share, excluding restructuring costs, 1 cent below Wall Street’s average forecast. Revenue of $2.86 billion missed estimates.  The company, which does not give earnings forecasts, said it still expected mid-single-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion in the second half of 2011.  Avon’s strength in Latin America came without a leader, as the 125-year-old company looks outside of its walls for someone to run that business after posting disappointing fourth-quarter results in key countries such as Brazil.  Latin America was not the key to growth for all companies.

9,CL,IFR-Disney cleans up in US bond market with coupon records," NEW YORK, Aug 18 (IFR) - The Walt Disney Company hit the market with a bond offering on Wednesday and ended up achieving the lowest ever coupons for bonds with maturities of five, 10 and 30 years.   It’s a sign of the times. The market was ripe with possibility when the A2/A/A rated issuer went out to investors yesterday. Treasuries all week have been trading near all time lows. In fact, what has drawn Disney (DIS.N) and this week’s other issuers to market is not necessarily a strong need for cash. The main allure is the ultra-low rates, and credit spreads for top-notch credits have snapped tight.   “Credit spreads on highly coveted names like Walt Disney are back at or close to their tights of the year; we’ve hit new lows across the Treasury curve, new issue concessions have abated and there is a cash-rich investor base,” said Jonathan Fine, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate in the Americas at Goldman Sachs. “When you have a confluence of these events issuers are going to break some records.”   Disney printed a US$750m offering of five-year notes with a 1.35% coupon at 99.206 to yield Treasuries plus 60bp. The coupon bests the 1.375% record held by Colgate Palmolive Co (CL.N) since October 29 2010. The US$750m 10-year finished with a 2.75% coupon at 98.717 to yield plus 72bp, beating out the 2.95% coupon achieved by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on August 12 2010 and matched by Colgate on October 29 2010.   Meanwhile, Disney’s US$350m 30-year tranche printed with a 4.375% coupon at 99.01 to yield Treasuries plus 87.5bp. J&J also set the previous 30-year record of 4.50% on August 12 2010. A handful of other issuers tied that level soon thereafter, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. Most recently Southwestern Public Service Co priced a 4.50% long bond on August 3 2011.   Disney was clearly what a lot of investors were looking for this week.   “You have to be able to check a number of boxes at the moment to get this type of execution in the new issue market: you need to be well known, Single-A or better and non-financial. If you are all of these things then you are ripe for a phenomenal offering,” said Fine.   Disney has always been at the forefront of financing trends. Most noticeably, it was the first corporate issuer ever to print a 100-year bond, when it priced a US$300m fundraising on July 21 1993. That started a trend among certain high-grade issuers that re-emerged over the past year, most recently with a US$300m century bond from University of Southern California that priced on August 10 2011.   Disney’s last trip the high-grade bond market was on May 18 this year. The difference between the Wednesday trade and the May deal had more to do with the changes in the Treasury market than in Disney.   The issuer printed a US$500m offering of 10-year notes in May with a 3.75% coupon, a full percentage point richer than Wednesday’s trade. However, from the point of view of spread it was a more attractive deal for the company. Last time it achieved 60bp over Treasuries compared to 72bp on Wednesday.

10,CL,Clorox can wait for Icahn to fail -traders,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Traders who bet on deals are putting low odds on billionaire investor Carl Icahn making any inroads at Clorox Co (CLX.N).  Clorox is unlikely to ever see the $10.3 billion offered by Icahn since the takeover bid is contingent on his nominees wiping clean the bleach company’s board and starting an auction, merger arbitrageurs said.  Icahn lowered his takeover bid for Clorox on Tuesday, but said his offer would serve as a back-stop if an auction of the company failed.  Icahn, Clorox’s largest shareholder with a 9.51 percent stake, has launched a proxy fight after the board rejected two of his earlier buyout offers.  “Wiping away the entire board won’t be easy,” said one arbitrageur, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “This is not a board that’s been asleep at the switch. It’s an active board that’s been producing.”  In the fiscal fourth-quarter, Clorox said its profit fell less than expected and that costs in the current fiscal year will rise less than it previously thought.  Clorox’s stock has risen about 12 percent this year, but it is trading about 13 percent below Icahn’s latest $78 bid.  “The $78 number is fictitious. It’s backstop offer to an auction that may never happen. The auction only happens if shareholders vote Icahn’s entire slate in and the chances of that are slim,” said a second arbitrageur, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  A defeat at Clorox would add to recent disappointments for the corporate raider-turned-activist, who is known to take on battles at several companies at the same time. This month he has turned up the heat on Clorox after setbacks in other ventures.  Icahn revealed his new bid for Clorox on the same day he gave up on his bid for control of film studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGF.N after a lengthy battle.  He kicked off his proxy fight at Clorox two weeks ago, the day after he lost a battle to get board seats at another target, Forest Laboratories FRX.N.  Icahn’s fortunes are far from even. He did manage to see his years-long investment in Motorola turn around this month when Google Inc (GOOG.O) agreed to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc (MMI.N) for $12.5 billion.  Clorox earlier slammed Icahn’s latest bid as an “inadequate, highly conditional proposal” and said the billionaire was looking to fund up to half of the purchase price by borrowing from its shareholders.  Icahn has said his bid was at least half cash, with the rest in bonds.  Icahn and Clorox could not be immediately reached for comment.  Icahn has said that synergies resulting from a deal with a strategic buyer could make even a $100-per-share offer viable for the likes of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Unilever Plc (ULVR.L), Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L), Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N), Henkel AG (HNKG_p.DE), and privately held SC Johnson.  But analysts and investors have raised questions about another bidder emerging.  “Clorox has a mix of products that a Unilever or P&G don’t need to have. And no private equity firm is going to get financing to come in there and pick and choose what they want,” the second arbitrageur said.  Wells Fargo Securities analyst Timothy Conder added, “We continue to believe there is little chance other strategic buyers will emerge at a price superior to Icahn’s $80 offer or his $78 back stop.”  Clorox, so far, has not faced a shareholder uprising to begin talks with Icahn or consider his offer.  For now, the 99-year-old company can sit back and wait for Icahn’s slate of board nominees to fail, said one consumer investment banker, who is not involved with the company.  “Clorox doesn’t have to launch a defensive move. They don’t need to breakup the company or launch some exotic restructuring. They just sit back and wait for Icahn’s slate to fail. The stock is below Icahn’s offer — no one feels that there’s a real alternative out there,” the arbitrageur said.  Clorox’s shares closed down 1 percent at $69.01 on Thursday.

16,CL,HOW TO PLAY IT-Stocks that inspire consumer confidence," THE ISSUE: The Thomson Reuters/U of Michigan’s Consumer Confidence index rose slightly more than expected but remained at nearly the lowest level in years at 57.8. In a healthy economy, it would be over 70 percent.   By Sam Forgione   NEW YORK, Sept 16  (Reuters) - Consumers are still gloomy, and the retailing recovery that had been expected has failed to materialize.   That’s a disappointment for the investors who steadily boosted the S&P Retailing index from last August through July of this year. It has fallen since, in step with sagging reports on confidence like the one reported Friday.   What’s eating consumers? Unemployment is hovering around 9 percent. Add to it fears surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling and ratings down-grade and the Euro-zone crisis, and overall expectations have been at historic lows.   What should investors do? Avoid the sector all together?   In the view of three experts who follow the industry, it’s time to be picky.    Here are views of three experts on how to find companies that inspire confidence even when the Consumer Confidence survey sags:      One strategist, Kate Warne at Edward Jones, cited retail and consumer stocks that do well regardless of consumer confidence.   Among her retailing favorites, Kohl’s (KSS.N) was up 61 cents to $47.59 in afternoon trading or 1.30 percent, Target (TGT.N) was up $1.19 to $52.89 or 2.3 percent,  Tiffany (TIF.N) was up 55 cents to $75.38 in afternoon trading.   Her list topped the overall gain of the Standard & Poor’s Retailing Index .XRT which was up a modest half a percent.   In the broader consumer sector, she cited Colgate Palmolive (CL.N) , which was  up  1.15 percent to $93.35, and Procter & Gamble (PG.N) up $1.69 or 2.68 percent to $64.46.   She pointed to solid brands and retailers who can manage in a weak environment.    “Whether confident or not, consumers are going to buy toothpaste,” said Warne, explaining her choice of the two consumer giants.   “Kohl’s has a long track record of delivering good value for consumers. People are shifting to cheaper items and spending less,” she said.   Ross Stores Inc.(ROST.O), which specializes in low-priced brand merchandise and Limited Brands Inc.LTD.N, with moderately priced women’s fashion, are also safe choices for investors, according to another strategist   “We continue to believe LTD (Limited) and ROST (Ross) are well positioned for the second half given strong top-line momentum and the relatively lower cost pressure they face compared to many apparel retailers,” reported Paul Lejuez, CFA of Nomura Holdings, in a research note.   A third strategist is undaunted by the sluggish confidence report and sees the anticipated recovery still on track. The key test for the sector will come in the big season ahead as holidays approach.   “When looking into Q2 results from retailers, for the most part, reporting is in line with expectations. We haven’t seen any major indications of them pulling back yet,” said John Long, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon.   Long also cites back-to-school spending as a bright sign.”If we look at back-to-school as a bellwether for holiday sales, which history indicates is the case, then retailers will have a good season, and only a major unforeseen event could change that.”    ",9162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplayit-consumer/how-to-play-it-stocks-that-inspire-consumer-confidence-idUSS1E78F0UU20110916
17,CL,HOW TO PLAY IT: Don't be a volatility ostrich,,9222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplay-volatility/how-to-play-it-dont-be-a-volatility-ostrich-idUSS1E78I1DW20110922
18,CL,How to play it: Don't be a volatility ostrich,"THE ISSUE: Since the beginning of August, the Dow industrial average has had nine days with 300-point-plus losses. In the entire year before it, there were only two. How can investors manage in such a period of high volatility?  NEW YORK (Reuters) - For many investors, big market drops like the ones this week have a bring-on-the-blindfold effect.  Many people stop looking at online brokerage statements and avoid reading the financial news. The bottom line is that they really don’t want to talk about the bottom line at all (except for those who shout ‘sell everything’ at their broker.)  But tempting as it may be for everyone to bury their heads in the sand, the ostrich strategy really is not the best way to react to a downturn.  Obviously there are as many strategies as there are risk profiles and investment goals.  Here are four ways to keep your head above water when selling floods the markets:  Warren Buffett has made billions buying shares when they are down and selling when they are up.  But that does not mean to get swept up in the emotions of the moment. Knowing the inherent value of stocks is a requirement — Buffett isn’t throwing darts in a windstorm.  James T. Evans, portfolio manager at Thompson Investment Management, said, “There’s a lot of volatility on a daily and weekly basis...The less emotion the better off we are.”  Evans said he favors beaten-down financials, especially regional banks, and energy. He is selling technology because it has been outperforming and has less residual value.  Well-diversified investors have the satisfaction of knowing that at least part of their portfolio is rising when stocks collapse as they have in recent days. Bonds have continued to rise. Individual investors have moved heavily into fixed income since 2008 and for the most part it has paid off.  “Bonds are inversely correlated with stock prices.....Rarely do you get bond and stock prices going down. That diversification reduces volatility,” said John Largent, Chief Investment Officer at Members Trust Capital.  When a major disruption hits, many advisers say it could be time to consider adding to risk-averse, highly rated bonds. Individual bonds carry the same yield until maturity and it’s an income stream that holders can count on in an uncertain world.  But Largent is taking a balanced view, saying that a tipping point could be coming.  The problem with bonds is that yields have dropped so low already it’s hard to generate any worthwhile income. Some fear that if the economy or inflation nudge higher, today’s high-priced bonds will quickly lose value.  Dividends on stocks have become more attractive than bonds. The overall stock payout already has surpassed the 10-year Treasury and is about on par with the 30-year bond.  “Bonds are at an absolute high, and stocks are at a 20-year low, offering greater income than bonds. There is also a negative real yield on treasuries from zero-to-10 years,” said Howard Ward, Director of Growth Equities at GAMCO Investors Inc.  Ward mentioned utility stocks such as Wisconsin Electric, Aqua America, American Waterworks, Alliant Energy, and Dominion Resources, as well as consumer stocks such as Procter and Gamble, Clorox, Colgate, and General Mills,as solid stocks that pay dividends.  “They have yields to protect them and very little risk and competition to their business model. They have more income than any treasury,” Ward said.  Many people get cold feet and just want to avoid risk when markets are volatile, and it’s reasonable to boost cash holdings at times like this said one strategist, though there is a tradeoff.  “Certainly, one alternative is to go to cash, but if you do that and the market rallies, you are giving up the upside,” said Maneesh Deshpande, Equity Derivatives Head at Barclay’s Capital.

19,CL,HOW TO PLAY IT: Don't be a volatility ostrich,"(Refiling to new codes: Sept. 22 date is correct)   By Sam Forgione   THE ISSUE: Since the beginning of August, the Dow industrial average has had nine days with 300-point-plus losses. In the entire year before it, there were only two. How can investors manage in such a period of high volatility?   NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - For many investors, big market drops like the ones this week have a bring-on-the-blindfold effect.   Many people stop looking at online brokerage statements and avoid reading the financial news. The bottom line is that they really don’t want to talk about the bottom line at all (except for those who shout ‘sell everything’ at their broker.)   But tempting as it may be for everyone to bury their heads in the sand, the ostrich strategy really is not the best way to react to a downturn.   Obviously there are as many strategies as there are risk profiles and investment goals.   Here are four ways to keep your head above water when selling floods the markets:   Warren Buffett has made billions buying shares when they are down and selling when they are up.   But that does not mean to get swept up in the emotions of the moment. Knowing the inherent value of stocks is a requirement — Buffett isn’t throwing darts in a windstorm.  James T. Evans, portfolio manager at Thompson Investment Management, said, “There’s a lot of volatility on a daily and weekly basis...The less emotion the better off we are.”   Evans said he favors beaten-down financials, especially regional banks, and energy. He is selling technology because it has been outperforming and has less residual value.   Well-diversified investors have the satisfaction of knowing that at least part of their portfolio is rising when stocks collapse as they have in recent days. Bonds have continued to rise. Individual investors have moved heavily into fixed income since 2008 and for the most part it has paid off.   “Bonds are inversely correlated with stock prices.....Rarely do you get bond and stock prices going down. That diversification reduces volatility,” said John Largent, Chief Investment Officer at Members Trust Capital.   When a major disruption hits, many advisers say it could be time to consider adding to risk-averse, highly rated bonds. Individual bonds carry the same yield until maturity and it’s an income stream that holders can count on in an uncertain world.   But Largent is taking a balanced view, saying that a tipping point could be coming.  The problem with bonds is that yields have dropped so low already it’s hard to generate any worthwhile income. Some fear that if the economy or inflation nudge higher, today’s high-priced bonds will quickly lose value.   Dividends on stocks have become more attractive than bonds. The overall stock payout already has surpassed the 10-year Treasury and is about on par with the 30-year bond.   “Bonds are at an absolute high, and stocks are at a 20-year low, offering greater income than bonds. There is also a negative real yield on treasuries from zero-to-10 years,” said Howard Ward, Director of Growth Equities at GAMCO Investors Inc.   Ward mentioned utility stocks such as Wisconsin Electric, Aqua America (WTR.N), American Waterworks (AWK.N), Alliant Energy (LNT.N), and Dominion Resources (D.N), as well as consumer stocks such as Procter and Gamble (PG.N), Clorox (CLX.N), Colgate (CL.N), and General Mills (GIS.N),as solid stocks that pay dividends.   “They have yields to protect them and very little risk and competition to their business model. They have more income than any treasury,” Ward said.   Many people get cold feet and just want to avoid risk when markets are volatile, and it’s reasonable to boost cash holdings at times like this said one strategist, though there is a tradeoff.   “Certainly, one alternative is to go to cash, but if you do that and the market rallies, you are giving up the upside,”said Maneesh Deshpande, Equity Derivatives Head at Barclay’s Capital.   Deshpande also implores investors to widen their range of cash holdings. “Consider looking across a range of asset classes. The Australian dollar put looks attractive.”   Stuart Ritter, a portfolio and retirement expert at T. Rowe Price,said that long term investors in retirement plans have a new incentive to stay the course.   “If you’re making a regular contribution to a 401K plan or 529 plan and the market is lower this month, then the same amount is buying more stocks,” he said.   “Volatility gives investors the opportunity to buy more shares when the market goes down.”  ",9262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplay-volatility/how-to-play-it-dont-be-a-volatility-ostrich-idUSS1E78P0J120110926

23,CL,Colgate-Palmolive profit matches expectations,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday that met analysts’ expectations as it increased advertising and cut costs to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The toothpaste maker also stood by its forecast for the year and said it remains comfortable with analysts’ expectations. Colgate earned $593 million, or $1.23 per share, in the first quarter, up from $576 million, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to cost cuts and the sale of land in Mexico, Colgate earned $601 million, or $1.24 per share, in the latest quarter. The profit matched analysts’ expectations of $1.24 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its sales rose nearly 5.2 percent to $4.20 billion, slightly better than the $4.18 billion expected by analysts. Organic sales, which strip out the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 6.5 percent, the largest increase Colgate has seen in seven quarters. The volume of goods sold and pricing each rose 3.5 percent. New York-based Colgate gets most of its revenue from outside the United States. While growth in Latin America, its largest market, has helped, a stronger U.S. dollar cuts into its profits. Advertising spending rose 7 percent to $448 million as Colgate spent some of the money it received from raising prices and cutting costs to promote its brands around the world. Colgate said its share of the global toothpaste market rose to 45.2 percent, up 0.8 share point from a year earlier, while its lead in manual toothbrushes rose 0.6 point to 32.7 percent. In January, Colgate said that while it still expected double-digit growth in earnings per share, it added the caveat that such growth would be on a currency-neutral basis. Colgate reiterated that forecast on Thursday and said it is still comfortable with external profit growth expectations. Analysts, on average, currently expect Colgate to earn $5.39 per share this year. Colgate competes with a variety of household products makers including Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), whose products include Crest toothpaste and Oral-B toothbrushes. P&G; is set to report its quarterly results on Friday. ",4262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-colgate/colgate-palmolive-profit-matches-expectations-idUSBRE83P0K720120426

27,CL,Household goods makers show resilience in second quarter,"(Reuters) - Makers of consumer products like toothpaste, toilet paper and even chocolate bars said they found growth in emerging markets and raised U.S. prices, easing concerns that shoppers were pulling back in a weak economy. Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) and Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) on Thursday had somewhat positive outlooks about the rest of the year, while Hershey Co (HSY.N) said price increases helped quarterly profit and it raised its full-year earnings forecast. Kimberly-Clark, known for its Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, saw relief in key commodity expenses, saying pulp costs should be lower than previously expected. Kimberly-Clark’s quarterly profit beat expectations and the company raised its 2012 forecast, while Colgate’s earnings were in line with estimates and it held to its earlier forecast. Colgate’s shares jumped 3.6 percent to $105.91, while Kimberly-Clark gained 3.2 percent to $86.04. Shares of both rose in the second quarter while the broader U.S. stock market declined. “These stocks have really been on a tear. Investors are seeking safety, they’re seeking dividend yield, so that’s the good news,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. “But the challenge is when you report earnings you’ve got to support the lofty valuations out there, and I think both of these companies did that.” Kimberly-Clark forecast 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 to $5.20, up from its previous target of $5.00 to $5.15. Colgate’s sales topped Wall Street’s average estimate, as 13 percent organic sales growth in emerging markets stood out against 2.5 percent growth in developed regions. Organic sales strip out the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. “The read-through for the U.S. consumer is still pretty lukewarm, but thankfully these companies have a global footprint,” Russo said. “The emerging markets really carried the day, especially at Colgate, and growth was slower, as we expected, in Europe and the U.S.” Results at larger European rival Unilever NV (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) were helped by strength in emerging markets, though the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap said it is seeing some commodities costs edge up. The results came weeks after Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the world’s largest household products maker, cut its forecast and still tries to set the right prices in slowing global economies — issues its smaller competitors have more nimbly managed. P&G; is set to report quarterly results on August 3. Hershey, meanwhile, was able to raise prices despite economic uncertainty. Sales rose 7 percent to $1.41 billion, mostly on price hikes. Kimberly-Clark’s second-quarter profit rose 19.9 percent to $498 million, or $1.26 per share. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding restructuring costs, rose to $1.30 and topped the average estimate of $1.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 0.2 percent to $5.27 billion, just shy of analysts’ expectation of $5.28 billion. Colgate’s profit was up less than 1 percent to $627 million, or $1.30 per share. Excluding items, Colgate earned $1.33 per share, matching expectations. Sales increased 2 percent to $4.27 billion, ahead of estimates of $4.25 billion. Both companies are increasing advertising spending to entice consumers with new products, such as Kimberly-Clark’s Depend and Poise pads for female incontinence, and Colgate’s Colgate Optic White toothpaste. Kimberly-Clark and Colgate have also raised prices. At Kimberly-Clark, the volume of goods sold increased 2 percent, and prices were up more than 2 percent. At Colgate, volume rose 5 percent, and pricing was up 3.5 percent. Kimberly-Clark now expects key commodity costs will be unchanged to down $100 million this year, versus an earlier expectation that such costs would range from $50 million in deflation to $50 million in inflation. Kimberly-Clark now expects to spend $1.3 billion on share buybacks, subject to market conditions, up from a prior target of $900 million to $1.1 billion, as it expects to have more cash, including proceeds from stock option exercises. Colgate still expects double-digit growth in earnings per share this year on a currency-neutral basis, though at current rates, foreign exchange would cut 2012 earnings per share growth by about 6 percent to 7 percent, Chief Executive Ian Cook said.

Colgate said it still expected double-digit growth in earnings per share this year on a currency-neutral basis, though at current rates foreign exchange would eat into those gains. Second-quarter profit rose to $627 million, or $1.30 per share, from $622 million, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Colgate earned $1.33 per share. Analysts, on average, expected Colgate to earn $1.33 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2 percent to $4.27 billion, ahead of the analysts’ forecast of $4.25 billion.

The volume of goods sold rose 5 percent, and pricing increased 3.5 percent. New York-based Colgate gets most of its revenue from outside the United States. Growth in Latin America, its largest market, along with a range of emerging markets has helped offset weaker economies in North America and Europe. Organic sales grew 13 percent in emerging markets and just 2.5 percent in developed markets, Chief Executive Ian Cook said in a statement. In Latin America, which accounts for 29 percent of sales, the volume of goods sold rose 6.5 percent, or 9.5 percent excluding a divested detergent business. In North America, which makes up 18 percent of sales, the volume of goods sold slid 0.5 percent. Colgate continues to be hurt by foreign exchange rates. If average exchange rates were to remain at current spot rates for the rest of the year, currency translation would cut its 2012 earnings per share growth by about 6 percent to 7 percent, Cook said.

33,CL,Treasuries turn on Colgate's $500 mln sale of 10-years,"July 27 (IFR) - A crazy week of upheaval in the Thomson Reuters/IFR low-coupon tables was set to end suitably, with yet another low-coupon record-breaker - on a summer Friday no less - from Colgate-Palmolive. In the end however, Colgate had to settle for number two position, with a big pop in US Treasury yields keeping the record out of reach. Colgate has regularly gained the top spot on the low-coupon tables and seemed almost certain to retake the number-one position in 10-years, after being ousted from the spot by 3M Co last month. To do so, it would have to top IBM’s landmark 1.875% coupon on notes due August 2022 that priced on Wednesday - the first 10-year US high grade deal to print inside of 2.00%. That seemed possible when the deal was announced, but by the time Colgate priced, the 10-year Treasury yield had spiked by 11 basis points (bp) on talk of stimulus measures from the ECB. Colgate did manage to come in below 2.00% with a 1.95% coupon, but IBM’s record remains intact for now. Colgate, rated Aa3/AA-/AA-, sold $500 million of SEC registered long 10-year medium term notes via HSBC, JPMorgan and  Morgan Stanley joint books. Proceeds of the deal will be used to retire commercial paper that was issued for general corporate purposes. Initial price talk on the deal came at Treasuries plus 65bp area. Official guidance emerged at Treasuries plus 60bp area. Ultimately the deal was launched and priced at 98.537 to yield 2.106%, or Treasuries plus 58bp. If Colgate had printed a straight 10-year instead of a long 10-year, that might have made the record easier to reach, but it wasn’t really an option. The issuer had just tapped the market with a straight 10-year in April - with the 2.30s due May 2022, which held the record low coupon in 10-years, tied with Procter & Gamble, until 3M came along with its 2.00s due June, 2022 on June 21. Colgate’s 22s were quoted around Treasuries plus 52bp bid on Friday. Adding in 5bp for the maturity extension puts fair value of Treasuries plus 58bp. That means that Friday’s trade priced with a flat new issue concession. On Wednesday, IBM demonstrated — with its 65bp area guidance that it was unable to tighten — that investors seem unwilling to dive into negative NIC territory with these low coupon/low spread deals. At least that seems to be the case for those that have active outstandings. Book size was heard as $1.25 billion. So IBM remains at the top of the 10-year table. Bristol-Myers Squibb remains at the top of the five-year table with its 0.875% coupon, the first five-year inside of 1.00%, that was part of a 2-part offering of five-year and 30-year notes that priced on Thursday. The 30-year tranche also grabbed top honors with a 3.25% coupon. In the three-year bucket, IBM has held the record since February 1 with its 0.55s due February 2015. A total of $15.25 billion from twelve deals priced this week, right about mid-range of where syndicate desks expected it to come in. That topped the $13.85 billion in 12 deals done last week. About half of the market expected activity to be in the area of $10 billion, perhaps to the plus side depending on opportunistic issuers. But the other half felt it would be busier - more like $15 billion area, with some saying $15-20 billion. Yankee FIG issuers led the way this week with $6 billion from four issues, accounting for 39% of total volume. Overall FIG issuance (domestic and Yankee) accounted for 52.5% of the total. Domestic industrial issuers also had a decent week, as four new issues hit the market for $4.5 billion, helping to boost the corporate sector total for the week (domestic plus Yankee) to $7.25 billion, accounting for 47.5% of total volume. As has been the case for most of 2012 and definitely for the month of July, single-A issuers were the most active participants in the new issue market. A full $6.5 billion, or 42.6%, of total issuance was from single-A rated companies. Double-A rated issuers accounted for $5.75 billion (37.8%), while the remaining $3 billion done this week, 19.6%, came from triple-B names. Fifty-four percent of July issuance, or $31.325 billion, has originated from single-A rated issues. The total for July is now $57.825 billion - just $918 million short of the $58.743 billion record for July (2010). There is still Monday and Tuesday of next week to push the month into record territory. Year-to-date corporate volume now stands at $527.061 billion from 498 issues. 2012 new issue volume remains well ahead of the pace from one year ago, when 428 deals were priced for $487.186 billion during the same period.

38,CL,UPDATE 4-Procter & Gamble earnings give CEO McDonald some relief,"* P&G; profit of $1.06/share tops expectations of 96 cents * P&G; keep forecast for fiscal 2013 core earnings per share * Colgate matches expectations, plans job cuts * P&G; shares up 3 percent, Colgate down 1.9 percent   (Adds details from Colgate, analyst comment, updates stock activity) By Jessica Wohl Oct 25 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co’s profit rose more than expected, indicating that the world’s largest household products company is making progress in cutting costs and giving Chief Executive Bob McDonald a little relief after months of pressure. Shares of P&G;, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, rose to their highest level in four years. Meanwhile, shares of rival Colgate-Palmolive Co slid as much as 3.3 percent after it announced plans to cut jobs as it strives to operate more nimbly as economies slow in many countries. Colgate’s quarterly profit matched expectations. P&G; is cutting $10 billion of costs and focusing on key markets, products and countries. The company’s goals as well as McDonald, who is also chairman, have been under intense scrutiny since activist investor William Ackman bought shares this summer. “They cleared a low hurdle,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. “The fact that they did report solid results is a plus, but I don’t know if the pressure is necessarily off.” P&G; had given a quarterly forecast in August that was below Wall Street’s view at the time, leading analysts to lower their expectations. P&G; ultimately beat the initial analyst expectations, helped by sales that met the high end of its forecast and some relief in commodity costs. Shares of P&G; rose as much as 4 percent to $70.83 on Thursday, their highest level since October 2008. The shares were up 3 percent at $70.11 by midafternoon. Colgate’s shares were down 1.9 percent at $104.49 in the afternoon, off an earlier low at $103.06. “It wouldn’t surprise me if we’re seeing some people saying it is time to sell some Colgate, buy some Procter, given Colgate’s outperformance year to date,” said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher, who has a “neutral” rating on Colgate and an “overweight” rating on P&G.; Several consumer goods makers are trimming jobs, including P&G;, as concerned consumers hold off on some purchases and growth slows in major markets such as China. P&G; is on track to cut 4,200 jobs by the end of October on its way to eliminating 5,700 jobs by the end of its fiscal year. Colgate’s plans, including moving away from single-country units toward regional hubs, should lead the toothpaste maker to trim about 2,300 jobs, or roughly 6 percent of its workforce, by the end of 2016. On Wednesday, Kimberly-Clark Corp said it would eliminate 1,300 to 1,500 jobs as it leaves some low-margin businesses in Europe, and Energizer Holdings Inc said in September that it plans to cut an unspecified number of jobs. Colgate’s shares had risen 15 percent this year through Wednesday, while P&G; shares were up less than 1 percent. P&G; did not raise its key profit forecast for the fiscal year that began in September, in part because it plans to ramp up marketing support behind new products being introduced later in the year, and because it has to spend more to obtain an absorbent material for Pampers diapers, its largest brand, following a plant explosion in Japan. P&G; earned $1.06 per share in the fiscal first quarter on a “core” basis, which excludes charges, up from $1.01 per share a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected it to earn 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Back in August, before P&G; forecast earnings per share of 91 to 97 cents, analysts’ average forecast had been $1.03. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, has publicly blamed P&G;’s top brass for high costs and declining revenue while saying that he understands the board wants to give McDonald time to repair years of damage. Ackman could not be reached for comment on Thursday. P&G; is putting a fresh focus on productivity, including adding a new global officer of productivity and organization transformation who will report to McDonald, as well as creating a productivity council of senior managers. P&G;’s net sales in the quarter fell 4 percent to $20.74 billion, below analysts’ target of $20.78 billion. Organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, rose 2 percent. P&G; is still seeing some pressure. Its sales grew 7 percent in China, but that was below China’s household-products market growth of 11 percent. China is P&G;’s second-largest market in terms of sales and profit. P&G; still expects to post core earnings per share of $3.80 to $4 this fiscal year. Analysts’ average forecast for the year is $3.91 per share. For the current second quarter, P&G; forecast core earnings of $1.07 to $1.13 per share, with organic sales up 1 to 3 percent. Analysts’ forecast was $1.10. Colgate, meanwhile, earned $1.38 per share, matching analysts’ forecasts, while sales fell 1 percent to $4.33 billion. P&G; is dealing with the explosion in Japan of a Nippon Shokubai Co plant that supplies a key material for Pampers diapers. Pampers is the company’s largest single brand, accounting for more than $10 billion in annual sales. Nippon Shokubai is one of the world’s biggest makers of acrylic acid, the main ingredient of a resin called SAP, which is used in diapers. P&G; has found other sources of the material and while any impact to consumers should be “minor,” it has to spend more obtain the supplies it needs, said Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers, said on Wednesday it was not affected by the explosion since Nippon Shokubai was not its supplier.

39,CL,"Colgate's fourth-quarter profit up, but Latin American sales slow","(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) said on Thursday a key measure of sales growth slowed for the second quarter in a row as the company faced increased pressures in Venezuela, including a labor slowdown at its factory there which has since been taken care of. Shares of the toothpaste maker fell as much as 3.7 percent, even as fourth-quarter profit rose slightly more than expected. The stock is up 6 percent so far this month after rising 13.2 percent in 2012, and some analysts suggested investors use the weakness as a buying opportunity. The company’s results in Latin America were disappointing, due largely to economic and labor problems in Venezuela, which accounts for about 5 percent of total sales. Colgate also faces tougher competition in Latin America from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), particularly in toothpaste and toothbrushes, though Colgate said it is still well ahead of its rival in countries such as Brazil and Mexico. Organic sales, which strip out the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 4 percent in the quarter. Organic sales rose 5 percent in the third quarter and 8 percent in the second quarter. Excluding Venezuela, organic sales growth would have been almost 1.5 percentage points higher in the latest quarter, Colgate said. Colgate still executes “very well on a number of fronts, though this seems to be reflected in the shares,” said Oppenheimer analyst Joseph Altobello. He kept a “perform” rating on the stock, adding that investors should “act opportunistically on pullbacks.” Colgate shares were down 2.6 percent at $107.92 after falling as low as $106.74. Meanwhile, Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N), which competes with P&G; and is also cutting jobs, topped expectations even as sales declined. Its shares fell 1.4 percent to $87.05, recovering from a steeper drop earlier in the day. Colgate’s sales rose 1.5 percent as volume fell 1.5 percent and prices increased 5 percent in Latin America - Colgate’s biggest market with 29 percent of overall sales. Organic sales in Latin America rose 4 percent, considerably less than the 9 percent rise posted in the third quarter and 14.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. “What was striking to us in the quarter was the significant toll that the tough Venezuelan operating environment had on the firm’s results,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. An increasingly difficult economic and labor environment in Venezuela hurt both volume and gross profit, Colgate said. The company dealt with a labor slowdown at its Venezuelan factory during the quarter and believes a number of other companies faced labor issues there as well. Venezuelan business leaders have complained that the uncertainty over President Hugo Chavez’s prolonged absence, saying policy decisions have led to growing economic imbalances. A devaluation of the bolivar currency would make Venezuelan exports more competitive by lowering local production costs and spur domestic industries by making imports less competitive. Operations in Venezuela are basically back to historical levels and sales have bounced back to levels seen consistent with Colgate’s plans, Chief Executive Officer Ian Cook said on a conference call. Colgate, which has said it will cut about 6 percent of its workforce in a restructuring announced in October, spent more on advertising for its toothpaste and other products. It earned $598 million, or $1.26 per share, in the fourth quarter, up slightly from $590 million, or $1.21 per share, in the quarter a year earlier. Excluding after tax charges from the restructuring and costs from the sale of land in Mexico, Colgate earned $1.41 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.5 percent to $4.29 billion, missing analysts’ target of $4.31 billion. The volume of goods sold increased 1.5 percent and prices rose 2.5 percent. Colgate expects 2013 earnings to grow at a double-digit clip, excluding factors such as restructuring charges and potential currency devaluations or macroeconomic changes. It also still expects organic sales to rise about 6 percent to 7 percent this year. The 2012 restructuring plan, including a 6 percent reduction in the workforce by the end of 2016, is on track, Colgate said. It plans to take $775 million to $875 million in aftertax restructuring charges and expects to save $275 million to $325 million aftertax annually by the fourth year of the plan.

42,CL,Venezuelan currency devaluation to cut Colgate's profit,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) said on Monday that it expects to incur a one-time loss of $120 million, or 25 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2013, related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. In addition, Colgate expects earnings to be reduced by 5 cents to 7 cents per share per quarter in 2013, due to the translation of financial statements at the new Venezuelan exchange rate. Venezuela accounts for about 5 percent of Colgate’s total sales. The devaluation will not have any impact on its 2012 results, or its financial position, the New York-based toothpaste maker said. Venezuela devalued its bolivar currency by 32 percent on Friday in a widely expected move that will shore up government finances after ailing President Hugo Chavez’s blowout election-year spending in 2012 but will also spur galloping inflation. It was the country’s fifth devaluation in a decade. Since January 1, 2010, Colgate has designated Venezuela hyper-inflationary and therefore all foreign currency fluctuations are recorded in income, the company said. Monday’s announcement comes after Colgate turned in disappointing fourth-quarter results in Latin America, due largely to economic and labor problems in Venezuela. An increasingly difficult economic and labor environment in Venezuela hurt both volume and gross profit in the fourth quarter, Colgate said on January 31.

46,CL,Colgate profit meets Wall Street expectations,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co’s (CL.N) profit matched Wall Street expectations and sales were better than expected, easing concerns a day after rival Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) appeared to be under pressure. Shares of Colgate were up 2 percent to $120.34 on Thursday after falling nearly 3 percent Wednesday, when P&G; reported lighter-than-anticipated sales and said profit would fall more than analysts estimated this quarter. Robert Campagnino, managing director at Hedgeye Risk Management, said a bit of a “relief” rally was to be expected after Colgate’s strong sales and in-line profit. Still, Colgate shares already trade at a high multiple and good news appeared to be factored into the stock price, he added. Analysts expressed concerns about declines in sales, volume and operating profit at its Hill’s pet food business. Colgate has said it wants to improve the operation with some higher-end products. Colgate, best known for its namesake toothpaste, said it raised some prices and spent more to advertise new products while cutting costs. Colgate goes head-to-head against P&G; in toothpaste, toothbrushes and soaps. It also competes against Europe’s Unilever (ULVR.L)(UNc.AS), which posted weaker-than-expected first-quarter growth on Thursday. February’s devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar led Colgate to take a hefty charge in the quarter and to plan for additional charges later in the year. For U.S. companies that do business in the country, the devaluation meant their earnings in bolivars were worth less when converted back to dollars. In February, Venezuela devalued the bolivar by 32 percent, requiring Colgate to adjust its balance sheet to the new rate. The New York-based company had already warned the revaluation would cut earnings by as much as 7 cents per share per quarter. On Thursday, it said it expected the impact of the currency devaluation to be 5 cents to 7 cents per quarter. The company affirmed its forecast of 2013 earnings-per-share growth of 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent on a dollar basis. That equates to earnings of roughly $5.65 to $5.71 per share, while analysts were looking for $5.70, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding aftertax charges of $111 million from Venezuela and $55 million from restructuring, Colgate earned $626 million, or $1.32 per share, matching the average analyst target. On a net basis, first-quarter profit fell to $460 million, or 97 cents per share, from $593 million, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2.5 percent to $4.32 billion, topping the analysts’ estimate of $4.29 billion. The volume of goods sold rose 4 percent, and pricing was up 1.5 percent. Organic sales, which strip out the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 6 percent. Sales in Latin America, Colgate’s biggest market, were up 1 percent on a net basis and 9 percent on an organic basis.

51,CL,Colgate-Palmolive lowers profit view as dollar gains,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) cut its 2013 profit forecast due to the stronger dollar as it posted a lower second-quarter net profit on Thursday, citing restructuring and other charges. The toothpaste maker’s earnings, excluding items, were in line with Wall Street’s expectations, despite slightly weaker-than-anticipated sales growth. Still, New York-based Colgate said its sales and margins should keep rising this year as it promotes new products such as Colgate Sensitive SmartFoam with Whitening toothpaste. Its shares were up 1.6 percent at $59.47. A strong dollar represents a double whammy for U.S.-based companies like Colgate. The company generates most of its sales outside the United States. So when those overseas revenues are brought home and translated into dollars, the U.S. currency’s strength reduces their bookable value and results in lower reported earnings. The higher dollar also increases production costs versus foreign rivals, making U.S. products less competitive in international markets. Colgate’s rivals such as Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) also have vast international businesses, including in Europe where economic pressure persists. On Monday, Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) said the stronger U.S. dollar may hurt its results more than it previously expected. Also on Thursday, Europe’s Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) posted weaker-than-anticipated quarterly sales growth, and said growth in emerging markets was slowing. Colgate’s organic sales, which strip out the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 5.5 percent, with the biggest gains in North America, Asia and Africa, and a jump at its Hill’s pet food business as it brought out new pet foods. In Latin America, its biggest market by far, Colgate continued to be hurt by the impact of February’s devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. That contributed to a 1.5 percent net sales decrease in Latin America and a lower operating profit there. Organic sales in Latin America, rose 7 percent, after rising 9 percent in the first quarter. That growth slowed less than feared, said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher. For U.S. companies that do business in Venezuela, the devaluation meant their earnings in bolivars were worth less when converted back to dollars. The U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies in the last four to six weeks of the quarter, leading Colgate to cut its 2013 earnings guidance by 1 percentage point. Colgate now expects earnings per share to rise 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent for the year. Venezuela accounts for about 5 percent of Colgate’s total sales. The company warned earlier this year that the devaluation would trim earnings each quarter, as it translates its financial statements at the newer exchange rate. P&G;, the world’s largest household products maker, cited volatility in Venezuela and elsewhere in April when it said that its profit would fall more than Wall Street was anticipating. It is due to post its quarterly results on August 1. Colgate’s sales in Europe and the South Pacific fell 3 percent, due to factors such as lower prices and sales declines in France and Greece. Colgate expects limited growth in Europe for the “foreseeable future,” Chairman and Chief Executive Ian Cook said on a conference call. Second-quarter net income fell to $561 million, or 60 cents per share, from $627 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding 10 cents per share in after-tax charges, Colgate earned 70 cents per share, in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1.9 percent to $4.35 billion, less than the $4.39 billion that analysts expected. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered sales by 3 percentage points. Pricing rose 1 percent. Colgate still expects its gross profit margin to improve by 0.3 to 0.7 percentage points this year, Cook said on the call.

52,CL,Colgate-Palmolive lowers profit view on Latam woes,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) on Thursday posted lower quarterly profit as the impact of the stronger dollar pressured its international business, and the toothpaste maker lowered its 2013 earnings forecast as Latin American sales slipped. It said sales rose 1.9 percent to $4.35 billion, below the $4.39 billion that analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered sales by 3 percentage points. Pricing rose 1 percent. Organic sales, which strip out the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 5.5 percent, with the biggest gains in North America, Asia and Africa, and a jump in business at its Hill’s pet food business. But Colgate continued to be hurt by the impact of February’s devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. That contributed to a 1.5 percent sales decrease in Latin America, its biggest market by far, and a lower operating profit there. For U.S. companies that do business in the country, the devaluation meant their earnings in bolivars were worth less when converted back to dollars. Colgate now expects earnings per share to rise 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent for the year, down 1 percentage point from its previous forecast range because of the bolivar devaluation and recent volatility in other exchanges. Sales in Europe and the South Pacific fell 3 percent, largely because of lower pricing. The consumer products maker said profit fell to $561 million, or 60 per share, from $627 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Colgate earned 70 cents per share, in line with analysts’ estimates.

55,CL,Colgate-Palmolive quarterly profit edges higher,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive reported slightly higher third-quarter earnings on Thursday as it spent more on advertising and posted strong sales growth in Latin America, yet failed to show robust growth at home. Its shares fell 2 percent in morning trading. The toothpaste maker still expects its annual profit to rise 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent, assuming foreign exchange rates remain fairly stable. It is targeting double-digit earnings-per- share growth for 2014, excluding restructuring charges. “Colgate continues to execute well on a number of fronts, though this seems to be reflected in the shares,” Oppenheimer analyst Joseph Altobello said. Growth in the latest quarter met Wall Street’s expectations with some help from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate and stock repurchases. Shares of New York-based Colgate were down about 1 percent at $62.86 in morning trading after falling to $61.95. Its sales rose 1.5 percent to $4.4 billion, short of analysts’ expectations, while Wall Street’s target was $4.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, were up 6 percent. In North America, organic sales rose just 1.5 percent, after rising 5 percent in the second quarter and 2.5 percent in the third quarter of 2012. Still, North American operating profit jumped 15 percent as the company continued its long-standing cost-cutting program and advertising spending decreased due to the timing of product launches. “The slowdown in North American sales raises questions,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty said, adding that Colgate was able to offset operating weakness in Latin America, its largest market, with profit growth in North America and Europe/South Pacific. In Latin America, which accounts for 29 percent of Colgate’s sales, organic sales rose 9.5 percent, a stronger showing than in the first two quarters of the year. Operating profit in Latin America declined 5 percent due to higher costs in Venezuela and elsewhere. Business in Venezuela has been hurt by February’s devaluation of the nation’s bolivar. Advertising spending rose 6 percent from a year earlier, and Colgate said it planned to keep spending for the rest of the year. It is promoting new products such as Colgate Optic White toothpaste and Hill’s Prescription Diet Metabolic pet food around the world. Colgate said it had earned $656 million, or 70 cents per share, up slightly from $654 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.

58,CL,Preview: Colgate at Wake Forest,"After a 34-60 mark in three seasons under coach Jeff Bzdelik, Wake Forest looks for a quick start to the new year as it hosts Colgate on Friday. The Demon Deacons return four starters and Bzdelik is looking for his core players to draw from the experience of an up-and-down 2012-13 season. “They’re older, they’re wiser, they’re stronger, they’re more mature,” he told the Winston-Salem Journal. “They gained a valuable understanding of what’s expected of one to win at this level.” Forward Travis McKie, who averaged 13.5 points and 7.0 rebounds last season returns for his senior year and should become the focal point of the offense for the Demon Deacons with C.J. Harris lost to graduation. With Notre Dame, Pittsburgh and Syracuse joining the Atlantic Coast Conference this season, Wake Forest will have its work cut out and Bzdelik may very well find himself on the hot seat without significant improvement. The Raiders welcome back three starters from a year ago, including their leading scorer in forward Murphy Burnatowski and guard Luke Roh, who led the team in assists and rebounding last season, and look to be a contender in the Patriot League. TV: 7 p.m. ET, ESPN3 ABOUT COLGATE (2012-13: 11-21, 5-9 Patriot League): Burnatowski returns after averaging 17.4 points last year to rank third in the conference. Fellow senior Pat Moore, who complemented Burnatowski’s output averaging 9.8 points, is also back, giving the Raiders their top two scorers from a year ago. Colgate has high hopes for a pair of transfers in center Ethan Jacobs from Ohio and guard Austin Tillotson, who joins the Raiders from Monmouth. ABOUT WAKE FOREST (2012-13: 13-18, 6-12 ACC): With Harris gone, the Demon Deacons will look to last season’s leading distributor, Codi Miller-McIntyre and post-graduate transfer Coron Williams, an established 3-point threat out of Robert Morris, to man the backcourt. Williams has the ability, striking from beyond the arc at a 42 percent clip for the Colonials over the course of the last three seasons. Defense was a problem for Wake Forest last year, ranking at or near the bottom of the conference in almost every category. TIP-INS 1. The Demon Deacons are 2-0 all-time against Colgate, though the teams have not met since 1957. 2. The Raiders ranked third among Patriot League teams a year ago, averaging 35.2 rebounds. 3. Wake Forest ranked second in the ACC, averaging 7.1 steals last season, trailing only North Carolina (8.4).

Freshman point guard Tyler Ennis scored 12 points on four 3-pointers, and backup Michael Gbinije added 11 points and six rebounds. Ethan Jacobs scored 13 points and was the lone Colgate player in double figures as the Raiders (0-2) lost to their second consecutive ACC opponent to open the season.

61,CL,Preview: Colgate at Syracuse,"Colgate and Syracuse may be in close proximity on a map, but the two couldn’t be further apart when it comes to basketball. The Raiders make their annual trek to face the Orange on Saturday, and Colgate has little reason to hope the outcome will be any different than the previous 47. Syracuse is ranked No. 7 in the country and has won its first two games by an average of 18.5 points. The Orange has met the small liberal-arts college located 40 miles away in Hamilton, N.Y., 165 times, winning 120. That includes an 87-51 Orange victory last November that has been typical of the series since Jim Boeheim took over in 1976. Colgate has never won over that time and finished within single digits just twice. TV: 4:30 p.m. ET, ACC Regional Network ABOUT COLGATE (0-1): The Raiders will be playing their second straight ACC opponent after losing 89-78 at Wake Forest in their season opener. Six Colgate players scored in double figures - including all five starters - against the Demon Deacons, led by Pat Moore’s 17 points. Unfortunately for Colgate, those were the only players who scored. ABOUT THE ORANGE (2-0): As is the norm under Boeheim, Syracuse is easing it way into the season against lesser competition and doesn’t play a true road game until Dec. 15 at St. John’s. The Orange do, however, begin play at the Maui Invitational later this month, and have to be careful not to get too anxious about leaving their snowy surroundings for the beach and look past Colgate. That seems unlikely, with returning leading scorer C.J. Fair picking up where he left off with 45 points in two games. TIP-INS 1. Syracuse tried to change the time of the game to avoid overlapping with the football team’s contest against No. 2 Florida State, but was unable to do so because of television commitments. 2. Colgate’s last win in the series was a 67-63 decision Feb. 24, 1962. 3. Fair struggled last season against the Raiders, scoring eight points on 2-of-7 shooting.

64,CL,Colgate's profit beats estimates due to cost cuts,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), the world’s largest toothpaste maker, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as cost cuts offset the negative impact of a stronger dollar. Colgate’s gross margins rose in the fourth quarter as it cut costs by negotiating better lease terms with suppliers, using cheaper raw material and reducing packaging material in products. “The company continues to deliver solid results, despite macro challenges - which is impressive,” JPMorgan analyst John Faucher wrote in a note. Launch of higher-margin products, redesigning of some brands and introduction of successful regional products in other markets helped the company grow its sales. Colgate, which controls about 45 percent of the global toothpaste market, said it expected its 2014 adjusted earnings to be in line with analysts’ estimates. Analysts on average are expecting a profit of $3.08 per share in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Colgate Chief Executive Ian Cook said he expected the company’s organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, to grow 5-7 percent in 2014. Gross margins are expected to increase by 75-125 basis points, he told analysts on a conference call. The company reported gross margins of 58.6 percent for 2013. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to hurt sales by 3 percent and profit by 4-5 percent in 2014, Cook said. Faucher said Colgate’s profit guidance was “fine,” as there were concerns that a stronger dollar would have a greater impact on the company’s profit. Rival Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said last week that it would not change its 2014 forecast and that it expected organic sales to grow 3-4 percent. Colgate’s organic sales rose 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter ended December 31, led by growth in emerging markets. In Latin America, its biggest market by sales, organic revenue rose 12.5 percent mainly due to new products such as Colgate Luminous White Advanced and Colgate Total Professional Gum Health. Organic revenue in Asia, including India and China, grew 9 percent due to higher sales of products such as Darlie Expert White toothpastes and Palmolive Naturals White + Milk bar soap. The company said its global volumes grew 6.5 percent, but pricing was flat. Pricing is expected to rise about 2 percent in 2014, Colgate said. Net profit fell to $564 million, or 60 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $598 million, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. The company earned 75 cents per share, excluding a $133 million aftertax charge related to restructuring. Revenue rose 2 percent to $4.36 billion.

Colgate said it expected a one-time loss of 19 to 21 cents per share if Sicad (Supplementary System For The Administration Of Foreign Currency) rate remains at 11.70 in the first quarter. Venezuela’s central bank devalued the Sicad, one of two rates in the country’s currency control system, by 3 percent to 11.7 bolivars per dollar on Saturday. Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, last week cut its sales and earnings forecast for the year to reflect unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Venezuela and in various developing markets. Colgate said on Tuesday it expected earnings to be reduced by 3-4 cents per share in the first quarter. Chief Executive Ian Cook said last month foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to hurt sales by 3 percent and profit by 4-5 percent in 2014. The company, which receives about 4 percent of its net revenue from Venezuela, had warned that the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency would result in a one-time loss of $120 million for the first quarter of 2013. Through its subsidiary in Venezuela, the Company is invested in U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds and fixed interest rate bonds.",2182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/colgate-venezuela/colgate-warns-of-loss-from-venezuelan-currency-devaluation-idUSL3N0LN5IR20140218
68,CL,Fitch Rates Colgate's $1B Notes 'AA-',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA-' rating to  Colgate-Palmolive Company's (Colgate) 1.75% $500 million medium-term notes due  March 15, 2019 and 3.25% $500 million medium-term notes due March 15, 2024. The  company plans to use $600 million of the proceeds to repay and retire the 1.25%  $250 million medium-term notes due May 1, 2014 and the 4.75% Eur250 million  medium-term notes due June 13, 2014.  The remainder will be used for general  corporate purposes including repaying outstanding commercial paper (CP)  balances.  As of Dec. 31, 2013, Colgate had no outstanding CP but typically has  significant balances inter-quarter. The new notes are issued under the company's 1992 indenture and may be redeemed  at Colgate's option. Given Colgate's high credit quality, repurchase upon change  of control language has not been included in any notes to date.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Scale, Strong Credit Measures The ratings reflect the company's scale with more than $17 billion in revenues  at Dec. 31, 2013, leading market shares, consistently strong operating  performance, and considerable liquidity. Colgate's adjusted EBITDA margin of  approximately 27% is in the top tier of large personal care manufacturers. The  company generated $1.1 billion free cash flow (cash flow from operations minus  capital expenditures and dividends) last year. Leverage ended at 1.2x, meeting  Fitch's expectations, and has been at this level or less in each of the past six  years. Colgate's leverage is expected to remain in this range through the medium  term.   Geographic Diversification Colgate is one of the most geographically diversified consumer products  companies, generating more than 75% of its revenues outside the United States.  More than half of Colgate's revenues are generated from developing markets.  Latin America (approximately 29% of revenues and adjusted operating profit  before corporate expenses) is a particular stronghold where the company  maintains very high toothpaste and toothbrush shares of more than 40% (Nielsen  Holdings, N.V.). The ratings also encompass volatility in revenues and profits  from developing markets.   Significant Liquidity, Manageable Debt The company is highly liquid with a $1.85 billion un-utilized five-year bank  facility expiring in November 2018, a 364-day $145 million revolver maturing in  November 2014, more than $962 million in cash, and considerable access to the  capital markets. The 364-day revolver is likely to be extended as it provides  additional support to the company's large CP program. During the quarter,  Colgate's CP outstanding can approach total revolver commitments.  For example,  average daily balances during 2013 were $1.7 billion. Debt balances of $5.7 billion increased modestly over last year's $5.2 billion.   Fitch does not expect debt balances to increase markedly. Long-term debt  maturities over the next four years are modest in relation to Colgate's  substantial cash flow with $895 million, the largest amount, due in 2014.  The  bulk of the $895 million is being refinanced with the current issuances.  Less  than $500 million is due annually in 2015 and 2016.  Much of these balances are  expected to be refinanced as the company manages its capital structure. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Future developments that may lead to a positive rating action include:  A positive rating action is not likely as Colgate manages its financial metrics  and performance commensurate with the current category. Fitch notes that Colgate  executes sizeable share repurchase programs and/or medium-sized acquisitions  whenever credit protection measures drift towards a higher rating category.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  A negative rating action is not expected given Colgate's low business risk and  conservative management team. While Colgate's credit protection measures are  solid there is little room for further increases in leverage within this rating  category.  Fitch currently rates Colgate as follows:  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA-'; --Short-term IDR 'F1+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'AA-'; --Revolving credit facilities 'AA-'; --CP program 'F1+'.

The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency has hurt many companies including Ford Motor Co, Procter & Gamble Co  and Mondelez International Inc, the maker of Cadbury and Oreo, as it reduces the value of sales in the Latin American country. Colgate, which controls nearly 45 percent of the global toothpaste market, booked an after-tax charge of $174 million due to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange, lower than its February estimate of $180 million-$200 million. The company said it expects such charges to continue, hurting earnings by about 3 cents per share per quarter during 2014. Latin America is the company’s biggest market by sales. Procter & Gamble, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said on Wednesday its quarterly earnings were hurt by 10 cents per share due to the changes in Venezuela. Colgate’s net profit fell to $388 million, or 42 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $460 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the maker of Colgate toothpaste earned 68 cents per share, in line with analysts’ average estimate. Sales rose marginally to $4.33 billion, slightly above the average analyst estimate of $4.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 6.5 percent, helped by strong sales in emerging markets. Organic sales in emerging markets rose 10 percent in the quarter. Mondelez said on Tuesday it would have to readjust its balance sheet to reflect the bolivar’s devaluation resulting in a charge of $140 million in the quarter ended March 31. Ford reported a 39 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday, as it had to readjust its balance sheet for currency devaluations in Venezuela. Colgate’s shares closed at $66.43 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The stock has risen about 12.7 percent in the year to Thursday’s close.

73,CL,UPDATE 4-P&G; to exit Duracell battery business; quarterly sales dip,"(Adds impact of strong dollar, Colgate earnings, updates shares) By Nandita Bose and Sruthi Ramakrishnan Oct 24 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co on Friday said it would sell its Duracell battery business, probably through a split-off into a separate company, as it looks to focus on faster-growing brands. P&G; shares rose about 3 percent as investors shrugged off a marginal fall in quarterly sales and warning that a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings this quarter. A surging U.S. currency, reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars. P&G; and Colgate-Palmolive Co, which on Friday reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings forecast, are the latest companies to be hurt by a stronger dollar. Emerging markets generate about 50 percent of Colgate’s sales and about 39 percent of P&G;’s revenue comes from developing markets. The world’s No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands in the next two years. Duracell, the world’s No. 1 battery business, was widely considered to be one of the largest assets that P&G; was likely to divest. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer John Moeller said the company had sold or discontinued 11 brands in the latest quarter and 25 in the last five quarters. Analysts expect it to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products, among others. Demand for Duracell’s mainstay non-rechargeable, disposable alkaline batteries has waned while a worldwide explosion in electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries. P&G;, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it would first sell its interest in a China-based battery joint venture for an undisclosed amount and then exit Duracell completely. The company said it was looking to split Duracell off into a stand-alone company but would consider alternatives that offer better value to shareholders. Under the split-off, expected in the second half of 2015, P&G; shareholders would be able to exchange some, none or all of their stock for shares of Duracell. P&G; said it expected the percentage growth in its net sales in fiscal 2015 to be little changed or rise in the low single digits, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from a strong dollar. Net income attributable to P&G; fell to $1.99 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30 from $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings, excluding the currency impact, were $1.07 per share, in line with the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales dipped to $20.79 billion from $20.83 billion due to currency fluctuations and divestitures. Organic sales, excluding those effects, increased 2 percent. Shares of P&G; were up 2.6 percent at $85.41 at midday.

74,CL,"Colgate profit down on weak Brazil, China demand; warns on dollar","(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings forecast, hurt by weak demand in Brazil and China and a stronger U.S. dollar. Shares of the company, whose profit has fallen in four of the past six quarters, fell 2 percent before the bell on Friday. The stronger dollar will slow the company’s full-year profit per share growth to 3-4 percent, Colgate said. It had previously expected a 4-5 percent growth. U.S. companies with big international operations are having to adjust to a new environment after more than a decade of reaping the benefits of a relatively weak dollar on earnings. Emerging markets, which generate about 50 percent of Colgate’s net sales, have weakened in the past few months, with Brazil slipping into recession and China facing what is said to be its worst slowdown in 24 years. Colgate, which controls nearly 45 percent of the global toothpaste market, said net sales in Latin America fell 4.5 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the world’s largest household products maker, reported a slight fall in quarterly sales on Friday and said a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings in the current quarter.  Colgate’s net income fell to $542 million, or 59 cents per share, in the quarter, from $656 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier.  Worldwide net sales fell marginally to $4.38 billion.

77,CL,Preview: Colgate at Arizona State,"Arizona State returns home to face Colgate on Saturday after a pair of disappointing losses in the CBE Hall of Fame Classic marred by poor free-throw shooting and an inability to put games away. The Sun Devils led each contest with less than three minutes to play before falling to Maryland 78-73 on Monday and Alabama 76-71 on Tuesday, making a combined 23-of-37 from the line. Arizona State also led at the half in both games after winning 38 of its previous 43 such contests. Eric Jacobsen, a 6-10 junior forward, has emerged as the Sun Devils’ top player by averaging 11 points and eight rebounds, and acknowledged to reporters that “we have to do better with the end-of-the-game stuff.” Arizona State has won 11 straight at home - their longest such streak since a 13-game run spanning the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons. The Raiders have lost four of their first five games, with every contest decided by six points or fewer. TV: 9 p.m. ET, Pac-12 Network ABOUT COLGATE (1-4): The Raiders, who are coming off a 75-71 loss to Albany on Wednesday in their home opener, are led by Damon Sherman-Newsome (18.6 points per game), a 6-5 senior guard from Anchorage, Alaska. Junior guard Austin Tillotson (12.6) is the only other player scoring in double figures and averages four assists, while senior forward Matt McMullen paces Colgate on the boards (5.8 rebounds per game), where the Raiders have a minus-3.4 margin. The remainder of Colgate’s non-conference schedule includes a trip to No. 17 Ohio State on Dec. 6 and its annual 40-mile trek to Syracuse on Dec. 22. ABOUT ARIZONA STATE (3-2): Jacobsen has filled the void down low left by Jordan Bachynski and has 10 blocks in five games after swatting a combined 16 in his first two seasons. The Sun Devils have five players - led by senior Jonathan Gilling at 12 points per game - scoring at least 7.8 and averaging at least 15 minutes. Shaquielle McKissic, a 24-year-old 6-5 senior guard, struggled with a combined eight points while going 4-of-10 from the free-throw line in the CBE Hall of Fame Classic games after scoring 20 points in the season opener and 10 in the Sun Devils’ third contest. TIP-INS 1. The Sun Devils have had a different leading scorer in each of their five games. 2. Arizona State averages a plus-six rebounding differential. 3.

80,CL,Preview: Colgate at Ohio State,"Ohio State looks to bounce back from its first loss of the season and wrap up a perfect run through the Buckeye Classic when the 13th-ranked Buckeyes host Colgate on Saturday. Ohio State is coming off a 64-55 loss at No. 5 Louisville on Tuesday in which the Buckeyes carved a 19-point deficit to four before falling short. The Raiders are off to a 1-6 start, but all of their losses have come by seven points or fewer. Ohio State has sailed through its first three games in the round-robin Buckeye Classic, beating Sacred Heart, Campbell and James Madison by an average of 34 points. The Raiders have gone 1-2 in the event, beating Campbell but losing to James Madison and Sacred Heart. The teams have split two all-time meetings with the most recent coming during the 1980-81 season. TV: 4:30 p.m., Big Ten Network ABOUT COLGATE (1-6): The Raiders let a five-point lead get away in the final three minutes of Wednesday’s 71-70 home loss to Sacred Heart. Leading scorer Damon Sherman-Newsome (16.3 points) played only 11 minutes and was limited to six points in that contest after suffering an injury midway through the first half. Guard Austin Tillotson (14.3 points) and center Ethan Jacobs (10.0 points) picked up the slack against Sacred Heart, but the Raiders need Sherman-Newsome, a 45.7 percent shooter from 3-point range, to be at full strength to have a shot against the Buckeyes. ABOUT OHIO STATE (5-1): The Buckeyes need to get back on track at the offensive end after shooting a season-low 30.4 percent from the floor against Louisville. Freshman guard D’Angelo Russell has made a splash in his first six collegiate games, averaging a team-high 17.8 points to go with 5.5 assists, and he and senior point guard Shannon Scott (8.2 points, 8.8 assists) give the Buckeyes two excellent ball-handlers. Sophomore forward Marc Loving (12.2 points) has scored in double digits in five of six games this season, and senior forward Sam Thompson (11.2 points, 5.0 rebounds) is Ohio State’s top offensive player in the post. TIP-INS 1. In each of its five wins, Ohio State has led at halftime, outrebounded its opponent, shot for a higher percentage and scored 70 or more points. 2. The Buckeyes have won eight straight home games, including all five this season, and haven’t lost a non-conference contest at home since falling to then-No. 9 Kansas on Dec. 22, 2012. 3.

82,CL,UPDATE 2-France fines household product firms $1.2 bln for price fixing,"(Adds background, comments) By James Regan PARIS, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The French competition authority slapped fines worth 951 million euros ($1.2 billion) on household goods makers on Thursday over price fixing in supermarkets between 2003 and 2006. The watchdog announced sanctions totaling 345.2 million euros on cleaning products makers Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever , Procter & Gamble , Reckitt Benckiser, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire. It announced a further 605.9 million euros of fines relating to personal hygiene products against Colgate, Henkel, Unilever, P&G;, Reckitt, Sara Lee, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, L’Oreal , Beiersdorf and Vania. The watchdog said the companies had coordinated their  commercial policies and, in particular, agreed on price increases. “These two sanctions are among the most significant imposed to date by the competition authority,” it said. French cosmetics giant L’Oreal, which faces the biggest share of the fines at 189.5 million euros, denied anticompetitive behaviour and said it would appeal the decision. “L’Oreal is extremely surprised by this decision and the amount of the fine, which are totally out of proportion,” it said in a statement. Anglo-Dutch company Unilever, whose fines total 172.5 million euros, said it will also appeal. American firm P&G;, on the hook for 154 million for Gillette and other businesses, said it will review the ruling, while   Germany’s Henkel, which faces fines of 109 million euros, said it would decide on further steps after examining the decision, adding that it had made provisions of 39 million. Reckitt Benckiser said it had cooperated with the authorities and that it had made a provision in 2013 which would be sufficient for the 121 million in fines it faces. Germany’s Beiersdorf said it had been notified of its fine, totaling 72 million euros, while Johnson & Johnson , being fined 8 million euros, said it had fully cooperated with the authorities. Other companies were not immediately available. Whistleblowers SC Johnson, Colgate and Henkel will benefit from varying degrees of clemency, the French competition authority added in a statement, with SC Johnson receiving total immunity. In addition, companies owned by Unilever, J&J;, Henkel, Reckitt, Colgate, P&G; and Beiersdorf benefited from 16-18 percent reductions in the fines after they did not contest the facts and pledged to conform to the rules in the future.

83,CL,Preview: Colgate at Syracuse,"If the season’s first month was any indication, Syracuse may be spending its postseason in the NIT. Still, despite his team having lost three of its last four games, Jim Boeheim refuses to think that far ahead, as the 70-year-old coach remains focused on Monday’s home date with Colgate. “I’m not worried about (the NCAA Tournament),” Boeheim said after Saturday’s overtime loss to No. 7 Villanova. “I’m not even thinking about that. I’m thinking about playing Colgate.” The Orange held a five-point advantage with less than 11 seconds left in regulation before the Wildcats rallied to tie en route to an overtime victory. Syracuse will need to be more disciplined against Colgate after committing 27 fouls and 20 turnovers against Villanova. History is on the side of the Orange, who have won 48 straight meetings with the Raiders. TV: 7 p.m. ET, ESPNU ABOUT COLGATE (3-8): The Raiders rank poorly in most statistical categories, but particularly in blocks, where they are 325th out of 351 Division I teams with 1.8 per game. Nobody has more than the seven blocks recorded by Ethan Jacobs and Matt McMullen. Damon Sherman-Newsome (14.8 points) and Austin Tillotson (12.8) are the double-digit scorers for Colgate, and each is dangerous from 3-point range. ABOUT SYRACUSE (6-4): The Orange could use a better effort from freshman Chris McCullough, who was 0-of-4 from the field against Villanova and finished with three points and four turnovers before fouling out. Several Syracuse players are coming off a strong showing against the Wildcats, including Rakeem Christmas, who scored 18 points and is averaging a team-high 16.6 points. Christmas has scored in double figures nine times in 10 games and has shot at least 50 percent from the field nine times. TIP-INS 1. Since scoring a combined 38 points in the first two games this month, Colgate C Ethan Jacobs has totaled 21 points in the last three games. 2. Syracuse won last year’s meeting 69-50 and has not lost to Colgate since 1965. 3. Orange freshman PG Kaleb Joseph had a career-high 10 assists against Villanova but also had four turnovers. He has multiple turnovers in every game this season, including 12 in his last two outings.

Syracuse (7-4), which had lost three of its previous four games, had no problems in remaining undefeated against Colgate (3-9) since 1962. The Orange, who entered as one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in the nation, went 10-of-20 from behind the arc, led by Cooney (4-of-9) and reserve Ron Patterson (3-of-6).

Damon Sherman-Newsome scored 13 points and Austin Tillotson had 11 to pace the Raiders. Syracuse began to take control with a 16-0 run that Gbinije and Cooney capped with back-to-back 3-pointers, pushing the lead to 22-5 about eight minutes into the game.

Cooney had 14 first-half points and the Orange did not turn over the ball in the opening 20 minutes. Tillotson opened the second half with a bucket before Syracuse scored the next 10 points, starting with another 3-pointer by Cooney.

85,CL,"Colgate reports rise in key sales metric, sees margins improving","(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) on Thursday reported a rise in an important sales metric, sending its shares up 6 percent as investors shrugged off a lowered earnings forecast.    The consumer products maker, which controls nearly 45 percent of the global toothpaste business, said fourth-quarter organic sales, which exclude the effects of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments, rose 6 percent because of higher volumes and better pricing.  Chief Executive Officer Ian Cook said on a conference call that sales volumes increased in all emerging markets despite the price hikes Colgate took to offset a strengthening dollar. Cook also said Colgate expected gross profit margins to increase by 50 to 100 basis points in 2015 as it benefits from lower prices for oil and other commodities.  In the fourth quarter, gross margin fell 30 basis points to 58.8 percent from a year earlier due to higher raw material and packaging costs stemming in large part from unfavorable currency fluctuations.  Net sales suffered because of the strong dollar and weak demand in markets such as Brazil and Europe.  Net sales in Latin America, Colgate’s biggest market, fell 6 percent. Sales were down 7.5 percent in Europe and 10 percent in Africa but rose 4.5 percent in Asia. Cook said foreign exchange volatility would remain a challenge in 2015. The rise in the dollar over the past nearly nine months has reduced the value of overseas sales. A stronger dollar also makes U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and lowers demand. Rival Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Tuesday that it no longer expected sales and core earnings to grow this year, blaming a strong dollar for its disappointing results and forecast.

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to the lowest level since 2000. The strong data comes a day after the Federal Reserve downgraded its view of the U.S. labor market and economy in a policy statement that suggested the central bank may have to wait until at least the third quarter to begin raising interest rates. “I think we’re going to see cleaner data come out in the second quarter and with the jobless claims being at their lowest levels in 15 years, that certainly points towards a strengthening labor market which has been a clear focus point of the Fed,” said Mark Luschini, chief market strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. S&P; 500 e-mini futures were down 4.25 points and their fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a lower open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures fell 35 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures lost 20.5 points. ConocoPhillips fell 0.6 percent to $68.45 in premarket trading after it reported a sharp fall in quarterly profit, hurt by a steep decline in crude oil prices. Companies continue to cite the strong dollar for cutting forecast, which has climbed nearly 9 percent against a basket of major currencies from January to March. Colgate-Palmolive fell 1.7 percent to $67.30 after cutting its full-year profit forecast for the second time, saying the impact of the dollar would worsen. Automotive supplier BorgWarner also cited the dollar for a fall in quarterly revenue. Its stock dropped 4 percent to $58.50.

93,CL,"WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory orders rebound solidly, but trend still soft","(Adds details, background, analyst comments, updates markets) * Factory orders rise 2.1 percent on transportation * Orders excluding transportation unchanged * March core capital goods orders revised up By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar. The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter’s abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather. “It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year,” said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment. Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February’s 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms. That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter. The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year. The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year. Companies like Schlumberger, the world’s No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices. Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world’s largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp, the world’s largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar. The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month. “Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession,” said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices.” Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories  rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines. Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.

The company’s shares fell as much as 3.4 percent on Friday. Colgate has been trying to cushion the impact of the dollar’s strength by raising prices, mainly in Latin America,     but the move has hit both revenue and volumes in the region. Sales in Latin America fell 11 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, while volumes fell 1 percent on the back of a 12 percent hike in pricing. The region accounts for 27 percent of the company’s sales. Overall volumes rose 1 percent in the third quarter, their slowest rise in almost five years. The effects of higher pricing needs to work its way through for volumes to improve, which is not likely to happen this year, Chief Executive Ian Cook said on a call with analysts. Foreign exchange had a 13 percent negative impact on total sales, Colgate said on Friday. Colgate relies on international markets for about 77 percent of its oral, personal and home-care sales. The company said it now expected full-year earnings per share to decline by a “low to mid-single digit”, excluding items, based on current exchange rates. The earlier forecast was for a “low single-digit” decline. Colgate extended its 2012 restructuring program by a year to Dec. 31, 2017, and said the funds it received from the sale of its laundry detergent business in South Pacific would be invested in the program. Colgate’s total sales fell 8.7 percent to $4 billion in the latest quarter - the fifth straight decline, and slightly below the average analyst estimate. Net income attributable to Colgate rose 34 percent to $726 million, or 80 cents per share, from a year earlier, and included a $120 million gain from the sale of its laundry detergent business. Excluding items, the company earned 72 cents per share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Craig Dima, a broker at K.C. Ward Financial on Long Island, was hit with civil charges on Thursday of making unauthorized and unsuitable trades from 2010 to 2015, including selling and soon after repurchasing nearly all of the client’s dividend-paying stock 11 times.

The companies that quantified an exchange-rate effect reported a negative impact totaling $6.81 billion, the smallest for any quarter since the third quarter of 2014, when the effect was $4.00 billion, according to FIREapps, a currency risk consulting firm. While the firm does not estimate the effect on future results, U.S. corporate reports on the fourth quarter already are showing signs of a stronger impact from U.S. dollar strength. Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N) said on Friday its quarterly sales were hurt by a strong dollar, and PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) also said currency fluctuations hit fourth-quarter results. The U.S. dollar index .DXY rose 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter, while it was down 0.7 percent in the third quarter of 2016. The number of North American companies citing a negative impact from currency fluctuations in the third quarter was 218, below the prior three quarters’ average of 307 companies, the FIREapps report showed.  U.S. multinationals’ foreign currency earnings are worth less in dollars when the dollar is stronger. Nearly half of U.S. S&P; 500 companies’ sales come from overseas, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices data.

In a decision on Friday, U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel in White Plains, New York rejected arguments by Colgate that the lawsuit is preempted by the 1997 U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and should be dismissed outright. Seibel agreed, however, to defer to the FTC on whether the whitening claims are valid.

139,CL,"Colgate's sales disappoint despite price cuts, higher ad spending","(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co’s (CL.N) shares sank on Friday after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales despite spending more on advertising and cutting prices to spur enough demand. The world’s largest toothpaste maker said gross margins fell to 59.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 60.4 percent a year earlier, hit by higher costs for raw materials and packaging. Colgate said it expects sales growth in 2018 but the forecast did nothing to shake the impression of stagnation that has dogged Colgate and other consumer goods producers in the past year. Its shares slumped 6 percent to $72.82, setting them up for their worst day in more than seven years. While the S&P; 500 has risen more than 50 percent in the past year, Colgate shares are up less than 15 percent and the company has missed sales estimates in five of the past six quarters. Organic sales improved sequentially, but the rate of improvement was less than expected, the company said in a post-earnings conference call. “Today’s results once again show that Colgate remains vulnerable to macro uncertainty and operational challenges,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. Organic sales growth of above 2 percent was below our consensus of 3 percent to 3.4 percent, Bonnie Herzog added. “Overall we view Colgate’s results as disappointing with the company missing on organic growth for the fifth quarter in a row,” Deutsche Bank markets Research analyst Steve Powers said. For 2018, Colgate forecast mid-single digit percentage net sales growth and low- to mid-single-digit organic sales growth, and double-digit earnings per share growth. In most markets, Colgate lowered prices as much as 2 percent to drive sales and volume. Its worldwide advertising spending rose 24 percent to $369 million in the fourth quarter, the company said, adding that it planned to boost ad spending further in 2018. Those increased outlays have taken a toll on operating profit, which was down nearly 3 percent overall and in all of the company’s global geographical segments with the exception of Europe. Chief Executive Ian Cook said the global market in the company’s core dental-care business remained “challenging”. Sales rose 4.5 percent to $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with the average analyst estimate of $3.92 billion. Net income nearly halved to $323 million, or 37 cents per share, largely due to a $275 million charge from changes to the U.S. tax code. Profit, excluding charges, was 75 cents per share, in line with analysts’ estimates.

149,CL,Colgate's sales disappoint on tepid Latin America demand,"(Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) said first-quarter sales came in below its expectations due to stagnant demand in Latin America - its biggest market - leading it to lower a widely watched sales forecast. U.S. packaged goods companies have been struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, who are tightening inventories, offering discounts and focusing on private label brands to trim costs. Even though Colgate spent nearly 13 percent more on advertising this quarter over the prior quarter, and cut prices between 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent in Europe and North America compared with a year ago, organic sales did not see the boost they expected. Growth in organic sales, that exclude benefits from acquisitions and divestitures, slowed to 1.5 percent in the first quarter from more than 2 percent in the previous quarter as the company saw no growth in volumes in developing markets. The company said it now expects these core sales to grow in the low-single-digit percentage range in 2018, compared with the low- to mid-single-digit growth it projected earlier. The company’s shares fell 3 percent to a 14-month low of $64.85 but pared most of those losses to trade down 0.3 percent. The weaker top-line results are certainly not a huge surprise in light of the tepid results reported by Colgate’s  peers, Suntrust Robinson analyst William Chappell said, but added that Colgate’s miss on sales was a surprise. Colgate’s net sales rose 6.4 percent to $4 billion, but came in slightly below the average analyst estimate of $4.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in Latin America rose just 0.5 percent to $929 million, hit by a slump in demand in Mexico, but pricing cuts in Europe and North America reversed some of the weakness. Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) earlier this month also posted organic sales growth that disappointed Wall Street, mainly because of pricing pressures in an environment where retailers are cutting back on costs. Still, Colgate’s stock has outperformed peers. While the S&P; 500 Household Products .SPLRCPROD index has fallen more than 18 percent in this year, Colgate shares are down 12 percent. In comparison, P&G;’s shares are down 21 percent. Excluding some items, Colgate earned 74 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 72 cents.
