1,LLY,UPDATE 2-Amylin says heart trial of diabetes drug met goal,"   * To submit data to FDA in third quarter  * Amylin shares rise 10.8 percent in extended trade  * Alkermes shares rise 6 percent  (Adds background, updates share prices)   LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Reuters) - A trial of exenatide, the active ingredient in a long-acting diabetes drug being developed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals AMLN.O, Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and Alkermes (ALKS.O), found no link between the drug and changes in heart rhythms, the companies said on Thursday.   The news sent shares of Amylin up nearly 11 percent in after-hours trading. Shares of Alkermes were up 6 percent, while shares of Lilly were flat at $37.85.   U.S. regulators last October asked for data from the trial before deciding whether to approve Bydureon, a once-weekly version of exenatide, as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   The companies said the study met its goal, showing that, even at high doses, exenatide did not prolong the QT interval, the time the heart’s electrical system takes to recharge after each beat, in healthy volunteers.   The companies said they plan to submit results of the study to the Food and Drug Administration in the third quarter of this year.   Shares of Amylin were trading at $15.19 after hours, while shares of Alkermes were at $20.40.   Bydureon is a longer-acting version of Byetta, known generically as exenatide, which is also sold by Lilly and Amylin. Both injectable drugs belong to a relatively new GLP-1 class of drugs that stimulate insulin release when glucose levels become too high.   Bydureon was approved by European health regulators last month. It competes with Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO) Victoza, a GLP-1 agonist which is injected daily.   Bydureon sales for Amylin are expected to reach $1.1 billion a year by 2015, according to analysts polled by Thomson Pharma.

2,LLY,Pfizer to unload units worth over $16 billion,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) might sell or spin off its animal health and nutrition units — businesses valued at more than $16 billion — to focus on its main pharmaceutical business and cushion the loss of its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol drug.  The drugmaker, the world’s biggest, also said on Thursday it will hold on to its established-products unit, which sells generic drugs, and its consumer healthcare business, bringing resolution to a review of its portfolio under Chief Executive Ian Read, a company veteran who took the helm in December.  Pfizer shares were down 1.9 percent in afternoon trading. They had risen some 19 percent this year, partly due to expectations of asset sales. Some investors were disappointed the company did not announce plans to sell off even more divisions, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.  “People wanted the established products and consumer groups to be included,” Conover said.  Animal health and nutrition, which accounted for about 8 percent of the company’s 2010 revenue, are “distinct enough from our core businesses that their value may be best maximized outside the company,” Read said in a statement.  The drugmaker also has been looking to cut costs to counter huge pressure on its revenue when it loses U.S. exclusivity for Lipitor in November.  Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with Miller Tabak who holds Pfizer shares, said it is possible the company will use the money to buy back stock, although ultimately it needs to develop new drugs.  “If you don’t do it right you’re just throwing money out the door,” Funtleyder said of research and development spending. “In a perfect world they would take the money and put it into developing new drugs.”  Pfizer has struggled to bring significant new products to market from its own research efforts. But earlier this year, it said it would slash as much as $2 billion from its 2012 research budget to help it meet profit goals.  In an interview with Reuters earlier this week, former Pfizer research chief John LaMattina said the drugmaker would be spending a low percentage of its revenue on R&D.  Even without the animal health and nutritionals businesses, Pfizer would be on track to spend at most 12 percent of revenue on research — below the historical 15 percent to 20 percent cited by LaMattina for the industry.  SPIN-OFF OR SALE FOR ANIMAL HEALTH?  While some investors are eager to see Pfizer slim down, exiting animal health means leaving behind a business that rival drugmakers are turning to as a driver of future profits.  Pfizer’s animal health business develops products for livestock and pets, and operates in more than 60 countries. It posted revenue of about $3.6 billion last year, making it one of the world’s largest in the field. Analysts put the value of the business at $10 billion to $16 billion.  Analysts said Pfizer might encounter antitrust problems should it seek to sell the animal health unit to some rivals. Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) earlier this year abandoned plans for an animal health joint venture with $5 billion in annual sales because of antitrust issues.  Conover said Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) — which won European approval on Thursday to buy Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) animal health unit — and Novartis AG NOVN.VX could be buyers of the Pfizer business, saying they were examples of “tier two players who may want to become tier one players.”  Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said he would expect Pfizer to spin off the animal health business in a tax-free transaction, similar to what Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) did with its Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN.N business.  Pfizer’s nutrition business, which sells formula and other nutritional products for infants and children up to 7 years old, generated revenue of about $1.9 billion last year. Analysts put the value of the nutritionals unit at $6 billion to $7.5 billion.  Potential buyers could include Mead Johnson, Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Danone SA (DANO.PA) and Nestle NESN.VX, Conover said.  Pfizer said it expects to complete any transactions in 12 months to 24 months and does not expect to make any further announcements about the businesses until next year.  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is advising Pfizer on a possible deal for the animal health business, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Centerview Partners are advising on the nutrition business.  In explaining its decision to keep the established products business, Pfizer said generic drugs and other off-patent medicines are crucial to growth in emerging markets.  The company said one important benefit of the consumer healthcare business is that it can extend the value of products by enabling Pfizer to market them when they switch from prescription to nonprescription medicines.

5,LLY,Lower-risk women need fewer mammograms: study,"NEW YORK (Reuters Life!) - Less-frequent mammograms for women at low risk for breast cancer can be a cost-effective way of saving lives, according to a study that challenges current screening guidelines.  Women with no family history of the cancer, no previous biopsy from a cancer scare and breasts that are not very dense might get a similar benefit from mammograms every three to four years, instead of every two, said a report published in Annals of Internal Medicine.  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an expert panel with federal support, advises women to have a mammogram every two years, but lead researcher John Schouseboe said the new study provides a more personalized set of mammogram guidelines than what is currently available.  “The benefits of mammography are going to depend a lot on what your underlying risk is, and the current guidelines look only at age,” Schousboe, a doctor at Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis, told Reuters Health.  Current recommendations say women aged 50 to 74 should have a mammogram every two years, unless the woman and her doctor feel there is reason to make an exception.  The team used data from two national surveys, which tracked the frequency of mammograms and the breast cancer rates of more than a million women, to form hypothetical scenarios.  In one, they were not screened, while in another they got mammograms every two years. In a third scenario they received a mammogram every three to four years.  All scenarios assumed that at age 40, every woman received a mammogram to reveal her breast density.  For women in their 40s with less dense breasts and no other risk factors, the study found that screening at any interval, whether biennially or every three to four years, was not cost effective.  It would cost $228,000 to save a life for a year if low-risk women in their 40s were screened every three to four years, compared to no screening.  The study also found that to save one life among women in their 40s, 8,000 would need to be screened, and 17 out of every 100 of them would experience a false cancer scare — leading to additional testing, which exposes them to more radiation.  “I think that, other things being equal, it’s reasonable for a patient and their doctor at that point to say, ‘we’re going to put off the next mammogram until age 50,’” said Schousboe.  But women with more dense breasts who have a close relative with breast cancer or have had a past breast biopsy would benefit from screening every three to four years in their 40s.  For women in their 50s to 70s, the study found, it was cost-effective for those with low-density breasts and no other risk factors to be screened every three to four years.  For women over 50 with denser breasts, a biannual screening became cost effective. If they had another risk factor, a mammogram every two years would be appropriate, the report said.  The study, funded by pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly, the Da Costa Family Foundation for Research in Breast Cancer Prevention of the California Pacific Medical Center, and the National Cancer Institute, does not apply to women who have a high genetic risk of breast cancer.  It also did not test the scenarios in a real-life situation, with the analyses based on simulations of screening policies.  Some experts said that while the concept was “exciting,” there were obstacles to refining the guidelines.  ""Communicating risk-based screening will be very difficult and will require education of women and physicians,"" said Jeanne Mandelblatt of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington D.C., who was not involved in the study.

8,LLY,Groups convince FDA to ease Alzheimer's trial rules,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Academic and industry experts said on Tuesday they have convinced U.S. regulators to ease safety restrictions imposed on clinical trials of Alzheimer’s drugs, a move that could improve the chances that a drug being developed jointly by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson might succeed.  A 2008 study of 240 patients testing that drug, known as bapineuzumab, found a dozen cases of a brain swelling condition called vasogenic edema, shaking confidence in the safety of agents that reduce levels of a protein called beta amyloid that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.  That study prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue stricter safety guidelines for clinical trials of drugs that alter amyloid in the brain, Maria Carrillo of the Alzheimer’s Association said in a telephone interview.  The guidelines restricted patients in the trials to having no more than two incidents of cerebral microhemmorhages, or tiny leaks of blood in the brain, before they enter a study. They also called for frequent MRI scans to check for brain swelling or other problems that might be caused by the study drugs, Carrillo said.  Under new guidelines ironed out through the Alzheimer’s Association’s Research Roundtable — which included both industry and academic researchers — the FDA has now eased those guidelines, Carrillo said in a telephone interview.  Many companies, including Pfizer and J&J and Eli Lilly, are working to develop drugs that reduce levels of this protein.  Carrillo said the new guidelines — based on the latest research — recognize that many patients with Alzheimer’s disease have had these types of brain events, and excluding so many people from clinical trials would make it more difficult to find effective drugs.  “We were able to bring together all of the literature involved in the discussion of MRI abnormalities that could occur when you are aging with Alzheimer’s disease and when you are participating in clinical trials with an amyloid-modifying agent.”  Carrillo said the group of industry experts and researchers submitted their report to the FDA, which has adopted the new recommendations. The report was published on Tuesday in the journal Alzheimer’s and Dementia.  The new guidelines allow some patients who develop brain swelling to stay in clinical trials, she said.  “We don’t want to compromise safety, but we also want to make sure as many people as possible can participate in Alzheimer’s clinical trials,” Carrillo said.  In January, Eli Lilly said one patient in ongoing trials of the company’s drug solanezumab temporarily developed brain swelling, although it was not clear whether the patient was taking the Lilly drug or a placebo. The problem was not seen in a follow-up brain scan and the patient resumed treatment.  Rachel Schindler, an Alzheimer’s disease expert at Pfizer who worked on the study and wrote an editorial in the journal, said, “broadening the restrictions would allow a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits of amyloid-lowering treatment.”  In May, J&J said it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval for bapineuzumab in 2012 or 2013, but analysts have said more studies may be needed because of issues with brain swelling.  Currently, there are no drugs that alter the course of Alzheimer’s, which affects 26 million people globally and costs more than $600 billion a year to treat.

11,LLY,UPDATE 1-Novartis eyes international board listing in China-sources," (Adds detail, background)	   * Novartis has consulted Chinese government on IPO-sources   * China one of six priority emerging markets for Novartis   * International board may host only 10 companies initially-local media    By Samuel Shen and Soo Ai Peng	   SHANGHAI, July 12 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG   is considering a possible initial public offering in China, joining a growing list of multinationals eyeing a listing on Shanghai’s planned international board, two people with knowledge of the situation said.	   Novartis is studying the feasibility of a China IPO and has been consulting relevant government agencies, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the information is not public. Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff declined to comment. 	   Selling shares in China would enable Novartis to raise money to fund rapid expansion in China and for potential acquisitions, as it competes fiercely with rivals such as Roche Holding AG  and Eli Lilly in the country. 	   Having its shares traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange could also help Novartis promote its brand in a country where concerns over food and drug safety constantly haunt consumers.	   China is among the six countries identified by Novartis as  priority emerging markets for the company, where combined net sales grew 12 percent in 2010 to $4.6 billion, accounting for 10 percent of the firm’s global sales, its annual report said. Novartis expects that proportion to double in five years.	   China may launch the international board as soon as this year or next year as the country wants to boost the global profile of the yuan currency and further liberalise its capital markets.	   Shang Fulin, Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said recently the international board was “coming closer and closer” to the market.	   Global firms, including HSBC  , Standard Chartered , Unilever and Coca-Cola Co  have already expressed interest for a listing on the international board.	   China may allow about 10 foreign companies to list on the board initially, local media reported earlier this year, citing draft rules on the board. 	   Foreign companies might be allowed to use proceeds from an international board listing for their offshore operations subject to approval from the forex regulator, the 21st Century Business Herald reported in April, citing the draft rules.	   Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis employs more than 5,000 people in China and has invested more than $700 million in the country, betting that rising income among its 1.3 billion people will boost health awareness and drug consumption.	   In March, Novartis paid $125 million in cash for a majority stake in Chinese vaccines company Zhejiang Tianyuan Bio-Pharmaceutical Co, establishing a foothold in China’s $1 billion-a-year vaccines market, the world’s third largest.

12,LLY,Obama said ready to move on South Korea trade bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will soon send a free trade pact with South Korea to Congress for approval despite Republican threats to vote against it because of a retraining program for workers displaced by trade, White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley said on Thursday.  “There is no time to waste fighting politics as usual,” Daley said in a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the U.S.-Korea Business Council. “If we do not act before the August recess, American business will suffer.”  Obama faces a showdown with Republicans over his insistence that an extension of the nearly 50-year-old Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) retraining program be passed along with the Korea pact and two other pending free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.  Republicans have objected to Obama’s plan to insert the TAA program into the implementing bill for the South Korea agreement, insisting that lawmakers be allowed to vote separately on the TAA and the trade pact.  The White House believes both could pass separately.  However, Daley said Republicans have yet to offer a “credible” plan that would prevent TAA opponents from blocking a vote on the program, which Democrats see as a vital safety net and many Republicans view as ineffective.  “We can no longer wait. If there’s no agreement on an alternative approach in the very near future, we will move forward to seek passage of the FTA (Free Trade Agreement) with TAA” included, Daley told the audience of U.S. and Korean business officials.  Daley said the White House expects the Korea agreement “to create or support 70,000 American jobs” through tariff cuts that will open the South Korean market to more U.S. exports.  Congress must act soon because a rival deal struck by the European Union with South Korea went into force on July 1, threatening U.S. market share in the longtime ally, he said.  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would vote against the Korean agreement if TAA is included in the implementing legislation for the deal.  But most business leaders recognize an extension of TAA has to be part of the mix, and don’t believe it is worth holding the agreement up over the issue.  “We can’t let differences over processes and procedures hold back these agreements any longer. American jobs and American standing in the world are on the line,” said U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue.  The deal was originally negotiated during the administration of former President George W. Bush and business groups have been waiting four years for it to become law.  “We’ve seen first hand what these free trade agreements do after implementation,” said Mike Ducker, chief operating officer of FedEx Express, a division of FedEx.  “Not only does it create new commercial opportunities for our customers and greater demand for our services, it allows us to continue growing our operations and our work force around the world,” Ducker told Reuters in an interview.  Critics, including the AFL-CIO labor federation and Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, say trade deals endanger U.S. jobs by cutting U.S. tariffs and encouraging companies to move their operations overseas.  A study by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute says the Korean trade agreement could displace about 159,000 American jobs over seven years.  But Harrison Cook, vice president of international government affairs for Eli Lilly and Company, said the rival EU-South Korea agreement puts U.S. pharmaceutical companies at a disadvantage in a major market.  “All those tariff preferences are going to go to our Europeans competitors, not to us.

14,LLY,Avid CEO confident in Alzheimer's imaging agent,"PARIS (Reuters) - The chief executive of Eli Lilly and Co’s Alzheimer’s imaging unit is confident it can create a training program for its imaging drug that will satisfy concerns raised by U.S. regulators.  So are many Alzheimer’s disease experts, who are gathering in Paris this week for the Alzheimer’s Association’s international conference.  Imaging the clumps of a toxic protein called beta amyloid that accumulate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s is seen as a critical step toward identifying the disease in the earlier stages, before memory problems begin.  Researchers increasingly believe this is the best time to intervene with drugs that might delay or prevent the disease from progressing.  Lilly is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market the agent, a radioactive tracer called Amyvid, for use with positron emission tomography, or PET, scans to help doctors rule out the plaque linked with Alzheimer’s.  In January, an advisory panel to the FDA unanimously said Amyvid appears to detect brain plaques associated with the memory disease, but that more data is needed to show the scans can be properly interpreted.  “Since we got that feedback, we’re working with the FDA to figure out what is required,” said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, president and CEO of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, a wholly owned unit of Lilly.  “We’re quite confident that we will be successful,” Skovronsky said in a telephone interview ahead of the conference, which runs July 16-21.  He said data from the company’s clinical trials was convincing, but the FDA said the test was too complicated for clinical use and may lead to inconsistent readings.  So the company is trying to focus its training on answering a simple question: “Is there amyloid in the brain? Yes or no?” Skovronsky said.  He said the FDA will not require additional clinical trials involving patients.  “I expect ultimately it will win approval,” said Dr. Michael Weiner, who is leading the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a federal study that uses imaging and other tests to track the progress of Alzheimer’s over time.  “I think most people see this as a temporary problem,” said Weiner, who also directs the Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Disease at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco.  If approved, the test will tell doctors whether amyloid is gathering in the brain. If there is none, it would tell doctors to look for other causes of mental decline, such as depression or medications.  “I’ve talked to some scientists who feel these scans can help them in assessing their patients,” Weiner said, adding: “Once there are treatments, these tests are going to be much more important.”  Avid’s compound is already being widely used by various drug companies in clinical trials, and Lilly’s $800 million acquisition of Avid last November raised concerns among Lilly’s rivals.  “One of the early questions on everyone’s mind was, ‘Are you going to continue to collaborate with us even though we are developing a drug that might compete with a Lilly drug?’”  “The answer right from the outset was yes,” Skovronsky said. “We are committed to this open collaboration model.”  Avid has been ahead in the race for such imaging agents that are estimated to have a potential global market anywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion.  General Electric Co and Bayer AG are also developing rival products, but Avid’s delay at the FDA may have cost the company some of its lead.  “When you are first, you are developing a path that others will follow. That is the benefit but also the cost of being in the lead,” Skovronsky said.

15,LLY,U.S. autopsy guidelines revised for Alzheimer's,"PARIS (Reuters) - For many years, an autopsy done by a pathologist was considered the best way to confirm the presence of Alzheimer’s disease.  But new guidelines proposed on Sunday by the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association seek to distinguish between memory changes or dementia diagnosed by doctors when people are alive, and the changes pathologists can see in an autopsy.  The proposed guidelines will offer additional information about the disease that will help as scientists develop tests that measure biological changes in the brain, blood or spinal fluid to diagnose Alzheimer’s at an earlier stage.  Several companies, including Eli Lilly and Co, Bayer and General Electric Co, are working on compounds to identify Alzheimer’s-related brain changes on positron emission tomography scans.  Many other companies and researchers are working on other types of biomarkers as well.  “Someday biomarkers are probably going to replace pathology,” Dr. Creighton Phelps of the National Institute on Aging’s division of neuroscience, said in an interview at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris.  Pathologists now look in the brain for clumps of a protein called beta amyloid and a protein called tau to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease.  But studies have shown that people can die with lots of plaques and tangles in their brain and still have normal cognitive function.  “We know people die with Alzheimer’s changes in the brain but they had no dementia,” Phelps said.  According to the proposed guidelines, patients who have memory problems caused by the disease will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia, or in milder cases, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s dementia.  The term Alzheimer’s disease will be used to refer to the underlying changes in the pathology, Phelps said.  “Classically, it’s all been one big pool but they are not equivalent,” he said. “You might have something on a slide that doesn’t match what the person was like in life.”  Phelps said dementia can be caused by many diseases, including vascular disease, so it is important to be clear about what is causing the problem.  The proposed guidelines offer much more detail about how to test people’s brains at autopsy, specifying tests that should be done and asking pathologists to quantify the amount of plaque in the brain.  Bill Thies of the Alzheimer’s Association said knowing the location of the plaques in a person’s brain may provide clues about why some people develop dementia and others do not.  If these protein deposits are clustered in memory centers of the brain, that could cause more problems than if they are in other parts, for example.  Earlier this year, the NIA, part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Alzheimer’s Association issued new diagnostic criteria to help doctors better classify patients who are tested for signs of dementia.  The proposed pathology guidelines, which are part of that process, will be available for public comment until September 1. Phelps said he hopes final guidelines will published in January 2012.

17,LLY,Exclusive: GE to soon seek FDA OK for Alzheimer's imaging agent,"PARIS (Reuters) - General Electric Co is finishing clinical trials for an agent designed to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s and expects to seek regulatory approval by year’s end, its executive leading the process said.  GE, Eli Lilly and Co and Bayer AG are all developing similar compounds, which stick to amyloid plaques in the brain and light up on positron emission tomography or PET scans. If approved, the compounds will be used to help doctors rule out Alzheimer’s in people.  Lilly unit Avid Radiopharmaceuticals was first to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its tracer, called florbetapir or Amyvid, but was dealt a setback when the agency said it should develop training programs to ensure the tests are read in a consistent manner.  Jonathan Allis, general manager of PET Medical Diagnostics at GE Healthcare, told Reuters that his team plans to learn from the mistakes of its competitors.  In an exclusive interview at the Alzheimer’s Association’s International Conference in Paris, Allis described what he called a long game in identifying and treating the brain-wasting disease.  “I think our data is very good. It’s tight. We’re close to filing (for approval),” Allis said of GE’s imaging agent, called flutemetamol.  “They (Avid) did a great job, but I think we did the boring stuff better,” he said, referring to the company’s extensive work on manufacturing, imaging quality and image analysis.  Radioactive tracers that test for fragments of beta-amyloid plaque are seen as a critical bridge in the search for effective drugs to treat Alzheimer’s, a fatal, mind-robbing disease that affects nearly 36 million people worldwide.  Scientists believe these Alzheimer’s-linked plaques start developing at least a decade before symptoms occur, and spotting those changes in the brain early offers the best chance to intervene with new drugs that might prevent or delay the disease.  Once they win approval for their products, GE, Lilly and Bayer will compete for market share. To gain an edge, GE is developing a software program to help analyze the flutemetamol scans, and it is developing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to measure brain volume, which also changes as Alzheimer’s advances.  “By the time we launch next year, we’ll launch the MRI images and combine the two together,” Allis said.  Allis said GE has a growing interest in addressing Alzheimer’s, a disease that is expected to affect as many as 115 million people by 2050 unless effective treatments are found.  “There is a huge interest in Alzheimer’s and it goes right to the top of GE,” Allis said, referring to GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, who once headed GE Healthcare Systems.  Besides amyloid imaging, GE plans to build on a partnership with Johnson & Johnson announced last December to search for other changes in the body that can be used to develop biomarker tests for Alzheimer’s.  “That is the start of what we hope to be a much broader relationship with J&J in Alzheimer’s disease,” Allis said.  Allis says finding earlier ways to identify Alzheimer’s patients is going to be critical as drug companies such as Lilly, Pfizer Inc and J&J look to test new agents that will stop the disease before it does too much damage.  Current medications treat Alzheimer’s symptoms but cannot change the course of the disease, and new drugs that have been tried so far have failed, in large part, experts think, because they were tried only when the disease was too advanced.  “If you look at all the pharmaceutical trials now, they are all in probably the wrong patient group. They are too late,” Allis said.  Amyloid imaging agents are already being commonly used to help drug companies identify people with amyloid in their brain who might be a good candidates for drug trials.  Allis said GE and J&J are trying to identify screening tests for the disease that can be used in a wider population, in much the same way people are tested for early signs of prostate cancer.  “It’s a long game. I think we are not anywhere near the end,” he said.  ",7182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers-ge/exclusive-ge-to-soon-seek-fda-ok-for-alzheimers-imaging-agent-idUSTRE76H5OZ20110718

19,LLY,Brain swelling may be common with Alzheimer's drugs,"PARIS (Reuters) - Three patients treated with an experimental Bristol-Myers Squibb Alzheimer’s drug have developed a type of brain swelling known as vasogenic edema, but the side effect may be common in Alzheimer’s patients, researchers said on Monday.  Vasogenic edema may even be a sign that drugs are clearing a protein tied to Alzheimer’s from the brain, researchers said at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris.  The results could have bearing on the closely watched drug bapineuzumab, being developed by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Vasogenic edema became a major concern after a 2008 mid-stage study of 240 patients on bapineuzumab found a dozen cases.  But while previous cases of swelling were seen in drugs that use antibodies to remove clumps of the Alzheimer’s-related protein beta amyloid from the brain, the Bristol drug BMS-708163 is a gamma-secretase inhibitor that targets the disease with a different mechanism.  “No one had thought this was likely in a trial of a gamma-secretase inhibitor,” Dr. Reisa Sperling of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston told the meeting. She added that the presence of the effect in different classes of drugs showed the side effect may be more common than previously thought.  Sperling said the side effect may be related to the clearing of amyloid from the brain, or it may be these side effects occur spontaneously in patients with Alzheimer’s.  Although vasogenic edema was visible on brain scans, none of the patients in the Bristol-Myers study had clinical symptoms and all three had a mutation in the APOE4 gene which raises the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  One of the three patients had signs of brain swelling at the beginning of the study, and Sperling said brain scans showed that patient’s condition continued to worsen over the course of the six-month study.  “Whether the treatment increased it, I don’t know,” she said in an interview.  The field of Alzheimer’s research is littered with drug failures, providing little hope to the nearly 36 million people who suffer from it worldwide. Eli Lilly and Co last year halted two studies of its gamma-secretase drug, called semagacestat, after it worsened patients’ symptoms of dementia in late-stage clinical trials.  In January, Lilly said one patient in an ongoing trial of its antibody drug solanezumab temporarily developed vasogenic edema, although it was not clear whether the patient was taking the Lilly drug or a placebo.  Concerns over the bapineuzumab study in 2008 prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue stricter safety guidelines for clinical trials of drugs that alter amyloid in the brain.  But researchers said last week the FDA agreed to modify those restrictions after a year-long study that showed these types of events may be common in people with Alzheimer’s disease.  Sperling said the FDA has been working with researchers and companies to allow more patients to be involved in drug trials for Alzheimer’s.

One of the three patients had signs of brain swelling at the beginning of the study, and Sperling said brain scans showed that patient’s condition continued to worsen over the course of the six-month study.   “Whether the treatment increased it, I don’t know,” she said in an interview.   The field of Alzheimer’s research is littered with drug failures, providing little hope to the nearly 36 million people who suffer from it worldwide. Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) last year halted two studies of its gamma-secretase drug, called semagacestat, after it worsened patients’ symptoms of dementia in late-stage clinical trials.   In January, Lilly said one patient in an ongoing trial of its antibody drug solanezumab temporarily developed vasogenic edema, although it was not clear whether the patient was taking the Lilly drug or a placebo.   Concerns over the bapineuzumab study in 2008 prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue stricter safety guidelines for clinical trials of drugs that alter amyloid in the brain.   But researchers said last week the FDA agreed to modify those restrictions after a year-long study that showed these types of events may be common in people with Alzheimer’s disease.[ID:nN1E76B04Y]   Sperling said the FDA has been working with researchers and companies to allow more patients to be involved in drug trials for Alzheimer’s.

21,LLY,"Special report: With Alzheimer's in the genes, when do you test?","PARIS (Reuters) - As a boy, Gary Reiswig would take his grandfather by the hand and guide him on walks around the family farm in western Oklahoma.  At 5, Gary knew to avoid the prairie dog town, fearful that his grandfather might stumble over one of the holes that the rodents burrowed into the grassy plain.  Occasionally, his grandfather would stop. His eyes took on an eerie stare that spoke of an empty place — one that once was filled with memories, laughter and toil.  In 1945, nobody knew that Gary’s grandfather had a rare form of Alzheimer’s disease that would strike 10 of Gary’s 14 aunts and uncles, his father and his only brother and sister in the prime of their lives.  Gary’s family has dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease. It is rare, and it afflicts the young. In his family, symptoms can appear in the early 40s.  This inherited form of Alzheimer’s is caused by mutations in one of three genes: amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 or presenilin 2. It is the only form of Alzheimer’s for which there is a diagnostic test that can predict with certainty whether Alzheimer’s will ensue.  That may change. Researchers, patient advocates and policy makers are pushing for earlier testing of Alzheimer’s, in part because it will help the search for a cure. That means more people could find out if they will succumb to the disease.  But without a treatment or a cure, would people want to know?  Surprisingly, yes, said Dr. Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health.  Blendon conducted a survey of 2,678 adults from five countries that was released on Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris. About two thirds of respondents said they were likely to get a test to predict whether they would get Alzheimer’s before any symptoms appeared.  Some 35.6 million people worldwide have Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia. Drugs only help symptoms; none can arrest Alzheimer’s, which costs $604 billion a year globally to treat.  All of the drugs that have been tried in people with advanced dementia have failed to slow the disease, and many experts think the reason is that they were tried on people who were too far gone.  Some people who know Alzheimer’s may lie in wait make different life choices. They take more extravagant vacations, they put their finances in order earlier than many other people. They even may use a surrogate parent instead of taking a chance of passing on the disease to a new generation.  There are no tests that can detect Alzheimer’s before symptoms appear, but researchers are getting closer.  Eli Lilly and Co is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell an Alzheimer’s imaging agent for use with positron emission tomography, or PET, scans to help doctors rule out Alzheimer’s.  In January, an advisory panel to the FDA said it would consider approving the compound, but it wants the company to develop a training program to ensure radiologists can read brain scans using the compound consistently.  Lilly acquired the drug through its recent purchase of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals Inc, which has been leading a three-way race for such imaging agents with General Electric Co and Bayer AG.  The agents could have a potential global market of anywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion, according to these companies.  Scientists are also looking for signals of Alzheimer’s in cerebrospinal fluid. These tests look for two Alzheimer’s-related proteins: beta amyloid, which forms sticky plaques in the brain, and tau, a marker of cell damage. Low levels of beta amyloid in spinal fluid suggest it may be accumulating in the brain, and high tau levels suggest nerve cell death.  Some doctors already test for this to confirm that Alzheimer’s has caused a person’s dementia.  Encouraged by these steps, National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Alzheimer’s Association in April revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer’s for the first time in 27 years to recognize mild cognitive impairment as a precursor to the disease.  They also added a new research category called preclinical Alzheimer’s, the earliest stage of the disease when clumps of amyloid start to form in the brains of people who are otherwise healthy.  This stage, which occurs some 10 years before dementia sets in, is seen as the best place to intervene. It is why new imaging agents for PET scans, spinal fluid tests and so-called biomarkers that predict Alzheimer’s are becoming so important to researchers and drug companies.  “The guidelines portend a lot more than just how to diagnose Alzheimer’s today,” said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, founder and chief executive of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals.  “I think many people now have a sense of hope that some day we can make Alzheimer’s a preventable disease, and that is through early prevention and early treatment,” he said.  Gary was 25 when he found out his father had Alzheimer’s, and he lived with the possibility that he might develop the disease until he was 57. That is when he learned he did not inherit the gene.  His family already saw the grim results of the disease. Gary’s grandfather, at age 53, veered into the path of a freight train in 1936. The accident killed his grandmother; his grandfather survived with a few stitches and lived another 10 years.  “My family attributed his disease and forgetfulness to his grief over this accident,” Gary said. It was only later, when the next generation began to suffer the same symptoms, that one of his aunts began to suspect something was terribly wrong.  Gary’s family and 11 other North American families have mutations in the presenilin 2 gene. They are descendants of Germans who settled in two villages in the Volga region of Russia in the 1760s, and later settled in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Their disease is autosomal dominant, meaning children only need to get one abnormal gene from either parent to inherit the disease, and each child has a 50/50 chance of getting it.  This form of Alzheimer’s comprises about 1 percent of the cases of Alzheimer’s worldwide.  “If you have that mutation, so far as we know, you will in fact get that disease,” Gary said.  And because of that guarantee, Gary’s family and others may soon lead the way to a cure for the disease.  A clinical trial known as the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network, or DIAN, is studying families with inherited forms of Alzheimer’s to learn more about how the disease progresses.  Funded by a grant from the National Institute on Aging in 2008, DIAN has the largest and most extensive worldwide research network investigating dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s, with sites in the United States, Britain and Australia.  Initial results from the study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association meeting suggest inherited forms of the disease can be detected as many as 20 years before problems with memory and thinking develop.  They found that, as with people with more common Alzheimer’s, people who develop early onset disease experience a drop in amyloid in their spinal fluid and an increase in tau some 20 years before their symptoms appear.  The findings suggest that there is a common pathway between inherited Alzheimer’s and late-onset Alzheimer’s, said Dr. Randall Bateman of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who is an associate director of the study.  “That is the pathway we want to treat. If we can interfere with that, we can hopefully prevent Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.  Drug companies are being selected to test their experimental medicines on these study volunteers because if they have the gene, they are certain to get Alzheimer’s.  “It’s a huge opportunity,” said Dr. Rachel Schindler, an Alzheimer’s disease expert at Pfizer Inc, which is developing the drug bapineuzumab with Johnson & Johnson, which is now in late-stage clinical trials.  “It’s a window into how early we really can detect the changes related to Alzheimer’s disease. Without that window, you’d have to study hundreds of people over a long period of time because only a few of them would end up developing the disease,” Schindler said.  If scientists can understand the disease, they can apply much of what they learn to late-onset Alzheimer’s, she said.  People in the study are eager to participate in the drug trials, Bateman said. “They are desperate to have treatments for their families.”  Marty Reiswig, a 32-year-old minister living near Denver, found out about the study from his brother Matt. Matt told Marty that he had to read a book about the family’s disease by Gary Reiswig — their father’s cousin.  After reading the book, “The Thousand Mile Stare: One Family’s Journey through the Struggle and Science of Alzheimer’s,” the brothers agreed that their family would make perfect “lab rats,” Marty said.  That is because people in his family, unlike most people who get Alzheimer’s, know it’s coming, he said.  Marty undergoes annual lumbar punctures to have his spinal fluid checked for levels of amyloid and tau — the proteins that help predict Alzheimer’s progression — and because he has no symptoms, he has a battery of memory tests every three years.  “Because I am a child of an affected early onset Alzheimer’s person, they want to study my mental health progress,” Marty said.  Marty’s and Matt’s father Lawrence is also part of the study.  Marty says he relishes his visits with Dr. Bateman, and loves to pepper him with questions about the study.  In one recent visit, he got some good news.  “I was lying in bed with lumbar puncture in my back, talking to Dr. Bateman,” Marty recalled. “He said, ‘I think some time in the next 12 months, there is a very good possibility we might be doing clinical trials with you to find drugs to prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s.’”  Marty said he lay in the hospital bed and wept.  “My dad was across from me in the hospital room and we had to control ourselves. That this terrible thing could possibly sort of vanish... that was just a huge relief for us.”  “That was thrilling,” said Lawrence, who is 58 and just starting to show signs of Alzheimer’s.  “He is still very functioning, but worsening,” Marty says of his father, who lives in Greeley, Colorado, with his mother Bonnie. “It has most affected his speech.”  Lawrence says it takes about five minutes to get himself a bowl of cold cereal and a spoon in the mornings, largely because he gets distracted so often.  “He has a fantastic attitude. He laughs at himself and allows others to laugh about his mistakes,” Marty said. “Here he is, faced with this cruel, slow ending to his life, and the embarrassment factor is huge.”  When people are in their 90’s and make social gaffes, people tend to excuse them, Marty said. “‘When you make those same social mistakes at age 58, the people who know what is going on give you grace, but everyone else wonders what is wrong with you.’”  Despite all the hope, some doctors and social workers who treat Alzheimer’s and care for their families say the push for early testing is premature.  “The tests are so inaccurate at this point that I don’t know what the value is other than to create a lot of anxiety,” said Debra Greenberg, geriatrics social worker at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.  Greenberg is skeptical of polls showing strong interest in early testing, especially when they are done among people who are young and healthy.  “I think what you decide when you are a healthy and well 40-year-old is very different from what you decide when you are older,” she said. “You are not that 40-year-old when this happens to you.”  Other Alzheimer’s experts see value in early diagnosis.  “We think right now, today, there is a clear benefit of an early diagnosis,” says Bill Thies, chief scientific officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, whose group has been a proponent of early diagnostics for many years.  One reason is that studies suggest people who understand the course of Alzheimer’s disease and what to expect from it cope better with the disease.  “This is true of patients and caregivers,” Thies said.  Thies said an early diagnosis also helps with end-of-life decisions, allowing the patient to plan their care instead of leaving these decisions to others.  It also leaves time for financial planning.  “If you know you’re starting down that path, you know to get your affairs in order. You take care of family issues so it won’t be a big surprise later when it gets worse,” said Dr. Creighton Phelps, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center Programs in the National Institute on Aging’s division of neuroscience.  But Blendon of Harvard worries about raising expectations by testing people and not offering treatments.  “For people who are so used to hope that medical science can push the darkness away here, they could be disappointed.”  And there are good reasons not to get tested.  Marty has decided not to find out his gene status. He is afraid that knowing he has the gene might jeopardize his long-term care insurance.  “My wife and I have chosen to live as if I have it anyway,” said Marty, who has a 5-year-old girl and 3-year-old boy.  The decision over whether to have children who could suffer the same genetic risk is especially touchy. Marty said his grandmother Ester, who was instrumental in helping bring the family’s genetic disease to light, urged members of the family not to have children.  “Personally, I’m glad that no one followed that rule,” he said. “I’ve been given a life by my parents and the good Lord. I love my wife. We both knew the genetic risk, but it is a very natural thing — we wanted to have kids and love them and raise them, no matter what their future.”  Every five years, they plan a big vacation. The last one was to Italy.  “I don’t know how long I have. It drives me to seize the day because I could get Alzheimer’s symptoms as early as my mid-40s, and here I am at 32.”  Gary says it is common among the younger members of his family not to get tested. “They say, ‘maybe when I’m 50,’ but I don’t want to know now.”  Gary had no idea of the weight of his burden of living with the threat of Alzheimer’s until the day he found out he did not inherit the gene.  “It was joyous relief. I just wanted to sing. And then, there was just this horrible weight of grief and sadness because of not only my brother and sister, but all of the other members of my family I have seen who have lived through this.”  ",7202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers/special-report-with-alzheimers-in-the-genes-when-do-you-test-idUSTRE76J1L020110720
22,LLY,"Many fear Alzheimer's, want to be tested: survey","PARIS (Reuters) - Alzheimer’s is the second-most feared disease after cancer and many people say they would seek testing for themselves or a loved one even if they did not have symptoms, U.S. and European researchers said on Wednesday.  The findings, presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris on Wednesday, reflect concern about the swelling ranks of people with the most common form of dementia. Alzheimer’s now affects nearly 36 million people worldwide.  Recent studies suggest the disease starts developing at least a decade before symptoms appear and many scientists and patient advocates believe earlier testing will play an important role in getting people treated and in preparing families for the burden ahead.  The telephone survey of 2,678 adults aged 18 and older in the United States, France, Germany, Spain and Poland was conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and Alzheimer Europe, with funding by Bayer AG, which is developing an imaging test for early signs of the disease.  It found that more than 85 percent of respondents said they would see a doctor if they had symptoms of confusion and memory loss. And more than 94 percent said they would want the same for a family member.  When asked to identify the most feared disease out of a list of seven that included cancer, heart disease and stroke, nearly a quarter of respondents from four of the five countries said they most fear getting Alzheimer’s.  Many in the survey said they know or have known someone with Alzheimer’s, including 72 percent of those in France, 73 percent in Germany, 77 percent in Spain, 73 percent in the United States and 54 percent in Poland.  And about three out of 10 people in the study said they have a family member who has had the disease.  Despite high levels of anxiety in the study, as many as 40 percent of people said they did not know Alzheimer’s is fatal and many said they thought there were effective treatments that could slow its progression.  Current drugs only treat Alzheimer’s symptoms, but none have been shown to delay the advance of the disease, which slowly robs its victims of the ability to think and care for themselves.  Nearly half of the people in the study believe there is a reliable medical test that can determine whether a person suffering from confusion and memory loss is in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.  And even healthy people with no symptoms are interested in testing, with about two-thirds of respondents saying they would get tested to see if they were likely to develop the disease.  “A very significant number of people appear at this stage to want to know if they are at significant risk even without symptoms,” Blendon said in an interview.  While companies such as Eli Lilly and Co, General Electric Co and Bayer are getting close to developing imaging that can spot early signs of Alzheimer’s in the brain, as yet there are no reliable medical tests.  Blendon said many countries are pushing for earlier testing and evaluation in people who have symptoms, but he worries that this might raise expectations for treatments that are not yet available.  Dr. Gary Kennedy of the division of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, who was not involved with the survey, said early testing is well worth it for people who have symptoms.  He said earlier diagnosis allows families to prepare and make their wishes known about how they want to be cared for while they are still capable. And while currently approved drugs do not work for everyone, about 2 in 10 people do have some benefit.  “The chances are not great that the family is going to see anything from treating them,” Kennedy added.  He often recommends treatments in case they get lucky.  ",7202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers-survey/many-fear-alzheimers-want-to-be-tested-survey-idUSTRE76J0VP20110720

24,LLY,Lilly's feared patent cliff becomes real,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s (LLY.N) long-feared “patent cliff” has begun in earnest, with quarterly earnings falling as generic competition hit demand for its Gemzar cancer medicine and as other top-selling drugs brace for cheaper copycats.  The Indianapolis drugmaker’s profit, excluding special items, fell to $1.18 per share from $1.24 in the year-earlier second quarter, in line with Wall Street expectations.  But Lilly shares rose 3 percent, outpacing a 1.4 percent gain for the drug sector, after sales topped forecasts and the company slightly raised its full-year earnings view.  Although an improvement, the new forecast translates into a profit decline of 8 to 10 percent from last year. Earnings rose 8 percent in 2010.  Sales of Gemzar, whose U.S. patent lapsed in November, plunged 62 percent to $112 million in the second quarter.  “Lilly’s earnings peaked in the first quarter, and we’re not likely to get back to that point for several years,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss, who has an “underweight” rating on the company’s stock.  Rival drugmaker Roche Holding AG ROG.VX said on Thursday its core earnings per share for the first half of the year slipped 4 percent to 6.68 Swiss francs ($8.11), but that topped the average estimate of 6.48 francs in a Reuters poll.  Lilly is expected to suffer one of the industry’s worst generic onslaughts of the decade, with its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug losing U.S. marketing exclusivity in October. Its Cymbalta anti-depressant faces generics in mid-2013, with copycat forms of its Evista osteoporosis drug flooding the market in 2014.  The three threatened drugs accounted for 43 percent of quarterly company sales and their growth underscored Lilly’s reliance on them.  Zyprexa revenue jumped 12 percent to $1.4 billion, while Cymbalta’s grew 16 percent to $1 billion. Evista sales rose 2 percent to $263 million.  Lilly has vowed to avoid large-scale mergers as its patent lapses mount and rely instead on its pipeline of experimental drugs to eventually restore earnings growth.  “The whole dynamic of this company now is how much you buy into their pipeline, but I think it’s high-risk,” Purkiss said.  Although Lilly’s products in the late stages of testing have big sales potential, especially a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, Purkiss said the likelihood of success in clinical trials for that drug and many others was questionable.  The company’s net earnings fell to $1.2 billion, or $1.07 per share, from $1.35 billion, or $1.22 per share, a year earlier.  Global revenue rose 9 percent to $6.25 billion, but would have risen only 5 percent if not for the weaker dollar, which raises the value of sales in overseas markets. Sales topped Wall Street expectations of $6.03 billion.  Lilly raised its 2011 profit forecast to between $4.25 and $4.35 per share, excluding special items. It previously forecast $4.15 to $4.30.

Its Cymbalta anti-depressant faces generics in mid-2013, with copycat forms of its Evista osteoporosis drug flooding the market in 2014.  The company’s “patent cliff” began in November, with the lapse of its U.S. patent on Gemzar. Second-quarter sales of the drug plunged 62 percent to $112 million.  “Lilly’s earnings peaked in the first quarter, and we’re not likely to get back to that point for several years,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss, who has an “underweight” rating on the company’s stock.  Lilly has vowed to avoid large-scale mergers as its patent lapses mount, and to rely instead on its pipeline of experimental drugs to eventually restore earnings growth.  “The whole dynamic of this company now is how much you buy into their pipeline, but I think it’s high-risk,” Purkiss said.  Although Lilly’s products in late stages of testing have big sales potential, especially a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, Purkiss said the likelihood of success in clinical trials for that drug and many others was questionable.  Lilly said on Thursday that it expected 2011 earnings of $4.25 to $4.35 per share, excluding special items. It had previously forecast $4.15 to $4.30.  Though an improvement, the new forecast translates into a profit decline of 8.2 percent to 10.3 percent from last year.  Lilly shares were down 0.4 percent at $38.02 in trading before the market opened.

27,LLY,Astra's Brilinta to be priced at premium to Plavix," * Brilinta wholesaler cost to be $7.24 per day   * Plavix wholesaler cost $6.08 per day   * Generic Plavix expected in U.S. in May 2012   By Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) said it will price its recently approved blood thinner Brilinta at a premium to widely used rival Plavix in the United States.   The British drugmaker confirmed on Wednesday a wholesaler acquisition cost for Brilinta of $7.24 per day, about 19 percent higher than Plavix, which is sold by Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) Co.   “Brilinta will be priced to reflect the label and its value in treating patients with acute coronary syndrome,” said AstraZeneca spokesman Tony Jewell.   “We believe Brilinta should be priced at a premium because if its label and the safety and efficacy versus clopidogrel,” Jewell said, using the chemical name for Plavix.   In a huge global clinical study that was the basis for Brilinta’s approval, the anti-clotting drug proved safer and more effective than Plavix, although the results among North American patients in the study were less clear cut.   Plavix, the world’s second biggest-selling prescription  drug with annual sales of about $9 billion, has a wholesaler acquisition cost (WAC) of about $6.08 per day.   Eli Lilly’s (LLY.N) Effient, another rival blood clot and stroke preventer that has been slow to gain traction against Plavix, has a WAC of about $5.78 per day, or 5 percent cheaper than Plavix.   “The cost (of Brilinta) to an individual patient will differ depending on that patient’s insurance status,” Jewell said.   Brilinta, which is already available in Europe and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week, is expected to start selling in the United States next month.   “This price seems high to us given the competitive dynamics in the antiplatelet category,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.   He noted that AstraZeneca has a very short window to get Brilinta established in the United States before it finds itself competing with much cheaper generic versions of Plavix.   The blockbuster drug is set to lose U.S. patent protection in May of 2012.   “Coming out with a premium price seems like it will give payers one more reason to push Plavix ahead of Brilinta,” Anderson said.

29,LLY,Covance sees more big-ticket drug R&D; alliances,"LONDON (Reuters) - Joe Herring, the chief executive of U.S. contract research group Covance Inc, finds a lot of drug companies are knocking on his door these days offering deals.  After striking major collaborations with Eli Lilly in 2008 and Sanofi in 2010, he is “pretty confident” of adding fresh research and development (R&D) alliances with other big drugmakers at the rate of one every 12 to 24 months.  Those tie-ups could super-charge Covance’s revenue growth to an annual rate of 12-15 percent over the next few years, Herring told Reuters on Thursday.  The template for such deals would see Covance taking over R&D sites and staff, in exchange for a commitment from the drugmaker to provide a steady stream of research work.  He is not interested in simply picking up laboratory space abandoned as a result of Big Pharma’s wave of cutbacks, such as the shuttering of Pfizer’s huge research base in Sandwich, southern England.  “Since we did Lilly, we’ve turned down 15 arrangements because the deal terms were unilateral in nature and not something that made sense for us,” the head of the Princeton, New Jersey-based group said during a visit to London.  Herring wants a commitment to five years of partnership work before taking on a facility.  Negotiating such big-ticket outsourcing alliances is a delicate affair — but Covance is currently in discussions with a number of large pharmaceutical customers on both sides of the Atlantic.  “I’m pretty confident ... right now we have a reasonable pipeline but it is hard to project the timing,” he said.  The potential prize is large. The 10-year tie-up with Lilly is worth $1.6 billion while the one with Sanofi is valued at $2.2 billion. Herring said he had also been within a week of signing another $2 billion deal with Wyeth in 2009, before it was acquired by Pfizer.  “Our underlying growth as a company is going to be in the 7-10 percent range over the next five years and if you drop one of these in every year or two then our growth rate is probably more like 12 to 15 percent per annum,” he said.  “And we can grow earnings a lot faster than revenue because of the marginal profitability of new work in a lab-based business.”  Disruption from a spate of Big Pharma mergers and the adverse impact of the credit crunch on many research-stage biotech companies have hurt the contract research organization (CRO) industry in recent years, but Herring said things were improving.  In the long term, he is convinced that the need to make previously fixed costs more variable will fuel increasing use of CRO outsourcing services by large drug companies.  “Pharmaceutical companies are going to really have to focus on what’s core and what’s non-core,” he said.  “When everything is going great, everything is core. But with the uncertain future they are facing now and their sagging pipelines, they are going to have to make some hard decisions.”  ",8042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-covance/covance-sees-more-big-ticket-drug-rd-alliances-idUSTRE77341I20110804
30,LLY,UPDATE 3-Novo Nordisk modern insulins growth slowing," (Adds CFO quotes, further details, updates share price)	   * Q2 EBIT 5.27 bln crowns vs forecast 5.34 bln crowns	   * Raises full-year 2011 outlook	   * Raises outlook on back of Victoza, modern insulin sales	   * Shares up 1.1 pct, outperforming wider market	   By Mette Fraende and Shida Chayesteh	   COPENHAGEN, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) faces slowing growth and fierce competition in the crucial modern insulins market that leaves it vulnerable to any delay in bringing new products to market.	   The world’s biggest insulin producer raised full-year guidance following a rise in sales of modern insulins and diabetes treatment Victoza, but acknowledged that it faces a slowdown of modern insulin sales, which in the second quarter accounted for 43.6 percent of total group sales.	   Novo Nordisk said it now expects full-year sales in local currencies to rise by 9 percent to 11 percent, up from an earlier forecast of 8-10 percent, and operating profits to rise 15-19 percent, up from an earlier forecast of around 15 percent.	   Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters he expected modern insulin sales growth to slow quarter by quarter from now and until a new product was launched.	   “All else equal, when you launch a new product you will have a fall in growth rates quarter by quarter, and the only way we can get growth going again is by launching a new product,” Brandgaard said. “We hope that degludec and degludec plus will come in and create new growth for our insulins in the United States,” he said.	   The company would “soon” file a registration application for degludec in the United States, he said. Once filed to the authorities, it could likely a year and 18 months for the drug to be launched.	   “It is clear that degludec, if given a strong labelling...could become a big blockbuster,” Brandgaard said.	   A blockbuster is a drug with annual sales of more than $1 	 billion.	   But Novo warned of intense generic competition in oral anti-diabetic products and challenges from healthcare reforms world-wide. Analysts said slower growth rates left the company vulnerable to delays in the launch of new drugs.	   Swedbank analyst Johan Unnerus said: “We expect modern insulin growth to slow ahead of approvals for the next generation of insulin, which will probably be late next year with the approval of degludec.” Degludec is an ultralong-acting insulin.	   “It leaves Novo a bit more exposed to any negative news or delays of degludec approval as the company faces slower growth,” Unnerus said. He said Sanofi-Aventis’ competing drug Lantus had proven very successful.	   Novo Nordisk’s shares were up 1.2 percent at 615 crowns by 1132 GMT, down from earlier highs of 629 crowns.	   The shares outperformed the European healthcare sector index  which was up 0.3 percent and the Copenhagen bourse’s bluechip index which rose 0.4 percent.	   “The quarter is a bit weak. Eli Lilly has really significantly strengthened its insulin sales force and that puts pressure on Novo,” said Alm. Brand Michael Jorgensen.	   Second-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose to 5.27 billion Danish crowns ($1.01 billion) from 5.04 billion in the same quarter last year, slightly below analysts’ average estimate of 5.34 billion in a Reuters poll. 	   Second-quarter sales rose to 16.0 bln crowns, also slightly below a 16.57 billion forecast in the Reuters poll.	   Sales of Victoza, a diabetes treatment that stimulates the body’s own insulin production, rose 322 percent to 1.25 billion crowns, beating analysts’ average 1.22 billion forecast.	   Modern insulin sales rose by a modest 3 percent to 6.97 billion compared with the same quarter a year earlier but failed to meet analysts’ average 7.30 billion forecast.	   Reporting second-quarter earnings last week, rivals AstraZeneca , Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker, and French rival Sanofi-Aventis both raised their 2011 earnings outlook despite modest sales growth.

31,LLY,Bayer eyes Pfizer's animal health business: report,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Bayer (BAYGn.DE) is considering whether to bid for the animal health unit of Pfizer (PFE.N) should the world’s largest drugmaker divest a business valued at as much as $16 billion.  “If it is up for sale, we will have a look at it,” Bayer Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers told German business weekly WirtschaftsWoche.  Animal health is a lucrative market since people in developed economies spend a lot on their pets. Moreover, in comparison to human drugs, the business is not as strictly regulated.  Pfizer’s animal health business develops products for livestock and pets, and operates in more than 60 countries. It posted revenue of about $3.6 billion last year, making it one of the world’s largest in the field. Analysts put the value of the business at $10 billion to $16 billion.  Bayer had net financial debt excluding pension liabilities of 7.40 billion euros at the end of the June, which is some 300 million euros more than it earned last year before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and special items.  Dekkers said the group was also looking for possible targets in agrobusiness and genetically modified food technology.  “We thinking more in terms of smaller acquisitions,” he told the magazine in an interview that will be published on Monday.  The Bayer CEO called a possible mega-merger between his pharma division and a rival as a theoretical option that was more attractive than an outright acquisition.  “Current prices for big transactions makes it very difficult to recoup your investment, so a merger among equals is much more elegant,” he said.  “I won’t speculate on names. I know all CEOs of the major pharma companies and enjoy speaking to all of them about industry topics.”  Bayer is bracing for impacts on its bottom line from the loss of patents on its popular Yaz and Yasmin families of birth control pills, which Dekkers anticipates will lead to a single digit percentage decline in global sales of the pills starting this year.  By 2013, he is aiming for robust organic growth in Bayer’s drugs business, when stroke treatment Xarelto along with two or three other medications should hit the market.  Dekkers said he expects cancer drug Alpharadin to generate peak sales in the “several hundreds of millions of euros.”  ",8072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-pfizer/bayer-eyes-pfizers-animal-health-business-report-idUSTRE77613P20110807

33,LLY,"Financial advisers have ""black Monday"" blues","NEW YORK (Reuters) - For plenty of financial advisers — who also serve as quasi-therapists, spiritual gurus and confidantes — Monday was bad.  Really bad.  The S&P 500 posted its largest drop — more than 6 percent — in nearly three years, sparked by rising fears of a recession and fueled by the United States’ loss of its perfect triple-A credit rating. Panicked selling on heavy volume resulted in the S&P’s worst day since December 2008 — every stock in the benchmark index’s components ended the session in negative territory.  An adviser at a brokerage giant Merrill Lynch office in a Philadelphia suburb said the phones rang off the hook all day.  “Thank goodness for people who are on vacation and not calling in, although many are,” she said, asking not to be identified by name due to company policy. “Every call is too long. Tons of emails. Everyone doing conference calls, which are pretty much worthless.”  She turned down the television volume several times and “thought about putting on the Food Channel.”  Alan Haft, an independent financial adviser in Newport Beach, California, said his phone was buzzing with calls from clients wanting to “sell everything.”  “One calls saying the Mayan Calendar is coming true, that he’s absolutely certain this really is the beginning of the end of the world,” Haft said.  The eight money managers at Capital Investment Advisors in Atlanta started their day with an emergency 8 a.m. EDT meeting to review the situation. The good news? “We don’t think this is 2008,” said Mitch Reiner, chief operating officer at the firm.  Reiner said more aggressive clients took advantage of cheap prices, adding Intel, Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly and other large-cap dividend stocks to their portfolios.

Reiner’s response: “Because you can’t handle being down 3 percent.”  Trying to talk people off a ledge is never easy.

But several advisers who focus on long-term financial planning say their phones were quiet on Monday.

37,LLY,"J&J;, Lilly drugs found among best for manic episodes"," * Study finds generic haloperidol ranks top for acute treatment   * Researchers say findings should inform clinical guidelines    By Kate Kelland	   LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Antipsychotics are far more effective than mood stabilisers in tackling acute manic episodes, researchers found, and Eli Lilly’s Zyprexa, Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal and generic haloperidol outperform the rest. 	   In a study published in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, researchers from Britain and Italy ranked antipsychotic drugs according to their effectiveness and said that since current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between the drugs, their findings could offer useful guidance for doctors.	   “Strikingly, some antipsychotic drugs were overall significantly more effective than mood stabilisers,” the researchers, led by Andrea Cipriani of Verona University and John Geddes of Oxford University, wrote in their study.	   “These results have potential clinical implications that should be considered in the development of clinical practice guidelines.”	   Mania, defined as an “excessively raised mood”, affects around 1 percent of the population worldwide, and experts say it tends to alternate with periods of depression. These swings define the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.	   Cipriani’s team analysed the results from 68 randomised controlled trials involving more than 16,000 participants from January 1980 to November 2010 to compare the most common drugs used to treat acute mania in adults. 	   They found that haloperidol, Zyprexa and Risperdal were the most effective antimanic drugs and said they “should be considered as among the best of the available options for the treatment of manic episodes”.	   Zyprexa has been one of Elli Lilly’s top-selling drugs, but is set to lose its valuable marketing exclusivity in the United States in October. 	   Haloperidol also had the highest number of significant differences in head-to-head comparisons, coming out better than Otsuka Pharmaceutical’s Abilify, known generically as aripiprazole;` carbamazepine, sold as Carbatrol by Shire  and Tegretol by Novartis ; valproate, sold by Abbott Laboratories as Depakine and Sanofi-Aventis as Epilim; Lundbeck’s and Merck’s asenapine.	   It also ranked higher than Pfizer’s Neurontin or gabapentin; lamotrigine, sold by GlaxoSmithKline as Lamictal; AstraZeneca’s Seroquel or quetiapine; J&J’s Topamax or topiramate and several other generic treatments, including lithium, the researchers said.	   Risperdal, Zyprexa and Seroquel were least likely to result in patients deciding to stop their treatment and were better than many mood stabilisers, the study found.	   In a commentary on the study also published in the Lancet, Michael Berk of Deakin University, Australia, and Gin Malhi at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney said its findings were likely “to attract much interest and have a substantial effect both on clinical practice guidelines and real-world treatment”.	   But they added that while haloperidol “seems to have won the race for pole position in the treatment of acute mania”, management of these episodes is not always the primary treatment aim.	   “Instead, the main goals of treatment are attention to long-term mood stability and prophylaxis,” they said, suggesting that haloperidol may not always be best in these circumstances.

39,LLY,Sanofi make generic of Pfizer's Lipitor -paper," PARIS, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Sanofi has won a licence from Pfizer to make a generic of the U.S. drugmaker’s cholesterol treatment Lipitor, the world’s best-selling treatment, which will lose patent protection next year.	   Les Echos newspaper, citing two sources close to the matter, reported on Thursday that Sanofi’s generic drugmaker Zentiva will be allowed to produce Lipitor’s active ingredient atorvastatine in France possibly even before the patent’s expiry on May 7, 2012.   No one at Sanofi was immediately available to comment.	   The deal is part of France’s Strategic Council of Health Industries (CSIS) programme, a cooperation agreement between the sector and the government, which gives the original drugmaker a tax break if it allows a generic drugmaker to produce and sell cheaper copies as the branded drug’s patent expires.	   The CSIS agreement is aimed to keep production sites and employment in France. In France, Lipitor is known under the brand Tahor.	   A similar deal was signed in 2010 with U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly allowing Delpharm to produce the main ingredient of its anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa.

43,LLY,Researchers find possible drug target for PTSD,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - People with post-traumatic stress disorder appear to have lower levels of a specific kind of brain chemical known as serotonin 1B, and targeting this with drugs could lead to the first treatments specifically targeting the disorder, researchers said on Monday.  Currently, doctors use antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs to treat PTSD, but these are largely ineffective and were never specifically developed to treat the disorder, in which trauma victims suffer from recurrent memories of trauma, intense guilt or worry, angry outbursts and bad dreams.  “The medications we have these days are not working for PTSD,” said Dr. Alexander Neumeister of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, whose study appears in the Archives of General Psychiatry.  To address this, Neumeister and a team at the Yale Positron Emission Tomography Center used imaging to study the specific differences in the brain between people who have PTSD and others who have had traumatic experiences but do not have PTSD.  For the study, researchers performed positron emission tomography or PET scans of 49 PTSD patients whose conditions arose from a variety of traumatic events, including childhood abuse, domestic violence and military service.  Researchers also looked at the brains of 20 trauma victims with no PTSD and 27 healthy adult volunteers.  They found that people with PTSD had changes in the serotonin 1B receptor, a key neurotransmitter that in animal studies appears to be especially sensitive to stress.  The researchers found that levels of serotonin 1B were substantially lower in patients with PTSD than in healthy patients. Levels of this neurotransmitter were also slightly lower in the non-PTSD group who had been exposed to trauma compared with the healthy volunteers.  And the younger a person was when the trauma occurred, the bigger the difference.  “In those individuals who had early trauma in their life, we found the most severe alteration in the serotonin 1B receptor,” Neumeister said in a telephone interview.  The findings, which need to be confirmed by bigger studies, offer a first step in developing drugs specifically designed to target brain changes that occur in people with PTSD.  “Currently, the only medical treatment options for the nearly 8 million American adults with PTSD are anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, which show little benefit in improving the mental health of these patients,” Neumeister said in a statement.  Neumeister said several drug companies, including Eli Lilly and Merck & Co already are exploring drugs that target this receptor, and other drug targets are being looked at as well.  “Hopefully in the near future we will have drugs that will interfere with this receptor,” Neumeister said.

45,LLY,"Diabetes ""massive challenge"" as cases hit 366 million","LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people living with diabetes has soared to 366 million, and the disease kills one person every seven seconds, posing a “massive challenge” to healthcare systems worldwide, experts said on Tuesday.  The vast majority of those with the disease have Type 2 — the kind linked to poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise — and the problem is spreading as people in the developing world adopt more Western lifestyles.  Diabetics have inadequate blood sugar control, which can lead to serious complications like heart disease and stroke, damage to the kidneys or nerves, and to blindness. Worldwide deaths from the disease are now running at 4.6 million a year.  The latest figures, unveiled at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) congress in Lisbon, underline the need for urgent action by governments at a U.N. meeting next week, according to top doctors in the field.  The high-level United Nations meeting in New York on September 19-20 — only the second to focus on disease after one on AIDS in 2001 — will consider what should be done to counter the growing problem of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes.  Food, drinks and tobacco companies are in the firing line for selling products linked to cancer, heart disease and diabetes, but health campaigners fear politicians may not set firm targets or provide funds for a decent fight.  The NCD Alliance, which groups 2,000 health organizations from around the world, argues that spending $9 billion a year on tobacco control, food advice and basic treatments would avert tens of millions of untimely deaths this decade.  Cash-strapped governments, however, have baulked at finding new money, though the cost of inaction may be even greater, with annual healthcare spending on diabetes alone now put at $465 billion.  The new figures on the prevalence and cost of diabetes are to be published in the fifth edition of the Diabetes Atlas, the authoritative guide to the disease issued by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).  The previous edition in October 2009 had estimated the number of diabetics at 285 million for 2010, although a separate study published in the Lancet medical journal in June this year had already put the figure at a much higher 347 million.  “The IDF’s latest Atlas data are proof indeed that diabetes is a massive challenge the world can no longer afford to ignore. In 2011 one person is dying from diabetes every seven seconds,” said IDF President Jean Claude Mbanya.  Mbanya and EASD Vice-President Andrew Boulton said more research was needed into strengthening health systems around the world to deal with diabetes.  Many older classes of diabetes drugs are now available as cheap generics, but global drugmakers — including Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — aim to introduce new classes of drugs that could further extend treatment options.  Global sales of diabetes medicines totaled $35 billion last year and could rise to as much as $48 billion by 2015, according to research firm IMS Health, driven by increased prevalence and treatment, especially in countries such as China, India, Mexico and Brazil.

47,LLY,Pfizer CFO says no decision yet on divestitures,"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has not decided how it might divest its nutrition or animal health businesses, the drugmaker’s chief financial officer said on Wednesday.  Pfizer in July announced it was exploring options, including spin-off or sale, of the two businesses. Their combined value could reach about $25 billion to $32 billion, according to Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold.  A Bloomberg News report on Tuesday, citing anonymous sources, said that Pfizer was delaying a sale of the nutrition business to explore whether a tax-free spin-off was a better option. Asked about the report, Pfizer CFO Frank D’Amelio told an investor conference that no decision had been reached.  “We haven’t reached a conclusion on any structure,” D’Amelio said at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York.  He said the variables involved in the decision for the units included tax consequences, regulatory hurdles, potential buyers and market conditions. Pfizer has said it does not expect to make any announcement about the businesses until next year.  Some analysts have said that a spin-off of the animal health business is more likely because a sale could encounter objections from anti-trust regulators.  The drugmaker’s decision on the units came after a review of the company’s entire business portfolio under CEO Ian Read, a company veteran who took the helm in December.  The review concluded that Pfizer should hang on to its established-products unit, which sells generic drugs, and which some on Wall Street also hoped would be a candidate to be sold off.  At the conference, D’Amelio said his vision for the future of Pfizer included one business that sells innovative products and another that sells established ones, which includes generic drugs and would generate a lot of cash.  “When you get out several years, I think we’ll have those two kinds of distinct businesses,” he said. The financial goal with that structure, he said, is “consistent sustainable earnings growth over time.”  D’Amelio also said Pfizer was improving its return on investment in its research operations.  He pointed to the fact that, at the time Pfizer announced its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009, the combined research budget of the companies was $11 billion. Next year, he said, Pfizer is forecasting research spending of $6.5 billion to $7 billion.  That spending is lower than what Pfizer was spending on its own at the time of the Wyeth deal, D’Amelio said, “and I believe our productivity, our output is better.”  Pfizer’s decision to cut back research spending has been controversial. While praised by some on Wall Street as a needed move after a decade of the industry’s failure to see return on huge research spending, the cuts are a worrisome sign to others in the industry.  Eli Lilly CEO John Lechleiter, for example, has said it would be a mistake for the company to significantly cut its research budget in order to discover new therapies.

49,LLY,"Obama signs patent bill, sees boost for innovators","(Reuters) - President Barack Obama signed into law a patent overhaul bill on Friday that backers say will curb frivolous lawsuits and help the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office do the hiring needed to clear a huge backlog of applications.  Obama said the law would give a boost to U.S. businesses, in part by giving the patent office the funding it needs to catch up on the backlog of nearly 675,000 patent applications.  “It’s a bill that will put a dent in the huge stack of patent applications waiting for review. It will help startups and small business owners turn their ideas into products three times faster than they can today,” Obama said at a signing ceremony carried on television.  “And it will improve patent quality and help give entrepreneurs the protection and the confidence they need to attract investment to grow their businesses and to hire more workers.”  While the administration has repeatedly pushed the measure as a jobs bill, some members of the patent community are skeptical of any direct effects.  “As for manufacturing or industry hiring lots of workers, I think that may be a little bit overblown,” said Bernard Codd, an attorney with McDermott Will & Emery. “I think it’s going to depend more on the national economy picking up. This may be a piece of the puzzle.”  In a rare show of bipartisanship, the Democrat-controlled Senate voted on September 8 to approve a version of the legislation that had come from the Republican-held House of Representatives.  Similar to a measure sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, the measure won praise from Republicans such as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Representative Darrell Issa, himself a patent holder.  The patent overhaul began at the urging of the tech industry, which makes devices containing hundreds of patented technologies and has faced growing numbers of patent infringement lawsuits.  There was initial opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, whose products often rely on a single patent, but the bill went through many changes. Eli Lilly and Co Chief Executive John Lechleiter attended the signing ceremony at a northern Virginia high school, the White House said.  The tech industry had sought to cut the number of infringement cases filed by patent-licensing companies which do not make products and are sometimes derided as “patent trolls.”  One portion of the new law places limits on who can be named as respondents in a single lawsuit, a measure aimed at these patent-holding companies.  “Some of these lawsuits name 50 or even 100 defendants,” said Colleen Chien, who teaches patent law at Santa Clara Law School. Chien said the law would reduce that problem.  The measure would also grant patents to the first inventors to file, rather than requiring inventors to show they were the first to develop an innovation. The change will make it easier for companies who file for patents in numerous countries.  One goal of the bill is to give the patent office more resources so it will do a better job of assessing patent applications, with the idea that rejecting bad patents will head off some litigation.  There were 2,296 patent lawsuits in 2000 in U.S. district courts. That number rose 23 percent to 2,833 in 2010, according to Joshua Walker, head of Lex Machina, which tracks patent litigation. In addition, the number of defendants per lawsuit rose, from an average of two in 2000 to three in 2010.  The legislation is designed to end the practice of fees paid to the patent office being diverted to the U.S. Treasury. There is some skepticism, however, among the ranks of patent holders that lawmakers — desperate to reduce budget deficits — will live up to pledges to end the diversion.  The law will also allow anyone — including a company’s rivals — to scrutinize newly granted patents and give the patent office evidence to show why it should not be allowed.  Half of the patents challenged in court are invalidated, which means they never should have been issued, says Daniel Ravicher, who teaches at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.

It will help startups and small business owners turn their ideas into products three times faster than they can today,” Obama said at a signing ceremony carried on television.   “And it will improve patent quality and help give entrepreneurs the protection and the confidence they need to attract investment to grow their businesses and to hire more workers.”   While the administration has repeatedly pushed the measure as a jobs bill, some members of the patent community are skeptical of any direct effects.   “As for manufacturing or industry hiring lots of workers, I think that may be a little bit overblown,” said Bernard Codd, an attorney with McDermott Will & Emery. “I think it’s going to depend more on the national economy picking up. This may be a piece of the puzzle.”   In a rare show of bipartisanship, the Democrat-controlled Senate voted on Sept. 8 to approve a version of the legislation that had come from the Republican-held House of Representatives.   Similar to a measure sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, the measure won praise from Republicans such as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Representative Darrell Issa, himself a patent holder.   The patent overhaul began at the urging of the tech industry, which makes devices containing hundreds of patented technologies and has faced growing numbers of patent infringement lawsuits.   There was initial opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, whose products often rely on a single patent, but the bill went through many changes. Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) Chief Executive John Lechleiter attended the signing ceremony at a northern Virginia high school, the White House said.   The tech industry had sought to cut the number of infringement cases filed by patent-licensing companies which do not make products and are sometimes derided as “patent trolls.”   One portion of the new law places limits on who can be named as respondents in a single lawsuit, a measure aimed at these patent-holding companies.   “Some of these lawsuits name 50 or even 100 defendants,” said Colleen Chien, who teaches patent law at Santa Clara Law School. Chien said the law would reduce that problem.   The measure would also grant patents to the first inventors to file, rather than requiring inventors to show they were the first to develop an innovation. The change will make it easier for companies who file for patents in numerous countries.   One goal of the bill is to give the patent office more resources so it will do a better job of assessing patent applications, with the idea that rejecting bad patents will head off some litigation.   There were 2,296 patent lawsuits in 2000 in U.S. district courts. That number rose 23 percent to 2,833 in 2010, according to Joshua Walker, head of Lex Machina, which tracks patent litigation. In addition, the number of defendants per lawsuit rose, from an average of two in 2000 to three in 2010.   The legislation is designed to end the practice of fees paid to the patent office being diverted to the U.S. Treasury. There is some skepticism, however, among the ranks of patent holders that lawmakers — desperate to reduce budget deficits — will live up to pledges to end the diversion.   The law will also allow anyone — including a company’s rivals — to scrutinize newly granted patents and give the patent office evidence to show why it should not be allowed.   Half of the patents challenged in court are invalidated, which means they never should have been issued, says Daniel Ravicher, who teaches at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.

51,LLY,Sanofi CEO says drug industry undervalued,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanofi SA’s (SASY.PA) chief executive has already put his company’s patent expiration woes in the rear view mirror and believes that the French drugmaker and the pharmaceutical industry are undervalued.  “We’re not in a market that’s really looking at fundamentals right now. Personally, I think this is an industry that is getting ready for a re-rating,” Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher told Reuters in an interview in New York.  He said that could take place once investors digest the anticipated sales declines for huge selling drugs like Sanofi’s Plavix and Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Lipitor that are bracing for imminent generic competition.  Sanofi’s price-to-earnings ratio is about 7.5 times next year’s projected earnings. Several rival drugmakers are also in the high single digits.  “You typically have low double-digit PEs for the market and my ambition for Sanofi, and I think for what the industry would be too, is to at least close the discount,” he said.  Viehbacher, whose company makes a top-selling diabetes drug Lantus, is a bit envious of companies whose products have been accused of contributing to such health problems.  “I’d like to have the same P/E as people who make sodas and potato chips,” quipped the charismatic 51-year-old CEO. The soft drink sector has an average P/E ratio of 16.3, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The Paris-based company, whose Plavix blood clot preventer and Avapro blood pressure drug face generic competition next year, has taken steps to shore up investor confidence by diversifying product offerings and promising its dividend will go from a current 35 percent payout rate to the 50 percent range by no later than 2014.  The company plans to maintain that higher rate — the proportion of net company business income that is given to investors in the form of dividends — for years to come.  “If you are going to make commitments on dividend policy, you have to be prepared to make those long term,” he said.  Viehbacher said studies have shown that companies that provide higher dividend payouts “do better versus the broader market than those who do buybacks, in terms of share price.”  Sanofi is relying on vaccines, animal health and consumer health products, as well as emerging markets, for sustained profit growth in the post-blockbuster era for drugmakers.  “You don’t have to come up with the ‘son of Plavix’ to make your company succeed,” he said. He already views drugs about to lose patent protection like Plavix as “discontinued business”.  Viehbacher is no stranger to such cycles in the drug business. He became Sanofi’s CEO in 2008 after heading pharmaceuticals in North America for GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L).  “This is the fourth time I’ve been through a patent cliff in my career and the objective of this is to avoid a fifth one,” he said.  Viehbacher said the company’s recent $20.1 billion purchase of U.S.-based Genzyme and its biotech drugs for rare diseases dovetails with that strategy. He said integration of Genzyme was going well, and that he did not plan more large deals.  “The company is nicely balanced, so I don’t particularly see any reason to go out and do big deals, so that’s completely off our radar screen,” Viehbacher said. “We’re going to continue to spend about 1 to 2 billion euros ($1.36 billion to $2.7 billion) per year on acquisitions.”  Viehbacher said he expects Genzyme’s manufacturing woes to be largely resolved by the middle of next year with the opening of a new plant in Framingham, Mass. the most critical step.  Genzyme failed to ship its drug for Fabry disease, Fabrazyme, in August despite prior assurances, and will have limited supplies of Gaucher disease drug Cerezyme through January, opening the door to further inroads by rivals.  Viehbacher, who described his company as “a cash machine” said Sanofi’s resources had helped get several delayed Genzyme projects back on track, including three Phase III trials.  He expressed confidence in Genzyme’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug Lemtrada, which will have critical Phase III data this year after reducing MS relapses by 60 percent in Phase II trials. And he is excited about a new diabetes treatment from the GLP-1 class that Sanofi is developing and also plans to combine with Lantus.  Sanofi plans to file for approval of six new drugs over a nine month period, Viehbacher said. He said the success of Lemtrada and other new drugs would restore faith in the company’s research and development reputation.  Meanwhile Viehbacher said Lantus, Sanofi’s $5.2 billion-a-year long-acting insulin, was not likely to see generic rivals in the foreseeable future.  “You’re going to have other competitors,” he said, citing new products coming from rivals Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) and Eli Lilly (LLY.N), “but at this stage we don’t see anything that causes us great concern.”  He also appeared to shrug off concerns that Sanofi’s Multaq drug for irregular heartbeat could face sales limitations or even be pulled from the market over safety concerns.  A European regulatory panel will discuss Multaq safety this week after heart problems surfaced in a study of patients with a more serious permanent form of atrial fibrillation. The drug is now typically given to patients whose incidence of irregular heart rhythms comes and goes.  “All of the conversations we’ve had with the agencies to date have been very positive,” he said. “We believe that the benefits clearly are there for the patients.”  ",9202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi/sanofi-ceo-says-drug-industry-undervalued-idUSTRE78J22C20110920

The pediatric advisory committee voted 16-1 to support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s routine safety monitoring of the new generation of antipsychotics.  But they did so with a caveat that the agency specifically looks at how to clarify the drugs’ labels to highlight concerns of their impact on children, namely the risks of weight gain and diabetes.  “We ask that with this upcoming revision that you carefully consider the language around pediatric use and adverse events,” said Dr. Geoffrey Rosenthal, the committee’s chair and director of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.  The FDA in the next month to six weeks will release a revised label for Abilify, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Otsuka Pharmaceutical, which is one of the antipsychotic drugs approved for use in children.  The new label will detail the drug’s latest clinical trials, warn of metabolic concerns and remind doctors to monitor patient weight and symptoms of diabetes, said Dr. Tom Laughren, FDA’s psychiatry products chief.  The new generation of antipsychotic medications has raised a wave of concerns as they are increasingly being prescribed for a host of uses and for younger and younger patients, with little conclusive research addressing their impact on children and sometimes with little evidence they work.

U.S. researchers have found that the drugs’ use in children increased by 65 percent from 2002 to 2009, primarily through prescriptions for teenagers.  From fall 2009 to spring of this year, 1.9 million prescriptions were written for patients under 18, most commonly for bipolar disorder in teenagers and toddlers aged 3 to 6, and for affective psychoses in children between the ages of 7 and 12.

56,LLY,Analysis: Open-access R&D; one answer to drug industry woes,"LONDON (Reuters) - Drug companies are learning how to share.  In a bid to save both time and money, some of the industry’s biggest names are experimenting with new ways to pool early-stage research, effectively taking a leaf out of the “open-source” manual that gave the world Linux software.  If it takes off, the approach could break the mold of current drug research and speed the development of tomorrow’s life-saving medicines for diseases from cancer to autism.  At the University of Oxford on Wednesday, two more companies — Pfizer and Eli Lilly — signed up for the first phase of the concept by joining existing backers GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis in an unusual public-private research partnership.  As supporters of the international Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), the rivals give cash and scientific resources for work into the three-dimensional structure of proteins — important for drug discovery — even though all the findings are made available to scientists worldwide without restriction.  In all, the SGC has secured $49 million in new funding.  Next year, a far more ambitious scheme is slated to take cooperation to another level by promoting open-access, patent-free research right up to mid-stage “proof of concept” clinical trials, known as Phase II.  The bold idea calls for drugmakers to trade exclusivity for the chance to get in on the ground floor of new therapies. After the initial sharing phase, companies could cash in by developing their own versions of any new medicines.  Patents may be the life-blood of the drugs industry but a growing band of rebels believe the current system of building walls around the science is counter-productive because companies end up working in parallel and duplicating research.  “It’s a horrendous waste of money, a horrendous waste of resource and waste of peoples’ careers,” says Chas Bountra, the SGC’s chief scientist, who is also a founder of the new project to take open-access research into the clinical arena.  “There is also an ethical and moral dilemma here because the way we are currently doing drug discovery means that we are exposing patients to molecules that other groups know are destined to fail. That is tragic.”  Bountra, who knows the industry well after working for nearly 20 years at GSK, is convinced that no one company can fully grasp the myriad genetic and other factors behind complex diseases like cancer.  Stephen Friend — another founder of the patent-free drug development project known as Arch2POCM — is also an industry veteran, having founded Rosetta Inpharmatics and gone on to head Merck & Co’s cancer research, before shifting to establish the non-profit group Sage Bionetworks in Seattle.  Friend told Reuters the new project, whose name derives from “archipelago” and “proof of clinical mechanism,” was on track to launch in 2012, with an initial focus on cancer and two areas in neuroscience, autism and schizophrenia.  A meeting is planned with drug companies in November to hammer out details on the oncology program.  Friend hopes to have at least three companies on board in cancer, each putting in $4 million a year in cash and “in-kind” expertise, with extra funding from public and private bodies giving a total budget of around $150 million over five years.  The neuroscience program, which is running a couple of months behind, would be of a similar size, making the overall venture significant, though still a side bet by comparison with the $68 billion Big Pharma spent on research last year.  It amounts to a radical departure for an industry used to playing its cards close to chest.  But Keith Blundy — who has a ringside seat as CEO of Cancer Research Technology, which strikes alliances with drug firms on behalf of Britain’s leading cancer charity — believes global drug companies are thinking outside the box these days.  “What people are prepared to entertain now is a long way away from what it was a couple of years ago,” he says. “Industry has pulled all the levers it can and new models have got to be considered.”  The stark fact is that current returns on drug research are dismal, prompting the first decline in R&D spending in 2010, after decades of relentless increases.  How far drug companies are prepared to go in embracing the Arch2POCM model remains to be seen.  Friend argues they would have two bites of the cherry to make a commercial drug — either by buying exclusive rights to data generated from any successful unpatented drug or, more significantly, by using the research as a jumping-off point for developing their own proprietary molecules.  Patrick Vallance, head of medicines discovery and development at GSK, says the new approach makes sense in principle but commercial decisions by companies on when they need to secure intellectual property (IP) will inevitably vary.  “I think going through to Phase II with everything in an IP-free environment is not going to happen,” he says.  “But there may be some areas that really benefit. For example, everyone is struggling with trying to understand aspects of neuroscience — having a few more molecules that probe specific pathways could be really beneficial for the whole field and for industry.”  ",9282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-research/analysis-open-access-rd-one-answer-to-drug-industry-woes-idUSTRE78R3RP20110928

The Food and Drug Administration said Cialis could be labeled for treatment of the signs and symptoms of a non-cancerous enlarged prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and also be used for people who have both BPH and erectile dysfunction.   About half of men over 50 suffer from prostate problems, which can cause difficulty urinating.   “BPH can have a big impact on a patient’s quality of life,” said Scott Monroe, director of the FDA’s division of reproductive and urologic products. “Cialis offers these men another treatment option, particularly those who also have ED (erectile dysfunction), which is also common in older men.”   U.S. researchers reported in the journal Urology in 2008 that impotence drugs could help reduce the symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate.   The FDA said it has approved eight other drugs to treat BPH, including Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Proscar, GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) Avodart and Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Cardura.   In an interview in July, Eli Lilly CEO John Lechleiter said he expects the longer-lasting Cialis to overtake Pfizer’s Viagra to become the market leader for impotence drugs.   Cialis, which the FDA approved for impotence in 2003, posted sales of $1.7 billion in 2010, up nine percent from the previous year, while global Viagra sales climbed 2 percent last year to $1.9 billion.

The FDA said it has approved eight other drugs to treat BPH, including Merck & Co’s Proscar, GlaxoSmithKline’s Avodart and Pfizer’s Cardura. In an interview in July, Eli Lilly CEO John Lechleiter said he expects the longer-lasting Cialis to overtake Pfizer’s Viagra to become the market leader for impotence drugs. Cialis, which the FDA approved for impotence in 2003, posted sales of $1.7 billion in 2010, up nine percent from the previous year, while global Viagra sales climbed two percent last year to $1.9 billion.",10072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cialis-enlarged-prostate/fda-oks-eli-lillys-cialis-for-enlarged-prostate-idUSTRE7963CY20111007
60,LLY,"UPDATE 4-Eli Lilly profit drops, hurt by higher costs","* Q3 EPS, excluding items, $1.13, matching forecast * Sales narrowly top expectations * Warns of “severe decline” in Zyprexa sales * Shares down 1 pct By Ransdell Pierson Oct 20 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly , whose top-selling schizophrenia drug will face cheaper generics this weekend, said quarterly earnings fell due to higher expenses, and the company’s shares fell 1 percent. While third-quarter profit matched Wall Street forecasts, Lilly warned on Thursday that Zyprexa will face a “rapid and severe decline” in revenue after the $4.5 billion-a-year product on Sunday begins facing competition from cheaper generics in the United States. “Overall, a decent in-line quarter for the company, yet for many investors it is the longer-term financial outlook that matters, and here Lilly’s outlook remains challenging,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. Lilly reported third quarter earnings fell to $1.24 billion, or $1.11 per share, from $1.3 billion, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Lilly earned $1.13 per share, matching the average forecast of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global company revenue rose 9 percent to $6.15 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $6.06 billion. Revenue would have risen 5 percent if not for the weak dollar, which raises the value of overseas sales. Quarterly sales of Zyprexa, which last month lost patent protection in most of Europe, fell 3 percent to $1.18 billion. Two of Lilly’s other top drugs are girding for their own confrontations with generics. Its Cymbalta anti-depressant, with $4 billion in annual sales, goes generic in mid-2013, and generic forms of its Evista osteoporosis drug arrive in 2014. Global sales of Cymbalta jumped 29 percent to $1.07 billion in the quarter, while sales of Evista rose 5 percent to $270 million. Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, which together accounted for 41 percent of the company’s third-quarter revenue, are expected to lose three-fourths or more of their sales soon after the generics become available. Lilly has vowed to remain independent through the three year-patent cliff, rather than merging with another big drugmaker to cushion the generic blows. Instead, it may even boost research spending through 2014 to produce a new crop of drugs as its top-sellers fade from view. “What’s critical in this period is to be able to make the investments in the (drug) pipeline,” Chief Executive John Lechleiter said in an interview. Lechleiter said Lilly is putting its faith in scores of drugs now winding their way through clinical trials. They include experimental treatments for diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis and lupus. Lechleiter said growing sales of other Lilly brands will help offset lost sales of Zyprexa — including Strattera for attention deficit disorder, impotence treatment Cialis and Alimta for lung cancer. Fast-growing sales of its drugs in Japan and in emerging markets, as well as growing demand for its animal-health products, will also help fill the revenue vacuum, he said. Lilly said total operating expenses rose 10 percent in the quarter, due in part to costs of a new diabetes-drug collaboration with German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. Research and development spending rose 5 percent to $1.28 billion, equivalent to almost 21 percent of total company revenue. But the company’s tax rate fell sharply due to resolution of an IRS audit, shoring up results. Aided by the lower taxes, the Indianapolis drugmaker said it now expects a profit for full-year 2011 of $4.30 to $4.35 per share, from its earlier view of $4.25 to $4.35 per share. That would reflect a profit decline of 8 percent to 9 percent from last year.

61,LLY,Lilly withdraws sepsis drug Xigris from market,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said it is withdrawing its sepsis drug Xigris from all markets after it failed to help patients live longer in a clinical trial. “While there were no new safety findings, the study failed to demonstrate that Xigris improved patient survival and thus calls into question the benefit-risk profile of Xigris and its continued use,” Timothy Garnett, Lilly’s chief medical officer, said in a statement on Tuesday. Approved in the United States in 2001 and in Europe in 2002, Xigris never reached its initial lofty sales expectations. The intravenously infused drug, also known as drotrecogin alfa, had global sales of about $100 million last year. Sepsis is a severe, often life-threatening illness caused by the body’s response to infections. Sepsis, which causes shock that can shut down multiple organs, occurs in 1 to 2 percent of all hospitalizations in the United States, according to The Journal of the American Medical Association. Lilly estimated it would take a charge tied to the withdrawal in the range of $75 million to $95 million in the fourth quarter, or about 5 cents per share after taxes. It maintained its full-year profit forecast that excludes special items. The setback comes only two days after Lilly’s top-selling product, the schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa, lost U.S. patent protection in the United States — making it prey to cheaper generics. The clinical study of Xigris, known as PROWESS-SHOCK, began in March 2008 as a condition for continued market authorization in Europe. Results of the 1,696-patient study showed Xigris did not meet the main goal of a statistically significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with septic shock. According to European Medicines Agency, 26.4 percent of patients taking Xigris died compared with 24.2 percent taking a placebo, a difference that was not deemed statistically significant. The risk of severe bleeding events in the study, the main risk with Xigris, was similar, “suggesting there was no increased harm” from the Lilly drug, according to the European regulators. Patients currently receiving Xigris treatment should stop, while doctors should not start any new patients on the drug, Lilly said. Lilly shares were down 0.7 percent at $37.94 on Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

62,LLY,"UPDATE 4-Lilly pulls sepsis drug Xigris, no benefit found","* Clinical study showed no survival benefit * Xigris was approved in U.S. in 2001 * Lilly to take Q4 charge of $75 mln-$95 mln * Shares down 1.6 percent By Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson Oct 25 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co withdrew its sepsis drug Xigris from all markets after the product, deemed a potential big seller when it was approved a decade ago, failed to improve survival in a clinical trial. Sepsis is a severe, often life-threatening illness caused by the immune system’s over-aggressive response to infections — releasing inflammatory proteins that cause shock and shut down multiple organs. The condition occurs in 1 to 2 percent of all hospitalizations in the United States. Xigris, which has never reached its lofty initial sales projections, had global sales of about $100 million in 2010. It has garnered total sales of $1.5 billion since being approved in the United States in 2001 and in Europe the following year. The intravenous drug increased the risk of serious bleeding in earlier studies, although no significant higher risk was found in the latest study. “While there were no new safety findings, the study failed to demonstrate that Xigris improved patient survival and thus calls into question the benefit-risk profile of Xigris and its continued use,” Timothy Garnett, Lilly’s chief medical officer, said in a statement on Tuesday. Patients currently receiving Xigris treatment should stop, while doctors should not start any new patients on the drug, Lilly said. The failed study, called PROWESS-SHOCK, comes only two days after Lilly’s top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment lost U.S. patent protection in the United States — making it prey to cheaper generics. The PROWESS-SHOCK study began in March 2008 as a condition for continued market authorization in Europe of Xigris, whose chemical name is drotrecogin alfa. Results of the 1,696-patient study showed Xigris did not meet the main goal of a statistically significant reduction in deaths from any cause over a 28-day period in patients with septic shock. According to European Medicines Agency, 26.4 percent of patients taking Xigris died compared with 24.2 percent taking a placebo, a difference that was not deemed statistically significant. The risk of severe bleeding events in the study, the main risk with Xigris, was similar, “suggesting there was no increased harm” from the Lilly drug, according to the European regulators. Xigris has been used on top of standard treatments, most notably intravenous fluids and antibiotics. In large studies conducted more than a decade ago, Xigris did significantly cut mortality, Lilly’s Garnett said. But in recent years, medical practice has greatly improved in intensive care units, Garnett said. Faster and more aggressive treatment with IV fluids and antibiotics has sharply improved survival rates of sepsis patients. “So the incremental benefit of Xigris is no longer apparent, and no longer clinically relevant,” Garnett said. Lilly estimated it would take a charge tied to the withdrawal in the range of $75 million to $95 million in the fourth quarter, or about 5 cents per share after taxes. It maintained its full-year profit forecast that excludes special items. Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler said the Xigris withdrawal was not a major setback for Lilly because Wall Street already had low expectations for the drug.

63,LLY,Eli Lilly faces tough times with patent losses,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co has hit a tough spot with the pharmaceutical company’s top treatment now facing competition from cheaper generic brands and the looming loss of patent protection on other drugs. “It may be one of our most challenging periods in our history because, as the way fate would have it, we lose patent protection on a number of products between now and 2014,” Lilly’s Chief Executive John Lechleiter told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit. Lilly’s best selling product, its $4.5 billion a year Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment, began facing cheaper generics in the United States a few weeks ago and the company will lose protection for antidepressant Cymbalta in 2013 and its Evista osteoporosis drug the year after. “Right now I have got my hands full. My goal is to help Lilly navigate through this tough patch,” said Lechleiter, who joined Lilly in 1979 as an organic chemist and became CEO in 2008. Lechleiter ruled out acquisitions to plug the hole left by Zyprexa and pointed to Lilly’s pipeline of potential medicines that were in the last stages of trials in the United States. “You can’t just order up a new menu item like it’s McDonald’s. It’s a longer-term cycle. Investors understand that,” he said. The Indiana-based company has forecast a minimum of $20 billion in sales, $3 billion in net income, and $4 billion in operating cash flow for the next few years. Lilly, the 10th largest pharmaceutical company in the world, is now vying to become the largest player for diabetes treatments. A recent break-up with long-term biotech partner Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc has freed up Lilly to pursue all types of diabetes products instead of being blocked by firewalls enacted as part of their partnership. Becoming No. 1 is “not out of the realm of possibility,” said Lechleiter. The company, which was the first to bring insulin to consumers in the 1920s, trails Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk. Lechleiter said his company could be in a position to compete effectively in insulin and oral diabetes medicines as well as maintaining its presence among a type of drug that stimulates insulin release when glucose levels become too high. Lechleiter and dozens of other executives were in Honolulu for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and discussed trade and business concerns with officials from the 21 Asia Pacific countries, including China.

64,LLY,APEC CEOs see threats but little impact on business,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Europe’s debt crisis and political gridlock in Washington are heightening business uncertainty among global corporations, but so far CEOs say strong global demand is offsetting any damage. Washington’s problems pose a longer-term threat. Business leaders fear that lawmakers are losing the ability to perform basic functions, making Congress unable to tackle policy needed to ensure the United States remains competitive. For now, companies from Caterpillar Inc to Eli Lilly and Co attending a CEO summit at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, said they are managing any loss of sales caused by turmoil in southern Europe. “We are seeing very minor impact,” Doug Oberhelman, the chief executive of Caterpillar told reporters on the sidelines of the APEC CEO summit here in Honolulu. APEC finance ministers on Thursday agreed that they need to shore up their defenses against fallout from a euro-zone debt crisis that threatens to pose a drag on growth for many months ahead. Oberhelman said the debate about Italy and Greece, which are struggling to stay solvent, has raised the degree of uncertainty in the world. But in terms of Caterpillar’s outlook, strong demand elsewhere has offset any losses. “Other parts of Europe and Eastern Europe and Africa are doing fairly well and will more than compensate for southern Europe in our industry,” he said. The world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer recently reported a surprising 44 percent increase in its quarterly results, driven by strong demand for mining equipment and construction machinery. Resource and construction industries are expanding rapidly to meet robust demand from China and other fast-growing emerging economies. Likewise, Nissan Motor Co’s corporate vice president told reporters there had been no impact on the Japanese automaker’s business. Eli Lilly, which has drug manufacturing and sales offices in Italy as well as dozens of other facilities around the world, is more on the front lines of the European crisis. In southern Europe, the 10th largest pharmaceutical company essentially depends on payments from governments since health care is largely funded by those countries’ authorities. “We are feeling the aftershocks of this crisis ... with pressure on pricing and in some cases delays in payments. But we are managing through that,” Lilly’s Chief Executive John Lechleiter told Reuters. “The impact so far has not been material.” After pulling through the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession, Caterpillar’s CEO said he expected the company to manage its business “no matter what.” “I am hopeful that the European authorities will find a way through that, but if they don’t we are prepared,” Oberhelman said. FedEx Express’ chief operating officer would not say whether the fallout had spilled into the shipping company’s operations, but Michael Ducker told Reuters: “We are doing what we have to do to manage this. “We have great flexibility in our business.” In the United States, companies are growing frustrated with Congress where Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided over how to reduce the $15 trillion U.S. public debt. “As businesses we are very concerned about it. Problems have to be solved. The political debate has gotten so caustic it has gotten in the way of that,” Tom Craren, managing partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, told Reuters. Lawmakers meeting in a special committee are trying to strike a longer-term deal to reduce the deficit. They have two weeks left to come up with a proposal. Many Republicans oppose raising taxes, while Democrats oppose deep cuts in social programs. The conflict follows a chaotic August budget fight, which nearly saw a government shutdown and a debt default. Business leaders urged compromise. “The U.S. fiscal problem has to get solved because long term it is not sustainable,” Craren said. Microsoft Corp’s chief research and strategy officer, Craig Mundie, also voiced concerns over the gridlock in Congress. “The deadlock that everybody observes in Congress, people outside the country, it makes them worried about whether the necessary policy things will get done,” Mundie told Reuters. A protracted fight over how to raise the country’s borrowing limit and rein in spending caused Standard & Poor’s to downgrade the United States’ top credit rating in August.

66,LLY,"UPDATE 2-Lilly drug boosts good cholesterol, appears safe","* Boosts HDL levels 128.8 pct at highest dose * No safety problems seen with drug in Phase II study * Company to begin Phase III trial “as soon as possible” By Lewis Krauskopf and Bill Berkrot ORLANDO, Fla., Nov 15 (Reuters) - An experimental heart drug from Eli Lilly and Co dramatically boosted levels of “good” cholesterol and appeared to be safe, according to data from a clinical trial, providing new hope for a class of medicines with a troubled past. The drug, evacetrapib, increased HDL cholesterol by 53.6 percent at the lowest dose and by a whopping 128.8 percent at the highest dose in the mid-stage study, according to the data, presented at the American Heart Association meeting in Orlando on Tuesday. It also cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol as much as 36 percent when used alone, and as much as 14 percent when taken on top of statins, the widely used cholesterol lowering pills. Researchers said evacetrapib showed none of the safety signals found with a similar drug developed by Pfizer Inc . That drug, torcetrapib, also showed robust increases in HDL, but Pfizer stopped development of the medicine in 2006 after it was found to increase deaths. “This is highly encouraging data that you’ve got an agent (evacetrapib) that has phenomenal effects on lipids and the safety profile looks clean,” said Dr. Stephen Nicholls, the study’s lead researcher and director of cardiovascular trials at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data. Statins and a raft of blood pressure medicines have dramatically reduced the number of heart attacks and strokes suffered by the population at large. But heart disease remains the No. 1 killer in the world, creating an opening for more effective medicines. Researchers recommended that evacetrapib begin a large, Phase III study that will show whether the drug prevents heart attacks and strokes, known as an outcomes trial. David Moller, Lilly’s head of endocrinology and cardiovascular research, said the company intends to begin its Phase III program “as soon as possible.” Two other so-called CETP drugs — Merck & Co’s  anacetrapib and Roche AG’s dalcetrapib — are already being tested among thousands of patients to see if they show such a benefit. Those drugs are seen as being further along in development than Lilly’s version. A Roche spokesman said the company expects to have final data from the first of two dalcetrapib outcomes trials in late 2012 or early 2013 But Moller said, “At this stage, it’s not clear who is going to be first in class or who is going to be best in class.” All of the drugs are designed to block the cholesteryl ester transfer protein, or CETP. Wall Street analysts have said the CETP drugs could reap $10 billion in annual sales, but they are skeptical that the drugs will ever reach the market, given the fate of torcetrapib, one of the highest-profile flameouts in the history of drug development. The study of evacetrapib involved 398 patients with either high levels of LDL or low levels of HDL. In one part of the study, patients received one of three evacetrapib doses — 30 milligrams, 100 milligrams or 500 milligrams — or a placebo. The HDL increase for the highest dose was comparable to the jaw-dropping rise shown by Merck’s anacetrapib. In another part of the study, patients received 100 mg of evacetrapib or a placebo on top of commonly used doses of the widely used statins Zocor, Lipitor and Crestor. For those patients, HDL increased between 78.5 percent and 88.5 over statins alone. “You have an enormously effective drug on lipid parameters, both HDL and LDL, whether you look at it from a monotherapy perspective or whether you look at it in combination with the three most commonly prescribed statins,” Nicholls said. From a safety perspective, the researchers found none of the blood chemistry changes that doomed torcetrapib. For example, they found no increases in blood pressure, or adverse changes in levels of the hormone aldosterone, which helps regulate blood pressure, or the hormone cortisol. “We have ruled out torcetrapib-like toxicity,” said Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, the study’s chairman. While still years from potentially reaching the market, evacetrapib could provide optimism for Lilly’s research pipeline at a time when the Indianapolis drugmaker desperately needs it. The company’s big-selling schizophrenia drug Zyprexa began facing generic competition in the United States last month, and two of its other biggest products lose patent protection in 2013 and 2014.

68,LLY,Lilly projects sharp drop in 2012 profit,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co forecast a sharp plunge in profits for 2012, the first full year its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment faces generic competition, and its shares fell as much as 3.6 percent. Like other drugmakers, Lilly is facing patent expirations on its most important medicines, leading generic competitors to erode billions of dollars in revenue. But unlike rivals such as Pfizer Inc, Lilly is not significantly cutting spending, including on research, in order to shore up profits. The Indianapolis-based company said it will maintain or even slightly increase its investment in research and development this year compared with 2011, while spending on sales and administration in 2012 would be higher than what analysts generally expected. Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice told analysts on a conference call that Lilly had pared down costs for several years to prepare for the Zyprexa patent expiration, including cutting more than 7,000 jobs since 2004. The company does not plan any additional major restructuring, he said. “Having substantially reduced our infrastructure, we are positioned to fund the R&D; that will drive our future growth” Rice said. The company projected earnings of $3.10 to $3.20 per share for 2012. Analysts’ average forecast is $3.61, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For 2011, Lilly said it expects to meet or exceed its previous profit forecast of $4.30 to $4.35 per share excluding one-time items. Including items, it expects $3.84 to $3.89 per share. Zyprexa, a $4.5 billion-a-year product, began facing U.S. competition in October from low-cost generic versions. Lilly’s Cymbalta antidepressant, with $4 billion in annual sales, goes generic in mid-2013, and generic forms of its Evista osteoporosis drug arrive in 2014. Chief Executive John Lechleiter has vowed to remain independent through the three-year patent cliff, rather than merging with another big drugmaker to cushion the generic blows. He has defended his stance on R&D; spending as necessary to usher in a new era of innovative medicines. Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said Lilly’s spending levels were “inconsistent” with rivals, so investors should not expect other drugmakers to issue similarly disappointing forecasts. Lilly said it had 12 drugs in late-stage, Phase III clinical studies, exceeding its goal of having 10 at that stage by the end of 2011. “Today’s guidance reaffirms the ongoing earnings pressure to Lilly’s results over next few years ... at a time when the company simultaneously needs to invest heavily in its pipeline,” JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. Lilly stood by its previous forecast for net income of at least $3 billion on revenue of at least $20 billion each year through 2014. For 2012, Lilly said it expects revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion. That would be a significant drop from the $24.2 billion analysts are looking for in 2011. Lilly expects Zyprexa sales to decline by more than $3 billion, which will be somewhat offset by growth in products such as Cymbalta, erectile dysfunction drug Cialis and its Humalog and Humulin insulins. Overall operating expenses will stay “essentially flat” in 2012, Lilly said. R&D; spending will stand at $5 billion to $5.3 billion in 2012, the company said, which will be flat or slightly higher than in 2011. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting late-stage results for Lilly’s experimental Alzheimer’s disease drug, solanezumab, which could be a huge seller. But many analysts doubt the product will prove effective. A panel of outside safety experts overseeing the Phase III trial for solanezumab will meet later this month and the company said it plans to provide an update at the end of January. JPMorgan’s Schott earlier this week projected that Lilly’s earnings per share would decline 5 percent a year on average through 2017. Lilly shares were down 1.9 percent at $39.93 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier low at $39.25.

70,LLY,"Generics take toll on Pfizer, Lilly profits","(Reuters) - Competition from low-cost generic drugs squeezed quarterly profits at Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N), but both companies were able to weather those declines somewhat with help from other medicines. Pfizer, the world’s biggest drugmaker, and Lilly topped Wall Street’s dim profit expectations. Lilly also said its closely watched experimental Alzheimer’s treatment was given a green light for further study, and its shares rose 1.2 percent. Pfizer’s quarterly results were helped by its animal health and nutrition units — businesses it is considering selling or spinning off. The company said on Tuesday that any separation of those businesses, which analysts say could bring in $16 billion, would occur between July 2012 and July 2013. That timetable was later than hoped for by some investors, who are eager to see Pfizer use the proceeds to buy back stock, said Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister. Pfizer shares fell 1.3 percent. “People were just hoping that this would occur sooner,” Bannister said. “Over time, this is going to work out the way investors hope it will.” While Pfizer’s revenue will shrink without those units, the streamlined company should get a significant boost to financial results when one of its newer drugs succeed, Bannister said. Pfizer has recently won approval for two cancer drugs, and may soon win clearance for promising medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and blood clot prevention. “Once you’re so large, it’s really difficult to move the needle,” Bannister said. “Lilly is the opposite of that right now. They’re small; one drug could make a difference for them.” Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, in a conference call with analysts, said the company should be viewed as two operations: a “growth business” of prescription drugs backed by strong research and development, and a “value business” dominated by its drugs that have lost patent protection and become generics. Asked in an interview if this framework could lead to an eventual spin-off of this generics business, Read said, “We would have to wait and see how the emerging markets develop and how our portfolio develops and at that point in time we would take that decision.” (For a graphic on Pfizer, Lilly earnings, see: link.reuters.com/wyx36s) For both Pfizer and Lilly, the fourth-quarter results marked the first period since they lost U.S. patent protection on their biggest-selling medicines. Pfizer saw sales of its Lipitor cholesterol treatment, long the world’s top-selling drug, drop 24 percent to about $2 billion. In the United States, where Lipitor lost patent protection in late November, sales fell 42 percent. Sales of Lilly’s Zyprexa anti-psychotic drug, for years the company’s biggest product, fell 44 percent to $750 million. Sales in the United States, where the pill lost patent protection in October, plunged 56 percent. Richard Purkiss, analyst with Atlantic Equities, said Pfizer’s profit margins markedly improved during the quarter, an unexpected trend given the onslaught of Lipitor generics. He noted that Pfizer expects similarly strong margins for the full year, most likely because of cost savings from the company’s purchase of U.S. rival Wyeth in late 2009. “The Wyeth takeout is benefitting the company” as Lipitor declines, Purkiss said. Pfizer’s fourth-quarter net income fell 50 percent to $1.44 billion, or 19 cents per share, from $2.89 billion, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Pfizer said results in the latest quarter appeared unfavorable in part because of a big tax benefit in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, earnings of 50 cents per share topped Wall Street’s target by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 4 percent to $16.75 billion but was a bit higher than Wall Street expectations of $16.61 billion. Softening the Lipitor declines, some of Pfizer’s other important drugs scored moderate sales gains, helped by price increases. Sales of arthritis treatment Enbrel and the Celebrex painkiller each rose 7 percent, to $865 million and $622 million, respectively. Sales of impotence treatment Viagra rose 5 percent to $523 million. As in the third quarter, Pfizer’s strongest gains came from its nutritional products and animal health units. Sales of animal health brands rose 13 percent to $1.1 billion, while sales of nutritional products — including baby formula and maternity supplements — jumped 22 percent to $598 million. Pfizer trimmed its 2012 financial forecasts, largely due to the negative impact of the stronger dollar. It projected 2012 earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, excluding items. That range was down from its prior outlook of $2.25 to $2.35. Lilly’s fourth-quarter net income fell 27 percent to $858.2 million, or 77 cents per share, from $1.17 billion, or $1.05 per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 87 cents per share, 6 cents ahead of analyst estimates. Global revenue fell 2 percent to $6.05 billion but topped Wall Street expectations of $5.9 billion. Sales growth of other top drugs helped counter Zyprexa’s declines, thanks in large part to price increases. Anti-depressant Cymbalta, which itself goes generic next year, saw sales jump 20 percent to $1.18 billion. Sales of lung cancer treatment Alimta rose 12 percent to $638 million while Lilly’s Humalog insulin vaulted 21 percent to $662 million. An independent data-monitoring committee overseeing two Phase III trials of Lilly’s solanezumab Alzheimer’s treatment recommended the studies continue without changes, the company said. Trial data is expected in the second half of the year. Many analysts believe solanezumab has little chance of success, but say the stock will soar if it works. Purkiss said Lilly’s quarterly results were “reasonably strong” but shares rose instead on the solanezumab news. “People are concerned about being underweight Lilly if the data come in positively,” said Purkiss.

It said an independent safety committee recommended continuing two late-stage clinical trials for its closely watched experimental Alzheimer’s treatment.

72,LLY,Lilly Alzheimer's drug an unlikely ace in the hole,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A treatment for Alzheimer’s disease is the drug industry’s longest shot, and any brave investors willing to place a bet on the outcome are likely to focus on Eli Lilly & Co. Lilly and Pfizer Inc are the farthest along in developing experimental medicines for the memory-robbing disease. But Lilly, as the far smaller company, has much more upside for its share price if it hits pay dirt. The field is littered with high-profile failures, one of the most recent being a previous Lilly compound. Lilly’s latest contender, solanezumab, is designed to bind to and mop up a protein called amyloid beta, the main component of amyloid plaque deposits in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Anticipation over the drug has built up slowly. Lilly is expected to release as soon as this summer final data from two 18-month studies of the treatment. Earlier this week, the company said an independent safety monitor had given researchers the green light to continue with the late-stage trials. That go-ahead suggested the drug so far has sidestepped the kinds of safety issues that doomed the earlier Lilly medicine called semagacestat in 2010. With no real treatment on the market, even the slightest sign of success could bring a windfall to Lilly, Wall Street analysts say. “If there are statistically significant positive results, showing a benefit of any kind with this drug, Lilly shares could go up as much as 50 percent or more,” said Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez. But if the trials fail, Lilly shares would likely fall no more than 10 percent, Fernandez said, noting that the share price already reflects investor skepticism of the drug’s ability to slow progression of the disease. “Lilly’s own internal outlook assigns an extremely low probability; they know it’s a very high risk, high reward” proposition, Fernandez said in a recent interview. Lilly shares have risen 13 percent in the past year, compared with an 8 percent rise for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers. Many investors hold the stock for its hefty dividend, which the company has pledged to preserve in coming years despite a host of challenges. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker badly needs big new drugs to offset plunging sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment, which in October began facing cheaper generics. Lilly also faces looming generic competition for its Cymbalta antidepressant. The group Alzheimer’s Disease International estimates there are now 36 million people with the disease worldwide and that the number will almost double to 66 million by 2030. So treating Alzheimer’s is considered the Holy Grail for the pharmaceutical industry, one of the few therapeutic areas where a new medicine could achieve the multibillion-dollar blockbuster scale achieved by the likes of Pfizer’s cholesterol fighter Lipitor. “Barring success for solanezumab, we continue to see Lilly as unable to meaningfully offset the loss of its core franchises to generic entry,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a research report. He gave the drug a “low likelihood” of success. Lilly halted late-stage trials of semagacestat after a monitoring board took an early peek at confidential trial data and determined the pill was actually worsening patients’ memories and their ability to perform daily tasks. Semagacestat worked by blocking production of an enzyme that makes amyloid beta rather than removing that protein from the bloodstream and the brain — as solanezumab is designed to do. Most researchers believe amyloid plaques cause the progressive disease which afflicts more than 5 million Americans, although the hypothesis has not yet been proven. Nearly a dozen drugs in the past decade have tried to stop buildup of the plaques or to remove them, but none have made real headway against the disease. “Nobody has ever come up with a disease-modifying compound,” said Eric Siemers, a Lilly neurologist who oversaw the failed semagacestat studies and is now in charge of the solanezumab trials. Current medicines for Alzheimer’s disease, including Pfizer’s Aricept and Namenda from Forest Laboratories, temporarily improve mental function. But they don’t appreciably slow progression of the disease, which is becoming ever more common due to the world’s aging population. Siemers said solanezumab would be deemed successful if it slows progression of Alzheimer’s by 35 percent in patients, all of whom began the studies with mild to moderate symptoms. “If you talk to physicians who treat these patients, they’ll say if you slow it down by roughly a third, that’s worthwhile,” Siemers said. Should the trials succeed, he said Lilly could seek approval for the medicine as soon as 2013. Dr. Sam Gandy, director of Mount Sinai School of Medicine’s Center for Cognitive Health, said brain scans and new imaging agents in the past few years have enabled doctors to detect plaque long before symptoms of Alzheimer’s develop. “The demand for new evaluations is already skyrocketing,” he said, due to the swelling number of patients with the disease and in part because of availability of the new tests. Increasingly, he is seeing patients in their 50’s. A drug that delays symptoms for just a few years would make a major difference, Gandy said. “That’s the sort of thing we want to see because Alzheimer’s disease really decimates the quality of life and the cost of care begins the moment they lose their ability to be independent,” Gandy said. “Every patient costs about $100,000 a year to care for, and the numbers add up quite quickly.” Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a Duke University professor of biological psychiatry and advisor to the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America, said success for solanezumab would be a landmark achievement. “I personally think the chances are almost zero,” he said, noting that so many previous drugs have failed because they tried to treat people who already showed symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Doraiswamy’s wariness also extends to a bapineuzumab, an injectable treatment from Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson undergoing late-stage trials due to conclude in coming months. The drug blocks production of an enzyme that makes amyloid beta protein. Patients receiving the Pfizer drug for 18 months in one small mid-stage study had an almost 25 percent lower accumulation of amyloid plaque than those receiving placebo injections, but achieved no cognitive benefits, he said. Moreover, he said patients receiving high doses of the drug in another Phase II study had worrisome brain swelling. If both the Lilly and the Pfizer drugs fail, but don’t show toxic side effects, Doraiswamy said there is a good chance they can be tested in future trials among patients not yet diagnosed with Alzheimer’s but deemed at risk of developing symptoms. That would make them candidates for preventing Alzheimer’s from taking root, the likely new frontier for drug testing. “We’re at a major crossroads,” Doraiswamy said.

73,LLY,UPDATE 1-Pfizer says its drug is best hope for Alzheimer's,"* Says prior trials suggest edge over Lilly Alzheimer’s drug * Says Prevnar 13 pneumonia data expected by 2013 * Expects FDA panel to review arthritis drug By Ransdell Pierson Feb 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc research chief Mikael Dolsten said the company’s experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease is the drug industry’s “best chance” to delay progression of the memory-robbing illness. Dolsten, speaking at the BIO CEO and investor conference in New York, stopped short of predicting whether the drug being developed with Johnson & Johnson would meet that goal. “This is so far the best chance the industry has for disease modification in Alzheimer’s,” he said. Dolsten said Pfizer’s drug, bapineuzumab, had far more complete and compelling data from already finished mid-stage clinical trials than Eli Lilly and Co’s solanezumab. Both companies plan to release Phase III data in the second half of this year from their respective large trials. The drugs are meant to be the first to slow progression of Alzheimer’s, a disease that affects an estimated 5 million Americans and more than 35 million people worldwide. “Bapineuzumab was the only one of these two that had significant Phase II data,” Dolsten said, referring to the relatively brief 12-week trials Lilly conducted on solanezumab before moving it into large late-stage studies. By contrast, Pfizer’s Phase II studies of bapineuzumab lasted 18 months, better enabling Pfizer to pick appropriate doses of the medicine in far larger ongoing Phase III studies. But mixed results were seen among patients receiving bapineuzumab in those smaller earlier studies. Patients in one mid-stage trial had an almost 25 percent lower accumulation in the brain of amyloid plaques — a suspected cause of Alzheimer’s disease — than those receiving placebo injections. But they achieved no cognitive benefits. And patients receiving high doses of the Pfizer drug in another mid-stage study had worrisome brain swelling. Asked in a recent interview if Lilly’s short Phase II studies might hurt its drug’s chance of succeeding in bigger Phase III trials, Dr. Eric Siemers, head of Lilly’s Alzheimer’s program, said, “The jury’s still out; we don’t  know if it was the right choice.” But Siemers told Reuters the shorter trials enabled Lilly to get solanezumab into late-stage trials far more quickly and at far less expense, hopefully without compromising future results. Many investors consider bapineuzumab and Lilly’s rival injectable drug long shots because they treat patients that already have developed mild to moderate symptoms, such as memory loss and inability to perform daily chores, and therefore may have suffered irreversible damage to neurons and brain tissue. Dolsten cautioned that Alzheimer’s patients would probably need to be treated at earlier stages of the disease to produce the most beneficial results, a prospect he sees likely within the next five years. Pfizer is counting on newer drugs to deliver revenue needed to offset plunging sales of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter, which has faced cheaper generics since November. They include Prevnar 13, an improved form of its Prevnar vaccine to prevent infections with streptococcus bacteria. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December approved its use for adults aged 50 and older, greatly widening the market for the product, which had been approved only in children. Dolsten said Pfizer expects data by next year from late-stage trials testing whether Prevnar 13 prevents pneumonia in adults. The $3.3 billion-a-year vaccine could get a big commercial boost if the trials succeed, especially in preventing  pneumonia among the elderly, he said. The world’s biggest drugmaker also has high hopes for tofacitinib, an experimental pill that treats rheumatoid arthritis through a new approach and is awaiting U.S. approval. The FDA is slated to decide on tofacitinib by August, but Dolsten said an FDA advisory panel of outside experts is likely to weigh the drug’s safety and effectiveness beforehand. “We expect a dialogue about how this drug will be used,” Dolsten said, given its new mechanism of action. It is the first in an emerging class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors that block a protein associated with inflammation. The research chief also expressed confidence Pfizer will eventually develop an anti-smoking vaccine and important new treatments for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Last year, Pfizer said it would slash its annual research budget by as much as $2 billion in order to deliver on earnings goals. Dolsten on Tuesday said Pfizer wants to remain a research leader but will likely increasingly team up with other drugmakers, and rely more heavily on contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct its large late-stage trials. Increasing numbers of those trials will be conducted in distant emerging markets. But Dolsten said safeguards will ensure that outside contractors do not cut corners, and thereby sacrifice quality controls in order to deliver speedy results.",2142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/pfizer-alzheimers/update-1-pfizer-says-its-drug-is-best-hope-for-alzheimers-idUSL2E8DECOP20120214
74,LLY,U.S. gives nod to Eli Lilly's brain plaque test,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators gave the nod to an imaging test from Eli Lilly and Co. that can for the first time help doctors detect brain plaque tied to Alzheimer’s disease, the company said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the radioactive dye, called Amyvid, to help doctors rule out whether patients have Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, Lilly announced late on Friday. The dye binds to clumps of a toxic protein called beta amyloid that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s. Doctors can then see the plaque light up on a positron emission tomography, or PET, scan. Patients with Alzheimer’s always have some brain plaque, so its absence in the test would tell doctors to look for other causes of mental decline, such as depression or medications, Lilly has said. But Lilly, which plans to sell the drug through its unit Avid Radiopharmaceuticals Inc, said the test should not be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s, since brain plaque can also be tied to other neurologic conditions and may occur naturally in older people with normal mental states. An FDA advisory panel recommended against approving the dye last year, saying doctors might have trouble interpreting scans of the plaque, and the FDA rejected Amyvid last March. Since then, Eli Lilly said it has worked to identify better ways of training doctors to use the test. Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, CEO of Avid, said one in five patients who are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s turn out not to have the disease after an autopsy. “The approval of Amyvid offers physicians a tool that, in conjunction with other diagnostic evaluations, can provide information to help physicians evaluate their patients,” he said in the company’s statement from Friday. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s, a mind-robbing disease that affects more than 35 million people worldwide and gets worse with age. But an early hint that something is wrong might improve the success of drugs meant to prevent or delay disease progression, researchers believe. Avid has been in the lead in the race for imaging agents for Alzheimer’s, which are estimated to have a potential global market anywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion. General Electric Co and Bayer AG are developing rival products. Lilly, as well as Pfizer Inc, are the farthest along in developing experimental medicines to treat Alzheimer’s.

77,LLY,Lilly profit beats forecast; focus on new drug data,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug took a milder drubbing from generics than Wall Street feared, and other products, including its Cymbalta anti-depressant, showed double-digit sales growth. The company’s shares rose nearly 1 percent on the first-quarter results, which also benefited from surging demand in China, as well as cost controls. Analysts said Lilly would face a greater test of its ability to revive sales in the coming months, as data becomes available on its experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and other medicines in late-stage trials. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker earned $1.01 billion, or 91 cents per share, compared with $1.06 billion, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took a number of restructuring and research-related charges. Excluding special items, Lilly earned 92 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 78 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Data on Lilly’s solanezumab for Alzheimer’s is expected later this year. Although it is considered a long shot, investors say solanezumab would have huge sales potential if it even slows the progress of the memory-robbing disease, speeding Lilly’s return to profit growth and giving a quick boost to its share price. On a conference call with industry analysts, Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said investors should not put all their hopes into that one drug, but consider the entire slate of one dozen products in Phase III studies. “We’ve said all along that solanezumab is not the home run bet for Lilly,” Rice said. Rice said solanezumab represented “the upside” for Lilly, on top of potential for its other late-stage medicines, including for lupus, diabetes, depression, cancer and schizophrenia. Revenue fell 4 percent to $5.6 billion in the quarter, above Wall Street expectations of $5.36 billion. Sales of Zyprexa, which lost U.S. patent protection in October, tumbled 56 percent to $563 million. But sales came in $63 million higher than expected, Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. Sales of animal health brands jumped 33 percent to $491 million, helped by the recent acquisition of new products in Europe, and topped the analyst’s forecast by $81 million. Cymbalta sales jumped 23 percent to $1.11 billion. Although that helped offset declines for Zyprexa in the quarter, the depression drug’s own U.S. patent will lapse in mid-2013. Its sales will then shrink dramatically, worsening Lilly’s long-feared patent cliff. Lilly has vowed it will not pursue a large-scale acquisition to prop up earnings during its three-year patent cliff, but will instead cut costs and rely on its drug pipeline to eventually restore profit growth. In the meantime, it has sought to mollify investors with pledges to preserve its hefty dividend. “Lilly has the highest dividend among U.S. drugmakers, with a yield of 4.9 percent, so that will prop up Lilly if the stock market sees a shift to lower-risk assets,” said MKM Partners analyst Jon LeCroy. In the meantime, he said Lilly would have a tough time replacing lost sales of Zyprexa, Cymbalta and osteoporosis drug Evista as the patent expirations pile up. “It’s entering a trough period, before its pipeline kicks in.” Sales of lung cancer drug Alimta rose 5 percent to $607 million. Its Humalog insulin rose 12 percent to $590 million, while its Humulin insulin brand grew 6 percent to $308 million.

78,LLY,UPDATE 2-Lilly profit beats forecast; focus on new drug data,"* Q1 EPS, excluding items, $0.92/shr vs. $0.78 forecast * Q1 sales top forecast by $240 mln, drive earnings beat * Raises full-year 2012 profit view * Data on new drug for Alzheimer’s in view * Shares rise nearly 1 pct By Ransdell Pierson April 25 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug took a milder drubbing from generics than Wall Street feared, and other products, including its Cymbalta anti-depressant, showed double-digit sales growth. The company’s shares rose nearly 1 percent on the first-quarter results, which also benefited from surging demand in China, as well as cost controls. Analysts said Lilly would face a greater test of its ability to revive sales in the coming months, as data becomes available on its experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and other medicines in late-stage trials. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker earned $1.01 billion, or 91 cents per share, compared with $1.06 billion, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took a number of restructuring and research-related charges. Excluding special items, Lilly earned 92 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 78 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Data on Lilly’s solanezumab for Alzheimer’s is expected later this year. Although it is considered a long shot, investors say solanezumab would have huge sales potential if it even slows the progress of the memory-robbing disease, speeding Lilly’s return to profit growth and giving a quick boost to its share price. On a conference call with industry analysts, Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said investors should not put all their hopes into that one drug, but consider the entire slate of one dozen products in Phase III studies. “We’ve said all along that solanezumab is not the home run bet for Lilly,” Rice said. Rice said solanezumab represented “the upside” for Lilly, on top of potential for its other late-stage medicines, including for lupus, diabetes, depression, cancer and schizophrenia. Revenue fell 4 percent to $5.6 billion in the quarter, above Wall Street expectations of $5.36 billion. Sales of Zyprexa, which lost U.S. patent protection in October, tumbled 56 percent to $563 million. But sales came in $63 million higher than expected, Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. Sales of animal health brands jumped 33 percent to $491 million, helped by the recent acquisition of new products in Europe, and topped the analyst’s forecast by $81 million. Cymbalta sales jumped 23 percent to $1.11 billion. Although that helped offset declines for Zyprexa in the quarter, the depression drug’s own U.S. patent will lapse in mid-2013. Its sales will then shrink dramatically, worsening Lilly’s long-feared patent cliff. Lilly has vowed it will not pursue a large-scale acquisition to prop up earnings during its three-year patent cliff, but will instead cut costs and rely on its drug pipeline to eventually restore profit growth. In the meantime, it has sought to mollify investors with pledges to preserve its hefty dividend. “Lilly has the highest dividend among U.S. drugmakers, with a yield of 4.9 percent, so that will prop up Lilly if the stock market sees a shift to lower-risk assets,” said MKM Partners analyst Jon LeCroy. In the meantime, he said Lilly would have a tough time replacing lost sales of Zyprexa, Cymbalta and osteoporosis drug Evista as the patent expirations pile up. “It’s entering a trough period, before its pipeline kicks in.” Sales of lung cancer drug Alimta rose 5 percent to $607 million. Its Humalog insulin rose 12 percent to $590 million, while its Humulin insulin brand grew 6 percent to $308 million. The company raised its 2012 profit forecast to between $3.15 and $3.30 per share, excluding special items.

80,LLY,"TEXT-Fitch:Pure pharmaceuticals players,such as AstraZeneca,most under pressure","Apr 30 - Fitch Ratings says pharmaceuticals companies which 	 focus on pure pharmaceuticals, such as AstraZeneca (‘AA-‘/Stable), Bristol Myers 	 Squibb Company (BMS; ‘A+’/Negative) and Eli Lilly & Co.’s (‘A’/Stable) are 	 likely to show the highest pressure on sales and EBITDA over the next three 	 years compared to more diversified pharmaceuticals players, such as Johnson & 	 Johnson (‘AAA’/Stable) or Bayer (‘A-‘/Stable). “With the challenging economic environment and government cost-containment 	 expected to continue, the pressure for pure pharmaceuticals is expected to 	 remain high,” says Britta Holt, a Director at Fitch Ratings in London. “As the 	 key factor to success for pure pharmaceuticals players is the R&D; product 	 pipeline, cash rich companies with a relatively weak R&D; pipeline, such as 	 AstraZeneca might be tempted to acquire,” adds Holt. Fitch expects the ongoing period of drug patent expiration to significantly 	 erode revenues and earnings from the rated pharmaceuticals companies over the 	 next three years, with the pure pharmaceuticals players Eli Lilly, BMS and 	 AstraZeneca belonging to those most affected by patent expiration. The agency 	 calculates that Eli Lilly and BMS stand to lose more than a third of their sales 	 and AstraZeneca more than 20% of their sales in the US sales due to US patent 	 expiration over the next three years. Sales of US prescription drugs and consumer-confidence-sensitive sales of 	 branded over-the-counter (OTC) products are expected by Fitch to suffer from 	 lower demand in 2012. Pressure on drug manufacturers’ profitability is also 	 expected in the US as the drug coverage gap - known as the “donut hole” - will 	 continue to be closed by 50% in 2012 (implying a continued 50% discount on 	 brand-name drugs in the coverage gap) while the industry’s annual fee (leading 	 to payments for individual manufacturers allocated according to individual US 	 market shares) of USD2.5bn, which had to be paid for the first time by the 	 industry in 2011, will be increased to USD2.8bn in 2012. The negative impact on sales and profit from cost-containment policies in 	 Europe, such as reference pricing, and restrictions on prescriptions and 	 reimbursement in major European markets, is likely to continue in 2012. As government authorities, particularly in Europe and the US, are increasingly 	 looking to reduce drug costs and are not willing to reimburse drugs with 	 uncertain clinical evidence at launch, pharmaceuticals companies are likely to 	 continue responding by offering conditional pricing deals. These deals take 	 place between pharmaceuticals companies and payors, such as those executed 	 between Pfizer Inc. (‘A+’/Stable) and US drug-benefit plans with regard to 	 Lipitor. To encourage continued use of branded Lipitor and to maintain its 	 market share to some degree after its genericization, Pfizer offered rebate 	 deals to drug-benefit plans and provides discounts to patients. In general, 	 arrangements like this can reduce costs and risks for the health payor and have 	 the advantage for the drug manufacturer that it is able to sell its medicines - 	 albeit with lower profitability compared to a traditional reimbursement 	 situation. In 2012, four of the 10 best-selling US medicines (ranking based on IMS Health 	 data) are likely to lose market exclusivity. Already in Q112, Pfizer’s 	 cholesterol-lowering treatment Lipitor (the best-selling medicine in the world 	 in 2010) in November 2011 and Eli Lilly & Co.’s Zyprexa have lost patent 	 protection in the US. During 2012, major patent losses are  BMS’  and Sanofi 	 SA’s (‘AA-‘/Negative) anti-platelet drug Plavix (number three in terms of 2010 	 US sales) in May; AstraZeneca’s Seroquel IR (number six in terms of 2010 US 	 sales) in March; Merck & Co’s (A+/Stable) Singulair (number seven) in August; 	 and Takeda’s (not rated) and Eli Lilly & Co.’s diabetes treatment Actos (number 	 nine in terms of 2010 US sales) in August.

81,LLY,Crackdown on drug thieves has trails to Florida,"(Reuters) - Prosecutors in a number of states have charged dozens of suspects with stealing prescription drugs from warehouses and tractor trailers across the country, including two brothers accused of grabbing more than $70 million of prescription drugs two years ago from an Eli Lilly & Co warehouse in Connecticut. The national crackdown on heists of prescription drugs involved coordinated arrests and indictments in Connecticut, New Jersey and Florida. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Haven, Connecticut said brothers Amaury Villa and Amed Villa, were arrested in Florida on Thursday in connection with the Eli Lilly burglary in the town of Enfield, Connecticut - calling it the biggest known theft in the state’s history. It said the pair were citizens of Cuba, living in Miami. The brothers were accused of cutting a hole in the roof of the warehouse on March 13, 2010, and partly disabling the building’s security alarm on a night when violent rain and winds lashed the Eastern seaboard. Over the next five hours, they allegedly used a forklift inside the building to load pallets of Lilly’s Zyprexa schizophrenia drug, Prozac anti-depressant and Gemzar cancer treatment into a tractor trailer truck. Prosecutors said Amed Villa left behind valuable evidence - his fingerprints - on a water bottle found in the warehouse after the burglary. Simultaneously, U.S. prosecutors in Miami charged Amaury Villa and two other Miami residents - Roberto Garcia-Amador and Suhong Wu - with conspiring to sell drugs stolen from the Lilly warehouse. Another eight suspects were charged in Miami with other thefts, including of various prescription drugs from warehouses and tractor trailers at truck stops in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Tennessee, as well as diabetes and epilepsy drugs from a warehouse in Virginia owned by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. “These defendants moved truckloads and pallets of stolen pharmaceuticals from other states to South Florida for storage and ultimate sale,” Miami U.S. Attorney Wilfredo Ferrer said in a release. “Along the way, they transported and handled these medications without any regard whatsoever for their proper storage and care, and - worst yet - with a callous disregard for the safety and health of the ultimate consumer.” Ferrer said the investigation was conducted by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, a partnership between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. In New Jersey, federal prosecutors charged 12 defendants with stealing and selling millions of dollars in prescription drugs, over the counter medicines, and other products. Ten were arrested in Florida, and one in Nebraska, while another is being sought. Six of the defendants were charged in connection with pharmaceuticals stolen in March 2009 from a product distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi, owned by German drugmaker Bayer AG.

83,LLY,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-U.S. to partner with Big Pharma for drug discovery,"* Eli Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca offer 24 compounds * Idea is to repurpose failed drugs for new uses * NIH providing $20 million in research grants * Successful projects eligible for royalties By Julie Steenhuysen and Anna Yukhananov CHICAGO/WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. government will help drug companies find treatments for a host of diseases through a new collaboration in which researchers will test experimental drugs provided by manufacturers. The National Institutes of Health said on Thursday that Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Eli Lilly and Co  have agreed to make 24 compounds available for a pilot phase of the project, the biggest of its kind ever launched in the United States. All of the compounds have been tried in people and found to be safe, but the drugmakers have abandoned them because they did not work for the disease they were intended to treat. The NIH will provide $20 million in grants each year to researchers trying to find new uses for the compounds. “The goal is simple: to see whether we can teach an old drug new tricks,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius during a press conference. Big advances in genetics have allowed researchers to identify causes of more than 4,500 diseases. But turning those discoveries into treatments has been difficult, and there are drugs to treat only about 250 of these conditions. NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said “diseases of the brain” represent an especially urgent unmet need. “We need to speed the pace at which we are turning discoveries into better health outcomes,” Collins said. “NIH looks forward to working with our partners in industry and academia to tackle an urgent need that is beyond the scope of any one organization or sector.” It generally takes a drugmaker $2 billion and 14 years to turn an initial idea into an effective medicine sold to patients, including the cost of testing medicines that ultimately don’t lead to results. Drugmakers may have scores of initially promising compounds that have already cost tens of millions of dollars sitting in warehouses or freezers with no apparent purpose. Collins said there are dozens of examples of drugs originally meant for one disease being repurposed for another. In a high-profile case, azidothymidine, or AZT, was approved to treat cancer in the 1960s but shelved for lack of efficacy. More than two decades later, it became the first effective treatment for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But in the past, such discoveries have occurred by chance. “The idea here is not to depend on serendipity,” Collins said, by opening up the failed drugs to researchers all over the country. Researchers who discover a new use for a drug will be eligible for royalty payments if the drug reaches the market, though the companies will still hold the rights to the drug compound. Pfizer has already attempted the program on a smaller scale with a collaboration with Washington University in St. Louis, while AstraZeneca launched a similar project with the British version of the NIH, the Medical Research Council. The British project includes more than 20 drugs originally targeted at everything from tumors to Alzheimer’s to diabetes and obesity. AstraZeneca said the project also includes studying drugs already on the market, not just those abandoned during testing. The NIH said it would release the names of the 24 compounds in the pilot project next month.",5032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/drugs-research/corrected-update-1-u-s-to-partner-with-big-pharma-for-drug-discovery-idUSL1E8G3DKC20120503

The Dodgers were boosted by the presence of new co-owner Magic Johnson, who addressed the home crowd before the first pitch. “I definitely thought the stadium had quite a lot of energy,” Lilly said. “We definitely felt it.” A red-hot Matt Kemp went 3-for-3 at the plate and improved his batting average to .406 a day after he was held out of the starting lineup with a hamstring injury. Andre Ethier and Juan Rivera each had two RBIs to help lead the Los Angeles assault The win put Los Angeles (19-10) top of the National League, while San Francisco sank to 14-15.

86,LLY,Eli Lilly's diabetes drug meets mid-stage trial goal,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co’s experimental drug to treat type 2 diabetes met the main goal of a mid-stage trial to test its effect on blood pressure and heart rate. The results of the study showed that the effect of Lilly’s drug, dulaglutide, on systolic blood pressure was comparable to that of a placebo. Makers of type 2 diabetes pills are required by the U.S. health regulator to prove that the drugs do not increase the risk of heart attacks or other heart problems. Dulaglutide, which is being tested as a once-weekly treatment for type 2 diabetes, was also able to significantly reduce HbA1c, or average blood glucose levels over a three-month period, compared with a placebo at the end of 16 and 26 weeks. The most common adverse events in the non-inferiority study were gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, the company said. Lilly added that a dosage of 1.5 mg dulaglutide showed statistically significant reductions in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure compared with a placebo during superiority testing. The study included 755 type 2 diabetes patients on one or more oral diabetes medication. About 67 percent of the patients had a pre-existing diagnosis of hypertension.

89,LLY,"Sanofi, Novo, Lilly shape up for big insulin fight","LONDON (Reuters) - Competition is ramping up in the multibillion-dollar market for long-lasting insulins, with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly lining up new products that could trump Sanofi’s top-seller Lantus. Worldwide, Lantus has some 80 percent of the market for long-acting, or basal, insulins used to treat diabetes and the product had sales of around $5 billion last year. Now rivals are closing in. Denmark’s Novo has a new insulin called Tresiba, or degludec, that is awaiting a U.S. approval decision by July 29 and could also get a green light in Europe in the second half of the year. And Lilly’s new long-acting insulin LY2605541, though still some years from reaching the market, is already causing a stir after signs in mid-stage Phase II clinical tests it may help patients lose weight. If confirmed in later trials, that could give it a unique selling point against other therapies for controlling type 2 diabetes, a disease that is closely linked with obesity. “Even modest - but real - weight loss could be a major commercial advantage over other basal insulins,” Mark Schoenebaum, an industry analyst at ISI Group, said. At the same time, Lantus faces indirect competition from so-called GLP-1 drugs like Byetta and Bydureon from Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Victoza from Novo and several others still at the development stage. More details on the changing landscape for diabetes treatments will emerge when scientists and doctors discuss progress at the American Diabetes Association annual meeting from June 8 to 12. Tim Anderson of Bernstein believes Lantus revenues, which grew 20 percent a year over 2007-11, will slow to an annual rate of 6.5 percent from 2012-16 - and from 2015 onwards sales of the drug are likely to go into decline, assuming generic “biosimilars” arrive around then. Consensus forecasts also predict annual Lantus sales continuing to rise to just under $7 billion by 2015 before declining thereafter, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma data. Sanofi is working to defend its business by developing an improved, longer-lasting formulation of Lantus and a Lantus plus GLP-1 combination product. But Novo Chief Executive Lars Sorensen believes his firm can turn the tables on Sanofi, although he is prepared for a lengthy battle. He told Reuters last year it would probably take until 2014 or 2015 before Tresiba was in a position to capture the bulk of new patients going on to basal insulins. Ending Sanofi’s 10-year dominance would be a major coup for Novo, whose existing long-acting insulin Levemir has failed to seriously dent the French drugmaker’s grip on the market. Tresiba, however, may have little time in a duopoly with Sanofi’s Lantus before Lilly enters the ring with LY2605541, according to Tim Race of Deutsche Bank. Phase III clinical data for the Lilly drug is expected in 2013, suggesting it will be snapping at Tresiba’s heels. International drugmakers are competing fiercely in the type 2 diabetes market as the number of people with the disease worldwide continues to grow rapidly. Diabetics typically start out on oral medicine but often need to move on to insulin injections to regulate their blood-sugar levels. One side-effect of taking insulin can be hypoglycemia, when sugar levels become dangerously low. A key selling-point for the new products from Novo and Lilly is that they cause fewer such “hypos”.

90,LLY,Lilly insulin shows advantage over Lantus - study,"* Better blood sugar control seen in type 1 diabetes study * Lilly drug, Lantus comparable in type 2 diabetes * Small weight loss seen with Lilly drug, gain with Lantus By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson June 11 (Reuters) - An experimental long-acting insulin being developed by Eli Lilly and Co demonstrated greater blood sugar control than Sanofi SA’s top selling Lantus in type 1 diabetes and was comparable in type 2 diabetes, with the added advantage of weight loss, according to data from midstage studies. Lilly, which is developing the long-acting, or basal, insulin and other diabetes medicines with Boehringer Ingelheim, is hoping to make inroads into Sanofi’s domination with the new drug currently known as LY2605541. Lantus, known chemically as insulin glargine, owns about 80 percent of the basal insulin market and had sales of about $5 billion last year. “Certainly the pieces are in place in our insulin portfolio for us to regain a leadership position,” Eli Lilly Chief Executive John Lechleiter told Reuters. “We believe our novel basal insulin has potential to offer advantages that will place it in a very competitive position in that category.” Dr. Richard Bergenstal, who led the type 2 study and participated in the type 1 trial, said in a telephone interview that Lantus is an excellent long acting insulin that “has set a pretty high bar for any new insulin to show that it’s an improvement.” Based on the Phase II data presented on Monday at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) meeting in Philadelphia, Bergenstal said the Lilly and Boehringer drug could raise the bar. “This drug seems to show that promise so deserves a larger look in Phase III trials,” he said. In the study of 137 patients with type 1 diabetes, the Lilly drug led to significantly better blood sugar control after eight weeks versus Lantus, with a mean difference of -10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) based on daily readings. There was also a greater reduction in the longer term blood glucose measure known as A1C with the Lilly drug. The unexpected finding of the study, in which patients took the Lilly drug or Lantus for eight weeks and then switched to the other drug for another eight weeks, was the weight loss associated with LY2605541. The study drug led to a mean weight loss of 2.65 pounds (1.2 kilograms), while those taking Lantus on average gained 1.52 lbs (0.7 kg). There was also weight loss seen with the Lilly drug in the 12-week type 2 diabetes trial - 1.28 lbs (0.58 kg) versus a gain of 0.68 lbs (0.31 kg) for Lantus. The weight loss, while small, could become a major selling point as obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes. “Usually when you start insulin you gain weight. We learn to tolerate it, but we don’t like it,” explained Bergenstal. “In this case they got better blood sugars and they lost weight, so that is sort of unique.” Patients who received LY2605541 required less mealtime insulin, with a statistically significant 24 percent reduction in their mealtime insulin dose compared with Lantus. The Lilly drug was associated with significantly higher rates of overall hypoglycemia, or a potentially dangerous drop in blood sugar. But it had a significantly lower rate of overnight, or nocturnal, hypoglycemia. Nocturnal hypoglycemia is particularly worrisome as the patient is asleep and not able to recognize or address the problem. Bergenstal was also impressed with the lack of peaks and valleys with Lilly’s insulin, which showed less within day variability than the market leader. “The hope would be no hypoglycemia overnight and less variability and fluctuation in the blood sugar and indeed that’s what happened,” Bergenstal said. The Lilly drug led to elevations in liver enzymes compared with Lantus in both studies. Levels remained within normal range, but was still significantly higher than with Lantus, researchers found. Elevated liver enzymes often raise a red flag with health regulators worried about liver damage. “That needs to be followed in Phase III to see if that was a fluke or a concern,” Bergenstal said. There was a small but negative impact on blood fats with the Lilly drug in the type 1 study, with a modest increase in triglycerides and decrease in good HDL cholesterol observed. In the larger type 2 diabetes study with 288 patients, the daily glycemic control was similar for the two drugs, as was the A1C reduction over 12 weeks. Overall rates of hypoglycemia were similar for the two medicines in type 2 diabetics, but the Lilly drug had a 48 percent reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia, the data showed. There was a statistically significant increase in gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, indigestion and abdominal bloating, associated with the Lilly drug in the type 1 study that was not seen with type 2 patients. More than 360 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Foundation, with the overwhelming majority suffering from type 2 diabetes. Diabetes can lead to major health problems, including kidney disease, increased risk of blindness and nerve damage and circulatory problems that can lead to amputations of extremities.",6112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/diabetes-lilly-basal/lilly-insulin-shows-advantage-over-lantus-study-idUSL1E8HB8U820120611
91,LLY,"Survey shows dim faith in Lilly, Pfizer Alzheimer's drugs","(Reuters) - Institutional investors doubt that treatments for Alzheimer’s disease being developed by Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly will achieve the main goals of their ongoing late-stage trials, but hopes are running far higher for the Pfizer drug, according to a survey by ISI Group Inc. Results from the survey of 146 investors were released late on Tuesday by Mark Schoenebaum, a pharmaceutical analyst for the investment research services group. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting results of the trials and expects huge potential sales if either of the medicines proves able to arrest the progression of the memory-robbing disease. Pfizer and Lilly are expected in the third quarter to disclose the main findings from large studies of their respective medicines, bapineuzumab and solanezumab. Complete data are expected to be presented at medical meetings in the fourth quarter. The survey responders, on average, gave solanezumab only a 14 percent chance of meeting all the primary goals of its two Phase III studies, compared with an average 21 percent probability for the two big trials of bapineuzumab, Schoenebaum said. Likewise, responders cite an average 15 percent probability of the Lilly’s drug winning approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sometime in the next two years, compared with 29 percent odds for bapineuzumab. Lilly only tested solanezumab in 12-week mid-stage trials before moving it into large Phase III studies. By contrast, Pfizer’s mid-stage trials of bapineuzumab lasted 18 months, better enabling Pfizer to pick appropriate doses of its medicine for the far larger Phase III studies. That potential advantage for the Pfizer drug might account for some of the greater confidence in bapineuzumab. Lilly desperately needs revenue from big-selling new drugs to offset plunging sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia medicine, now facing cheaper generics and the approaching collapse of other top Lilly drugs that will confront generics. Solanezumab would be just the ticket and some analysts have forecast that Lilly shares could jump 50 percent, or even double, if the injectable drug proves safe and effective in the trials and is approved. Pfizer, which is rebounding from years of anemic sales and earnings thanks to cost controls and new medicines, could also be transformed if its Alzheimer’s drug goes the distance. Should solanezumab fail to show any signs of effectiveness, however, Lilly shares would likely drop to about $37.40, according to the average estimate in Schoenebaum’s survey. That would represent a decline of almost 12 percent from Lilly’s closing share price on Tuesday of $42.29. Pfizer shares, in the event its drug completely fails, would likely fall to about $21.30, responders said, representing about a 6 percent decline from their current price.

93,LLY,Lilly resumes share buybacks after long absence,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co, which faces revenue pressure from patent expirations of top products, said it was resuming its program to buy back its stock. The Indianapolis-based company had not bought back its shares since 2006, choosing to use its cash for other purposes. Lilly’s board authorized the company to resume a share repurchase program that had begun in 2000, under which it had spent $2.58 billion of a total authorization of $3 billion.

It also faces the loss of exclusivity of antidepressant Cymbalta next year.

96,LLY,"Lilly beats Wall St profit view, ups forecast","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s (LLY.N) quarterly earnings beat Wall Street forecasts, and the company said on Wednesday that profit margins should improve after 2014, once the worst pain from patent expirations on its top drugs has abated. The company, whose shares rose 2.2 percent to $42.91 in premarket trading, raised its 2012 profit outlook because the stronger U.S. dollar has reduced the cost of overseas goods. Other drugmakers, by contrast, have suffered badly because of the stronger greenback — rival Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), cut its full-year profit forecast last week due to the drag on overseas sales. Lilly’s results, as expected, were battered by the recent patent expirations on its biggest product, schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa. The pain intensifies late next year, when $5-billion-a-year depression drug Cymbalta goes generic. Lilly said it still expected to return to revenue and income growth after 2014, largely due to the launch of new medicines. “This growth, combined with our continued focus on expense management should lead to expanding (profit) margins,” the company said in a release. Industry analysts welcomed the promise of improved profit margins but said it was too early to know whether cost-cutting might be a bigger contributor than the introduction of new prescription drugs. “The key controversy remaining is: Can they really improve margins if the pipeline fails to deliver?” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. “So what if the revenue doesn’t grow?” Lilly’s most important experimental drug is solanezumab, an Alzheimer’s disease treatment that has completed two late-stage trials. The company, which is expected by next month to unveil data from the highly anticipated studies, did not provide any updates on the medicine or discuss a similar treatment being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). The Indianapolis drugmaker on Wednesday said it earned $924 million, or 83 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned 83 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The (earnings) beat was due to stronger underlying demand of key products such as Cymbalta, as well as the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on our cost of goods sold,” said Lilly spokesman Mark Taylor. Global sales of $5.6 billion were in line with Wall Street expectations of $5.59 billion. The company said it would continue with cost-cutting programs as it grapples with generic competition for Zyprexa and other medicines. Lilly said it now expected full-year 2012 earnings of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, excluding special items. It had previously forecast $3.15 to $3.30. Even so, the improved forecast would still represent a 23 percent decline from 2011 results and a 28 percent drop from 2010 profit — due to the fallout from Zyprexa generics. Quarterly global sales of Zyprexa, the company’s biggest product until it lost U.S. patent protection in October, fell 73 percent to $380 million as cheaper generics flooded the market. Sales of Cymbalta, now Lilly’s top product, jumped 22 percent to $1.22 billion.

98,LLY,Eli Lilly's solanezumab may fail pivotal studies: Jefferies,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s experimental drug solanezumab, which seeks to treat Alzheimer’s disease, may fail its pivotal studies, Jefferies & Co said, downgrading the stock to “underperform” from “hold.” Eli Lilly is expected to unveil by next month data from the highly anticipated studies on solanezumab, which has completed two late-stage trials. “We expect that solanezumab will outright fail its pivotal studies in Alzheimer’s disease ... with only a 25 percent chance of being effective in a niche population,” Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said. Alzheimer’s affects some 5 million Americans and as many as 35 million people worldwide. On Wednesday, Eli Lilly raised its 2012 profit outlook, and said profit margins should improve after 2014, once the worst pain from patent expirations on its top drugs has abated. Holford said it suspects Eli Lilly’s post-2014 forecasts was a “pre-emptive strike ahead of the pivotal read-out for solanezumab in Alzheimer’s to support consensus estimates in case it fails.” Holford — a four-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on companies in his coverage universe, according to Thomson Reuters’ Starmine — lowered his price target on Eli Lilly to $35 from $37. According to StarMine, two analysts rate the stock “strong buy,” 15 rate it a “hold,” and three rate it a “sell,” with a mean price target of $39.83.

99,LLY,"Lilly drug slows Alzheimer's in some, fails main goals","NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug showed signs of slowing mental decline in patients with a mild form of the disease, even though it failed to meet the main goals of two large clinical trials, suggesting the treatment could be salvaged. Shares of the company rose as much as 6 percent on Friday as investors bet the treatment, solanezumab, may help patients in the early stages of the disease, which has so far stumped the research efforts of the world’s largest drugmakers. Lilly did not give detailed data on its findings, but its executives said they were the first glimmer of hope in a large clinical trial that removing the toxic protein beta amyloid from the brains of Alzheimer’s patients might alter the course of the disease. Scientists were far more cautious and said it was impossible to gauge what the findings mean until full results are released at a neurology meeting on October 8 in Boston. The late-stage trials, known as EXPEDITION 1 and 2, tested solanezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, compared with a placebo. Both of these studies failed to meet their primary goals. However, a secondary analysis of the results looking at the two-thirds of patients with mild Alzheimer’s from both studies showed a statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline, the company said. “We recognize that the solanezumab studies did not meet their primary endpoints, but we are encouraged by the pooled data that appear to show a slowing of cognitive decline,” said Lilly Chief Executive John Lechleiter. “We intend to discuss these data with regulatory authorities to gain their insights on potential next steps.” Dr Samuel Gandy, of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in New York, said the fact that Lilly had to combine findings from both studies suggests any positive signal is fairly weak. “That sounds really pretty borderline,” Gandy said in an interview. “It’s hard for me to characterize without seeing how they came up with this.” Dr Ronald Petersen of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and chair of the federal Advisory Council on Alzheimer’s Research, Care and Services, called it a soft finding. “It’s a bit subtle, but it seems to be real and it may in fact mean that the drug is doing what it’s supposed to do,” he said in a statement. Alzheimer’s experts already see reason to test the theory that a treatment may need to be delivered even before patients show signs of dementia, when the disease may have already caused irreversible brain damage. Lilly’s Dr Eric Siemers, who directs the company’s Alzheimer’s research program, took a different view. “For us to see what appears to be a signal in this pooled data in mild patients, we are quite pleased,” he said. “That would suggest you don’t have to move much earlier in the pathology of the disease.” Lilly shares were up 3 percent at $43.69 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier high at $45.00. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. An estimated 5 million Americans are believed to have the disease, and a successful treatment could be worth billions of dollars. The Alzheimer’s Association called the Lilly results encouraging and said that if data showing a patient response to targeting beta amyloid levels could be replicated, it would be “a major step forward” in fighting the disease. Wall Street analysts had expected the Lilly drug to fail in its main goals, particularly after a similar treatment from Pfizer Inc and Johnson & Johnson called bapineuzumab did not help either mild or moderate Alzheimer’s patients in study results reported earlier this month. An earlier-stage trial of immune system therapy Gammagard, from Baxter International Inc, has also raised hopes by showing a handful of patients saw their Alzheimer’s stabilize while on the drug. But some were encouraged by Lilly’s findings, which left the door open for the drug to be considered by health regulators. “Basically the odds of approval just went up from like 10 percent to maybe 20 to 30 percent,” said Dr Mark Schoenebaum, analyst with ISI Group, noting that patients with a mild form of the disease comprise at least half of the diagnosed population. “(That’s) still high risk, but much better than expected.” “Theoretically all possibilities are still on the table,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson wrote in a research note. “This includes the possibility that solanezumab could be filed for regulatory approval, given the large unmet medical need in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and the generally acceptable safety profile.” “Our best guess is that more studies would have to be done before FDA or other regulatory agencies would consider approving solanezumab,” he said. Lilly executives declined to say whether they would need to conduct any more trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had yet to review the Lilly results, but looked forward to discussing next steps with the company. The company’s trials tested solanezumab in more than 2,050 patients in 16 countries, over an 18-month period. Side effects included lethargy, rash, malaise and angina, compared to the placebo.

By  the quarter ended June 30 2012, more than 95% of the U.S. market was taken by  generics. Also, anti-depressant Cymbalta will lose patent protection in 2014,  leading to a further low double-digit revenue decline. These estimates give no  credit to the products in phase III testing. — Despite this revenue contraction, we expect Lilly to maintain or  slightly increase R&D; spending over the next two years; EBITDA margins  therefore should decline to about 28% during that time, a level that still  exceeds the majority of industrial issuers. EBITDA at the trough should still  be in excess of $5 billion. — These still-strong margins, limited internal capital needs, and a  dividend that we expect to be relatively stable should lead to discretionary  cash flow remaining just over $2 billion for the next two years, providing  substantial capacity to pursue moderate-sized acquisitions while maintaining  debt to EBITDA well under 1.5x, the limit for a minimal financial risk profile. The strong business risk profile reflects the longer-term promise of products  currently in development, despite recent disappointments. Lilly has strong  positions in the neuroscience, endocrinology, oncology, cardiovascular, and  animal health markets. We expect it to continue benefitting from product- and  therapeutic-class diversity. In 2013, we believe Lilly will have at least  seven drugs with sales in excess of $1 billion each, with five generating  mid-single-digit growth. The largest selling at that time will be Cymbalta,  which has prospered in a market dominated by a variety of not-dissimilar  generic drugs. Lilly has 12 products in phase III development, with an emphasis on cancer and  other chronic diseases, suggesting an ample, but still uncertain, ability to  expand the portfolio and revenues. We expect Lilly to maintain a conservative financial policy regarding share  repurchases, dividends, and acquisitions. We believe it will continue  generating good levels of profitability, strong discretionary cash flow, high  cash balances, and very low leverage, supporting the minimal financial risk  profile. Financial metrics are now strong for even a minimal financial risk  profile. As of Dec. 31, 2011, Lilly had no net debt. Even assuming $1 billion  to $2 billion of acquisitions, we expect cash reserves to exceed debt. Liquidity We view Lilly’s liquidity as exceptional; our short-term rating is ‘A-1+’.  Sources of cash are expected to exceed mandatory uses of cash over the next  two to three years. Relevant aspects of Lilly’s liquidity are: — We expect liquidity sources to exceed uses by at least 2x over the  next two to three years. — We expect liquidity sources to continue exceeding uses, even if EBITDA  declines by 50%. — With its ample cash balance and access to the commercial paper market,  we believe Lilly could absorb, without refinancing, high-impact,  low-probability events. — The credit facility does not include financial maintenance covenants. — Lilly has well-established, solid relationships with banks and a  generally high standing in the credit markets. Sources of liquidity as of June 30, 2012, included cash and readily available  investments of about $9.7 billion. The $1.24 billion credit facility is  largely undrawn: It is the backup to a commercial paper program that can be as  large as $8 billion, but seldom exceeds $2 billion. The largest single use of  cash flow is the dividend, which is in excess of $2 billion. For the 12 months  ended June 30, 2012, Lilly generated $3.2 billion of discretionary cash flows. Outlook Our rating outlook on Lilly is stable. We expect conservative financial  policies and continued strong growth of protected products will preserve the  company’s existing minimal financial profile. However, the first of two major  patent expirations took place in 2011, with the loss of patent protection for  sales leader Zyprexa. The inevitable—but, in our view—modest revenue  declines will strongly limit the chance for an upgrade. Still, over time, the  successful commercialization of several new products could bolster our view of  Lilly’s business risk profile, contributing to an upgrade, although this is  not a near-term prospect. A major shift in financial policies, such as  significant debt-financed acquisitions to bolster the portfolio and/or  pipeline, could lead us to lower our rating if leverage remains above the 1.5x  upper limit for minimal financial risk. Given Lilly’s essentially unleveraged  posture, we estimate that cash uses would need to exceed $14 billion to breach  this upper limit.

108,LLY,TEXT-Fitch says patent cliff causes Eli Lilly revenue to tumble,"Oct 24 - Eli Lilly & Co., Inc. (Eli Lilly) reported an 11% drop in its third-quarter revenue on Oct. 24, clearly demonstrating the negative impact patent expiration can have on earnings. Earlier this week, Fitch Ratings affirmed Eli Lilly’s issuer default (IDR) rating at ‘A,’ but revised its Rating  Outlook to Negative from Stable, as the company still faces the industry’s most  severe patent expiration period over the next three years, with approximately  35% of sales subject.  Significant 3Q12 losses were largely a function of the company’s patent loss on  its top-selling pharmaceutical Zyprexa in 2011. According to Eli Lilly, the drug once recorded annual sales of over $5.0 billion, but sales during 3Q12 totaled a mere fraction of that number at $374.5 million. In the first nine months of  2012, sales decreased by more than $2.5 billion.    We remain highly concerned about the company’s ability to counter the negative  effects on earnings and cash flows from a patent cliff that accelerates with the loss of market protection for its top-selling antidepressant, Cymbalta, in  December 2013. By then, Cymbalta will be Eli Lilly’s best-selling product,  generating well over $5 billion in revenues. Additionally, the company loses  market protection next year on Humalog, another of its top-selling drugs.  We believe the company has sufficient margin flexibility under the current  rating in 2012 and 2013, but deterioration in financial flexibility due to  margin erosion in 2014 as a result of losses from the Cymbalta and Humalog  patents could potentially place additional pressure on the company’s credit  profile resulting in a review of its ‘A’ IDR. Free cash flow (FCF) generation is expected to remain indicative of the current rating, with FCF margin greater  than 10% until the potential lapses of Cymbalta and Humalog.  Along with a potential deterioration of financial flexibility, an increased  focus on shareholder returns as a use of cash could pressure ratings through  2014. The recent resumption of share repurchases after a long pause in activity  and the potential for incremental dividends show a shift in focus that may  strain Eli Lilly’s ability to address $1 billion of debt maturing in March 2014.   We maintain the company’s ability to mitigate the impact of key drug patent  expiration relies on a combination of successful commercialization of the  late-stage research and development pipeline, continued debt reduction, and  significant proactive cost control. Eli Lilly has several late-stage studies  underway, including those for a broad diabetes portfolio, and we will continue  to monitor its research and development pipeline.",10242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA831820121024

110,LLY,"Merck becomes bigger Alzheimer's player, with new trial","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc has moved to the forefront of Alzheimer’s disease research by starting a mid-stage study of a drug from a new class of oral medicines that aim to shut down production of a protein associated with the memory-robbing disease. The drugmaker said on Monday it had started the trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its so-called BACE inhibitor, named MK-8931, in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The Phase II trial, which will compare the drug with a placebo, is a global, multi-center study that includes a group of 200 patients to test safety. The study is expected eventually to enroll up to 1,700 patients in the main Phase III trial. Darryle Schoepp, head of neuroscience at Merck, said drugmakers have been trying for a decade to develop treatments that arrest Alzheimer’s disease by blocking beta secretase, an enzyme involved in production of toxic beta amyloid proteins that form plaque in the brain believed to be a contributor to Alzheimer’s disease. By blocking beta secretase in earlier Phase I trials, the Merck drug slashed by more than 90 percent the levels of beta amyloid protein circulating in cerebrospinal fluid. “It’s like shutting the faucet so nothing comes out,” Schoepp said in an interview. Merck hopes that by preventing production of beta amyloid - the main component of brain plaque - its drug will prevent a worsening of symptoms among patients with mild-to-moderate stages of the disease. Should the Merck drug prove safe in the Phase II safety trials, Schoepp said the medicine could eventually be tested in “prodromal” patients, or those with the very earliest signs of Alzheimer’s. They would include people with very mild memory problems who have also been shown by blood tests or brain scans to have worrisome initial buildup of amyloid plaque or who have other “bio markers” associated with the progressive memory-robbing disease. A successful Alzheimer’s treatment could reap billions of dollars in annual sales. But many experts believe treatment must be delivered before patients show signs of dementia because once that happens, brain damage may be irreversible. U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly is also testing a beta secretase inhibitor, as well as another experimental drug called solanezumab that has shown hints of effectiveness in Phase III studies. Solanezumab also targets beta amyloid protein, but through a different mechanism than beta secretase blockers. “In addition to solanezumab, which is currently in Phase III clinical development, in July 2012 Lilly advanced our homegrown beta secretase inhibitor into Phase II clinical development for its potential to slow the progression of this devastating disease,” a Lilly spokesperson said. Schoepp noted that the Merck drug is a pill, whereas solanezumab is given by intravenous infusion. He added that solanezumab is believed to work by removing some plaque already deposited in the brain, whereas beta secretase inhibitors directly interfere with production of the beta amyloid proteins that form the plaque. “Our drug attacks the amyloid pathway directly. We’re preventing it at the beginning. You can’t get plaque if you don’t make these” protein fragments, he said. Lilly is considered ahead of the its rivals in Alzheimer’s research after solanezumab, in Phase III trials, was shown in August to slow cognitive declines in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. However, the drug failed its overall goal of delaying cognitive and physical decline in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s. The start of Merck’s new trial of MK-8931 could put the company on an equal footing with Lilly in the race for the first approved drug to delay progress of the disease. Merck’s drug appears almost to entirely prevent the formation of new beta amyloid, the toxic proteins that lead to plaques in the brain, while the Lilly drug acts by removing existing plaques, according to Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group. “We do not believe that Merck has any clinical efficacy data at this point upon which it is basing its Phase II/III ‘go’ decision. Thus, one must still view the Phase III as highly speculative,” Schoenebaum wrote in a research note. Assuming the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asks Lilly to conduct another confirmatory Phase III trial on its drug, the Merck drug is on roughly the same timeline to potential approval as the Lilly drug, he said. If the FDA approves the Lilly drug on its existing data, something Schoenebaum thinks is unlikely, then Lilly would be about three years ahead, he added. Merck shares were up 20 cents, or 0.45 percent at $44.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lilly shares were down 10 cents at $48.94. Earlier this year, Roche Holding AG more than doubled the size of a clinical trial of its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, gantenerumab, in patients who have early Alzheimer’s but have not yet developed dementia, putting it in the vanguard of attempts to catch the disease in early stages.

Lilly’s settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission represents part of a broader bribery crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry by U.S. criminal and civil authorities as they continue to probe corruption. The settlement stems from an investigation by the SEC of Lilly’s activities from 1994 to 2009, Lilly said, adding the company was first notified of the probe in 2003. In this case, the SEC alleged that a Russian unit of Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly used “marketing agreements” to funnel millions of dollars to government officials through offshore companies. Eli Lilly, whose products include schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa and the depression drug Cymbalta, agreed to the settlement with the SEC without admitting or denying the charges. The SEC said that when Eli Lilly became aware of possible violations of the law that bans bribing government officials it did not intervene on the use of the marketing agreements for more than five years. Moreover, the SEC said the company’s units in Brazil, China and Poland made improper payments to government officials or third-party firms associated with government officials. “Eli Lilly and its subsidiaries possessed a ‘check the box’ mentality when it came to third-party due diligence,” said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, head of the SEC enforcement unit that specializes in bribery cases. “Companies can’t simply rely on paper-thin assurances by employees, distributors, or customers. They need to look at the surrounding circumstances of any payment to adequately assess whether it could wind up in a government official’s pocket.” Eli Lilly, in a statement, said that in addition to paying $29.4 million, it agreed to have an independent compliance consultant conduct a 60-day review of its internal controls and FCPA compliance. “Lilly requires our employees to act with integrity with all external parties and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,” said Anne Nobles, Lilly’s chief ethics and compliance officer. Nobles said Lilly had cooperated with the U.S. investigators and strengthened its internal controls, including significant investment in a global anti-corruption program. Under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), it is illegal for U.S. companies and foreign firms with listed U.S. stock to bribe government officials. In February, a review by Reuters showed that eight of the world’s top 10 drug makers, including Eli Lilly, had all warned investors they could face liabilities related to corruption charges in overseas markets.

118,LLY,Eli Lilly banks on cost controls for higher 2013 profit,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said on Friday it expects profit in 2013 to increase by more than Wall Street had been forecasting, primarily due to cost controls and improved productivity. Lilly, whose shares were up nearly 4 percent on Friday, said 2013 sales will be flat to a bit higher, despite the loss of patent on its $5 billion-a-year antidepressant, Cymbalta, in December. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker is coming off a particularly difficult 2012 when sales declined sharply because of competition from cheaper generics. It expects 2013 earnings to increase to $3.75 to $3.90 per share excluding items, from a forecast of $3.30 to $3.40 per share in 2012. In 2011, its adjusted earnings were $4.41 per share. Analysts on average forecast earnings of $3.71 for 2013 and $3.36 per share for 2012, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Overall, it was better than anyone expected,” said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler. “From an earnings perspective, no one believed that operating expenses would be kept in check.” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said, “They’re cutting costs at a pace that’s maybe a little quicker than people were anticipating, and that was one of the reasons for the outperformance in their guidance.” The company said 2013 net profit would benefit from a tax credit that had been pushed into this year because of the late signing of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 - the legislation that prevented the so-called fiscal cliff. The company said it is not sure yet of the amount of the tax credit, which is related to research and development accounting, and said it would provide more information during its January 29 earnings conference call. Lilly said it excluded the impact from all of its financial guidance. Similar uncertainty could face other drugmakers, as well as other corporate sectors with extensive research budgets, such as technology and defense. However, “It could be resolved by the time everybody else reports,” Butler said of the pharmaceutical industry. “We’ve got another three weeks before anyone reports.” Lilly said the adjusted earnings forecast also excludes payment and income for revenue sharing with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Amylin unit on Byetta, a diabetes drug, and restructuring charges. Lilly severed ties with Amylin when it agreed to collaborate with Boehringer Ingelheim on diabetes drug development. Lilly forecast 2013 revenue of $22.6 billion to $23.4 billion, driven by sales of its drugs for diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, erectile dysfunction and animal health. The company said it also expects significant revenue growth from Japan and emerging markets, such as China. Analysts are looking for 2013 revenue of $22.82 billion. While Cymbalta is not expected to start facing generic competition until the end of the year, the company cautioned that sales declines could begin sooner if wholesalers start to reduce inventory supplies prior to the patent expiration. As a result, it said, the fourth quarter could look significantly different than the first three. Lilly has already been battered by generic competition for its once top-selling schizophrenia drug, Zyprexa, and will face generic competition for its $1 billion-a-year Evista osteoporosis drug in early 2014. But help is on the way. Lilly said it now has 13 drugs in late-stage testing, the most at any one time in its history. It could seek approvals this year for drugs for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, gastric cancer and for a type of lymphoma. Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice told analysts on a conference call that the company was firmly focused on replenishing the developmental pipeline. “This is our future and it’s our first priority.” The company also vowed to maintain its dividend payout and complete its share repurchase plan. “Lilly has financially done a really good job. Obviously, you need the pipeline to come through,” said Barclay’s Butler, adding that positive late-stage data on ramucirumab in breast cancer could signal an important new product for Lilly. The drug is also in late-stage testing for the smaller gastric cancer market. Other key events for Lilly in 2013 include the start of a new Phase III trial of solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease after an earlier study failed but showed some signs of hope for the memory-robbing condition, and an August trial challenging a method of use patent on the $3 billion-a-year lung cancer drug Alimta. Should Lilly prevail in court, the company could have patent protection on the medicine into 2022 even though the basic patent lapses in 2016.

119,LLY,UPDATE 3-Eli Lilly banks on cost controls for higher 2013 profit,"* Profit gain in 2013 follows drop in 2012 * Sales to be about flat to higher in 2013 * Shares rise nearly 4 percent   (Adds analyst comment, details from Lilly call, updates share price) By Bill Berkrot and Caroline Humer Jan 4 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said on Friday it expects profit in 2013 to increase by more than Wall Street had been forecasting, primarily due to cost controls and improved productivity. Lilly, whose shares were up nearly 4 percent on Friday, said 2013 sales will be flat to a bit higher, despite the loss of patent on its $5 billion-a-year antidepressant, Cymbalta, in December. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker is coming off a particularly difficult 2012 when sales declined sharply because of competition from cheaper generics. It expects 2013 earnings to increase to $3.75 to $3.90 per share excluding items, from a forecast of $3.30 to $3.40 per share in 2012. In 2011, its adjusted earnings were $4.41 per share. Analysts on average forecast earnings of $3.71 for 2013 and $3.36 per share for 2012, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Overall, it was better than anyone expected,” said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler. “From an earnings perspective, no one believed that operating expenses would be kept in check.” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said, “They’re cutting costs at a pace that’s maybe a little quicker than people were anticipating, and that was one of the reasons for the outperformance in their guidance.” The company said 2013 net profit would benefit from a tax credit that had been pushed into this year because of the late signing of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 - the legislation that prevented the so-called fiscal cliff. The company said it is not sure yet of the amount of the tax credit, which is related to research and development accounting, and said it would provide more information during its Jan. 29 earnings conference call.

122,LLY,Lilly brain-plaque diagnostic approved in Europe,"Jan 15 (Reuters) - European health regulators on Tuesday approved Eli Lilly and Co’s imaging agent used to detect brain plaques that are considered a possible cause of Alzheimer’s disease. It was approved in Europe for use in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease and other causes of memory and reasoning problems. The radioactive diagnostic called Amyvid, which is used in conjunction with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging tests, was approved for use in the United States last April. Amyvid can help detect beta-amyloid plaque build-up in the brain. The plaques, which have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, were previously only detectable through autopsy.",1152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/lilly-diagnostic/lilly-brain-plaque-diagnostic-approved-in-europe-idUSL2N0AKJRH20130115
123,LLY,UPDATE 2-U.S. Medicare panel skeptical of brain-plaque scans,"By Ransdell Pierson Jan 30 (Reuters) - A Medicare advisory panel expressed skepticism on Wednesday that  radioactive imaging agents like Eli Lilly and Co’s Amyvid can improve health outcomes of people with early symptoms of memory problems. The medical panel’s lack of confidence could deter U.S. reimbursement for recently approved Amyvid, which is used to detect plaques in the brain made of beta amyloid protein. Its wholesale cost is $1,600 per dose. Although the brain plaque is considered by many researchers to be a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, some panel members questioned whether Amyvid and similar imaging agents now in development could be reliably used to diagnose Alzheimer’s or risk of developing it. The Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) met in an all-day review of the imaging technique. It involves use of PET scans (Positron Emission Tomography), which measure the decay of injected radioactive tracers like Amyvid. Of 12 voting members, eight voted they had low or low-to-intermediate confidence that PET imaging of brain beta amyloid changes health outcomes. Three members voted they had intermediate confidence, while one voted intermediate to high confidence. The U.S. Medicare insurance program for the elderly and disabled already reimburses use of PET scans to detect and analyze a wide number of cancers. But the agency, relying on its medical advisory panel, is evaluating whether to reimburse patients for Lilly’s product. Medicare reimbursement for drugs is doubly important to drugmakers because it typically paves the way for reimbursement by private insurers. Lilly declined to speculate whether the panel’s skeptical reaction to its product would harm Amyvid’s reimbursement chances with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). “That’s for CMS to decide,” said Wei-Li Shao, senior director of Alzheimer’s business at Lilly. But he said much of the information presented at the meeting supported the value of Lilly’s imaging agent. “One in five patients told they have Alzheimer’s don’t actually have it,” he said, and could avoid unnecessary treatment for the disease if Amyvid shows the absence of brain plaque. “It’s a hard diagnosis, so it’s important to get that right,” Shao said. The FDA in April 2012 approved use of Amyvid (florbetapir F 18 injection). Prior to Amyvid, the amount of brain plaque could  be determined only with a brain biopsy at autopsy. Lilly, which is developing a number of experimental treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, bought Avid Radiopharmaceuticals in late 2010 to acquire Amyvid. It paid $300 million for the privately held company, and agreed to pay an additional $500 million to Avid stockholders if regulatory and commercial milestones for the product were achieved. Lilly’s experimental Alzheimer’s treatment, solanezumab,  last summer failed to slow cognitive decline in two big late-stage trials that enrolled patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. But when data from the two trials was combined and analyzed, the drug slowed cognitive decline by more than 30 percent in patients with mild symptoms. The infused drug is now being tested in several independent trials among patients with very mild symptoms or no symptoms of the progressive memory-robbing disease, or who have a high family risk of developing Alzheimer’s. The trials will select many patients based upon whether patients have brain plaque, as detected by PET scans and Amyvid. Lilly shares closed down 0.3 percent at $54.15 on Wednesday, amid slight declines for the drug sector.

125,LLY,Eli Lilly CEO says company keeping animal health business,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s chief executive said his company had no intention of following Pfizer’s lead by spinning off or selling the company’s lucrative Elanco animal health unit. “We’re comfortable with that business and we’re going to keep it,” Lilly CEO John Lechleiter said definitively on Monday during a question and answer session at the BIO CEO & Investor conference in New York. Pfizer earlier this month spun off its animal health business through an initial public offering that raised $2.2 billion, though Pfizer will control roughly 80 percent of the new company, leading to speculation that other drugmakers would follow suit. But Lechleiter said his company was very happy with a business that was posting industry leading growth rates. He said livestock and pet care products now accounted for about 10 percent of total company sales, up from 5 percent to 6 percent a few years ago, and that the percentage could become even bigger. While overall sales at Lilly declined about 7 percent in 2012, primarily due to generic competition for its once top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug, the animal health unit saw sales jump 21 percent to $2 billion, with a 30 percent rise in the United States. Lechleiter also said the company had no plans to make a push into so-called orphan drugs - medicines for serious conditions that affect few people but command astronomical prices. Many drugmakers have found this to be an attractive option as they try to find ways to make up for former big sellers facing generic competition. “We’re still focused on big diseases that kill the most people,” he said, mentioning cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly has a pair of high profile Alzheimer’s drugs in development. It is conducting a third late stage study of its solanezumab at the request of U.S. health regulators after the first two failed to meet the main goals of the trials but showed promise in patients with a mild form of the disease. The drug works by blocking a protein called beta amyloid that causes toxic plaques to build up in the brain. It also has a drug in Phase II testing from a promising class called beta secretase, or BACE, inhibitors. “I’m hopeful within the next 10 years, or sooner than that, we will have something that slows progression,” Lechleiter said. While the root cause of the brain wasting, memory robbing disease is not known, many researchers believe brain plaques are a main culprit. “I think the amyloid plaque hypothesis is the best shot we’ve got,” the CEO said. Meanwhile Lilly has several other shots on goal in its development pipeline. The company currently has 13 drugs in Phase III testing - the most at any one time in its history - and expects key data on eight of them this year. It also has 23 drugs in midstage testing. “We’ve tried to make R&D; (research and development) more sustainable and not return to the cupboard is bare” that Lechleiter said was the company’s plight in 2004.

127,LLY,Lilly confident on keeping dividend through patent cliff,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co will maintain its dividend despite the erosion of its earnings by generic copies of blockbuster drugs and should be well placed by the end of 2013 to assess the potential of its future medicines, its chief executive said. The U.S. drugmaker suffered a 7 percent drop in revenue last year and a 6 percent decline in net profit after it lost U.S. patent protection of top-selling schizophrenia drug Zyprexa. Conversely, the company that brought Prozac to the world has 13 drug candidates in phase III trials, the most in its history. Major U.S. drug companies lost a total of about $21 billion in revenue last year from lucrative medicines coming off patent, while the hit for European businesses is about $10 billion, according to Standard & Poor’s. However, the industry won 39 new drug approvals in 2012 — a record only beaten in 1996. Chief Executive John Lechleiter told Reuters that Lilly had pledged in 2009 to maintain its dividend at $0.49 per quarter. “We’ve stayed with that and that’s still our guidance,” he said on Tuesday during a trip to Brussels. In recent months, Lilly has reported positive Phase III test results for ramucirumab to treat gastric cancer and for two diabetes medicines and results showing its Alzheimer disease drug solanezumab may be effective in treating mild sufferers. Ramucirumab will undergo a further test for gastric cancer along with Bristol-Meyers Squibb’s chemotherapy drug paclitaxel and studies in breast, lung, colorectal and liver cancers. “We sort of have a lot of shots on goal. We are hopeful that we can establish efficacy in several of these tumors,” Lechleiter said. Lilly believes it will be able to report Phase III trial results for eight drug candidates and file for approval for five this year. “We’ll have a very good sense of where we stand by the end of this year,” Lechleiter said. The Lilly chief said drug launches could come as early as late 2014 or into 2015. A ramp-up of sales can take around five years from launch. Lilly has said revenue in 2014 would be no lower than $20 billion with net profit of at least $3 billion. Lechleiter said developed world governments, many forced into budget cuts, needed to balance short-term budgetary considerations and long term economic and social benefits. Lechleiter said the industry had to acknowledge health budget and reimbursements cuts in struggling European countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, but conditions in other nations, such as Germany and Britain, were very different. The European Union also needed to put itself in a position to profit from what he forecast would be the “biomedical century”. State-sponsored initiatives such as more funding for research and the region’s 2020 goals might help. But ultimately, governments needed to pay up for new medicines. “When I joined Lilly in 1970s.. more than 50 percent of the medicines in that decade originated in Europe. Around 30 percent came from the U.S. Now those figures are reversed.” “With all due respect to the push initiatives... there needs to be a pull mechanism. Innovation needs to be rewarded.” ",3062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lilly/lilly-confident-on-keeping-dividend-through-patent-cliff-idUSBRE9250OJ20130306
128,LLY,UPDATE 1-Lilly diabetes drug as good as insulin in study,"* Drug proved as effective as long-acting insulin * Drug also showed benefits when used with other treatments April 16 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co’s experimental once-weekly diabetes drug dulaglutide proved as good as insulin in controlling blood sugar in type 2 diabetics in two late-stage studies, the company said on Tuesday. The medicine met the studies’ key goal of demonstrating non-inferiority to insulin glargine, a longer-acting form of insulin, in lowering hemoglobin A1c, a measure of controlling diabetes. Further research showed dulaglutide demonstrated statistical superiority in lowering hemoglobin A1c compared to insulin glargine at one year in patients with type 2 diabetes who were already taking the diabetes drugs metformin and glimeperide, the company said. Dulaglutide combined with insulin lispro, a fast-acting form of insulin, also was statistically superior in reducing hemoglobin A1c compared to insulin glargine in combination with insulin lispro at 26 weeks. The company said it expects to submit data from the studies to U.S. regulatory authorities this year as it seeks marketing approval for the injectable medicine. Last October, Eli Lilly released data showing dulaglutide lowered hemoglobin A1c levels more than twice-daily injections of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Byetta given for six months, oral metformin taken for 26 weeks, and Merck & Co’s  once-daily oral Januvia taken for one year.

132,LLY,UPDATE 1-Eli Lilly lymphoma drug fails in late-stage trial,"May 10 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said it will end development of an experimental cancer drug after it failed in a late-stage trial to delay a worsening of symptoms in patients with lymphoma. The drug, enzastaurin, was being tested in lymphoma patients who were at high risk of relapse following chemotherapy treatment. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The decision to stop the drug’s development will result in a second-quarter charge of about $30 million, but the company’s 2013 forecast remained unchanged, Lilly said in a statement on Friday. Lilly over the past decade has also tested the pill against a variety of other types of tumors, without success, including lung cancer and breast cancer. Its main remaining focus has been on lymphoma. Cowen and Co had expected Lilly to seek marketing approval for the medicine this year as a lymphoma treatment, and for it to generate annual sales by 2016 of about $200 million, if approved for the condition. That would have made it a fairly modest product for Lilly. Approval would have given a boost to Lilly’s cancer program. The company’s third-biggest medicine is Alimta, a treatment for lung cancer that pulls in $2.5 billion a year, but it could face generic competition in the United States by 2016. Lilly on Friday said it continues with late-stage trials of two other experimental cancer drugs.

Both patients died three to four days after receiving “an appropriate dose” of the medicine, and both had very high levels of the drug in their bloodstreams, the FDA said in a bulletin released on its website on Tuesday. The medicine’s package insert carries a prominent “black box” warning of risk from post-injection delirium sedation syndrome, or PDSS, a serious condition in which the drug enters the blood too fast following an injection, causing greatly elevated levels of the drug in the bloodstream. High doses of the drug can cause delirium, cardiopulmonary arrest, heart rhythm problems, sedation and coma, the FDA said. Lilly said it was not clear whether the two deaths were related to use of the drug. “We are continuing to evaluate this important safety issue and will communicate any clinically significant safety information that affects the product,” Lilly spokesman Morry Smulevitz said in an emailed statement. In Lilly’s clinical trials of Zyprexa Relprevv, cases of PDSS were seen within three hours of taking the drug, but no deaths from the syndrome were seen, the FDA said. Zyprexa Relprevv, approved by the FDA in 2009, comes with warnings that patients must stay at the doctor’s office for at least three hours after it is given so they can be monitored. The drug is a long-acting version of Lilly’s widely used oral Zyprexa treatment, which was the company’s biggest product until it began facing competition from cheaper generics in 2011. Zyprexa Relprevv competes with other long-acting treatments such as Johnson & Johnson’s Invega Sustenna. It is meant to offer weeks of symptom control for schizophrenia patients, who often fail to take their medication regularly. The Lilly spokesman said Zyprexa Relprevv’s global sales were “less than $60 million” in 2012. Lilly has annual sales of more than $20 billion. Global sales of Lilly’s Zyprexa franchise plunged 49 percent to $284 million in the first quarter of 2013 as cheaper generics continued to gain market share. Lilly shares were down 6 cents to $52.30 in early-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

135,LLY,Lilly CEO returns to work after surgery,"July 8 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said Chief Executive John Lechleiter returned to work after recovering from a surgery to treat a dilated aorta. Lechleiter, CEO since April 2008, was cleared by his personal physician and the company’s employee health services physician to return to work, Eli Lilly said on Monday. Lechleiter’s condition was discovered while undergoing certain unrelated tests, and he underwent the surgery on May 13. Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice, who served as acting CEO, and lead independent director Ellen Marram, who served as acting chairperson of the board during Leichter’s medical leave, will return to their roles. A dilated aorta is an abnormal swelling of the aorta, the largest artery of the body and crucial for blood circulation. An abnormal swelling can cause the aorta to rupture, leading to internal bleeding and can be fatal.",7082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/elililly-ceoreturn/lilly-ceo-returns-to-work-after-surgery-idUSL4N0FE2OO20130708
136,LLY,Medicare plan on Alzheimer's test dismays advocates,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Alzheimer’s experts plan to protest proposed Medicare guidelines that would deny coverage of an Eli Lilly diagnostic test for the disease unless patients are taking part one of several clinical trials in which the $3,000 test is being used. Eli Lilly and Co and the Alzheimer’s Association have objected to the draft guidelines, issued last week by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the agency that runs Medicare. Both plan to pressure CMS to change the guidelines, saying they deny some patients the chance to get an accurate diagnosis. The final rule goes into effect in October. CMS said it made the decision because there was not enough evidence that the test - a radioactive drug used with PET imaging - improves patient care. At the same time, it conceded there was evidence the tests could rule out Alzheimer’s in difficult-to-diagnose cases and help identify good candidates for clinical trials into more effective treatments or prevention strategies. Patient advocates and the company say the decision might slow the development of future diagnostic tests for Alzheimer’s and deny patients with symptoms the chance to find out whether they have Alzheimer’s or some other disease that causes symptoms of dementia. Several experts say there is still much to learn about what a positive scan might mean, and believe CMS’ decision to at least cover scans used in clinical trials may help in the search for treatments for the fatal, brain-wasting disease that affects 5 million Americans and 38 million people worldwide. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved Lilly’s compound, known as Amyvid. But Medicare reimbursement is seen as critical for the company because most people begin showing signs of dementia at around age 65, the age when Medicare coverage kicks in. “Restricting coverage could hinder a timely and accurate diagnosis,” said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, president and chief executive of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals Inc, a Lilly subsidiary. “It may stifle future innovation.” In addition to Lilly, the draft guidance could affect imaging agents being developed by General Electric Co’s GE Healthcare, and Piramal Imaging, a unit of India’s Piramal Enterprises, which acquired Bayer AG’s agent last year. Both have compounds under review at the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. All three are radioactive tracers designed to light up deposits of an Alzheimer’s-related protein called beta amyloid when used in conjunction with brain scans known as positron emission tomography, or PET. Scientists believe these Alzheimer’s-linked plaques start developing at least a decade before symptoms occur, and spotting changes in the brain early offers the best chance to intervene with new drugs that might prevent or delay the disease. Instead of agreeing to routinely pay for the $3,000 test, CMS proposed “Coverage with Evidence Development,” a designation that suggests there are still gaps in the evidence over the benefits of the test. That allows CMS to gather more data by paying for scans in patients taking part in trials. CMS could use the data to render a decision on wider coverage. “Essentially, they acknowledge that there is the possibility that coverage is important, but they don’t understand it quite yet,” said Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific Relations at the Alzheimer’s Association. Before the decision, the Alzheimer’s Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging sent CMS a report detailing the limited circumstances under which the test would be appropriate for certain patients. That might include helping to tell which patients have Alzheimer’s and which have another form of dementia involving the shrinking of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Robert Egge, vice president of public policy at the Alzheimer’s Association, said the group will urge doctors and patients to provide feedback on the document during the 30-day public comment period. And he said the group will consider other options, including lobbying lawmakers. Egge said the CMS guidelines contradict the spirit of the National Alzheimer’s Plan, a sweeping effort to find an effective way to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s by 2025 and improve the care of those already afflicted. Wei-Li Shao, director of Lilly’s Alzheimer’s business, said the company will meet with the agency to lay out its case. “One in five patients who are told they have Alzheimer’s don’t have it,” he said. “Diagnosing Alzheimer’s can be really difficult. Knowing someone’s amyloid status, or knowing they’ve got amyloid in the brain, is valuable information.” In April 2012, Lilly became the first company to win U.S. marketing approval for Amyvid, but without Medicare approval, use of the drug has been limited to individuals with the means to pay for the scans themselves and to coverage by private insurance companies on a case by case basis. The drug had first-quarter sales of $500,000 and demand is growing, Shao said. It is available at 450 imaging centers across the country and more than 1,000 doctors are trained to read it. But some doctors are concerned Medicare approval might prod healthy people who are worried about their memory to pressure their doctors for the test. “I think CMS found a way to do something truly constructive while holding back what will undoubtedly be a tsunami of worried well” who may discover they have amyloid in their brains, said Dr. Sam Gandy, an Alzheimer’s expert at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. “They would have no idea if or when their brains would begin to curdle in response to the amyloid, setting them on the road to dementia,” Gandy said. Lilly, in its statement, says its test was not designed to predict whether Alzheimer’s would develop, only to rule out Alzheimer’s in patients. A negative scan for the presence of beta amyloid would indicate other potential causes of dementia. That still leaves the problem of what to tell patients who have a positive scan, said Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer’s expert at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. In someone with a precursor condition to Alzheimer’s known as mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, a positive scan may mean a higher risk of advancing to Alzheimer’s more quickly than a negative scan would indicate, he said. “The data are accumulating, but I don’t know if they are there yet.” At Mayo, Petersen is conducting a study of thousands of cognitively normal people to try to answer that question. As companies work on new drugs, having tests that identify the disease will be essential, said Dr. Steven DeKosky of the University of Virginia. “One of the reasons for trying to do these studies now is to know what we will actually do once we have drugs that will make a difference,” he said.

138,LLY,Eli Lilly to freeze employee base pay ahead of generic onslaught,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N), which expects to lose about 20 percent of its global revenue next year due to the expiration of key drug patents, is suspending base pay increases for most employees in 2014 to cut costs. At the end of this year Lilly’s current biggest product, the antidepressant Cymbalta, will lose patent protection while copycat forms of its $1 billion-a-year Evista osteoporosis drug are due to arrive in early 2014. The company has also decided to reduce employee bonuses paid out in 2015 for their performance in 2014. The news came just months after the drugmaker decided to layoff about 1,000 domestic sales representatives to cut costs. “This is a difficult, but necessary decision,” company spokesman Edward Sagebiel said on Wednesday. “We continue to face the most significant challenges in our history.” “While we’ve taken many actions to reduce costs and become a leaner organization, we must do more,” Sagebiel said, adding that the company expects to save about $400 million through 2016 with the help of these cost-cutting efforts. Sagebiel said Lilly employees will be eligible for base pay increases in 2015.

139,LLY,"WRAPUP 1-Drugmakers fear short-term ""turmoil"" as China probes widen","* Sanofi regional office visited by officials this week * Eli Lilly says had routine visit earlier in 2013 * AstraZeneca sales rep still detained in Shanghai * AstraZeneca CEO sees short-term disruption, price pressure By Ben Hirschler and Elena Berton LONDON/PARIS, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities visited a regional office of French drugmaker Sanofi this week in the latest sign of a widening investigation into Western drugmakers. Eli Lilly said it had also been visited by officials in the same city of Shenyang as part of a “routine” probe which had started earlier this year, while the CEO of AstraZeneca , which has a sales executive in detention in Shanghai, warned of short-term “turmoil” in the sector. The latest developments suggest a series of probes into over-pricing and alleged bribery in the industry may have a broad impact, in a market that has been a particular bright spot for Western pharmaceuticals who face slowing sales at home. “In the short term, there could be some ups and downs because this issue will create turmoil. It may well be that the industry experiences more intense price revisions,” AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot told Reuters on Thursday. “But even if this happens, in the mid- to long-term China is a growing market - there is no doubt about that in my mind,” Soriot added, stressing his company had no plans to cut back investment in the country. Chinese police have detained four Chinese executives of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and questioned at least 18 other staff amid allegations the drugmaker funnelled up to 3 billion yuan ($489 million) to travel agencies to facilitate bribes to doctors and officials. At the same time, the powerful National Development and Reform Commission is examining pricing by 60 local and international pharmaceutical companies. Sanofi said its office in Shenyang - one of 11 regional offices in China - had been visited by officials from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) on July 29. “We are not really aware of the purpose of the visit, we are working with SAIC,” CEO Chris Viehbacher told reporters on Thursday as he presented the company’s second-quarter results. Viehbacher added that the French group’s local head office in Shanghai had not been contacted by Chinese authorities. A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly said SAIC officials had also visited its office in Shenyang, adding that the visit was a regular business inspection and not related to the GSK case, which is being handled by the Ministry of Public Security. SAIC is one of China’s anti-trust regulators in charge of market supervision, which also looks into low-level bribery cases. AstraZeneca and Belgian drugmaker UCB have also been visited recently by Chinese authorities, but it remains unclear if or how the cases are related. AstraZeneca’s Soriot said one sales representative in Shanghai was continuing to be detained by police, although two other employees who were questioned were quickly released. Local police have told the company that the case is an “individual” investigation and not linked to the GSK scandal. Big drugmakers have been scrambling to ensure their compliance systems are up to scratch in the wake of the GSK allegations. Soriot, speaking after presenting quarterly results, said his team had “double- and triple-checked that everything is compliant” and he was confident the firm’s internal systems to prevent bribery and corruption were robust. China is an especially important market for AstraZeneca, since it has a long-standing presence in the country and punches above its weight in terms of market share. It enjoys strong sales of medicines like Nexium for controlling stomach acid, and Symbicort for asthma and chronic lung disease. AstraZeneca grew Chinese sales by more than fifth to $431 million in the second quarter of 2013 and China represents 7 percent of the group’s total revenue. China’s contribution to GSK sales, by contrast, is just over 3 percent. A promise last week by GSK to make its drugs more affordable in China in the wake of the bribery scandal is seen by many analysts as a lever for Chinese authorities to start pushing back harder on the cost of Western medicines. One board member of a Western drugmaker not involved in the incidents reported to date said this could lead to some of the more bullish estimates for Chinese sales to revised down, although it would remain a major growth market. Viehbacher said it was premature to say what repercussions the scandal would have on Sanofi’s business in China. “We are examining the issue closely and we are examining our business in China, but I think it’s too early to draw any conclusions,” he told reporters during the quarterly results briefing.",8012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-pharmaceuticals/wrapup-1-drugmakers-fear-short-term-turmoil-as-china-probes-widen-idUSL6N0G22LB20130801

H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN.CO), a smaller Danish drugs firm, also said its unit in Beijing had been visited by the authorities, while a Chinese newspaper reported an allegation from an unnamed person that French firm Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) had paid around 1.7 million yuan ($276,200) in bribes to hundreds of doctors in China in 2007. Paris-based Sanofi said it took the claim “very seriously”. Chinese investigations into bribery and over-pricing have so far centred on Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) (GSK.L) but the latest developments suggest they could have a wider impact across the pharmaceuticals industry. Novo said on Thursday that local Administration for Industry and Commerce (AIC) officials visited a production facility in Tianjin on August 1, adding there had been no visit at the company’s head office in the country. “We were asked to provide information regarding our operations in China,” Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told reporters as he presented second-quarter results. “Whether this was a routine check or triggered by the (GSK) case reported recently in the media is not completely clear to us. However, the local AIC hasn’t accused Novo Nordisk of any wrongdoing.” Chinese police have detained four Chinese executives of GSK and questioned at least 18 other staff amid allegations that the drugmaker funnelled up to 3 billion yuan ($489 million) to travel agencies to facilitate bribes to doctors and officials. At the same time, the powerful National Development and Reform Commission is examining pricing by 60 local and international pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), meanwhile, has had a sales executive detained in Shanghai, while Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) and Belgium’s UCB SA (UCB.BR) have also had visits to premises in China. Industry analysts at Wells Fargo Securities, citing the views of a China expert with law firm Ropes & Gray, said the knock-on effect would be to crimp growth for multinational pharma companies in China, where the authorities are expected to push for harsher price controls. As a result, the rate of growth for drug sales in the country could fall to around 10 percent a year from an historical 20 percent, they wrote in a research note. For Novo investors, the potential problems in China were offset by the company’s decision on Thursday to raise its full-year results forecast for a third time in six months, after double-digit sales growth in diabetes drug Victoza and modern insulin helped lift second-quarter operating profit above forecasts. It now expects 2013 sales growth in local currencies of between 11 and 13 percent, compared with 9 to 11 percent previously. Its forecast for operating profit growth was increased to between 12 and 15 percent from around 10 percent. “Given the tendency of management to beat and raise throughout the year, we expect consensus to move 1 to 2 percent upwards to the higher end of the new guidance range,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race. Shares in Novo were up 0.8 percent at 969 crowns by 1134 GMT. Profit growth was driven by a 12 percent increase in sales of modern insulins compared with the same quarter a year ago and a 25 percent rise in sales of diabetes drug Victoza. Group sales rose 10 percent to 21.38 billion crowns, against an average market forecast of 21.26 billion given in a Reuters poll of analysts. The company said that based on feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the design of a cardiovascular outcomes trial for its new long-acting insulin Tresiba, it now expected to start the trial before the end of the year. The additional trials for the drug follow a blow in the United States in February when the FDA refused to approve Tresiba and instead asked for extra tests to assess potential heart risks.

142,LLY,Lilly says deeply concerned by bribery allegations in China,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co said it was “deeply concerned” about allegations published in a Chinese newspaper that it spent more than 30 million yuan ($4.90 million) to bribe doctors in China to prescribe the firm’s medicines instead of rival products. A former senior manager for the company, identified by the pseudonym Wang Wei, told the 21st Century Business Herald that bribery and illegal payments at Eli Lilly’s China operations were widespread, the paper reported on Thursday. Eli Lilly is the third foreign drugmaker to face whistleblower accusations in the newspaper this month. The reports coincide with multiple Chinese investigations into the pharmaceutical sector, spanning alleged corruption to how drugs are priced. “In order to hit sales at rival companies and push the company’s own products, bribes and special payments of all sorts were extremely common at the company. The level of the problem was just as bad as at GlaxoSmithKline,” Wang was quoted as saying. The report said the 30 million yuan in bribes were handed out over a period of around one year from 2011 to 2012. Police have detained four Chinese executives at British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline over allegations it funneled up to 3 billion yuan ($489.92 million) to travel agencies to facilitate bribes to doctors to boost the sale of its medicines. GSK has said some of its senior Chinese executives appear to have broken the law. Eli Lilly said in an emailed statement to Reuters that it was looking into the matter. “Although we have not been able to verify these allegations, we take them seriously, and we are continuing our investigation,” the statement said. The U.S. firm said it had been made aware of separate but “similar allegations” of kickbacks in 2012 by a former sales manager. Lilly said it had opened an investigation at that time involving staff interviews, e-mail monitoring and expense report audits. Wang told the newspaper that company employees paid the bribes to promote two of the company’s key insulin products in Shanghai and neighboring Anhui province. Further kickbacks in the form of paid talks, conferences and other contributions were also made, he said. Last week the 21st Century Business Herald quoted an unnamed whistleblower as saying Novartis AG had paid bribes to doctors to boost drug sales, prompting the Swiss company to launch an internal investigation. Health Ministry officials are also investigating Sanofi SA over bribery allegations after the newspaper said staff paid bribes totaling about 1.7 million yuan to more than 500 doctors in late 2007 to boost sales. The French company has said it is taking the claims “very seriously”. Lilly has 3,600 employees in China, representing almost 10 percent of its global workforce. Many of them work at its research center in Shanghai and a manufacturing site in Suzhou. The company, whose Humalog and Humulin insulins have combined global sales of almost $4 billion, also sells widely used treatments for depression, cancer, osteoporosis and schizophrenia. Lilly earlier this month said its facilities in Shenyang were inspected toward the beginning of the year by the state Administration for Industry and Commerce (AIC). The antitrust regulator is in charge of market supervision, but also investigates low-level bribery cases. Lilly cooperated with the AIC investigators and has not received any formal notice regarding their visit, the company said. The drugmaker on Thursday said China’s Public Security Bureau, the country’s main police authority, had not contacted the company about any of the allegations or inspections. Lilly is no stranger to bribery allegations. Last December, the Indianapolis company agreed to pay $29 million to settle U.S. civil charges that its subsidiaries made improper payments to foreign government officials to win business in Russia, Brazil, China and Poland. The settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stemmed from an investigation by the SEC of Lilly’s activities between 1994 to 2009. Corruption in China’s pharmaceutical industry is widespread, fueled in part by the low base salaries for doctors at the country’s 13,500 public hospitals.

143,LLY,"Eli Lilly says ""deeply concerned"" by bribery allegations in China","* Whistleblower tells newspaper Eli Lilly bribes “widespread” in China * U.S. drugmaker says taking allegations seriously * Foreign pharmaceutical firms under scrutiny in China SHANGHAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co  said it was “deeply concerned” about allegations published in a Chinese newspaper that it spent more than 30 million yuan ($4.90 million) to bribe doctors in China to prescribe the firm’s medicines instead of rival products. A former senior manager for the company, identified by the pseudonym Wang Wei, told the 21st Century Business Herald that bribery and illegal payments at Eli Lilly’s China operations were widespread, the paper reported on Thursday. Eli Lilly is the third foreign drugmaker to face whistleblower accusations in the newspaper this month. The reports coincide with multiple Chinese investigations into the pharmaceutical sector, spanning alleged corruption to how drugs are priced. “In order to hit sales at rival companies and push the company’s own products, bribes and special payments of all sorts were extremely common at the company. The level of the problem was just as bad as at GlaxoSmithKline,” Wang was quoted as saying. The report said the 30 million yuan in bribes were handed out over a period of around one year from 2011 to 2012. Police have detained four Chinese executives at British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline over allegations it funnelled up to 3 billion yuan ($489.92 million) to travel agencies to facilitate bribes to doctors to boost the sale of its medicines. GSK has said some of its senior Chinese executives appear to have broken the law. Eli Lilly said in an emailed statement to Reuters that it was looking into the matter. “Although we have not been able to verify these allegations, we take them seriously, and we are continuing our investigation,” the statement said. The U.S. firm said it had been made aware of “similar allegations” of kickbacks in 2012 by a former sales manager. It said the firm had opened an investigation at that time involving staff interviews, e-mail monitoring and expense report audits.

144,LLY,Halt in Zilmax sales fuels demand for rival cattle feed product,"* Some new Optaflexx feeders put on waiting list-customers * Cattle feeders switch additives after Merck pulls Zilmax * Eli Lilly unit denies shortage of Optaflexx feed additive By Tom Polansek and P.J. Huffstutter CHICAGO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s decision to suspend sales of its Zilmax cattle feed additive has caused such a surge in demand for rival Eli Lilly & Co’s Optaflexx that Lilly is telling some new customers it cannot immediately supply them, customers told Reuters. Zilmax became the focus of attention in the livestock industry after Tyson Foods Inc said on Aug. 7 that it will stop buying Zilmax-fed cattle for slaughter beginning next month. Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat processor, said it was concerned about Zilmax potentially causing health problems for some cattle. Merck announced on Aug. 16 it was temporarily suspending sales of the product in the United States and Canada. Optaflexx, sold by Lilly’s Elanco Animal Health, and Zilmax both belong to a family of drugs called beta-agonists, a class of non-hormone growth promoters that have been deemed safe for animals and humans by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both products are fed to cattle prior to slaughter to increase weight by as much as 30 pounds of lean meat. Elanco denied that its supply of Optaflexx is short of the industry’s current demand. The company is “managing the supply over the next two weeks as we assess the long-term market demand,” company spokeswoman Colleen Parr Dekker told Reuters in a statement on Friday. Elanco last week told Reuters that its on-hand supply of Optaflexx was sufficient to handle demand. That assessment was focused on Tyson customers before the withdrawal announcement from Merck, Elanco said on Friday. Elanco declined to comment on how much demand for Optaflexx has increased in recent days. The company does not publicly break out sales figures for the additive. Some new Elanco customers told Reuters they are being put on a waiting list for Optaflexx due to limited supplies. Other new customers are having their orders only partially filled, said Tom Bejot, a feedlot manager in Ainsworth, Nebraska. Existing customers said they are being assured that their needs will continue to be filled by Elanco. “For all their customers who have been using Optaflexx, they’re calling to see how much everybody needs,” said Tom Williams, manager of Chappell Feedlot in Nebraska. Williams said an Elanco representative called his feedlot on Thursday to find out how much Optaflexx its cattle are fed each month. About 70 percent of cattle brought to slaughter in the United States are fed beta-agonists, according to industry estimates. Merck’s Zilmax was the dominant beta-agonist for U.S. cattle feeders, and last week Merck disclosed it had about $159 million in U.S. sales of Zilmax last year. Merck has said no safety issues have been discovered in 30 studies since Zilmax was introduced in the United States in 2007. Tight supplies of Optaflexx could temporarily pinch beef production at some feedlots, said John Nalivka, an expert on livestock and president of Sterling Marketing Inc. However, there should be little impact on the nation’s overall beef supply, he said. “We’re not going to run out of beef,” Nalivka said, adding that feeders can adjust feed rations and take other steps to control meat production. Some cattle feeders who formerly used Zilmax said they are frustrated that they are having trouble immediately ordering an alternative. For many, the drugs have been a way to reduce some of the economic pain caused by high costs for grain fed to cattle. Bejot Feedlots in Nebraska, which feeds Optaflexx to some of its 10,000 cattle, received a call on Thursday from an Elanco sales representative who said supplies of the drug were tightening, Tom Bejot said. According to Bejot, the representative said Bejot would continue to receive Optaflexx but that new customers will not be able to buy all they need. “Guys that are switching don’t get preferential treatment, at least until Elanco catches up,” said John Nelson, vice president of commodities for Producers Livestock Marketing Association ",8232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/livestock-zilmax-lilly/halt-in-zilmax-sales-fuels-demand-for-rival-cattle-feed-product-idUSL2N0GO10U20130823
145,LLY,A new generation fights for civil rights in Florida,"ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - The shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last year shook the foundations of Phillip Agnew’s comfortable life selling erectile dysfunction drugs and anti-depressants. Outraged at police who cited Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” self-defense law as a reason not to arrest neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, Agnew felt compelled to make a stand of his own. The 28-year-old from Miami led the longest sit-in in memory at the Florida Capitol this summer. On Wednesday he will step up to the microphone in Washington to add his voice to those of President Barack Obama, former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and others commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Now a salaried field organizer for the Service Employees International Union, Agnew represents a generation of civil rights activism half a century removed from King’s iconic address. Martin’s killing prompted Agnew and many others to question whether equal justice in the United States was still only a dream. The group he helped start, which calls itself the Dream Defenders, camped for 31 days in the office of Governor Rick Scott to protest Zimmerman’s acquittal in July. “We think the political landscape of America is turning very much in favor of young people now,” Agnew told Reuters. “We want people to come together and talk about the future of Florida.” Many people blamed Zimmerman’s acquittal on the Stand Your Ground law, under which people in fear of their lives no longer must try to retreat before defending themselves with potentially lethal force. As the protest progressed, the Dream Defenders broadened their platform to include other issues, including educational opportunity and drug incarceration rates. The Dream Defenders’ protest surpassed by two weeks the 2011 pro-union sit-in at the Wisconsin Capitol, which was cut off by court order. The group, which has established chapters on six of Florida’s major public college campuses, is positioning itself to play a role in the 2014 midterm elections in a state that will be pivotal in the presidential campaigns that launch soon after. “They planted the seeds for issues and mobilization efforts that clearly are going to be evident in the 2014 election cycle,” said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. Agnew met fellow Dream Defenders founders Gabriel Pendas and Ahmad Abuznaid a decade ago, when he was a student at Florida A&M; University in the state capital, Tallahassee. They got a taste of activism in 2006 while participating in marches and a two-day student-led sit-in at then-Governor Jeb Bush’s office over the death of another black teen, Martin Lee Anderson, at a juvenile boot camp. The Florida legislature subsequently closed all five state camps. As a child of poverty, Agnew said he felt obligated upon graduation to use his business degree to secure a spot for himself in the middle class, and he took a sales job with pharmaceuticals company Eli Lilly & Co. But his experience in the Anderson case kept tugging at his conscience. So within weeks of Martin’s killing, Agnew said he gave up his $52,000 salary ($63,000 with bonuses), rented out his house and reconnected with Pendas, who was working as a union organizer in Miami, and Abuznaid who was vacationing in Amsterdam after passing the Florida bar. Agnew draws a connection between the Dream Defenders and the anti-war and civil rights movements of two generations ago, especially after some of the 1960s leaders such as Jesse Jackson and Julian Bond joined them briefly in the Florida Capitol. Bond agreed. “I think it’s fair to say that, in many, many ways, what happened here over the last several days is very much like what happened across the South in the days when I was a young guy,” he told Reuters as the Dream Defenders were decamping on August 15. Despite ending the sit-in, Agnew said the Dream Defenders had accomplished some of their goals, including getting the speaker of Florida’s House of Representatives to call for a committee hearing next month on the Stand Your Ground law. He said it was fitting that the 50th anniversary of King’s speech was only a few days away. “There are many comparisons to be made between today and yesterday,” he said. “This is the same struggle, the same fight, the same eagerness to do something about it. And we’re lucky to have these spirited young people involved in it.” ",8232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-dream-florida/a-new-generation-fights-for-civil-rights-in-florida-idUSBRE97M0TO20130823

148,LLY,UPDATE 1-Novo could see U.S. sales hurt after losing two contracts,"(Adds dateline, rewrites first paragraph, adds analyst comment, updates shares) By Teis Jensen COPENHAGEN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S has lost two contracts to supply a U.S. pharmacy group with its insulin and diabetes treatments, taking a bite out of expected earnings. The world’s biggest insulin producer said it had lost two contracts with Express Scripts Holding Co - a contract for its diabetes drug Victoza, won by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , and a deal for insulin Novolog, taken by Eli Lilly & Co . A spokesman on Tuesday confirmed the lost business but had no further immediate comment. Express Scripts is a purchasing organisation for a number of prescription programmes serving between 40 and 45 million Americans. “This is a serious blow for Novo Nordisk. I think it will hit earnings per share by closer to 3 percent in 2014,” analyst Soren Hansen at Sydbank said. Shares in Novo Nordisk traded 2.9 percent lower at 934.50 crowns by 1103 GMT on Tuesday against a 0.5 percent fall in the Danish benchmark index OMXC20CAP. The stock fell as low as 926 crowns, its lowest since late July. Hansen said he still expected sales of Victoza to grow but at a lower rate than previously foreseen. Jyske Bank said in a note the loss of the two contracts would impact total sales by 1 percent and operating profit by 1.8 percent in 2014. Analyst Rune Dahl at DNB Markets estimated that the Express Scripts contract for Victoza accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of the company’s Victoza prescription sales in the United States. Novo’s sales of Victoza in North America amounted to 3.56 billion Danish crowns ($629.4 mln) out of a total of 21.35 billion in the second quarter of this year.

149,LLY,Fitch Affirms Eli Lilly's IDR at 'A'; Revises Outlook to Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Eli Lilly & Co. Inc.'s  (Lilly) ratings, including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Rating  Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A full list of ratings follows  at the end of this release.  The ratings apply to approximately $5.3 billion of debt at June 30, 2013.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch believes Lilly will maintain a credit profile supportive of its 'A' rating  despite facing significant operational headwinds during 2014. Fitch's rating  actions are based on the following: --Lilly faces significant patent risk with three of its top drugs, which account  for roughly 30% of total firm sales and are scheduled to lose patent protection  during the next two years.  --Fitch expects LLY will return to top-line growth during 2015-2016 with the  annualizing of patent expiries and continued strength in established and new  products such as Amyvid, Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and  Tradjenta/Jandueto. --Fitch believes Lilly's late-stage pipeline, particularly strong in treatments  for diabetes and cancer, offers the company numerous opportunities to sustain  longer-term growth.  --Fitch anticipates margin compression in 2014 due to Cymbalta's patent expiry.  However Lilly's cost cutting measures should result in a leaner cost structure,  paving the way for margin expansion in 2015-2016 as sales rebound. --Fitch forecasts that Lilly will generate roughly $1.8 billion of FCF (cash  flow from operations minus capital expenditures and dividend payments) in 2013  and approximately $900 million - $1 billion in 2014. --Relatively aggressive share repurchases from now through 2017 are incorporated  in Fitch's forecast. However, cash dividend increases are expected to be modest  and acquisitions targeted. --With leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of 0.76 times (x) for the latest 12-month  (LTM) period ended June 30, 2013, Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt  leverage of 1.1x-1.3x during 2014. --Fitch assumes the company will maintain adequate liquidity during the upcoming  patent cliff, supported by FCF generation, balance sheet cash and availability  on its revolving credit facility. SIGNIFICANT PATENT CLIFF Lilly faces significant patent expiries through 2014. Its largest selling drug,  Cymbalta, loses U.S. patent protection in December 2013 (Europe - August 2014)  and accounts for roughly 24% of totally company sales. Evista loses U.S. market  exclusivity in March 2014 and accounts for approximately 4% of total firm  revenues. In addition, Fitch expects further sales erosion for Zyprexa and  Humalog which U.S. patents expired in 2011 and 2013, respectively. REBOUND WITH PATENT PROTECTED PRODUCTS Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line growth during 2015-2016, achieving  annual sales in excess of $20 billion. The negative effect of near-term patent  expiries on revenues will have effectively annualized in early 2015. Currently  marketed drugs including Amyvid (Alzheimer's diagnosis), Alimta (cancer), Cialis  (erectile dysfunction), Effient (cardiac thrombosis), Erbitux (cancer) and  Tradjenta/Jandueto (diabetes), in aggregate, have decent intermediate-term  growth potential. These drugs, combined, generate roughly $5.2 billion in annual  revenues for Lilly and address large and growing treatment markets. IMPROVING PIPELINE Lilly has improved its growth prospects for the intermediate- to longer term, as  it has been making significant progress in building its late-stage pipeline. The  company currently has four drug candidates in registration to treat diabetes,  gastric cancer and pancreatic insufficiency. In phase III development, Lilly has  a growing number of therapeutics, including three to treat cancer and two to  treat diabetes. In addition, its phase III pipeline contains drugs to treat  lupus, psoriasis, high cholesterol, depression and rheumatoid arthritis. The  company has partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim in its efforts to develop  diabetes medications.  EFFORTS TO SUPPORT MARGINS Fitch expects Lilly to remain focused on controlling costs in order to support  margins while balancing its need to invest in growth. The company faces a number  of operational headwinds, including the anticipated near-term patent expiries.  As such, Lilly has cumulatively taken approximately $620 million out of SG&A;  during the last 18 months (ended June 30, 2013). During the same period, the  company has remained steadfast in funding longer term growth by increasing  research and development spending by roughly $460 million. Nevertheless, Fitch  anticipates materially compressed EBITDA margins (24%-25%) during 2014 and  improvement thereafter. POSITIVE BUT SUBDUED FCF Fitch forecasts positive, but lower FCF of approximately $900 million during  2014, as Lilly contends with the loss of profitable U.S. sales of Cymbalta and  Evista. Expected cash flow from operations of roughly $4.1 billion should be  sufficient to fund $2.2 billion in cash dividends and $900 million in capital  expenditures. Fitch believes FCF will grow from 2014 levels over the long run,  as revenues and margins recover. RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT Fitch incorporates roughly $5 billion in share repurchases from now through  2017-2018, funded with FCF and cash on hand. However, Fitch models only  incremental dividend increases and targeted acquisitions during the same  forecast period, which will not likely stress Lilly's balance sheet. LEVERAGE TO INCREASE IN 2014 Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt leverage of 1.1x-1.3x in 2014 during  the height of the patent expiries. This is a sharp increase  from current  leverage of 0.76x. Fitch recognizes that there is some uncertainty surrounding  its forecasted leverage range for 2014, since the forecast will be influenced by  the level of profitability the company will generate during the period, as well  as the discipline Lilly exercises regarding balance sheet debt. Fitch assumes  Lilly will refinance the $1 billion senior unsecured notes maturing in March  2014. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY Fitch assumes Lilly will maintain adequate liquidity, supported by FCF  generation, balance sheet cash and availability on its revolving credit  facility. At June 30, 2013, the company had approximately $4.7 billion of cash  and short-term investments, full availability on its $1.2 billion credit  facility which matures April 7, 2015 and roughly $6.6 billion in noncurrent  investments. Lilly generated approximately $2.1 billion in FCF during the latest  12-month (LTM) period. At June 30, 2013, Lilly had approximately $5.3 billion in debt outstanding.  Fitch believes the company's debt maturities are manageable with roughly $1  billion maturing in 2014, $200 million in 2016 and $1 billion in 2017. Fitch's  forecast assumes that Lilly will refinance these maturities with new debt  issuances. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision  of the Rating Outlook to Positive include: --Revenues continue to expand for recently launched patent protected products,  including Amyvid, Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and Tradjenta/Jandueto. --The company employs adequate cost controls to generate sufficient  profitability while limiting increases in debt to maintain leverage sustainably  below 1.3x. --Cash is deployed conservatively, with the majority of the planned $5 billion  share repurchase program funded through cash flow as opposed to debt issuance.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Negative  Rating Outlook and/or a one notch downgrade to 'A-'/'F2' include: --Operational stress from, but not limited to, patent expiries drives leverage  durably above 1.7x. --Free cash flow deteriorates without the expectation of a timely trend  reversal. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings on Eli Lilly: --Long-term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'; --Bank loan rating at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at'F1'.  The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative.

The price increase - which the company said will apply to all of Eli Lilly’s products for cattle, hogs and other food animals - comes amid strong demand for its Optaflexx ractopamine-based feed additive for cattle, which helps bulk up the amount of meat on a beef carcass prior to slaughter. The move is part of a review of its agricultural product pricing, market conditions and production costs that Elanco regularly conducts for all products, said company spokeswoman Colleen Parr Dekker. The price increase, though, will not apply to newer non-betagonist products released in 2012 or this year, she said. Sales of Elanco’s cattle feed additive Optaflexx in the United States began surging in late August, after rival Merck & Co. announced its decision to temporarily suspend sales of its Zilmax beta-agonist additive. Merck’s announcement came after meat processor Tyson Foods said it would stop buying Zilmax-fed cattle amid concerns the livestock drug was potentially causing health problems for some cattle. Elanco’s price increase will likely not have much of an impact on meat producers, nor cool demand for the drug-maker’s beta-agonist feed products - particularly among cattle feedlot owners. Retail beef prices remain at record highs, while the nation’s cattle herd is the lowest level in more than 60 years. Elanco “is clearly taking advantage of the lack of competition” for beta-agonists,” said Jim Robb, director of the Livestock Marketing Information Center in Denver, Colorado.

153,LLY,Novartis opens animal health books to Bayer and Lilly: sources,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis is ready to sell its animal health subsidiary and has opened its books to Bayer and other rivals interested in a business that could change hands for more than 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Germany’s Bayer is seeking to bolster its position as a diversified life sciences company while Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez and Chairman Joerg Reinhardt have said they are considering options for non-core assets that lack the scale to become world leaders. Suitors including Bayer, Eli Lilly of the United States and Germany’s unlisted Boehringer are conducting due diligence assessments of the business, the financial sources said. Bayer is interested in expanding its animal health business, CEO Marijn Dekkers told Reuters at a pharmaceuticals conference in London on Tuesday, though he declined to comment on whether it was looking at the Novartis assets. Eli Lilly was not immediately available for comment outside business hours. Novartis and Boehringer declined to comment. Combining Bayer’s veterinary drug sales of about $1.7 billion with Novartis’ $1.1 billion would lift the German company from fifth place to third or fourth in the global animal health market, where former Pfizer subsidiary Zoetis leads the way. Eli Lilly’s veterinary drugs business had $2 billion in sales last year, making it the No.4 player, while Boehringer was sixth with $1.3 billion in sales. Merck & Co and Sanofi sit at No.2 and No.3 respectively, with sales of $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion. The sector is expected to grow faster than the global economy as ageing western societies spend more money on pets while livestock farming increases in emerging markets, where appetite for meat rises with average household incomes. The potential sale of Novartis’s animal health business would be part of a continuing review of group operations, which last month resulted in the sale of its blood transfusion testing unit to Spain’s Grifols for $1.68 billion. The sources said that Novartis has hired Goldman Sachs to assist it in the review. Goldman declined to comment.

154,LLY,Lilly depression drug fails late-stage trials,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said on Thursday it would not seek approval for edivoxetine, its experimental drug to treat major depression, after it failed to meet its primary goal in three late-stage trials. Edivoxetine, a member of a family of medicines called norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, was tested in combination with a member of a widely used class of depression treatments known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in each of the three trials. After eight weeks of treatment, the combination of drugs that included edivoxetine did not prove superior to the SSRIs alone, thereby failing the main goal of the studies. The three trials enrolled patients with major depression who had achieved only a partial response to treatments with SSRIs, which include generic forms of Lilly’s own Prozac (fluoxetine), Pfizer Inc’s Zoloft (sertraline) and GlaxoSmithKline’s Paxil (paroxetine). “The lack of efficacy compared to SSRI alone in three separate clinical trials means that Lilly will not proceed with development of edivoxetine as an add-on treatment for depression,” David Ricks, president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, said in a release. The setback comes as the Indianapolis drug maker badly needs new medicines to offset plunging sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment which faces cheaper generics, and looming patent expirations on its Cymbalta depression medicine and Evista osteoporosis treatment. Industry analysts had been hoping edivoxetine, which is a derivative of Lilly’s Strattera drug for attention deficit disorder, would garner annual sales in the $200 million range by 2016, if approved, and grow from there. But the depression drug has not been considered nearly as important, or potentially lucrative, as other experimental drugs being developed by Lilly, including treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. Derica Rice, Lilly’s chief financial officer, said despite edivoxetine’s failure the company remains on track to return to revenue growth and see improved profit margins in 2015 and beyond, after other drugs are introduced beginning next year to help bolster sales.

157,LLY,UPDATE 2-Merck moves Alzheimer's drug into big trials after safety review,"By Ransdell Pierson Dec 10 (Reuters) - Merck & Co said it will begin two late-stage trials of its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, one of the industry’s best hopes for slowing the memory-robbing disease, after an independent monitoring board reviewed its safety and recommended that more patients be recruited for studies. The data monitoring committee gave its blessing to a Phase III trial involving up to 1,960 patients after examining interim safety data from a mid-stage trial of 200 patients who had been treated with the medicine, called MK-8931, for at least three months. The planned new study, called EPOCH, is expected to conclude in mid-2017, Merck said on Tuesday. The medicine works by blocking an enzyme called beta secretase that is involved in production of beta-amyloid, a protein that creates brain plaques considered a major cause of the progressive disease. Such medicines are known as BACE inhibitors. “There’s good reason to hope that a BACE inhibitor might help patients, and ours is the first to get the go-ahead for Phase III” trials, Darryle Schoepp, head of neuroscience at Merck, said in an interview. Merck will also begin a separate Phase III trial of the drug, involving 1,500 patients, in “prodromal” patients who do not yet have dementia. That study, called APECS, will enroll patients with mild cognitive problems and potential biomarkers for Alzheimer’s, such as elevated levels of beta amyloid in the brain and of beta amyloid and the protein tau in spinal fluid. They will be treated for two years. The trial is predicated on the theory that early intervention may be crucial, and that once dementia develops it may be too late to seriously arrest Alzheimer’s disease. “The prodromal trial is exciting because it may teach us whether we can prevent or slow down the onset of dementia,” Schoepp said. An estimated 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, the most common cause of dementia. More than 38 million people worldwide are believed to have dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, and those numbers are expected to rise as more people live longer. Unlike heart disease and cancer, no major advancements have been seen in Alzheimer’s drug research since the first treatment was approved in 1993 by U.S. regulators. Current Alzheimer’s drugs, including Namenda from Forest Laboratories Inc and generic forms of Pfizer Inc’s  Aricept (donepezil), can minimally and briefly help memory and ability to perform daily functions, but do not slow the disease. Oral drugs to block beta secretase have taken center stage after an injectable class of medicines, meant to remove beta amyloid plaque after it has already formed, failed or fell short last year in trials conducted by Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co. Safety of the new drugs became a major concern in June, when Lilly pulled the plug on its own BACE inhibitor due to liver toxicity. Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Roche Holding AG  and Eisai Co Ltd are still in the race. Although data from Merck’s mid-stage trial of MK-8931 remains blinded, or secret, the data monitoring committee was allowed to examine the data for hints of safety issues. Its green light could help ease safety concerns over the emerging new class of medicines. The Merck drug in earlier trials cut production of a-beta peptide, the building block of beta amyloid plaque, by 79 percent, Schoepp said. “You’re turning off the faucet, shutting at its source the pathway that forms a-beta peptide,” said Schoepp. The toxic peptides clump together to form beta amyloid plaques in the brain that are a hallmark of the disease. J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott said expectations remained “low” for BACE inhibitors following the termination of Lilly’s product. But he said Merck’s drug could generate annual sales of more than $5 billion if it succeeds in trials and is approved. Merck shares slipped 0.4 percent to $49.35 in afternoon  trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid moderate declines for the drug sector.",12102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-alzheimers/update-2-merck-moves-alzheimers-drug-into-big-trials-after-safety-review-idUSL1N0JP0T820131210

160,LLY,New U.S. FDA rules aim to cut antibiotic use in farm animals,"(Reuters) - In a bid to stem a surge in human resistance to certain antibiotics, U.S. regulators announced new guidelines to phase out their use as a growth enhancer in livestock. The Food and Drug Administration said the antibiotics could still be used to treat illnesses in animals raised for meat, but should otherwise be pared back over the next three years under a voluntary program to keep them out of the human food supply. Although voluntary, the agency said it expects drugmakers to fully adhere to the new guidelines and on Wednesday announced that two of these biggest purveyors of those antibiotics had already agreed to narrow their use. Doctors and hospitals have become increasingly worried in recent years by new strains of bacteria that cannot be controlled by a wide range of current antibiotics. Part of the suspected reason for the emergence of these “superbugs” is that people who have eaten meat that contained antibiotics develop resistance to the drugs as bacteria mutate to thwart them. “Because antimicrobial drug use in both humans and animals can contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, it is important to use these drugs only when medically necessary,” the FDA said in a release. In guidance issued on Wednesday, the FDA asked global drugmakers and animal health companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Zoetis to revise labels of medically important antibiotics by removing references to use in animal production. Once companies remove farm production uses of their antibiotics from drug labels, it would become illegal for those drugs to be used for those purposes, Deputy FDA Commissioner Michael Taylor said in a conference call with journalists. The agency said about 25 animal health companies could be affected by the guidelines, especially Lilly and Zoetis. Although the program is meant to be voluntary, Taylor said the FDA would be able to take regulatory action against companies that fail to comply. The FDA’s “final guidance,” also brings the drugs under oversight of veterinarians by changing the over-the-counter status of the products. The FDA said it will require animal pharmaceutical companies to notify the agency within three months of their intent to adopt its strategy. The companies would then have three years to complete the transition process. Critics on Wednesday said the guidelines give drugmakers too much discretion in policing their own use of antibiotics. Democratic lawmaker Louise Slaughter called the FDA move an inadequate response to the overuse of antibiotics “with no mechanism for enforcement and no metric for success.” Her view was echoed by consumer and environmental advocacy groups. “Our fear ... is that there will be no reduction in antibiotic use as companies will either ignore the plan altogether or simply switch from using antibiotics for routine growth promotion to using the same antibiotics for routine disease prevention,” said Steven Roach, senior analyst with advocacy group Keep Antibiotics Working. Morningstar analyst David Krempa said the FDA issued similar voluntary guidelines in April 2012, meant to limit use of important antibiotics in food-producing animals, but they appear to have been largely ignored by farmers. He said compliance with the FDA’s latest set of voluntary guidelines could be equally spotty. “Compliance will be tough because all the farmers and meat producers know these products increase the size of their animals,” Krempa said. “They can continue to use them, and just say there’s a disease going through their herds.” But even if antibiotics use in livestock indeed comes down, Krempa said it would be only a “small negative” for Zoetis because it, like other animal health companies, sells such a wide range of products for both livestock and pets. The FDA said it had already received support for the new measures from Zoetis and Elanco, a unit of Eli Lilly, which sell a large percentage of the products that will eventually be phased out. Elanco said in a statement that it would voluntarily narrow use of antibiotics used to treat both humans and animals “only to therapeutic purposes of treating, controlling and preventing diseases in animals under the supervision of a veterinarian.” Other companies with animal health businesses include Merck & Co, Novartis AG, Sanofi and Bayer AG. Bayer and Sanofi said the FDA strategy would not affect the types of products they sell, but both companies said they support the FDA’s position. “It is important that these medically important antibiotics are used responsibly and with veterinary oversight,” a Bayer spokeswoman said.

164,LLY,Lilly sees 2014 profit decline in line with estimates,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) on Tuesday forecast its profit will fall by up to one-third this year, as cheaper generic forms of its Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment and Cymbalta depression drug hurt results, but the outlook was in line with expectations. The U.S. drugmaker said it expects earnings, excluding special items, at $2.77 to $2.85 per share in 2014. Analysts, on average, estimated $2.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Indianapolis-based company, whose shares were little changed in late-morning trading, forecast revenue this year between $19.2 billion and $19.8 billion, also in line with analysts’ expectations. Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said 2014 will be the “trough year” in Lilly’s painful three-year patent cliff, which began in October 2011, when it lost U.S. patent protection for Zyprexa, then its biggest product. Despite lingering skepticism among many investors about Lilly’s prospects, Purkiss said he expects company revenue to bounce back strongly in 2015, and for the company to have mid-teens percentage growth in earnings from 2014 to 2017. “The company with the poorest growth over the last couple of years will be right at the top of its large-cap peers globally,” Purkiss predicted. “It will be a top-line recovery, driven by good growth from existing products and sales of newly approved medicines.” In the meantime, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said Lilly’s expected gross profit margin this year - 74 percent - is well below the 79 percent to 80 percent range that Wall Street expected for 2013, and reflects bigger-than-expected declines for Cymbalta. Lilly said the weaker margin will be offset by a $800 million drop in research spending. Zyprexa, which had annual sales of more than $5 billion at its peak, now brings in only $1 billion. Rising prices of Cymbalta have helped cushion Zyprexa’s decline, but sales of the $5 billion-a-year antidepressant are expected to plunge following the loss of its own patent protection last month. The company’s pain will intensify in March, when Lilly’s Evista osteoporosis drug, with annual sales of $1 billion, goes up against generics. Early last year Lilly had projected revenue of $20 billion for 2014, but in October it said it would be hard-pressed to reach that goal because of the devaluation of the yen and slower growth in emerging markets. The drugmaker said on Tuesday it expects to achieve its goals for net income of $3 billion and operating cash flow of $4 billion in 2014, and plans to maintain its dividend at the current level. The company, which reports fourth quarter and 2013 results on January 30, said its 2013 financial expectations also remained unchanged. Lilly’s seemingly unending patent cliff has soured many investors and hurt its stock. Company shares rose only 3 percent in 2013, woefully underperforming a 27 percent jump in the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers .DRG. But other investors have been attracted by the company’s generous dividend, with its 3.8 percent yield, and hopes of a rebound for its respected research laboratories. “Investors are largely focused on the company’s (drug) pipeline and less on the near term,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark. He maintained a “hold” rating on Lilly, saying its stock appeared to be “appropriately valued.” Shares dipped 0.2 percent to $51.45 in late-morning trade. One of the company’s biggest hopes is an experimental drug called ramucirumab. When used by itself, the drug prolonged survival of patients with stomach cancer in late-stage trials. Some analysts believe annual sales could top $1.5 billion by 2020 if it is approved for the hard-to-treat condition, and for other forms of cancer, including of the lung, liver and colon. U.S. regulators have assigned a priority review to ramucirumab and could decide by the second quarter of 2014 whether to approve it. In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Lilly Chief Executive John Lechleiter said diabetes drugs will remain a company mainstay and be an “entree” into emerging markets. He said two experimental Lilly diabetes drugs now in late-stage trials, an injectable medicine called dulaglutide and a basal insulin, offer potential advantages over the competition. (Refiled to correct final paragraph to show product is basal insulin, not an insulin glargine similar to Lantus.)

The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, was triggered by notification from Lilly last month that it applied with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking permission to sell a generic version of Lantus, known chemically as insulin glargine. Lilly, in its submission, challenged the validity of several patents on Lantus held by Sanofi. Lantus is the world’s most prescribed insulin product, with annual worldwide sales of about $7 billion. Indianapolis-based Lilly had said it will not launch its generic product before the February 2015 expiration of Sanofi’s patent on the active ingredient in Lantus. But the patent infringement lawsuit triggers an automatic 30-month stay of a generic approval by the FDA, which would keep Lilly’s generic off the market until mid-2016. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, in a recent research note, said a 30-month delay would raise Sanofi’s earnings per share from 2015 through 2020 by about 6 percent and lower Lilly’s EPS for the period by about 2 percent. A delay in the launch of a generic by Eli Lilly would also give Sanofi more time to switch patients to a new long-acting follow-up product known as U300 once it gains approval before cheap competition for Lantus hits the market.

167,LLY,Sanofi sues Lilly over challenge to top diabetes drug Lantus,"NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi sued Eli Lilly and Co for alleged patent infringements concerning its top-selling Lantus diabetes treatment, delaying the U.S. company’s plans to produce its own version of the drug. Lantus is the world’s most prescribed insulin product, with annual worldwide sales of about $7 billion. It is set to lose patent protection in the United States, the world’s largest pharmaceutical market, in February 2015. Sanofi’s lawsuit, filed on Thursday, triggers an automatic 30-month stay of approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, keeping Lilly’s biosimilar drug off the U.S. market until mid-2016, more than a year later than its previously expected launch date. Sanofi’s shares were higher in earlier trading, but ended down 0.8 percent at 72.80 euros. Shares in Denmark’s Novo Nordisk, whose own rival to Lantus, called Levemir, accounts for 15 percent of its sales, rose 3.64 percent to 219 Danish crowns. “Any delay provides Sanofi and Novo increased pricing power in the $6 billion U.S. basal insulin market,” Citigroup analysts wrote. Deutsche Bank analysts said the move also raised the possibility of a further, multiyear extension of exclusivity for Lantus if, in the end, the court found that Sanofi’s patents had indeed been infringed. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, comes a month after Eli Lilly applied to the FDA for permission to sell a biosimilar version of Lantus, known chemically as insulin glargine. Indianapolis-based Lilly, in its FDA submission, challenged the validity of several patents on Lantus. But it also said it would not launch its product before Sanofi’s patent on the active ingredient in Lantus expires in February 2015. But Sanofi hit back in its lawsuit on Thursday, alleging that Lilly had infringed on four of its patents. Lilly responded to the lawsuit on Friday, denying any patent infringement. “Lilly respects the intellectual property of others and does not believe the application for approval of its new insulin glargine product infringes any valid claim of the asserted patents,” Lilly’s general patent counsel Doug Norman said in a statement. Eli Lilly shares were up 21 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $53.48 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Lantus accounts for close to a fifth of Sanofi’s total sales and over a third of its operating profit. Analysts estimate U.S. sales of the drug grew by 22 percent in 2013 to 3.8 billion euros ($5.15 billion). Sanofi, which publishes full-year results next Thursday, is striving to return to growth after a difficult 2013 that featured problems in Brazil and several product setbacks. Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher told Reuters last month he was confident its diabetes business could grow beyond 2015. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note that the 30-month delay would raise Sanofi’s earnings per share from 2015 through 2020 by about 6 percent and reduce Lilly’s EPS for the period by about 2 percent. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum forecast annual sales of about $1 billion by 2020 for a Lantus biosimilar, half of which would go to Lilly’s partner Boehringer Ingelheim. “In the worst case scenario, Sanofi blocks Lilly completely and the FDA never approves the drug, effectively removing all sales,” he wrote in a note. The delayed launch of Lilly’s biosimilar drug will also give Sanofi more time, before cheap competition for Lantus hits the market, to switch patients to a new long-acting follow-up product known as U300, which could get FDA approval in 2015. “Time is important in any switching strategy, so any delay would be supportive to the franchise’s long-term growth,” Jefferies analysts wrote.

169,LLY,Fitch Rates Eli Lilly's $1B Notes Issuance 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Eli  Lilly & Co. Inc.'s (Lilly) $1 billion senior unsecured notes issuance. A full  list of ratings is shown at the end of this release.  Lilly issued $600 million of 1.95% notes due in 2019 and $400 million of 4.65%  notes due in 2044. The net proceeds of the issuance will be used to  repay/refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes.  The ratings apply to approximately $5.2 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2013.  Lilly's short-term debt, including the current portion of its long-term debt, is  roughly $1 billion.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch believes Lilly will maintain a credit profile supportive of its 'A' rating  despite facing significant operational headwinds during 2014. Fitch's rating  actions are based on the following: --Lilly faces significant patent risk with three of its top drugs, which account  for roughly 30% of total firm sales and are scheduled to lose patent protection  during the next two years.  --Fitch expects LLY will return to top-line growth during 2015-2016 with the  annualizing of patent expiries and continued strength in established and new  products such as Amyvid, Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and  Tradjenta/Jandueto. --Fitch believes Lilly's late-stage pipeline, particularly strong in treatments  for diabetes and cancer, offers the company numerous opportunities to sustain  longer-term growth.  --Fitch anticipates margin compression in 2014 due to Cymbalta's patent expiry.  However Lilly's cost cutting measures should result in a leaner cost structure,  paving the way for margin expansion in 2015-2016 as sales rebound. --Fitch forecasts that Lilly will generate approximately $600 million-$800  million of free cash flow (FCF; cash flow from operations minus capital  expenditures and dividend payments) in 2014. --Relatively aggressive share repurchases from now through 2017 are incorporated  in Fitch's forecast. However, cash dividend increases are expected to be modest  and acquisitions targeted. --With leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of 0.74x for the latest 12-month (LTM)  period ended Dec. 31, 2013, Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt leverage  of 1.1x-1.3x during 2014. --Fitch assumes the company will maintain adequate liquidity during the upcoming  patent cliff, supported by FCF generation, balance sheet cash, and availability  on its revolving credit facility. SIGNIFICANT PATENT CLIFF Lilly faces significant patent expiries through 2014. Its largest selling drug,  Cymbalta, lost U.S. patent protection in December 2013 and will lose patent  protection in Europe in August 2014. Cymbalta accounts for roughly 24% of total  company sales. Evista loses U.S. market exclusivity in March 2014 and accounts  for approximately 4% of total firm revenues.  REBOUND WITH PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line growth during 2015-2016, achieving  annual sales in excess of $20 billion. The negative effect of near-term patent  expiries on revenues will have effectively annualized in early 2015. Currently  marketed drugs including Amyvid (Alzheimer's diagnosis), Alimta (cancer), Cialis  (erectile dysfunction), Effient (cardiac thrombosis), Erbitux (cancer) and  Tradjenta/Jandueto (diabetes), in aggregate, have decent intermediate-term  growth potential. These drugs, combined, generate roughly $5.2 billion in annual  revenues for Lilly and address large and growing treatment markets. IMPROVING PIPELINE Lilly has improved its growth prospects for the intermediate- to longer-term, as  it has been making significant progress in building its late-stage pipeline.   The company currently has four drug candidates in registration to treat diabetes  and gastric cancer (and possibly lung cancer). In phase III development, Lilly  has a growing number of therapeutics, including three to treat cancer and two to  treat diabetes. In addition, its phase III pipeline contains drugs to treat  lupus, psoriasis, high cholesterol, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis. The  company has partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim in its efforts to develop  diabetes medications.  EFFORTS TO SUPPORT MARGINS Fitch expects Lilly to remain focused on controlling costs in order to support  margins while balancing its need to invest in growth. The company faces a number  of operational headwinds, including the anticipated near-term patent expiries.  As such, Lilly has cumulatively taken approximately $391 million out of SG&A;  during the last 12 months (ended Dec. 31, 2013). During the same period, the  company has remained steadfast in funding longer term growth by increasing  research and development spending by roughly $310 million. Nevertheless, Fitch  anticipates materially compressed EBITDA margins (24%-25%) during 2014 and  improvement thereafter. POSITIVE BUT SUBDUED FCF Fitch forecasts positive but lower FCF of approximately $900 million during  2014, as Lilly contends with the loss of profitable U.S. sales of Cymbalta and  Evista. Expected cash flow from operations of roughly $4.1 billion should be  sufficient to fund $2.2 billion in cash dividends and $1.3 billion in capital  expenditures. Fitch believes FCF will grow from 2014 levels over the long run,  as revenues and margins recover. RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT Fitch incorporates roughly $5 billion in share repurchases from now through  2017-2018, funded with FCF and cash on hand.  However, Fitch models only  incremental dividend increases and targeted acquisitions during the same  forecast period, which will not likely stress Lilly's balance sheet. LEVERAGE TO INCREASE IN 2014 Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt leverage of 1.1x-1.3x in 2014 during  the height of the patent expiries. This is a sharp increase from current  leverage of 0.74x. Fitch recognizes that there is some uncertainty surrounding  its forecasted leverage range for 2014, since the forecast will be influenced by  the level of profitability the company will generate during the period, as well  as the discipline Lilly exercises regarding balance sheet debt. Fitch assumes  Lilly will refinance the $1 billion senior unsecured notes maturing in March  2014. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY Fitch assumes Lilly will maintain adequate liquidity, supported by FCF  generation, balance sheet cash and availability on its revolving credit  facility. At Dec. 31, 2013, the company had approximately $5.4 billion of cash  and short-term investments, full availability on its $1.2 billion credit  facility which matures April 7, 2015, and roughly $7.6 billion in noncurrent  investments. Lilly generated approximately $2.5 billion in FCF during the LTM  period. At Dec. 31, 2013, Lilly had approximately $5.2 billion in debt outstanding.  Fitch believes the company's debt maturities are manageable with roughly $1  billion maturing in 2014, $200 million in 2016, and $1 billion in 2017. Fitch's  forecast assumes that Lilly will refinance these maturities with new debt  issuances, as evidenced by its recent notes issuance. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision  of the Rating Outlook to Positive include: --Revenues continue to expand for recently launched patent protected products,  including Amyvid, Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and Tradjenta/Jandueto; --The company employs adequate cost controls to generate sufficient  profitability while limiting increases in debt to maintain leverage sustainably  below 1.3x; --Cash is deployed conservatively, with the majority of the planned $5 billion  share repurchase program funded through cash flow as opposed to debt issuance.   Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Negative  Rating Outlook and/or a one-notch downgrade to 'A-'/'F2' include: --Operational stress from, but not limited to, patent expiries drives leverage  durably above 1.7x; --FCF deteriorates without the expectation of a timely trend reversal. Fitch currently rates Eli Lilly as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'; --Bank loan rating at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

171,LLY,Lilly weekly diabetes drug as effective as market leader Victoza-study,"(Reuters) - An experimental once-weekly medicine for type 2 diabetes developed by Eli Lilly and Co proved as effective in lowering blood sugar as Victoza from Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk in an eagerly anticipated late stage study. The Lilly drug, dulaglutide, achieved the primary goal of the 599-patient study by demonstrating so-called non-inferiority to the highest approved dose of Victoza after 26 weeks, according to initial results released by the company on Tuesday. Lilly shares rose more than 1 percent before retreating. Dulaglutide, considered one of the more important medicines in Lilly’s pipeline of drugs in development, is awaiting U.S. and European approval decisions. “It is our hope that we will have approval this year,” Lilly’s Senior Medical Director Sherry Martin said in a telephone interview. Once weekly dulaglutide and Victoza, which is taken daily and known chemically as liraglutide, belong to a class of injected diabetes drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists. They work by increasing the release of insulin after meals and by slowing absorption of food in the gastrointestinal tract. “Dulaglutide is the only GLP-1 agonist to show non-inferiority against liraglutide’s highest-approved dose in a Phase III trial,” Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly Diabetes, said in a statement. BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei noted that the other weekly diabetes drug from the class did not fare as well in a similar study. “The positive surprise here is that so far dulaglutide had shown a similar clinical profile to competitor Bydureon in terms of A1C (blood glucose) lowering and Bydureon failed to show non-inferiority versus Victoza,” he said, referring to AstraZeneca’s weekly diabetes treatment from the same class. John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, raised his sales forecast for dulaglutide to $1.6 billion by 2020 from $1.1 billion following the non-inferiority result. He believes Lilly will be able to undercut Novo’s Victoza pricing with payors since the study used a lower dose - 1.5 milligrams versus 1.8mg for Victoza - and that the weekly dosing will give it an additional competitive advantage. “Those are two powerful tools,” said Boris, who sees the GLP-1 market growing to $5 billion by 2020. Victoza, which now owns about 70 percent of the market for GLP-1 drugs, had sales of more than $590 million in the fourth quarter, putting it on track to exceed $2 billion this year. Dulaglutide in previous studies proved superior in reducing blood sugar compared with placebo and a variety of other diabetes treatments. But analysts had been especially anxious to see how it would fare against future main rival Victoza. Patients in the Award-6 trial were already taking metformin, the most commonly prescribed initial treatment for type 2 diabetes. Details of the study, such as the exact magnitude of glucose reduction, the percentage of patients who reached blood sugar target levels and amount of weight loss seen with each drug, will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Side effects were similar for patients in both treatment groups, with the most frequently reported adverse events gastrointestinal-related, such as nausea, the company said. “There are no new safety signals,” Martin said. The potential market for type 2 diabetes drugs is enormous and growing. An estimated 382 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation, with type 2, which is often associated with obesity, accounting for 90 percent to 95 percent of all cases.

BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei noted that the other weekly diabetes drug from the class did not fare as well in a similar study. “The positive surprise here is that so far dulaglutide had shown a similar clinical profile to competitor Bydureon in terms of A1C (blood glucose) lowering and Bydureon failed to show non-inferiority versus Victoza,” he said, referring to AstraZeneca’s weekly diabetes treatment from the same class. John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, raised his sales forecast for dulaglutide to $1.6 billion by 2020 from $1.1 billion following the non-inferiority result. He believes Lilly will be able to undercut Novo’s Victoza pricing with payors since the study used a lower dose - 1.5 milligrams versus 1.8mg for Victoza - and that the weekly dosing will give it an additional competitive advantage. “Those are two powerful tools,” said Boris, who sees the GLP-1 market growing to $5 billion by 2020. Victoza, which now owns about 70 percent of the market for GLP-1 drugs, had sales of more than $590 million in the fourth quarter, putting it on track to exceed $2 billion this year. Dulaglutide in previous studies proved superior in reducing blood sugar compared with placebo and a variety of other diabetes treatments. But analysts had been especially anxious to see how it would fare against future main rival Victoza. Patients in the Award-6 trial were already taking metformin, the most commonly prescribed initial treatment for type 2 diabetes. Details of the study, such as the exact magnitude of glucose reduction, the percentage of patients who reached blood sugar target levels and amount of weight loss seen with each drug, will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Side effects were similar for patients in both treatment groups, with the most frequently reported adverse events gastrointestinal-related, such as nausea, the company said. “There are no new safety signals,” Martin said.

173,LLY,Lilly weekly diabetes drug succeeds vs market leader Victoza -study,"Feb 25 (Reuters) - An experimental once-weekly medicine for type 2 diabetes developed by Eli Lilly and Co proved as effective in lowering blood sugar as Victoza from Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk in an eagerly anticipated late stage study. The Lilly drug, dulaglutide, achieved the primary goal of the 599-patient study by demonstrating so-called non-inferiority to the highest approved dose of Victoza after 26 weeks, according to initial results released by the company on Tuesday. Dulaglutide, considered one of the more important medicines in Lilly’s pipeline of drugs in development, is awaiting U.S. and European approval decisions. “It is our hope that we will have approval this year,” Lilly’s Senior Medical Director Sherry Martin said in a telephone interview. Once weekly dulaglutide and Victoza, which is taken daily and known chemically as liraglutide, belong to a class of injected diabetes drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Prior to Tuesday’s announcement of the study’s top line results, Cowen and Co estimated dulaglutide sales would reach $700 million in 2020. However, results of the study, dubbed Award-6, could give future sales of the Lilly medicine a boost. “Dulaglutide is the only GLP-1 agonist to show non-inferiority against liraglutide’s highest-approved dose in a Phase III trial,” Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly Diabetes, said in a statement.

178,LLY,UPDATE 4-Japan drugmaker Takeda to fight $6 bln damages awarded by U.S. jury,"* Louisiana jury orders $6 bln damages from Takeda, $3 bln from Eli Lilly * Award unlikely to stand after Takeda and Eli Lilly challenges * Takeda shares mark biggest one-day loss in five years   (Adds legal expert commentary, background) By Daniel Levine and Edmund Klamann SAN FRANCISCO/TOKYO, April 8 (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said it would contest $6 billion in punitive damages imposed by a jury in the United States in a case that accused Japan’s largest drugmaker of concealing cancer risks associated with its Actos diabetes drug. Eli Lilly and Co, Takeda’s co-defendant in the case, was ordered to pay $3 billion in punitive damages by the jury in Louisiana on Monday. It also awarded $1.475 million in compensatory damages. Legal experts said it was unlikely that such a large award would stand after challenges in court by both companies. Eli Lilly and Takeda have said they would dispute the verdict, which could include appeals to a higher court or filing motions asking the trial judge to set aside or reduce the verdict. “Although there’s no mathematical bright line” to determine how high is too high when it comes to punitive damage awards, federal appeals courts generally scrutinize the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, preferring those that fall into the single-digit range, according to Professor Catherine Sharkey, a tort law expert at New York University School of Law. Punitive damages are meant to discourage companies from bad conduct. Compensatory damages are meant to pay victims for their actual losses. With a ratio of more than 6,100 to 1 of punitive to compensatory damages, the Actos award could be highly vulnerable. “It’s definitely the case that the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled to lower courts that they should be restraining very large punitive awards,” Sharkey added. Lilly, which co-promoted Actos from 1999 to 2006, said in a press release it will be indemnified by Takeda for its losses and expenses around the litigation based on the terms of its agreement with Takeda. Takeda’s shares fell as much as 8.8 percent to an eight-month low in Tokyo trading on Tuesday after the verdict. The stock ended 5.2 percent lower at 4,572 yen. Lilly shares fell 0.2 percent, or 12 cents per share, to $58.50 per share in New York Stock Exchange trading. The massive award was met with “stunned silence” in the  Lafayette, Louisiana, courtroom, plaintiffs’ lawyer Mark Lanier said. Lanier acknowledged it was not certain whether the damages award would be sustained. “Nobody has gone out and bought a new home,” Lanier said. “This is a conservative judge and a conservative court and she’s very ‘balls and strikes.’ We’re not under any grand illusion.” The $9 billion in punitive damages awarded by the jury against Takeda and Eli Lilly exceed the $5 billion penalty that a jury in Alaska imposed on Exxon Mobil Corp for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the previous Exxon Valdez award had been “excessive.” The company was ultimately ordered to pay $500 million. That and other rulings have been read as limiting punitive damages in federal cases. Lanier said the jury deliberated for only an hour and 10 minutes to deliver its verdict finding liability on all 14 questions, and 45 minutes longer to come out with the multibillion-dollar punitive damages. The allocation of liability for compensatory damages was  75 percent for Takeda and 25 percent for Lilly, according to Lilly. Takeda said judgements were entered in Takeda’s favor in all three previous Actos trials, while this was the first federal case to be tried in a consolidated multidistrict litigation comprising more than 2,900 lawsuits. Last May, a U.S. judge had nullified a separate jury verdict for $6.5 million against Takeda after ruling that the plaintiffs failed to offer any reliable evidence that Actos had caused cancer. Germany and France suspended use of the drug, a multibillion-dollar seller, in 2011 because of concerns about a possible link to cancer.

The benchmark S&P; index was holding above its 50-day moving average around 1,840, a support level which could trigger more declines if convincingly broken. The index has managed to stay above the 1,840 level several times over the past month. On Monday, the S&P; 500 suffered its biggest three-day drop in two months and the Nasdaq posted its worst three-day decline since November 2011 as investors bid down Internet stocks and rotated into defensive names. Biotech stocks, among the momentum names that have slumped in recent weeks, fell again on Tuesday, with Gilead Sciences Inc , down 2.4 percent to $70.49 and Biogen Idec Inc , down 1.8 percent to $288.81 among the biggest drags on the S&P; 500. The Nasdaq biotech index lost 1.2 percent. “What happened over the past couple of the days is we had this rotation out of the darling stocks into more conservative issues, which is a good sign. It’s a healthy move seeing this rotation into more defensive and conservative issues,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “Up until now we saw the rotation process take us down and as earnings come out we could enter into more of a corrective stage, but nothing too serious.” Earnings season gets under way this week, with results due from companies including Alcoa Inc after the close, retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond on Wednesday, while financials JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co  close out the week with results on Friday. S&P; 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. A lackluster first-quarter earnings season hurt by a harsh winter could spark a pullback, some analysts said, with investors expressing optimism for the second quarter as weather improves. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 13.39 points or 0.08 percent, to 16,232.48, the S&P; 500 gained 0.82 points or 0.04 percent, to 1,845.86 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.108 points or 0.32 percent, to 4,092.861.

184,LLY,Novartis and GSK trade assets as pharma industry reshapes,"ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets on Tuesday to bolster their best businesses and exit weaker ones as the drug industry contends with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition. The deals, which include Novartis’ purchase of GSK’s cancer drugs and GSK’s acquisition of Novartis’ vaccines business, came just after a newspaper report that AstraZeneca Plc had turned down a $101 billion bid approach from Pfizer Inc, a story that sent shares up across the sector. In addition, Novartis is selling its animal health arm to Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly for about $5.4 billion in cash. That would make Lilly’s Elanco unit the world’s second-largest animal health business when that deal closes early next year. A flurry of dealmaking has overtaken the global pharmaceutical industry recently as most large companies try to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers seek greater scale. Deal values have almost doubled since the start of 2014 to $77.9 billion from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. The overhaul at Novartis marks the end of a yearlong review of its sprawling portfolio after the departure of longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Vasella, the architect of the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that led to the company’s formation in 1996. The Swiss drugmaker said it would buy London-based GSK’s oncology products for $14.5 billion plus another $1.5 billion that depends on the results of a trial in melanoma. The deal will strengthen Novartis’s world No. 2 position in cancer behind crosstown rival Roche Holding AG. Novartis said GSK was buying its vaccines, excluding flu, for $5.25 billion plus potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion and ongoing royalties. The companies also will form a joint venture in consumer healthcare. The transactions, and their hint of more deals ahead for the drug sector, lifted the ARCA Pharmaceutials Index 1.8 percent. Lilly’s Elanco animal health unit will acquire about 600 animal health brands from Novartis, including vaccines and anti-parasite medicines that will allow it to enter the acquaculture, or fish farming, market. This would be the eighth and largest acquisition since 2007 for Elanco, which by global sales would trail only Zoetis Inc, which also specializes in products for farm animals and pets. “With this transaction, we’ll go from being No. 5 to No. 3 on the pet side globally and become a top 2 or 3 player in every segment” of products for farm animals, Jeff Simmons, Lilly’s head of animal health, said in an interview. Last year Elanco had sales of $2.15 billion, compared with $1.1 billion for Novartis Animal Health. “Novartis has agreed (to) an elegant set of transactions that either removes or strengthens its underperforming assets, while boosting its oncology portfolio,” Jefferies analysts said. In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, Novartis shares were up 1.4 percent at $86.63, while GSK rose 4.2 percent to $55.34. Lilly dipped 0.9 percent to $60.32. Novartis CEO Joe Jimenez said the revamp would help make the company “fighting fit” to meet the challenges of the global healthcare industry over the next 10 years. He told reporters the deals would lower overall sales by about $4 billion but result in higher profits as the company swaps lower-margin vaccines for higher-margin oncology drugs. Cancer is a particular focus for some drugmakers as novel medicines show promise by boosting the body’s immune system. “We reckon the real value of the (cancer) deal should be searched for in the pipeline and the newly launched products, strengthening Novartis’ position in melanoma and hematology,” Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss said. Analysts at Swiss broker Notenstein were also upbeat, saying the new cancer drugs would help Novartis to navigate patent expiries on top-selling medicines more easily. However, analysts at Barclays described the price tag of as much as $16 billion for the oncology assets as “rather hefty.” Drugmakers are stocking up their oncology pipelines as they bet that combinations of drugs will become the future of cancer care. A desire to boost its oncology business is seen as a key factor behind Pfizer’s reported interest in AstraZeneca. Cancer is an extremely competitive marketplace, however, and some analysts said it was right for GSK to exit a field where it was only No. 14 in the world. GSK boss Andrew Witty said the company did not have the scale to compete in cancer drugs, so it made sense to put them into “the hands of somebody who is a world leader in oncology.” Conversely, he said the deals with Novartis strengthened two of GSK’s core businesses: vaccines, given in more than 2 million shots every day, and consumer health, where the company will take the lead in running a business worth about $10 billion in annual revenue with the Swiss group. The deals were another step in his strategy of focusing on areas of strength, he said, moving further away from the monolithic model of drugs companies that tried to do everything. After the deal, GSK will get 70 percent of sales from its franchises in respiratory, HIV, vaccines and consumer health. Novartis said it would start a separate sale process for its flu business immediately, which was not part of the GSK deal.

The deals, which include Novartis’ purchase of GSK’s cancer drugs and GSK’s acquisition of Novartis’ vaccines business, came just after a newspaper report that AstraZeneca Plc had turned down a $101 billion bid approach from Pfizer Inc, a story that sent shares up across the sector. In addition, Novartis is selling its animal health arm to Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly for about $5.4 billion in cash. That would make Lilly’s Elanco unit the world’s second-largest animal health business when that deal closes early next year. A flurry of dealmaking has overtaken the global pharmaceutical industry recently as most large companies try to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers seek greater scale. Deal values have almost doubled since the start of 2014 to $77.9 billion from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. The overhaul at Novartis marks the end of a yearlong review of its sprawling portfolio after the departure of longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Vasella, the architect of the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that led to the company’s formation in 1996. The Swiss drugmaker said it would buy London-based GSK’s oncology products for $14.5 billion plus another $1.5 billion that depends on the results of a trial in melanoma. The deal will strengthen Novartis’s world No. 2 position in cancer behind crosstown rival Roche Holding AG. Novartis said GSK was buying its vaccines, excluding flu, for $5.25 billion plus potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion and ongoing royalties. The companies also will form a joint venture in consumer healthcare. The transactions, and their hint of more deals ahead for the drug sector, lifted the ARCA Pharmaceutials Index 1.8 percent. Lilly’s Elanco animal health unit will acquire about 600 animal health brands from Novartis, including vaccines and anti-parasite medicines that will allow it to enter the acquaculture, or fish farming, market. This would be the eighth and largest acquisition since 2007 for Elanco, which by global sales would trail only Zoetis Inc , which also specializes in products for farm animals and pets. “With this transaction, we’ll go from being No. 5 to No. 3 on the pet side globally and become a top 2 or 3 player in every segment” of products for farm animals, Jeff Simmons, Lilly’s head of animal health, said in an interview. Last year Elanco had sales of $2.15 billion, compared with $1.1 billion for Novartis Animal Health. “Novartis has agreed (to) an elegant set of transactions that either removes or strengthens its underperforming assets, while boosting its oncology portfolio,” Jefferies analysts said. In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, Novartis shares were up 1.4 percent at $86.63, while GSK rose 4.2 percent to $55.34. Lilly dipped 0.9 percent to $60.32.

188,LLY,"UPDATE 1-Bayer offers animal health assets, cash for Merck's OTC unit -sources","(Adds background on Merck auction) By Arno Schuetze and Olivia Oran FRANKFURT/NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Bayer AG  is offering to swap its animal health assets for Merck & Co Inc’s consumer healthcare business, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, in a move that could give the German drugmaker a leg up in the $14 billion auction of the Merck business. As part of its bid, Bayer has offered to pay the remainder of the acquisition price in cash, these people said, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Bayer and Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser Group are among the final contenders for the Merck unit, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, Reuters reported last weekend. Bayer’s animal health business had net sales of 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in 2013, according to the company’s website. Representatives for Bayer declined to comment and Merck did not respond to requests for comment. Bayer’s asset swap offer is yet another evidence of drugmakers’ efforts to exit weaker businesses and focus resources on areas of strength. Last week, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline Plc agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, with Eli Lilly and Co buying Novartis’ animal health business for $5.4 billion. However, asset swaps are often complicated and hard to value and there is no guarantee Bayer’s offer will prevail over cash offers from rival suitors, people familiar with the matter said. Merck’s auction has also drawn interest from several other healthcare and consumer giants including Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi SA, Procter & Gamble Co and Novartis AG , Reuters previously reported. A sale of Merck’s consumer business could approach $14 billion with an outcome expected this week, sources said last week. Reckitt confirmed on Monday it was in talks to buy the Merck unit. Bayer’s Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers said on Monday during a conference call with analysts that OTC “is an important business for us.” Reckitt owns over-the-counter medicines, including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Germany’s Bayer has a strong portfolio of consumer products, including pain medication Aleve and antacid Alka-Seltzer.

189,LLY,Big Pharma beware: GSK China case may be just the beginning,"SHANGHAI, May 18 (Reuters) - Chinese corruption charges against executives of British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) could be just the start of the pharmaceutical industry’s problems in its biggest emerging drugs market, according to industry sources in China. The charges relating to GSK executives, accused of funnelling hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to doctors and health officials via travel agencies, were announced by Chinese authorities last week, the culmination of a 10-month police investigation. But the GSK case is unlikely to represent closure for the drugs industry in China, which is set to become the world’s second-biggest pharmaceutical market behind the United States within three years according to consultancy IMS Health. Drug-company executives, sales staff, lawyers and compliance experts say China’s crackdown on drugmakers and other healthcare firms is intensifying as prosecutors grow bolder in the wake of the GSK case, threatening to stymie the growth of any firms caught in the crosshairs of the prolonged corruption crackdown. “The investigation against GSK may be coming to a close, but these types of probes in the pharmaceutical sector are becoming a weekly occurrence,” a sales rep for the Chinese unit of a major global drugmaker said. He requested his name and his firm’s name be withheld due to the sensitivity of the topic. After a series of probes against foreign drugmakers last year, a range of government bodies, including the state planning agency, local commerce bureaus and the health ministry are making frequent, sometimes unannounced spot-checks at foreign healthcare firms, risk consultants and lawyers said. Lawyers estimate that more than half of all drugmakers operating in China are being investigated in some capacity, from large multinational firms to Chinese state-owned enterprises. The impact of an investigation can be significant. GSK’s revenues in the country plunged 61 percent in the third quarter last year and were still down by 20 percent in the first quarter of 2014 from a year earlier. Official Chinese media said on Friday that the firm might have suffered “irreparable damage” in the Chinese market. Legal sources and one source with direct knowledge of the GSK investigation said China’s authorities might still try to charge the company itself, which could potentially put GSK’s business licences to operate in China at risk. GSK said in a statement on Wednesday that the firm wanted “to reach a resolution that will enable the company to continue to make an important contribution to the health and welfare of China and its citizens”. A London-based spokesman declined to elaborate on Friday. Chinese authorities, led by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) and the country’s public security bureau (PSB), are ramping up their visits to foreign drug firms. “We have certainly been made aware from clients that inspection visits by various government agencies have increased and these visits are now more focused,” said risk consultant Bob Youill, Shanghai-based managing director at FTI Consulting. Authorities are looking to unearth proof that firms have violated anti-corruption laws or artificially inflated drug prices, a sensitive theme as China’s leaders look to provide affordable healthcare to the country’s near-1.4 billion people. Last year authorities visited large international drugs manufacturers including Novartis AG, AstraZeneca Plc , Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly & Co and Bayer AG as part of a broad investigation into the sector. Bayer said its contacts with regulators were within the normal range. Johnson & Johnson spokesman Ernie Knewitz said he was unaware of any “new developments” in China. Chinese subsidiaries of U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc  “have received and may continue to receive inquiries regarding their operations from various Chinese governmental agencies”, Merck spokesman Steven Cragle said via email. Pfizer Inc said that it regularly interacted with government and regulatory agencies in China “to discuss a variety of issues, including patient access, regulatory and compliance matters, and anti-counterfeiting measures”. Roche Holding AG said it had not been contacted or investigated by Chinese authorities over allegations of corruption, while a Novartis spokeswoman said she was not aware of any contact from authorities in China around corruption. AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Eli Lilly did not have any immediate comment. Lawyers and consultants say a case as severe as GSK is unlikely to be repeated anytime soon, but that the charges against the British firm are likely to open the floodgates to a number of smaller corruption probes throughout the sector. Chinese police charged GSK’s former China boss, Briton Mark Reilly, and two other colleagues with corruption on Wednesday after the probe found the firm had made billions of yuan from bribing doctors and hospitals. “Just this morning we are starting with three new compliance investigation cases,” John Huang, Shanghai-based partner at law firm MWE China, told Reuters last week. China’s PSB and SAIC were actively visiting drug firms, he said. “We’re being asked to do training on how to deal with dawn raids, how to act when people are being arrested, and how individuals should respond to police investigations.” In turn, companies are looking to boost internal compliance systems and training, company insiders and lawyers said. “My company’s compliance systems have always been strict, but recently there have been more detailed regulations, with more all-encompassing rules and lots of internal probes,” said a second China-based sales rep at a large U.S. drugmaker. This has been a boon for compliance lawyers and risk consultants, said Nat Edmonds, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings and a former Foreign Corrupt Practices Act litigator at the U.S. Justice Department. “The amount of resources companies are putting into this has increased exponentially,” Edmonds told Reuters in Shanghai. The issue for drugmakers - both Chinese and foreign - is that China’s healthcare system is widely accepted to be riddled with bribery and corruption. Graft is often used to smooth business ties between sales reps and doctors. Without these illicit payments many companies would struggle to compete, lawyers and company insiders said. This would pose a challenge for firms as they look to hit steep sales targets under the glare of Chinese watchdogs. “The whole industry is going to get more and more regulated,” said a source with direct knowledge of the GSK investigation.

190,LLY,A bitter pill as China crackdowns squeeze pharma margins,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A crackdown on corruption and pricing in China’s fast-growing pharmaceutical market has squeezed profits and margins, raising a red flag to global Big Pharma that the days of easy growth in the country may be over. A Reuters’ analysis of more than 60 listed Chinese healthcare firms shows average profit margins declined to around 10 percent last year from 15 percent in 2012. Average net profits fell 2.1 percent, down from close to 20 percent growth in previous years. China has been a magnet for the big global pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare firms as growth slows in Europe and the United States. It is the largest emerging drugs market and is set to be the global number two overall within three years, according to consultancy IMS Health. While global drugmakers withhold their China profit figures, the analysis suggests profit growth is harder to come by - a concern as many global firms look to China as a future growth driver. “Most companies, local and foreign, have enjoyed an easy growth phase for 5-6 years as money was thrown at the healthcare system to improve access,” said Alexander Ng, Hong Kong-based associate principal at McKinsey & Co. “Now China is more into cost containment mode... and the squeeze on pricing and margins is a lot more apparent.” Over the past year, China has cracked down on high prices and corruption in the healthcare sector. Authorities probed drugmakers over pricing in July, while a high-profile investigation into British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc led to executives at the company being charged with bribery earlier this month. Industry and legal sources said the investigations into the sector are likely to grow more intense, meaning downward pressure on profits is likely to remain. Graphic: Reuters survey r.reuters.com/nuw59v The climate of investigation has stymied sales growth, with some doctors saying they are worried to meet pharmaceutical reps, fearing being caught in the glare of China’s watchdogs. In 2013, Chinese authorities visited global drugmakers including Novartis AG, AstraZeneca Plc, Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly & Co and Bayer AG as part of a broad investigation into the sector. GSK, which saw its China revenues plunge 61 percent in the third quarter last year, has since overhauled its management structure in China, stopped payments to healthcare professionals and changed its incentive systems for drug reps. “Of course there will be an impact on sales. The pattern of selling through bribing definitely won’t work anymore,” said a Shanghai-based sales executive at another global drugmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Reuters’ analysis showed combined revenue growth in the sector fell to 17.9 percent last year, from 22.6 percent in 2012 and more than 28.8 percent in 2011. Price cuts are also putting a strain on profits and margins as China’s leaders look to cut a healthcare bill that is set to hit $1 trillion by 2020, according to McKinsey & Co. Combined profit growth dropped to around 5.2 percent last year from 23.9 percent in 2011, according to the Reuters’ analysis. While authorities have made some moves to step back on price caps, Chinese healthcare procurement still puts the main emphasis on cost, creating an incentive for firms to push prices lower to beat rivals to contracts. “The industry is in a very competitive stage, where firms want to take market share to stay in the game, but at the same time can’t deal with the low prices,” said Yu Mingde, president of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Enterprises Association, an organization supervised by China’s cabinet. The crackdown on pricing has pushed some Chinese firms out of business and forced global drugmakers to rethink their China strategy, industry sources and analysts said, putting greater emphasis on high-tech drugs which command greater pricing power. International drugmakers have long banked on being able to charge a steep premium in emerging markets for branded generic drugs that have gone off patent in their home market. Generics specialist Actavis Plc pulled out of China this year, saying the market was too risky and not a business-friendly environment. “When you have 5,000 competitors you have to be special, and being a foreign company is no longer enough,” said Guillaume Demarne, Shanghai-based business development manager at healthcare research body Institut Pasteur. Rising competition in the market will also likely spur a round of consolidation as firms look to strengthen in terms of scale or technology to stay ahead of rivals, analysts said. Bayer said in February it would buy Chinese traditional medicine maker Dihon Pharmaceutical, while Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said last month it plans to take U.S.-listed Chindex International Inc private in a $461 million deal with equity firm TPG. “The level of industrial concentration will rapidly increase by way of acquisitions and reorganizations,” Fosun Pharmaceutical said in a statement with its annual earnings.

Rising competition in the market will also likely spur a round of consolidation as firms look to strengthen in terms of scale or technology to stay ahead of rivals, analysts said. Bayer said in February it would buy Chinese traditional medicine maker Dihon Pharmaceutical, while Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said last month it plans to take U.S.-listed Chindex International Inc private in a $461 million deal with equity firm TPG. “The level of industrial concentration will rapidly increase by way of acquisitions and reorganisations,” Fosun Pharmaceutical said in a statement with its annual earnings. M&A; activity this year has so far outstripped 2013, said Phil Leung, China healthcare head and Asia Pacific M&A; head for consultancy Bain & Co, noting that local and global firms were looking at acquisitions, joint ventures and other tie-ups. Drugmakers with advantages of scale, low-cost production or unique, in-demand products should hold their own, he said, while others would struggle to survive. “In this environment, the strong will get stronger and the stragglers will be more exposed.”   (Additional reporting by Li Hui in BEIJING and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",5252014,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-pharmaceuticals-margins/a-bitter-pill-as-china-crackdowns-squeeze-pharma-margins-idUSL3N0O92QN20140525

195,LLY,"Spooked by probes, pharma executives ask: should I leave China?","* Charges against GSK’s Mark Reilly shocked business community * Managers weigh legal responsibility of taking top positions * Crackdown is part of wider campaign against corruption By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI, June 13 (Reuters) - China’s crackdown on corruption in the pharmaceutical sector has frightened foreign executives so much that some fear they could be jailed and have asked their lawyers if they should leave the country for six months. Others are thinking of going for good. While the crackdown has been building for a year, Chinese police shocked the foreign business community a month ago when they filed corruption charges against Mark Reilly, former China head of British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. The Briton, who has been barred from leaving China, could face decades in prison. Even before then, executives were getting worried about a wave of visits from police and regulators to their offices as well as articles in Chinese media alleging corrupt practices against many global drugmakers. The charges against Reilly had prompted some senior executives to look at all contingencies, several legal and industry sources said. “Many of our clients are asking about personal liabilities and insurance, with executives asking if they are put in jail what will happen to their families and how the company will provide protection for them,” said John Huang, Shanghai-based co-founder and managing partner at law firm MWE China. Police said a year-long investigation found GSK made billions of yuan from schemes to bribe doctors and hospitals. Two senior Chinese executives were also charged. Britain’s biggest drugmaker has said the accusations were “deeply concerning” and that it had zero tolerance for bribery. Reilly has not been reachable for comment while his lawyer has declined to talk to the media. Reilly’s whereabouts are unknown. Global drugmakers contacted by Reuters declined to comment about the crackdown and how it was affecting executive morale in the world’s third-largest pharmaceutical market. But Huang and two pharmaceutical executives said some managers were reconsidering the legal risks involved in holding any position where they were responsible for some of the thousands of marketing and sales staff that global firms employ across China. Investigators have focused on those staff and how they deal with poorly paid doctors and administrators in public hospitals, the biggest buyers of medicine in China. The crackdown, which shows no sign of abating, coincides with a wider campaign by President Xi Jinping against corporate and official graft. Lawyers said some executives and in-house counsel had sought legal advice about leaving China to avoid getting caught up in any future probes. Some top managers were actively pursuing career options outside China, said one source. Others were contemplating a more temporary escape until the worst blew over. “They are thinking about leaving China short-term, staying out of the country on a three or six-month rotation,” said another Shanghai-based lawyer, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. By moving abroad, executives would avoid being arrested should there be any formal investigation into their firms, lawyers said. Executives had sought advice on relocating to Singapore, Hong Kong and other destinations, they added. Some international firms were also finding it harder to attract staff to China, said the two pharmaceutical executives at separate global drugmakers, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Other executives believe the GSK case is a one-off event and are more focused on not falling foul of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which can apply to a wide variety of firms that have business ties to the United States. That would be a mistake, said Steven Dickinson, partner at law firm Harris Moure in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. “Every week I write an email saying you’re missing the point - you won’t have time to get hit by the U.S. law because you’ll be in jail in China,” Dickinson said. While formal charges have only been levelled against GSK executives, virtually all big drugmakers in China have come under scrutiny from police or regulators. Last year authorities visited Novartis AG of Switzerland, Britain’s AstraZeneca Plc, Sanofi SA  of France, U.S. firm Eli Lilly & Co, Germany’s Bayer AG and Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S . All said they were cooperating with the authorities and that they did not condone bribery. Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG  said last month its Hangzhou office in eastern China was visited by China’s anti-graft watchdog, the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC). The regulator declined to give details while Roche said it would cooperate with the authorities. A leaked memo from the Health Ministry in Hangzhou also named Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and AstraZeneca as examples of drugmakers suspected of making kickbacks. The three firms said they had not been contacted by authorities over the matter. Several global drugmakers including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Roche have also changed their China heads in the past year. The three firms said the moves had nothing to do with the crackdown. GSK replaced Reilly in July after the investigation into the company was announced. Johnson & Johnson appointed a China chairman in a newly created role in August to oversee the firm’s business. The U.S. company declined to comment on the move.

196,LLY,"Lilly beats forecasts, vows to remain independent","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s (LLY.N) quarterly revenue plunged due to generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug and its Evista osteoporosis treatment, but cost controls helped earnings beat forecasts. Lilly on Thursday said it had earned 68 cents per share in the second quarter, above analysts’ average forecast of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of Cymbalta, which lost U.S. patent protection in December, tumbled 73 percent to $401 million. Evista, which began facing cheaper generics in March, had a sales drop of 61 percent to $108 million.     The Indianapolis drugmaker’s sales and earnings have been badly hurt since late 2011, when its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug lost U.S. patent protection and faced competition from cheaper generics. The expiration of patents and resulting decline in revenue have been a problem for most U.S. drugmakers and are among the reasons for a surge in mergers and acquisitions in the sector. But rather than attempt to merge with another big drugmaker, Lilly has vowed to remain independent and rely on its own product lineup to get back on track.    Lilly on Thursday said it plans to stick with that strategy and selectively make small or mid-size acquisitions. By contrast, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which faces looming patent expirations on big drugs, earlier this year tried but failed to buy British rival AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) in a deal valued at $118 billion. Pfizer hoped to slash its tax rate by buying AstraZeneca and domiciling the combined company in Britain, a maneuver known as a tax inversion. Other healthcare companies are pursuing similar deals. Pfizer, with three mega-mergers since 2000, has focused on U.S. rivals, largely for huge cost cuts that boosted earnings. Lilly Chief Executive John Lechleiter, appearing on CNBC on Thursday, said Lilly had not been approached by Pfizer and did not “intend to be anyone’s target.”      Later, in a conference call with investors, Lechleiter said tax reform is needed in the United States to create a lower corporate tax rate, so U.S. companies can better compete with overseas rivals. “It’s time for Congress to step up to the plate to get this thing done,” he said during the call. Company Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said Lilly would never pursue tax inversions as a “primary driver” of deals, although they could be a secondary benefit.  Lilly earned $734 million, or 68 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $1.21 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier, when the company took charges for closing a distribution center and other costs. Although revenue fell 17 percent to $4.94 billion, it topped Wall Street expectations of $4.90 billion. Lilly said it still expects earnings this year of $2.72 to $2.80 per share, excluding special items. Shares of Lilly edged 0.6 percent higher to $64.62 in midday trading.

Lilly on Thursday said it had earned 68 cents per share in the second quarter, above the analysts’ average forecast of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter told CNBC on Thursday that he planned to stick with that strategy and selectively make small or mid-size acquisitions to bolster Lilly’s drug pipeline. By contrast, Pfizer Inc, which faces looming patent expirations on several big drugs and has developed few top sellers in recent years, has tried several times since November to buy AstraZeneca Plc. It officially abandoned that quest in May, but under British takeover law could make renewed overtures to its smaller rival in November. Pfizer has said it would lower its tax rate considerably by buying AstraZeneca and domiciling the combined company in the United Kingdom, a maneuver known as a tax inversion. Other healthcare companies are pursuing similar deals. Pfizer, in seeking mega-mergers in the past, has focused on big U.S. rivals, having bought Warner Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth since 2000. These deals provided huge cost cuts that have propped up its earnings. Lechleiter, in the television interview, said Lilly had not been approached by Pfizer and did not “intend to be anyone’s target.” But he said high U.S. corporate taxes put U.S. companies at a disadvantage. “Companies doing inversions are simply trying to level the playing field,” he added.

199,LLY,"Takeda, Lilly lose bid to overturn $9 billion award for hiding cancer risk","(Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and Eli Lilly & Co lost a bid to overturn a combined $9 billion punitive damage award by a U.S. jury for hiding cancer risks associated with their Actos diabetes drug, according to a court ruling. “Plaintiffs have pointed to sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the ‘information’ about bladder cancer contained in Actos labels did not adequately warn of the increased risk of cancer,” U.S. District Judge Rebecca Doherty of the Western District of Louisiana said on Wednesday. The development is a setback for Takeda but leaves open the possibility of a retrial or reduced verdict, for which Japan’s top drugmaker made a separate appeal in April. A spokeswoman called the latest ruling “unfortunate”, adding that Takeda continued to hope for an outcome in its favor on the separate appeal. Takeda reiterated its intention to keep fighting in court rather than settle. Legal experts have said it was unlikely that such a large award would stand after challenges in court by both companies. Lilly, which co-promoted Actos from 1999 to 2006, was not immediately available to comment. The company has previously said it will be indemnified by Takeda for its losses and expenses from the litigation based on the terms of its agreement with Takeda. Shares in Takeda reacted little to the news, rising 0.4 percent on Friday afternoon, against a slight fall in the broader Tokyo market. Actos, an oral Type 2 diabetes medication that regulates blood sugar levels, has been on the market since 1999. Takeda on Friday separately announced findings of a 10-year epidemiology study that concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that taking Actos led to an increased risk of bladder cancer. Data from the study, conducted by the University of Pennsylvania and Kaiser Permanente Northern California, was submitted to regulatory authorities in the United States, Europe and Japan, it said. This is the first federal case to be tried in consolidated multidistrict litigation comprising more than 2,900 lawsuits. In all three previous Actos trials, Takeda has said, judgments were entered in its favor.

208,LLY,Eli Lilly stops development of lupus drug; XTL shares soar,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said it would stop the development of its drug to treat the autoimmune disorder lupus, after it was found to be not effective enough in late-stage trials. While Lilly’s shares hardly budged on the news, the ADRs of Israel-based XTL Biopharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing its own lupus treatment, were up 87 percent at $3.09 in early afternoon trading. Lupus is a condition in which the body’s immune system starts attacking healthy tissues, causing inflammation, pain and, in extreme cases, death. About 1.5 million people in the United States are estimated to suffer from lupus, according to the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. The disease has been particularly challenging for drugmakers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved GlaxoSmithKline’s Benlysta in March 2011, making it the first lupus drug to be approved in 50 years. Lilly tested the drug, tabalumab, in two studies, but it failed to meet the primary goal in one of the trials. “Collectively, the data from these studies did not meet expectations for efficacy in the context of existing treatments,” the company said, adding that the decision to stop developing the drug had nothing to do with safety concerns. The decision to drop tabalumab will result in a charge of about 4-5 cents per share in the third quarter, Lilly said. The Lupus Foundation of America said there was enough evidence in Lilly’s data to merit further examination. “The results underscore that the pathway this drug targets (B cells) is known to be critical in the development of lupus,” the non-profit organization said in a statement. B cells are white blood cells that produce antibodies to fight off infections. They are an important component of abnormal immune responses that can be used to identify each autoimmune disease. XTL said last month that it would start mid-stage studies of its lupus drug in mid 2015 and planned to meet FDA officials at the end of this year to discuss trial design. Shares of Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc, which has completed mid-stage studies of its potential lupus treatment, were down 6.7 percent at $1.68 on the Nasdaq. Lilly shares were down almost 1 percent at $64.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

214,LLY,Stada secures third license for copycat biotech drug: CEO,"BAD VILBEL Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s Stada plans to bring a copy of Eli Lilly’s Forteo osteoporosis treatment to market, its chief executive said, as the generic drugmaker moves further into the sale of cheaper alternatives for costly biotech drugs. Hartmut Retzlaff told Reuters in an interview on Friday that its partner - biotech development firm Richter-Helm - would develop a copy of synthetic hormone Forteo. Stada has secured the license to market it in Europe. “We are preparing for a market launch in 2019,” said Retzlaff, who has been at the helm for 21 years. He added the company was in talks over another copycat biotech drug, or “biosimilar”, that could be introduced in 2017, but declined to name it because a deal had not been struck. Hundreds of companies around the world are chasing the emerging biosimilars market, with more than 700 substances now in development or already approved, a major study of the sector showed last month. Many top-selling biotech medicines - made from proteins and other large molecules - are losing patent protection. But copycat versions of biological medicines can be difficult, since such drugs are produced in living cells and imitations can only be similar, not identical.  After suffering cost overruns in developing its own biosimilar version of anemia treatment erythropoietin (EPO), Stada decided in 2011 to focus on the marketing side of the business and at the time won Hungarian drugmaker Richter as a partner for the development of two drugs. So far, such copycat medicines have typically been offered at a 20 to 30 percent discount to innovator brands, but Retzlaff warned he expected the average discount to rise to 50 percent three years after market launch, as more rivals pile in. Still, the business promised better margins than the company’s main generics business - copies of conventional chemicals drugs - in the medium term, he said. Stada’s generics business carried a margin of 17.3 percent over sales last year. Its biosimilars business has so far generated only negligible volumes. Retzlaff added that generic drugmakers riding the wave of pharmaceuticals losing patent protection needed to gain a foothold in biosimilars or risk running slowly out of business. “We are in for a paradigm shift as more biopharmaceuticals will soon go off-patent than conventional generics,” said Retzlaff. “If Stada doesn’t have these products in its portfolio after 2020, the company will not be competitive.” Shares in Stada were down 2.3 percent to 28.88 euros by 1128 GMT, underperforming a 1 percent fall in the European healthcare index. Retzlaff said Stada’s biotech business would not take off before 2018 but the goal was for biosimilars to account for one third of the group’s off-patent prescription drug revenues. Despite a flurry of development activity, the market is still in its infancy with overall biosimilar sales of 60 to million euros ($76 to $89 million) in Germany, Stada says. The European healthcare regulator’s website shows it has approved biosimilars of five biotech drugs so far.  The biggest players in the industry, who unlike Stada develop the substances in-house, are Novartis’s Sandoz unit and Israel’s Teva. Stada also sells non-prescription treatments and last year boosted that business by taking over British over-the-counter drug manufacturer Thornton & Ross.     Biotech medicines - made from large protein molecules - have gradually gained importance compared with conventional chemical drugs because they offer more promise to tackle difficult-to- treat conditions such as cancer and auto-immune diseases.

215,LLY,Lilly profit plunges as cheaper generics take toll,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) said its quarterly earnings plunged 58 percent, hurt by special charges and generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug, but it affirmed its full-year profit forecast. The U.S. drugmaker on Thursday said it had earned $501 million, or 47 cents per share, in the third quarter. That compared with $1.20 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items such as charges of $95 million from research collaborations, Lilly earned 66 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 67 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said earnings were held back by higher-than-expected research and development costs and sales, general and administrative expenses, but he found no major surprises in the report.    Sales fell 16 percent to $4.88 billion, but topped Wall Street’s expectations of $4.83 billion. Lilly’s earnings have suffered since late 2011, when its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug began facing cheaper generics in the United States. The pain worsened last December, when Cymbalta, then its biggest drug, went generic. And its osteoporosis treatment Evista began facing generics in March. Cymbalta’s sales fell 73 percent in the third quarter to $368 million, while Evista’s tumbled 65 percent to $90 million. Lilly, which has resisted mergers with other big drugmakers to focus on its own experimental drugs, expects new products to help earnings rebound next year.  The company, whose shares slipped 0.6 percent in midday trading, is testing treatments for cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, cholesterol and psoriasis. U.S. regulators recently approved Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Trulicity (dulaglutide) for type 2 diabetes and granted tentative approval for a generic form of Sanofi SA’s (SASY.PA) top-selling Lantus (insulin glargine) insulin. But Lilly will not be able to introduce its biosimilar form of Lantus, called Basaglar, until it resolves patent disputes with Sanofi.    “The number of Lilly products reaching the market over the next year should set the company up for a return to growth and profit margin improvement next year,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “So we’re now at an inflection point.” Conover said Lilly’s earnings next year should exceed the approximate 5 percent growth he expects for the industry. But he said Lilly shares were trading at 21 times expected 2015 earnings, a significant premium to most rivals, “so some of Lilly’s return to growth is already priced in.” Sales of many of Lilly’s biggest products rose sharply in the quarter, helping offset Cymbalta’s swoon. Sales increased 8 percent to $568 million for impotence treatment Cialis and were up 15 percent at $706 million for Humalog insulin. The company’s Elanco animal health unit bolstered results, with sales jumping 10 percent to $585 million. Lilly said it still expected 2014 earnings of $2.72 to $2.80 per share, excluding special items. That would represent a decline of as much as 35 percent from last year.

216,LLY,"U.S. judge slashes $9 billion award vs Takeda, Lilly over diabetes drug","(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday slashed a $9 billion punitive damages award to $36.8 million against Takeda Pharmaceutical Co and Eli Lilly & Co over their Actos diabetes drug, although she rejected their request for a new trial.  U.S. District Judge Rebecca Doherty in Louisiana in a court filing granted a motion from the drugmakers to reduce the $9 billion in combined punitive damages awarded earlier this year. In the first federal case to go to trial in a consolidated group of lawsuits, the companies were accused of failing to warn users that Actos could raise the risk for bladder cancer.  In her ruling, Doherty said the original $9 billion damages award was “excessive” and violated the companies’ constitutional rights to due process. She ordered Takeda to pay $27.6 million and Eli Lilly to pay $9.2 million for a total of $36.8 million. Doherty said that, while far smaller than the jury’s original award, the reduced punitive damages were still “large enough to accomplish the jury’s clear aim: to send a message to the defendants that their wrongdoing must stop...” The $9 billion in punitive damages was among the largest ever from a U.S. jury. Legal experts doubted it would stand, since appellate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court typically reject punitive damages that are vastly out of proportion to compensatory damages.  In her ruling, Doherty urged the higher courts to give more guidance on whether there should be an upper limit to punitive damages when a jury finds defendants engaged in “seriously reprehensible behavior.” The companies also had sought a new trial, arguing that the court had made prejudicial rulings on evidence and jury instructions that tainted the trial’s outcome.  Doherty rejected that request Monday, writing that the evidence during the trial showed that the companies “disregarded, denied, obfuscated and concealed” for more than a decade that Actos could increase patients’ risk for bladder cancer.  Takeda’s U.S. general counsel, Kenneth Greisman, said they viewed the reduced award as a “step in the right direction,” but would continue to challenge the verdict on appeal.” Lilly’s general counsel, Mike Harrington, said in a statement that the company would continue to fight the verdict. “While we have empathy for the plaintiff, we believe the evidence did not support his claims,” he said.  Plaintiffs’ lawyer Richard Arsenault called the ruling “thorough” and noted its focus on the need for “meaningful deterrence for these multi-national, billion-dollar corporations.” Actos, an oral medication used to regulate blood sugar levels in patients with type-2 diabetes, has been on the market since 1999. Lilly, which co-promoted Actos from 1999 to 2006, has said it will be indemnified by Takeda for its losses and litigation expenses.  The case, brought by plaintiff Terrence Allen, is among more than 3,700 consolidated before Doherty. The companies face thousands of additional lawsuits in state courts.  The jury had also awarded Allen $1.475 million in compensatory damages, which both parties agreed to reduce to $1.27 million.

219,LLY,"Lilly, Boehringer revise terms of diabetes drugs alliance","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co and German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim said they had revised the structure of their diabetes alliance for some countries. Under the alliance signed in 2011, the companies agreed to develop and market diabetes drugs together in more than 50 countries.  Boehringer and Lilly will continue to jointly develop and market these drugs in 17 countries, including the United States, they said in a statement on Wednesday.  These countries represent over 90 percent of the anticipated market opportunity for these drugs, they said.  In the remaining countries, each company will exclusively market the molecules it brought to the alliance and Lilly will receive upfront payments and ongoing payments instead of commissions there. Lilly spokesman Greg Kueterman declined to elaborate on these terms.  The U.S. drugmaker will issue a revised 2014 forecast to include the impact of these changed terms, in a regulatory filing, Boehringer and Lilly said.  So far, the companies have launched three treatments - Trajenta, Jardiance and Jentadueto - under the alliance. A new insulin glargine product, which is approved in Europe, has won tentative approval in the United States. Sanofi SA said on Tuesday that growth in sales of its diabetes drugs would stall next year due to pricing pressures in the United States.  The French drugmaker said it expected sales of diabetes drugs to be flat next year, surprising analysts who had expected double-digit percentage growth. Shares of several diabetes drug developers including Lilly, Denmark’s Novo Nordisk A/S and Merck & Co had fallen on Tuesday after Sanofi’s comments.  Lilly’s shares were little changed at $65.04 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

The fast-acting insulin, called BioChaperone Lispro, is currently in early-stage Phase Ib studies and aims to control glucose levels better during and after meals. Under the deal, Adocia will receive an upfront fee of $50 million, potential future payments of up to $280 million if BioChaperone Lispro reaches certain development and regulatory milestones, and sales milestones of up to $240 million, the companies said in a statement.  Lilly will also pay royalties on sales of the drug, if approved, and reimburse Adocia for some of its research and development expenses, for an unspecified amount. Shares in Adocia jumped 40 percent on the news, trading at 37.70 euros by 0819 GMT (3.19 a.m. EST).  Drugmakers Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and Eli Lilly & Co are fiercely fighting for share of the global market for diabetes treatments, worth over $40 billion and growing as over-eating and lack of exercise fuel an epidemic of Type 2 diabetes.

227,LLY,"Lilly forecasts 2015 earnings, revenue shy of Street estimates","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) forecast 2015 earnings and revenue just shy of market expectations as the drugmaker looks to bounce back after the expiration of patents on some of its biggest sellers. Lilly’s sales started falling in late 2011 when its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug began facing competition from cheaper generics in the United States. The company - touting “one of the strongest pipelines in our history” - said on Wednesday that its next phase of growth would be led by new diabetes and cancer drugs and the company’s expanding animal health business. Lilly, whose shares were little changed at $69.36 at midday, forecast 2015 sales of $20.3 billion-$20.8 billion, taking into account a $500 million impact from a strong dollar.  Adjusted earnings were forecast at $3.10-$3.20 per share. Analysts on average estimated earnings of $3.22 per share on sales of $20.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said the “low” sales guidance may reflect more muted expectations for the company’s existing drugs as well as some recent launches. The Indianapolis-based company, which is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 30, reaffirmed its adjusted earnings forecast for 2014.  Lilly closed a deal to buy Novartis AG’s NOVN.VX (NVS.N) animal health business for $5.4 billion earlier this month. The transaction makes Lilly’s Elanco unit the world’s No. 2 animal-health group by revenue, up from No. 4.  Lilly said it expected to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to 50 percent or less by the end of 2018, compared with just under 75 percent in the latest quarter. Despite a difficult 2014, Lilly’s shares rose 35 percent,  outperforming 14 percent jump in the ARCA Pharmaceutical index of large drugmakers .DRG.

Elevated levels of the drug, Zyprexa Relprevv, were found in the two patients who died in 2013, three to four days after receiving the injection. The FDA said its investigation into the deaths was inconclusive. (1.usa.gov/1xsdbOe) The study noted that much of the increase in drug levels could have occurred after death, explaining the extremely high blood levels of the drug found in the two patients. Zyprexa contains the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. It carries a boxed warning, FDA’s most serious type of warning, for post-injection delirium sedation or olanzapine overdose. Lilly’s earnings have suffered since late 2011, when Zyprexa, its top-selling drug, began facing cheaper generics in the United States.

232,LLY,Lilly's psoriatic arthritis drug succeeds in late-stage study,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said its experimental drug, ixekizumab, reduced the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis in patients more than a placebo did in a late-stage trial. Up to 30 percent of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory form of arthritis that can cause swelling, stiffness and pain in and around joints, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. The study, which tested two doses of ixekizumab against a placebo for 24 weeks, showed that Lilly’s drug was statistically superior, as demonstrated by the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20 response. ACR 20 is a standard assessment defined by the American College of Rheumatology as one that reduces the signs and symptoms of a disease by 20 percent. The psoriatic arthritis patients in the trial were required to have had a flare up of symptoms in at least the past six months as well as be untreated by certain drugs. Ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is injected under the skin and is also being tested to treat plaque psoriasis. Last August, Lilly announced data that showed ixekizumab was successful in multiple late-stage studies in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

233,LLY,Fitch Affirms Eli Lilly's IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings affirms Eli Lilly & Co. Inc.'s (Lilly)  long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. In addition, Fitch affirms the  company's short-term IDR at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The rating  actions apply to roughly $7.6 billion of debt outstanding at Dec. 31, 2014. A  full list of the rating actions is provided at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch views the acquisition of Novartis' Animal Health (NAH) business as  strategically sound, offering Lilly a broader product portfolio, greater  geographic reach, top-line growth opportunities and potential cost savings. --Lilly is nearing the end of its significant patent risk period that  essentially began in 2014 with two of its top drugs, which accounted for roughly  26% of total firm sales, losing patent protection and now accounting for only 7%  of firm sales.  --Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line organic growth during 2015-2016  with the annualizing of patent expiries and continued strength in established  and new products such as Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and  Tradjenta/Jandueto. --Fitch believes Lilly's late-stage pipeline, particularly strong in treatments  for diabetes and cancer, offers the company numerous opportunities to sustain  longer-term growth.  --Lilly's leaner cost structure, growth of patent-protected products and new  product launches should pave the way for margin expansion in 2015-2016 as sales  rebound. --Fitch forecasts that Lilly will generate approximately $400 million to $600  million of free cash flow (FCF; cash flow from operations minus capital  expenditures and dividend payments) in 2015. --Relatively aggressive share repurchases from now through 2017 are incorporated  in Fitch's forecast. However, cash dividend increases are expected to be modest  and acquisitions targeted. --Fitch expects Lilly to operate with leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of 1.5x-1.7x  during 2015. --Fitch assumes the company will maintain adequate liquidity during the forecast  horizon, supported by FCF generation, balance sheet cash, and availability on  its revolving credit facility. ANIMAL HEALTH ACQUISITION GOOD FIT Lilly completed its $5.4 billion NAH acquisition in January 2015, which it  funded with roughly $3.4 billion of international cash and $2 billion in debt.  The acquisition moves Lilly near to the top of the animal health market in terms  of product categories and geographic presence. In addition, Novartis' animal  health product pipeline is reportedly strong and will likely increase Lilly's  long-term growth potential. The newfound scale with its animal health business should also offer efficiency  opportunities. Lilly has stated that it expects to achieve more than $200  million in annual cost synergies within three years after the acquisition. While  acquisition-related top-line synergies are more difficult to quantify and  realize, Fitch believes there will be prospects for enhanced organic growth  stemming from a broader product portfolio. PATENT RISK EASING Lilly is close to exiting its significant patent expiry period that essentially  began in 2014. Its largest selling drug, Cymbalta, lost U.S. patent protection  in December 2013 and European patent protection in August 2014. Cymbalta  accounted for roughly 24% of total company sales during 2013 and accounted for  only 7% in 2015. Evista lost U.S. market exclusivity in March 2014 and accounted  for approximately 4% of total firm revenues, declining to 2% of firm revenues in  2014. To date, no biosimilar competition to Humalog has entered the market,  despite its May 2013 patent expiry.  REBOUND WITH PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line organic growth during 2015-2016,  achieving annual sales of roughly $19 billion to $21 billion including  meaningful foreign exchange headwinds. Currently marketed drugs including Alimta  (cancer), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Effient (cardiac thrombosis), Erbitux  (cancer) and Tradjenta/Jandueto (diabetes), in aggregate, have decent  intermediate-term growth potential. These drugs, combined, generate roughly $6.3  billion in annual revenues for Lilly and address large and growing treatment  markets. IMPROVING PIPELINE Lilly has improved its growth prospects for the intermediate-to-longer term, as  it has been making significant progress in building its late-stage pipeline. The  company has a number of late-stage drug candidates and recently launched Cyramza  (cancer)and Trulicity (diabetes). Late stage candidates include potential  treatments for cancer, diabetes, lupus, psoriasis, high cholesterol, depression,  and rheumatoid arthritis. The company has partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim in  its efforts to develop diabetes medications.  COST CONTROL BODES WELL FOR LONGER-TERM MARGIN EXPANSION Lilly has been effective in reducing costs during 2014, as it reduced spending  in SG&A; by 7% and R&D; by 15% compared to 2013. Much of the decrease was driven  by reducing resources needed to support Cymbalta and Evista, as well as  prioritizing research and development projects. In addition to costs, the growth  in newer, higher-margin products supports the case for margin improvement  beginning in 2015. POSITIVE AND GROWING FCF Fitch forecasts higher FCF of approximately $400 million to $600 million during  2015, as Lilly returns to a period of organic growth and improved margins.  Expected cash flow from operations of roughly $4 billion should be sufficient to  fund approximately $2.2 billion in cash dividends and $1.3 billion in capital  expenditures. Fitch believes FCF will continue to grow from 2014 levels over the  long run, as revenues and margins recover. RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT Fitch incorporates roughly $4 billion in share repurchases from now through  2017-2018, funded with FCF and cash on hand. However, Fitch models only  incremental dividend increases and targeted acquisitions during the same  forecast period, which will not likely stress Lilly's balance sheet. NAH ACQUISITION DRIVEN LEVERAGE  Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt leverage of 1.5x-1.7x during 2015.  The forecasted increase in leverage over early 2014 stems from the increased  debt that the company incurred to fund the acquisition of NAH in early 2015.  Fitch does not expect the company to reduce debt levels during the forecast  period. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY Fitch assumes Lilly will maintain adequate liquidity, supported by FCF  generation, balance sheet cash and availability on its revolving credit  facility. At Dec. 31, 2014, the company had approximately $4.8 billion of cash  and short-term investments, $3.2 billion of unused committed bank credit  facilities, and roughly $4.6 billion in noncurrent investments. Lilly generated  approximately $1 billion in FCF during the LTM period.  In August 2014, the company refinanced its revolving bank credit facilities and  entered into a $1.20 billion credit facility with a five-year term and a $2.00  billion credit facility with a 364-day term, both of which are available to  support Lilly's commercial paper program. There were no amounts outstanding  under the revolving credit facility during the year ended Dec. 31, 2014.  At Dec. 31, 2014, Lilly had approximately $7.6 billion in debt outstanding.  Fitch believes the company's long-term debt maturities are manageable with  roughly $2.7 billion maturing in 2015, $209 million in 2016, $1 billion in 2017,  $204 million in 2018, and $601 million in 2019. Fitch's forecast assumes that  Lilly will refinance these maturities with new debt issuances. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: Fitch's key assumptions for Lilly's 'A'/Stable Outlook include: --Moderate organic revenue growth, which is mostly offset by the negative effect  of foreign exchange movements during 2015; --Improving margins driven by favorable mix, including new product introductions  and the achievement meaningful cost reduction; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $400 million to $600 million during 2015; --Leverage to remain below 1.7x during 2015; --No major business development initiatives that would meaningfully increase  leverage during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a positive rating action in the near term, future  developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision of the  Rating Outlook to Positive in the intermediate term include: --Revenues continue to expand for patent protected products, including Alimta,  Cialis, Cyramza, Effient, Erbitux, Tradjenta/Jandueto and Trulicity; --The company employs adequate cost controls and integration synergies to  generate sufficient profitability while limiting increases in debt to maintain  leverage sustainably below 1.3x; --Cash is deployed conservatively, with the vast majority of the remaining $3.7  billion share repurchase authorization funded with cash flow as opposed to debt  issuance.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Negative  Rating Outlook and/or a one-notch downgrade to 'A-'/'F2' include: --Operational stress from, but not limited to, patent expiries drives leverage  durably above 1.7x; --Inability to extract efficiencies from current operations as well as from the  NAH acquisition; --FCF deteriorates without the expectation of a timely trend reversal. Fitch has affirmed Eli Lilly's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'; --Bank loan rating at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at'F1'.

234,LLY,"Lilly profit beats estimates, helped by cost cuts","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) soundly beat quarterly profit estimates on lower-than-expected spending on research and marketing, but revenue slipped as the stronger dollar hurt sales outside the United States.  The U.S. drugmaker hopes to begin rebounding this year from three years of plunging sales and earnings caused by patent expirations on some of its biggest products. First-quarter earnings were hurt by generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug and its Evista treatment for osteoporosis, it said on Thursday. “Lilly has weathered one of the industry’s most challenging storms of patent expirations and is primed to grow,” said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. Boris said Lilly had “a very good quarter,” and newer treatments for cancer and diabetes should ensure average annual earnings growth in the mid-teens percentage range from 2015 to 2020, topping expected industry growth of about 12 percent. Lilly earned $530 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with $728 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier..  Excluding items, the company earned 87 cents per share, well above the analysts’ average estimate of 77 cents. Research spending fell 6 percent to $1.04 billion, which Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said was about 10 percent below his estimate. Results also benefited from increased stocking of its medicines by distributors, as well as a 42 percent jump in sales of animal health products to $750 million. Animal health is a growing focus for Lilly as people in developing countries rely more on farm animals for dietary protein and embrace companion animals. In January Lilly completed a $5.4 billion purchase of Novartis AG’s NOVN.VX(NVS.N) animal health business, making its Elanco unit the world’s No. 2 animal-health group by revenue, up from No. 4. The company affirmed its full-year profit forecast of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, excluding special items. While earnings beat expectations, largely on cost-cutting, revenue was just in line, falling about 1 percent to $4.64 billion.  First-quarter revenue would have risen 5 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales abroad. Lilly shares were down less than 1 percent at $71.83 in morning trading, amid a moderate downturn for the drug sector.

237,LLY,US STOCKS-Wall St little changed; health stocks rally,"* Healthcare index rallies after Supreme court decision * UnitedHealth biggest boost to the Dow; Eli Lilly to S&P; * S&P; 500 healthcare index up 11.3 pct this year * May consumer spending highest in six years * Indexes up: Dow 0.06 pct, S&P; 0.13 pct, Nasdaq 0.14 pct   (Updates to early afternoon) By Tanya Agrawal June 25 (Reuters) - Healthcare stocks surged after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld tax subsidies key to Obamacare but the broader market was little changed in afternoon trading as concerns over the Greece debt crisis weighed. The S&P; 500 healthcare index rallied as much as 0.91 percent after the court ruled that the 2010 Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, did not restrict the subsidies to states that establish their own online healthcare exchanges. The index, which is up 11.3 percent for the year, constituted 15.1 percent of the S&P; 500 as of May 29. UnitedHealth Group jumped as much as 2.5 percent to $122.13 and was the biggest boost to the Dow. Among hospital operators, shares of Community Health Systems  were up 12.6 percent at $62.28 after touching a record high of $63.36, while shares of HCA Holdings rose 8.6 percent to $90.55 and Tenet Healthcare jumped 14.5 percent to $57.41. “We like healthcare stocks. Even if the economy were to dip a little bit, healthcare stocks won’t be as affected as other sectors like travel and consumer,” said Jeff Carbone, co-founder and Managing Partner of Cornerstone Financial Partners. “We are cautious on biotech but like hospital operators even though their valuations are on the higher side.” The S&P; 500 healthcare sector trades at 24.3 times analysts’ estimates of future earnings, while the S&P; 500’s forward P/E is at 17.6, according to Thomson Reuters data. At 13:16 a.m. ET (1716 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 11.07 points, or 0.06 percent, at 17,977.14, the S&P; 500 was up 2.65 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,111.23 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 7.19 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,129.60. Wall Street continued to take cues from the ongoing Greek debt crisis as the country failed again to clinch a deal with its international creditors, setting up a last-ditch effort on Saturday to avert a default next week. Euro zone finance ministers ended their third meeting in a week without agreement after the three creditor institutions put a final cash-for-reform proposal on the table in a showdown with Athens’s leftist government. Investors have also been keeping a sharp eye on economic data for signs of a recovery in the U.S. economy, which came to a crawl in the first quarter, as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.9 percent last month, the biggest gain since August 2009, after a 0.1 percent rise in April. Personal income increased 0.5 percent last month after a similar gain in April. Weekly jobless claims rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended June 20 but labor market conditions continued to tighten. IAC/Interactive shares jumped as much as 6.7 percent to $82.40 - a record high - after the company said it planned to list its dating business, which includes Match.com and mobile app Tinder. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,789 to 1,197. On the Nasdaq, 1,336 issues rose and 1,333 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 101 new highs and 28 new lows.

238,LLY,"Lilly cancer drug improves survival, raises blood clot risk: FDA","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co.’s experimental lung cancer drug necitumumab improved overall survival by an average of 1.6 months but also increased the risk of sometimes fatal blood clots, according to a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA’s review was posted on its website on Tuesday ahead of July 9 meeting of outside experts who will discuss the drug and recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Necitumumab is a second-generation monoclonal antibody for patients with stage IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In a 1,093-patient clinical trial patients who received necitumumab together with the chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin survived an average of 11.5 months compared with 9.9 months for patients who received gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. In the necitumumab group, 48 percent of patients experienced serious side effects compared with 38 percent of patients in the control group. There were 66 deaths in the necitumumab group of which 15, or roughly 3 percent, were deemed drug-related. There were 57 deaths in the control group, of which 10, or about 2 percent, were considered drug-related. Analysts on average expect the drug, if approved, to generate annual sales of $582 million by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for roughly 85 percent of all lung cancer cases. The squamous form accounts for about 30 percent of NSCLC cases. Lilly also tested the drug in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. The study was closed prematurely due to an imbalance in the number of deaths attributed to potential thromboembolic events, or blood clots. There was no offsetting difference in overall survival. The FDA is seeking the panel’s advice on whether the results of the non-squamous trial impact the benefit to risk assessment of the drug in squamous NSCLC. The overall incidence of thromboembolic events was 9 percent in the squamous NSCLC trial compared with 5 percent in the control group. In the non-squamous trial the incidence was 11 percent compared with 6 percent in the control group.

240,LLY,Britain's Immunocore raises $320 mln in record financing round,"DUBLIN, July 16 (Reuters) - Britain’s Immunocore completed Europe’s largest ever financing round by a private life sciences company on Thursday, raising $320 million from investors including Eli Lilly & Co, Malin and Woodford Investment Management. The Oxford-based biotech compnay said it will use the proceeds to accelerate its pipeline of new medicines it calls ImmTACs, next-generation cancer drugs that fight tumours in ways antibody drugs cannot. The investment by some of the healthcare sector’s “most highly regarded international institutions” is another endorsement of that technology, Immunocore Chief Executive Eliot Forster said in a statement. “This funding will be invaluable in assisting us to continue the rapid advancement of IMCgp100 in the clinic,” he said, referring to its most advanced drug, used to treat melanoma and which produced positive Phase I and II trial data in April. Immunocore’s drugs exploit the power of T-cell receptors — a part of the immune system — to recognise changes that occur inside cells during cancer or viral infection. ImmTACs then activate the immune system to kill targeted cells. Traditional antibody-based therapies only recognise changes on the surface of cells. Analysts believe that such treatments to exploit the power of the body’s immune system may extend patients’ lives significantly and generate tens of billions of dollars in annual sales. The funding represents further support for Immunocore’s technology, having already signed research and licensing agreements with Lily, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline  and AstraZeneca. Immunocore said the new funding was comfortably oversubscribed and a number of its existing investors took part. Irish life sciences investment firm Malin, which raised 330 million euros ($360.3 million) in one of Europe’s biggest life science stock market debuts in March, said on Thursday that it would seek to raise an additional 42 million euros via a private placement. It will sell the shares at 10.99 euros, above the 10 euro-per-share issue price in March, to help with its $80 million investment in Immunocore and said expressions of interest had already been received from existing shareholders. “From a Malin shareholder perspective, the opportunity to be involved in Immunocore is a significant one, and one that we have to take very seriously,” Malin CEO Adrian Howd, who will join the Immunocore board, told Reuters. “This has probably been one of the most overly subscribed and highly validated rounds I’ve ever seen for a relatively early stage biotech company. We have really landed something here that is of huge potential value.” Adaptimmune Therapeutics, which co-owns T-cell receptor engineering technology with Immunocore, launched an initial public offering in the United States recently and has a market capitalisation of $1.2 billion.

243,LLY,Eli Lilly shifts Alzheimer-drug study to USC,"(Reuters) - Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly announced Tuesday it will shift the funding for clinical trials of an early-stage Alzheimer’s treatment from the University of California San Diego to the University of Southern California. The study of solanezumab is a large part of the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study, a $100 million, 70-member consortium that has been headquartered at UCSD since its inception in 1991. However, the ADCS has been embroiled in litigation since the departure of its director of eight years, Dr. Paul Aisen, who moved to USC in June. In a lawsuit filed July 2, the UC regents accused USC of conspiring with Aisen and several of his colleagues, who also moved to USC in recent months, in an attempt to take the ADCS with them. The regents alleged that Aisen and his colleagues were blocking UCSD’s electronic access to the study results.

249,LLY,"Eli Lilly halts study of heart drug, stock tumbles","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co has stopped a late-stage trial of its closely watched cholesterol treatment after it proved ineffective, sending its stock down more than 9 percent and casting greater skepticism over the potentially lucrative class of medicines. The setback, announced by the company on Monday, also hit shares of Merck & Co Inc, which is now the only major drugmaker still moving aggressively ahead with a member of the novel family of drugs called CETP inhibitors.  “Today’s news is a negative for Lilly and we anticipate that investors will also likely read across negatively for Merck,”  Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. Merck stock fell as much as 2.5 percent.  Lilly’s drug evacetrapib, like rival CETP inhibitors, is meant to sharply raise “good” HDL cholesterol while cutting levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol. Current cholesterol fighters called statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, prevent artery-clogging by slashing LDL levels, but have little impact on heart-protective HDL. Lilly said it stopped the evacetrapib study on the recommendation of an independent data-monitoring committee, which cited insufficient efficacy of the drug. The study was not stopped due to safety concerns, Lilly added. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford had been counting on evacetrapib to be approved in 2017 and generate eventual annual sales of $5 billion for Lilly. He now expects no sales from the drug, even though Lilly will continue to test it in smaller ongoing studies.    Pfizer’s CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, was scrapped in 2006 after being linked to deaths in a large $800 million study, dashing the company’s hopes it would be approved and generate annual sales of over $10 billion. A second CETP inhibitor, Roche Holding AG’s dalcetrapib, was ditched in 2012 due to lack of benefit.  Merck is conducting a late-stage trial of its candidate, anacetrapib, that is expected to conclude in 2017.  In mid-stage studies, the Merck drug raised HDL levels by a whopping 138 percent, while cutting LDL by 40 percent. But the big question is whether it will safely reduce deaths, heart attacks and strokes - goals that have eluded its rivals. Analysts said Merck’s drug is the only major remaining CETP inhibitor and remains a potential strong competitor to two recently approved cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that can slash LDL levels 60 percent beyond reductions seen with statins alone. The PCSK9 inhibitors are Praluent from Regeneron Inc and Sanofi, and Repatha from Amgen Inc, both deemed potential blockbusters. Indianapolis-based Lilly is conducting no other late-stage trials of cardiovascular drugs, one of its seven key areas. Lilly said it will take a charge of up to $90 million, or 5 cents per share, in its fourth quarter due to the setback. Lilly shares were down 8 percent to $79.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.

253,LLY,"Lilly beats forecasts on cost cuts, raises 2015 view","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings due to cost controls and sales of new treatments for diabetes and cancer, keeping the U.S. drugmaker on track for its planned return to growth this year. Lilly raised its full-year profit forecast to reflect expected investment gains and lower spending on research and marketing.    “We are encouraged by the combination of Lilly’s new product cycle coupled with expense management, which we see driving healthy earnings growth over the next five years” or longer, J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. Lilly has been strapped with declining sales and earnings since 2011 after sales of its biggest products plunged due to competition from cheaper generics. But the Indianapolis drugmaker has refused to consider merging with another large drugmaker, saying its own pipeline of experimental drugs would restore earnings growth by 2015. Cyramza, the company’s new treatment for lung cancer, posted sales of $111 million in the quarter, while the company’s recently approved diabetes drug Trulicity pulled in $74 million.  One the company’s most promising drugs is Jardiance, following data last month from a large trial that showed the pill slashed deaths 32 percent among patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack. Jardiance had sales of just $15 million in the quarter, but analysts expect it to eventually post big sales if medical societies recommend early use of the drug.  Lilly expects a profit of $3.40 to $3.45 per share this year, excluding special items, from its earlier view of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. That would reflect growth of up to 24 percent over last year. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans on Thursday maintained her “hold” rating on Lilly, saying its shares trade at a premium to most rivals and already reflect the company’s improving earnings prospects and strong lineup of experimental drugs. Company sales rose 2 percent in the quarter to $4.96 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations. They would have risen 10 percent if not for the stronger U.S. dollar. Net quarterly profit rose to $799.7 million, or 75 cents per share, from $500.6 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.

258,LLY,Eli Lilly's Swiss lab closure worries animal rights group,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Eli Lilly’s plan to close a Swiss laboratory that conducts tests and experiments on live animals has caused concerns by a local animal welfare group over the fate of the facility’s hundreds of dogs, cats and livestock. The U.S.-based company said on Thursday it was working to secure new owners for many of the animals as its Elanco animal health company may shut the research center in the Swiss town of Saint-Aubin, about 25 kilometers (15.53 miles) southwest of the Swiss capital of Berne.  But Julika Fitzi, a veterinarian and lawyer who works with the group Swiss Animal Protection, worries many may be killed. “We want to work closely with Elanco to find individual places for as many of the animals as possible,” Fitzi said Thursday. “These animals have earned a future that includes more than being killed.”  Fitzi said the laboratory houses about 350 dogs, 170 cats, 280 sheep, cattle and pigs and about 200 mice, figures that Eli Lilly didn’t confirm, and she had been told by the company last month it did not need her group’s help in finding them new homes. The expected closure comes as Eli Lilly looks to concentrate some of its Swiss research activities in Basel following its acquisition of the animal health business of Novartis earlier this year for $5.8 billion.  Its Saint-Aubin research and development facility has been the site of bioanalytics and clinical pathology research, as well as research and in-vitro screening work in relation to animal parasites. Elanco’s spokeswoman Maria Zampaglione said on Thursday the company will make a final decision on the Saint-Aubin research site later this month. She said that if it is closed the company’s primary plan for so-called “companion animals” such as cats and dogs would be “transfer of ownership to other facilities and employee pet owners.” “We have already identified the appropriate relocation options for all livestock, companion animals and fish on the site,” Zampaglione told Reuters in an email. What to do with animals used in research and testing which are no longer needed due to age or the ending of a research program, is an issue for many companies. European rival Bayer’s animal health unit in Germany says on its website that it placed 3,000 animals including cats and dogs with adoptive owners after they were no longer needed for research. However, animal testing itself by companies and research bodies such as universities remains a sensitive and controversial issue. In 2009 Novartis’s then Chief Executive Daniel Vasella had the front and rear of his Austrian holiday home doused with fuel and set alight and a family grave desecrated by activists who Vasella called “terrorists”. Windows of Novartis employees’ cars were also smashed. According to Switzerland’s federal veterinary office, the number of animals used in experiments in the country has fallen to around 600,000, from 2 million in the 1980s. Swiss law requires humane treatment of laboratory animals, but isn’t specific about what should happen to animals no longer wanted. “There are no requirements for what is done with the animals after tests, except that they cannot be used two times in a very stressful trial,” said veterinary office spokeswoman Nathalie Rochat.

261,LLY,REFILE-UPDATE 1-China firm loses 5 years of financial documents as truck stolen,"(Removes extraneous sentence in last paragraph on Elanco couldn’t be reached for comment as company has commented) SHANGHAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China Animal Healthcare , part owned by Eli Lilly and Co, said on Wednesday it was hunting for five years-worth of financial documents that were lost after the truck carrying them was stolen as the driver took a lunch break. The documents were stolen while being transported from a storage facility in China’s northern Hebei province to the company’s headquarters in nearby Beijing. China Animal Healthcare, whose shares have been suspended since March and which is in the middle of an investigation of its accounts, said in an earlier filing on Monday the truck had been stolen on Dec. 4 in the city of Baoding. The loss of such a large trove of documents will be a concern to investors at a time when China regulators are cracking down on corporate bad behaviour and trying to bolster confidence in the country’s markets and regulators. The firm said the loss included “original financial documents of the Group for the four financial years ended 31 December 2014 and for the current year.” It added these related to its chemical drug operations and not its vaccine business. Eli Lilly owns 20 percent of the Hong Kong-listed firm. China Animal Healthcare did not say in the statements if it had copies of the lost documents, but added it was making efforts to retrieve them from various sources. Calls to the company on Wednesday were not answered The firm said in the Monday statement it had set up a special investigation group (SIG) to look into the incident. “Based on the findings of the investigation by the SIG, no suspicious person has been identified in the incident,” it said, adding that local police had said similar thefts were common in the area. Police had later found the vehicle, but the documents had been removed, the statement added. Eli Lilly’s animal healthcare division Elanco Animal Health invested around $100 million for its stake in China Animal Healthcare in 2013, according to a statement from the company at the time. “We are concerned and have urged the board and company chairman since (the share suspension) to take steps to properly resolve the situation,” Elanco said in emailed comments to Reuters late on Wednesday. A China-based spokeswoman for Eli Lilly said she was unable to comment on the story.

262,LLY,Lilly 2016 revenue outlook falls short but Jardiance boosts shares,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday forecast 2016 revenue below expectations but said that its Jardiance diabetes treatment grabbed market share during the fourth quarter, which helped shares rise as much as 3 percent.  Lilly’s head of diabetes, Enrique Conterno, told investors on a conference call that new data released in September about Jardiance’s favorable effect on heart health had caused a surge in new patients to the drug. John Boris, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said shares were also helped by the company’s statements on the call that it expects to have data in the fourth quarter of this year from a late-stage trial of its Alzheimer’s disease treatment, solanezumab. It also said it may begin late-stage trials this year of another high-profile Alzheimer’s treatment, which belongs to a different class called BACE inhibitors. Earlier on Tuesday, the company said in a news release that it expected revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion for 2016, below the average analyst estimate of $21.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The drugmaker’s adjusted profit forecast of $3.45 to $3.55 per share also fell short of analysts’ expectations of $3.65. Analysts said the forecast was “very conservative” and pointed to uncertainty on foreign exchange trends. Foreign exchange headwinds account for about $675 million of the $1 billion miss on the revenue forecast, Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.  Excluding foreign exchange headwinds, the forecast represented a growth of mid to high single digit, “which is quite healthy versus peer companies,” they wrote.  Lilly estimated earnings of $2.28-$2.33 per share for 2015, below its forecast of $2.40-$2.45, citing an after-tax charge of about 12 cents per share related to the acquisition of rights to a glucagon nasal spray from Locemia Solutions. Lilly has recently launched its Jardiance treatment for diabetes and Cyramza drug for colon and lung cancer.  Jefferies analysts said they expected Lilly to raise its forecast during the year as the rollout of new drugs continues.

Taltz works by blocking a protein that causes inflammation, which is believed to play a role in development of the autoimmune disorder characterized by red skin and thick, unsightly, scaly white patches. In large, late-stage clinical trials, ixekizumab led to significant skin clearing compared with a placebo and also helped patients who did not respond to Amgen Inc’s blockbuster treatment Enbrel. “Today’s approval provides patients suffering from plaque psoriasis with another important treatment option to help relieve the skin irritation and discomfort from the condition,” Julie Beitz, from the FDA’s Office of Drug Evaluation, said in a statement.

Excluding Boehringer’s U.S. generics business - sold to Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc at the beginning of this year - and the effect of currency swings, sales rose 5.3 percent.

Eli Lilly’s new Jardiance diabetes treatment, sold together with Boehringer, earlier this year began stealing market share from rival drugs in its class, bolstered by clinical trials showing it slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

271,LLY,Independence of compliance reviews is questioned in drug firm settlements,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some major U.S. drug companies have hired their own auditors to perform compliance reviews mandated in government settlements over alleged civil violations, such as paying kickbacks or off-label drug promotion, according to federal records reviewed by Reuters. Third-party compliance reviews are playing an increasingly large role in helping the government ensure companies fulfill their obligations in federal settlements. But unlike the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general does not prohibit companies from hiring firms with whom they have existing business ties. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that practice creates conflicts of interest and could impair outside reviewers’ independence. “If the goal of this whole thing is to have an energetic and independent reviewer ferreting out mistakes and potential fraud within the company, do not put them under the financial thumb of the people who have millions of dollars at stake in keeping the audit work,” said Kevin Outterson, a professor of health and corporate law at Boston University. Several large drug makers - including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Sanofi and Allergan Inc. - have relied on their existing or previous auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) or Ernst & Young (EY), to also serve as compliance reviewers, according to corporate filings and a list of reviewers. The health agency’s inspector general provided the list of reviewers hired by drug companies in response to a Reuters Freedom of Information Act request. The inspector general typically settles civil claims through the use of a “corporate integrity agreement” mandating various reforms. These five-year deals often require the hiring of an independent compliance consultant known as an “independent review organization,” which is tasked with reviewing internal policies and data, such as payments to doctors. In exchange, the inspector general’s office agrees not to exclude a company from participating in Medicaid and Medicare. Susan Gillin, an attorney in the inspector general’s office, said she agreed that “theoretically, a potential conflict of interest exists.” But she said her agency has not observed any problems with weak oversight by auditors serving in dual roles. Such arrangements are allowed, she said, as long as the firm is not involved in corporate management or advising on policies it will also review. “We have very few repeat parties to corporate integrity agreements,” she said.  While some companies have had multiple settlements over the years, they typically cover different alleged violations, or conduct committed by companies that, between settlements, became part of a different firm through an acquisition, Gillin said. Spokespeople for Novartis, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi all said they disclosed their business relationships to the inspector general, which reviewed them. A spokesman for Allergan Plc. said the arrangement predated the company’s acquisition by Actavis in March 2015. Executives at PwC and Ernst & Young told Reuters they believe their dual work auditing and conducting compliance reviews are not in conflict and that they comply with all applicable regulations. The compliance reviewers “are independent in fact and in appearance,” said EY Vice Chair Ron Hauben. Nancy Beacham, a partner at PwC, said the firm adheres to federal standards for all public company auditing engagements. “We abide by the rules of what we can and cannot do,” she said. Some legal experts who see a conflict in the dual role say it can be exacerbated by the fact that accounting firms are generally paid more for their audit work than for these sorts of compliance reviews. For example, prior to Allergan Inc’s acquisition by Actavis in March 2015, the company disclosed that in fiscal year 2012, it paid Ernst & Young more than $5 million in audit fees, compared with more than $440,000 it paid the firm for compliance work performed under the corporate integrity agreement. “Work with a major company is an important contract, and an established contractor isn’t going to be independent,” said Brandon Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said such arrangements could weaken enforcement. “If the firms enforcing the agreements aren’t independent,” he told Reuters in a statement, that “defeats the purpose of the agreements.” While some companies hire their auditors as reviewers, the majority of the more than two dozen public companies reviewed by Reuters that have or had corporate integrity agreements - such as Pfizer, CVS Caremark and Eli Lilly - do not hire their own auditors and instead opt for consulting or law firms. Pricewaterhouse’s current dual clients for audits and compliance reviews include Novartis and Merck, according to the list provided by the health agency’s inspector general. GlaxoSmithKline previously engaged its auditor, PwC, for a compliance review which ended in 2012. EY currently performs dual work for Sanofi and it previously did dual work for Allergan Inc. prior to its acquisition. GlaxoSmithKine, Novartis and Merck have all been involved in multiple settlements with the U.S. government since 1991 to resolve a range of criminal and civil claims, according to a recent report by the nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen. [ID: nL2N17122L] GlaxoSmithKline has paid nearly $8 billion in federal fines between 1991 and 2015 - the most of any drugmaker, according to the Public Citizen report. A GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman said the company has greatly improved its compliance by taking steps such as eliminating payments to doctors who speak on the company’s behalf and ending sales incentives based on prescription volumes. Novartis, in 2010, settled civil charges of paying kickbacks to doctors who spoke at corporate events, and signed a corporate integrity agreement. The company now faces another civil lawsuit filed by federal and state prosecutors, which alleges that kickbacks to doctors continued for nearly a year after it signed its 2010 corporate integrity agreement with the health agency’s inspector general. Novartis has sought to dismiss the case, saying it makes “sweeping” allegations of a “decade-long, nationwide fraudulent scheme based on just fifteen doctors.” ",6022016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pharma-conflicts/independence-of-compliance-reviews-is-questioned-in-drug-firm-settlements-idUSL2N18O1A8

The rating actions  apply to roughly $7.8 billion of debt outstanding at Mar. 31, 2016. A full list  of the rating actions is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Lilly is facing a manageable patent expiry period, with roughly 22% of total  sales at risk through 2018. Nearly half of those sales come from biologics,  which generally experience relatively moderate sales decline once their patents  expire.  --Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line organic growth during 2016-2018  with the annualizing of patent expiries and continued strength in established  and new products. --Fitch believes Lilly's late-stage pipeline, particularly strong in treatments  for diabetes and cancer, offers the company numerous opportunities to sustain  longer-term growth. --Lilly's leaner cost structure, growth of patent-protected products and new  product launches should pave the way for margin expansion in 2016 as sales  rebound. --Fitch forecasts that Lilly will generate solid free cash flow (FCF; cash flow  from operations minus capital expenditures and dividend payments) in 2016. --The rating incorporates moderate share repurchases, targeted acquisitions and  incremental dividend increases through the forecast period. Manageable Patent Expiry Risk: Lilly faces patent expiries for Erbitux in  February 2016 (3% of firm sales), Effient in October 2017 (2% of firm sales),  Strattera in May 2017 (4% of firm sales), Cialis in November 2017 (12% of firm  sales) and Forteo in December 2018 (7% of firm sales). However, Erbitux and  Forteo are biologics, which generally lose sales to biosimilar competition at a  much slower pace than small molecules (Cialis) do when experiencing generic  competition. As such, Fitch views the company's patent expiry risk as  manageable. Lilly recently exited its significant patent expiry period which essentially  began in 2014. Its largest selling drug, Cymbalta, lost U.S. patent protection  in December 2013 and European patent protection in August 2014. Cymbalta  accounted for roughly 24% of total company sales during 2013 and accounted for  only 7% in 2015. Evista lost U.S. market exclusivity in March 2014 and now  accounts for approximately 1% of total firm revenues. To date, no biosimilar  competition to Humalog has entered the market, despite its May 2013 patent  expiry. Rebound With Patent-Protected Products: Fitch expects Lilly will return to  top-line organic growth during 2016-2018, achieving annual sales in excess of  $20 billion, including meaningful foreign exchange headwinds. In our view,  currently marketed drugs including Cyramza (cancer), Trulicity (diabetes), Taltz  (psoriasis), Jardiance (diabetes) and Tradjenta/Jandueto (diabetes), in  aggregate, show reasonable intermediate-term growth potential.  Pipeline Underpins Long-Term Growth: Lilly has improved its growth prospects for  the intermediate- to longer term, as it has been making significant progress in  building its late-stage pipeline. The company has a number of late-stage drug  candidates, and recently launched Basaglar (diabetes), Cyramza (cancer),  Jardiance (diabetes), Portrazza (cancer), Trulicity (diabetes) and Taltz  (psoriasis). Late-stage candidates include potential treatments for cancer,  diabetes, lupus, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis. The company has partnered  with Boehringer Ingelheim in its efforts to develop diabetes medications as well  as evaluate therapy combinations in treating cancer. Support for Margin Expansion: Lilly improved its EBITDA margin to 26% during the  LTM ended March 31, 2016, versus 25.1% in the prior year period. A 220bps  improvement in SG&A; (as a percentage of sales) more than offset a 60bps decline  in gross margin and a 90bps increase in R&D; (as a percentage of sales). Fitch  expects the company will continue to improve gross margins during the  intermediate term through the growth in recently- or to-be-introduced,  higher-margin products. Growing FCF: Fitch forecasts higher FCF of approximately $800 million during  2016 as Lilly generates organic growth and improved margins. Expected cash flow  from operations of roughly $4.2 billion should be sufficient to fund  approximately $2.2 billion in cash dividends and $1.1 billion in capital  expenditures. Fitch believes FCF will continue to grow from 2015 levels over the  long run, as revenues and margins advance. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch incorporates roughly $2 billion - $3  billion in aggregate share repurchases from now through 2018, funded with cash  on hand. However, Fitch models only incremental dividend increases and targeted  acquisitions during the same forecast period, which will not likely stress  Lilly's balance sheet. We believe Lilly would moderate its share repurchases if  it were to pursue somewhat more strategic acquisitions. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Lilly's 'A'/Stable Outlook include: --Moderate organic revenue growth, mostly offset by the negative effect of  foreign exchange movements during 2016; --Improving margins driven by favorable mix, including new product introductions  and the achievement of meaningful cost reduction; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of roughly $800 million during 2016; --Leverage to remain below 1.6x during 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a positive rating action in the near term, future  developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision of the  Rating Outlook to Positive or an upgrade in the intermediate term, include: --Revenues continue to expand for patent-protected products, including Cyramza,  Jardiance, Taltz, Tradjenta/Jandueto and Trulicity; --The company attains adequate cost controls and integration synergies to  generate sufficient profitability while limiting increases in debt to maintain  leverage sustainably below 1.3x; --Lilly deploys cash conservatively with a bias of using cash flow as opposed to  debt issuance to fund transactions.  Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a Negative  Outlook and/or a one-notch downgrade to 'A-'/'F2' include: --Operational stress from factors including, but not limited to, patent expiries  drive leverage durably above 1.7x; --Inability to maintain relatively strong operations through the intermediate  term, patent expiry period; --FCF deteriorates without the expectation of a timely trend reversal. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch assumes Lilly will maintain adequate liquidity,  supported by FCF generation, balance sheet cash and availability on its  revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2016, the company had approximately $3  billion of cash and short-term investments, $1.2 billion of unused committed  bank credit facilities, and roughly $3.8 billion in noncurrent investments.  At March 31, 2016, Lilly had approximately $7.8 billion in debt outstanding.  Fitch believes the company's long-term debt maturities are manageable with  roughly $635 million maturing in 2017, $800 million in 2018, and $600 million in  2019. Fitch's forecast assumes that Lilly will refinance these maturities with  new debt issuances. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Eli Lilly & Co. Inc.'s ratings as follows: --Long-Term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'; --Bank loan rating at 'A'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

276,LLY,"Lilly sales beat estimates, helped by newer drugs","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly sales, fueled by newer drugs, and predicted average annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent through the end of the decade due to its growing roster of medicines.  The Indianapolis drugmaker, whose earnings growth resumed last year after three years of tumbling sales caused by competition from generic drugs, said investors can count on annual dividend increases in 2016 and beyond.  Revenue rose 9 percent to $5.4 billion in the second quarter, topping Wall Street estimates of $5.15 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said surprisingly strong sales were seen for some older brands, including its Cialis impotence treatment and Forteo osteoporosis drug, which both benefited from higher prices.  Newer drugs that are key to Lilly’s turnaround are the main focus of investors, and performed well in the quarter. Trulicity, an injectable diabetes treatment that competes with Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster Victoza, posted sales of $201 million, while sales of two-year-old Cyramza for stomach and lung cancer vaulted 68 percent to $147 million. Wall Street expects another new drug for type 2 diabetes, Jardiance, to become a $3 billion-a-year product by 2021 because of recent clinical data showing that it slashes the risk of cardiovascular death.  But Jardiance, a so-called SGLT-2 inhibitor that competes with Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana, posted a disappointing $40.1 million in quarterly sales as U.S. health regulators weigh whether to include the favorable new clinical data in its label. Once in the label, Lilly could promote the data to doctors and drive sales higher.  In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Lilly said it plans to unveil data later this year on solanezumab, its experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, and could seek  U.S. approval within months for a breast cancer drug that could compete with Pfizer Inc’s similar Ibrance. “Lilly is doing an excellent job, coming out of its patent cliff, and is poised to release a lot of new drugs,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Lilly’s net income rose 24.5 percent to $747.7 million, or 71 cents per share, in the quarter. Excluding special items, including restructuring charges,  Lilly earned 86 cents per share, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lilly reaffirmed it expects full-year earnings of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, excluding special items. That would reflect growth of up to 5 percent over last year.

280,LLY,Incoming Lilly CEO says dealmaking will be a focus,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co will likely step up the pace of making deals with other drugmakers while aggressively developing new drugs on its own, the company’s newly appointed chief executive said on Wednesday. Company veteran David Ricks will become CEO on Jan. 1, after John Lechleiter, 62, retires by year-end, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker said. Ricks, 49, has served since 2012 as president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, where he has overseen late-stage drug trials and global marketing. He has also held other leadership positions at Lilly. The incoming CEO said Lilly will “keep the foot on the gas” in terms of innovation, and predicted his experience in his first job at Lilly, in business development from 1996 to 1998, would come into play as CEO. “I wouldn’t look for a dramatic change, but maybe (expect) an acceleration of interest in partnering externally,” he said. “There are a lot of good ideas out there.” Although the tempo of acquisitions and drug-development partnerships will likely increase, he said Lilly would steer clear of the kinds of mega-mergers that have hurt productivity of other drugmakers. Many large drugmakers, when faced with generic competition for their biggest products, have tied the knot with big rivals to bolster earnings. Pfizer Inc, for instance, merged with Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth between 2000 and 2009, but its laboratories failed to produce a single important medicine over that period. Lilly has remained steadfastly independent, avoiding disruptions from such deals.   Lechleiter, an organic chemist who became Lilly’s CEO in 2008, has steered the company through a painful series of patent expirations by developing new medicines such as lung cancer treatment Cyramza, and Trulicity and Jardiance for type 2 diabetes. Its drugs in development include solanezumab, for Alzheimer’s disease, and treatments for pain and headache. After three years of tumbling sales caused by generic competition, Lilly revived earnings growth last year. It has predicted at least 5 percent average annual revenue growth through the end of the decade, thanks to its growing roster of prescription drugs. It plans to launch 20 new drugs between 2014 and 2023. Lechleiter joined Lilly in 1979 as a senior organic chemist and later took on roles that involved pharmaceutical product development, regulatory affairs and operations. Shares of Lilly have risen 60 percent since Lechleiter took the helm 8 years ago, compared with an 86 percent advance for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers over the same period.

282,LLY,UPDATE 1-Lilly CEO Lechleiter to retire; David Ricks to succeed,"(Adds details) July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co  said on Wednesday John Lechleiter, its chief executive of eight years, would retire by the end of the year and would be succeeded by senior vice president David Ricks on January 1. Lechleiter, who  became the CEO in April 2008, has steered the company through a steep patent cliff by reinvigorating its pipeline. Lilly has made great progress building an R&D; engine that has the potential to launch 20 new products in 10 years beginning in 2014, Lechleiter noted in the company’s earnings release on Tuesday. Earnings growth at the Indianapolis-based drugmaker resumed last year after three years of tumbling sales. The company’s internal pipeline is well positioned to mitigate patent losses during the next decade, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover wrote on Tuesday. Lilly on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly sales, fueled by newer drugs, and predicted average annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent through the end of the decade due to its growing roster of medicines. Lechleiter joined Lilly in 1979 as a senior organic chemist and later took on roles that involved pharmaceutical product development, regulatory affairs and operations. Since 2012, Ricks has served as president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, the largest of the company’s five businesses in terms of sales. The unit also accounts for nearly half the company’s mid-to-late-stage pipeline assets. The 140-year old company’s shares were unchanged in premarket trading.

289,LLY,"Lilly breast cancer drug stumbles, but trial continues","(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co on Wednesday said it would continue a late-stage trial of its experimental breast cancer drug in combination with a widely used treatment even though an independent panel determined the combination therapy failed to meet its interim effectiveness goal.  The independent data monitoring committee recommended the trial continue without modification through the first half of 2017 despite the fact that its interim look at the data suggested the combination treatment was not delaying progression of the disease. Lilly shares were down 1.2 percent in morning trading. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said continuation of the study, called Monarch 2, would allow Lilly to better understand abemaciclib, which is also being tested in a variety of other trials. The Monarch 2 study included 669 patients who had previously failed to benefit from anti-estrogen treatment for metastatic breast cancer. It compared combined use of abemaciclib and anti-estrogen therapy fulvestrant with fulvestrant alone. Lilly’s drug is from the same new class of breast cancer treatments as Pfizer Inc’s recently approved Ibrance, which brought in more than half a billion dollars in second-quarter sales. They work through a new mechanism, by blocking the proteins CDK 4 and CDK 6. Lilly is evaluating abemaciclib as a single agent in breast cancer patients who have not derived enough benefit from prior treatments. Three other studies are testing abemaciclib with other drugs. Abemaciclib, which was granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) breakthrough therapy status for breast cancer last year, is also being tested for use in lung cancer. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 40,000 of the 220,000 American women diagnosed with breast cancer die each year, the CDC estimates.

The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abemaciclib, in combination with anti-estrogen drug fulvestrant, in patients with a form of advanced breast cancer. The trial will continue into the first half of 2017 and will include a final analysis of progression-free survival, overall survival and safety data, the U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday.

The injectable drug, called fasinumab, blocks Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a protein involved in transmission of pain signals. Its new mechanism of action could make it a non-addictive alternative to opioids, the drugmakers said in a joint release. It is being tested in late-stage trials for osteoarthritis pain and in mid-stage studies for chronic low back pain. Rival U.S. drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co and Pfizer Inc plan by 2018 to seek approval for their similar medicine, tanezumab, which they are testing under a $1.8 billion deal reached in 2013. Teva, a generic drugmaker that sells the branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, will pay Regeneron $250 million upfront and share equally in fasinumab’s ongoing research costs of about $1 billion. U.S.-based Regeneron, best known for its blockbuster Eylea treatment for macular degeneration, has been attempting for years to develop an anti-NGF drug for pain, but has been stymied by safety concerns over the new approach.

The S&P; 500 held at slightly lower levels after the release of minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed  policymakers appeared confident on the eve of the U.S. election that the economy was strengthening enough to warrant interest rate increases soon. Expectations among investors remained high that the Fed will raise rates in December. But traders said volume was lighter than usual, with many market participants leaving work early ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday. “Today is the beginning of the holiday, so many people have left or are on their way,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “You could continue to see a little bit an overreaction either way just because there are less people. But I think next week - Monday, Tuesday - I think then you’ll see the market digest a little bit, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the market back off.” Eli Lilly was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500, falling  11.5 percent after the company said it would stop developing its Alzheimer’s drug following a trail failure. Biogen, which is developing a similar drug, fell 4.2 percent. At 2:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 36.67 points, or 0.19 percent, to 19,060.54, the S&P; 500  had lost 1.33 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,201.61 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 17.40 points, or 0.32 percent, to 5,368.95. The Dow hit a record intraday high for the third straight day earlier in the session, and was on track to close at an all-time high. The S&P; 500 industrial sector rose 0.7 percent to a record high, helped by a report showing a strong jump in durable goods orders in October due to demand for machinery and other equipment. Caterpillar rose 2.7 percent to $96.16, while the Dow transportation average rose 0.8 percent. Deere  jumped 10.8 percent to a record high after the farm equipment maker reported a much smaller-than-expected decline in profit. The industrial sector had risen roughly 7 percent since the U.S. election on bets that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to boost infrastructure spending would benefit the industry. In other healthcare shares, Juno Therapeutics sank 27 percent after reporting that two patients died during a trial of its leukemia drug. The market will be closed on Thursday and close early on Friday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 295 new highs and 19 new lows.

305,LLY,Lilly revenue beats as diabetes drug sales rise,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s (LLY.N) quarterly revenue beat analysts’ estimates, driven by higher demand for its diabetes drug Humalog as well as its newer products such as Trulicity and Basaglar. The company, whose earnings growth resumed in 2015 after three years of tumbling sales caused by competition from generic drugs, has been aggressively developing new drugs. Eli Lilly said newer drugs generated sales of $706.7 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $252.5 million a year earlier. “Newly launched products, including Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance and Taltz, led Lilly’s volume-driven growth in 2016,” said Chief Executive Officer David Ricks, who assumed the role on Jan. 1.              Trulicity, an injectable diabetes treatment that competes with Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO) blockbuster Victoza, reported sales of $337 million, easily beating consensus estimates of $278 million, according to Evercore ISI. Basaglar, Lilly’s cheaper knock-off version of Sanofi’s (SASY.PA)  slow-release insulin Lantus, generated sales of $39.5 million. The drug has seen a much faster uptake by U.S. medical insurers than expected. Lilly said global sales of Humalog rose about 3 percent to $819.8 million in the fourth quarter, well above the consensus estimates of $755 million, as Lilly cut the drug’s U.S. price to better compete with other mealtime insulins, including Novo Nordisk’s widely-used NovoLog. Revenue rose 7.2 percent to $5.76 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $5.55 billion. Lilly, which is recovering from the failure of its high-profile Alzheimer’s drug solanezumab, has also been stepping up the pace of dealmaking. The company said earlier this month that it would buy CoLucid Pharmaceuticals Inc CLCD.O for about $960 million, bolstering its migraine therapy pipeline. The drugmaker’s net income rose to $771.8 million, or 73 cents per share, from $478.4 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier.    However, the company’s profit missed estimate. Excluding special items, Lilly earned 95 cents per share, below the 98 cents per share analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Higher expenses, along with lower-than-expected non-operating income, led to the overall earnings miss, Credit Suisse analysts said. Lilly’s shares were up marginally at $75.05 in premarket trading on Tuesday.  The Indianapolis-based drugmaker’s shares fell about 11 percent on Nov. 23, after the company announced solanezumab’s results. The stock has risen about 10 percent since then.

Accera’s AC-1204 failed to induce a statistically significant improvement in symptoms versus a placebo in patients with a mild-to-moderate form of the disease, the company said. The announcement comes weeks after Merck & Co Inc said it would halt a late-stage trial of its Alzheimer’s drug, verubecestat, after determining that it had no chance of working. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental drugs called BACE1 inhibitors which target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on this mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen as well as Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. But Accera’s drug targets what the company believes is the cause of the build up of amyloid. Decades before diagnosis, the brain exhibits a decreasing ability to metabolize glucose - the main food of the brain. It is this metabolic deficit that then gives rise to the deposition of amyloid, Accera Chief executive Charles Stacey told Reuters. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Industry analysts say any treatment that successfully interferes with the cause of the disease would be virtually guaranteed multi-billion dollars in sales. After a successful mid-stage trial, Accera decided to tweak AC-1204’s formulation. But that change led to lower levels of bioavailability – or the degree by which the drug’s active ingredients are absorbed by the blood – Stacey said. “We were essentially under-dosing our patients and that’s why the primary endpoint was not met.” Accera has now fixed the formulation and is readying itself for another late-stage study, pending discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the CEO said. The company already sells a product called Axona, launched in 2010, as a medical food labeled for the dietary management for Alzheimer’s patients. Both Axona and AC-1204 work on the same principle, but differ in terms of bioavailability, taste, format etc, Stacey said. In 2013, the FDA censured Accera, saying Axona had been “misbranded” and did not satisfy the definition of medical food. But the issue has since been resolved and Axona remains on the U.S. market.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use gave a positive opinion on the drug, Kevzara, citing its ability to reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. (bit.ly/2p00FDy) Sarilumab, the active substance of Kevzara, a treatment for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, works by blocking a protein called IL-6, which is associated with inflammation.  The panel’s opinion will now be reviewed by the EMA. In October, U.S. regulators declined to approve sarilumab because of manufacturing deficiencies at a Sanofi plant in France. Regeneron said in February that it was planning to resubmit a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab. The drug has already been approved by Canadian health regulators to treat rheumatoid arthritis.  More than 23 million people worldwide suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. Current treatments include the widely used methotrexate as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Other IL-6 inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis include Roche Holding AG’s approved Actemra and Johnson & Johnson’s experimental sirukumab.

319,LLY,Neurotrope Alzheimer's drug data fails to impress; shares crater,"(Reuters) - Neurotrope Inc’s shares more than halved after data from a small trial on the company’s Alzheimer’s drug failed to impress investors, the latest in a series of setbacks in the quest for an effective treatment for the memory-robbing disease.  Two doses of Bryostatin-1 were tested against a placebo, in addition to the standard treatment, in 147 patients with moderate-to-severe disease over a twelve week period.  A total of 113 patients completed the study and Neurotrope said the higher 40 microgram (mcg) dose showed “very modest efficacy”.  However, patients on the 20 mcg dose met the main goal by showing improvement on a scale called the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), which is used to measure cognition levels, the company said.  Data showed a mean increase of 1.5 on the SIB, compared with a decrease in the placebo group of 1.1, or a p-value of less than 0.07.  When performing a hypothesis test, the p-value helps determine the significance of the results.  Statistical significance in late-stage trials is typically defined by a p-value of 0.05 or less, but this was more an exploratory mid-stage study and the data is encouraging, Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Alkon said on a call with analysts.  In patients who received the 20 mcg dose but did not complete the study, Bryostatin-1 failed to meet the main goal, the company added.  “This may not be what investors were expecting, and we expect some to view the p-values as a failure,” Aegis Capital analyst Robert LeBoyer said. In a longer study, “the decline in the placebo patients would be expected to widen the difference between the two groups, showing greater treatment effect and statistical significance,” LeBoyer said. The drug, which comes from a marine source, is designed to address an underlying cause of the disease by inducing growth of synapses in the brain and preventing cell death.  The compound was originally evaluated as a treatment for cancer. Following its failure as an oncology treatment, Neurotrope inked a deal to supply the expensive compound to National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Neurotrope, which now has an exclusive license for a synthetic version of the drug, hopes to discuss a path forward with the U.S. health regulator, it said.

320,LLY,UPDATE 4-Neurotrope Alzheimer's drug data fails to impress; shares crater,"(Reuters) - Neurotrope Inc’s shares more than halved after data from a small trial on the company’s Alzheimer’s drug failed to impress investors, the latest in a series of setbacks in the quest for an effective treatment for the memory-robbing disease.  Two doses of Bryostatin-1 were tested against a placebo, in addition to the standard treatment, in 147 patients with moderate-to-severe disease over a twelve week period.  A total of 113 patients completed the study and Neurotrope said the higher 40 microgram (mcg) dose showed “very modest efficacy”.  However, patients on the 20 mcg dose met the main goal by showing improvement on a scale called the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), which is used to measure cognition levels, the company said.  Data showed a mean increase of 1.5 on the SIB, compared with a decrease in the placebo group of 1.1, or a p-value of less than 0.07.  When performing a hypothesis test, the p-value helps determine the significance of the results.  Statistical significance in late-stage trials is typically defined by a p-value of 0.05 or less, but this was more an exploratory mid-stage study and the data is encouraging, Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Alkon said on a call with analysts.  In patients who received the 20 mcg dose but did not complete the study, Bryostatin-1 failed to meet the main goal, the company added.  “This may not be what investors were expecting, and we expect some to view the p-values as a failure,” Aegis Capital analyst Robert LeBoyer said. In a longer study, “the decline in the placebo patients would be expected to widen the difference between the two groups, showing greater treatment effect and statistical significance,” LeBoyer said. The drug, which comes from a marine source, is designed to address an underlying cause of the disease by inducing growth of synapses in the brain and preventing cell death.  The compound was originally evaluated as a treatment for cancer. Following its failure as an oncology treatment, Neurotrope inked a deal to supply the expensive compound to National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Neurotrope, which now has an exclusive license for a synthetic version of the drug, hopes to discuss a path forward with the U.S. health regulator, it said.   Existing treatments only lessen symptoms or slow disease progression, and there is laundry list of crushing disappointments in the effort to find an effective way to reverse cognitive decline that affects more than 5 million Americans with Alzheimer’s. Neurotrope’s shares fell as much as 56.6 percent to $8.16 in morning trading.

323,LLY,"CORRECTED-U.S., China accelerate beef talks; deal possible by early June","(Corrects paragraphs 2 and 18 to show China will likely test for residue of beta-agonists in beef instead of banning beef from cattle fed the drugs) * Deal to resume U.S. exports to China raises farmers’ hopes * U.S. producers set to track cattle to meet China rules * Agreement would prohibit use of growth-promoting drugs * U.S. may challenge top beef exporter Brazil in China By Tom Polansek CHICAGO, May 19 (Reuters) - Talks on restarting U.S. beef exports to China are moving fast and final details should be in place by early June, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Friday, allowing American farmers to vie for business that has been lost by rival Brazil. As part of a trade deal, U.S. ranchers are set to face tests over the use of growth-promoting drugs to raise cattle destined for export to China and to log the animals’ movements, according to the USDA. The two sides are negotiating to meet a deadline, set under a broader trade deal last week, for shipments to begin by mid-July. Finalizing technical details in early June should mean beef companies, such as Tyson Foods Inc and Cargill Inc , can sign contracts with Chinese buyers to meet the deadline, the USDA said. China banned U.S. beef in 2003 after a U.S. scare over mad cow disease. Previous attempts by Washington to reopen the world’s fastest-growing beef market have fizzled out. But now, the quick progress of the latest talks is raising hopes of U.S. farmers. “Both sides feel the urgency to get it done by the deadline,” said Joe Schuele, spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation, which represents Tyson, Cargill and other meat companies. China’s embassy in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment. The timing of the new deal allows U.S. producers to benefit as Brazil, the world’s top beef exporter, is struggling with scandals and rival shipper Australia is suffering from a drought that is hurting production, analysts said. China accounted for nearly one-third of the Brazilian meat packing industry’s $13.9 billion in exports last year. But in March, Beijing briefly banned Brazilian imports after Brazilian police accused inspectors of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meat. JBS SA, the world’s largest meatpacker, was involved in the probe and in separate allegations this week that Brazil’s president conspired to obstruct justice with the company’s chairman. The food-safety probe hit Brazil’s beef exports, which fell by 24.6 percent to $378 million in April from March, according to Abiec, an industry group that represents meat processors accounting for about 90 percent of Brazil’s exports. “This is a very opportune time for the U.S. to step up,” said Derrell Peel, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. Chinese appetite for beef has climbed due to its expanding middle class. In 2003, its imports totaled just $15 million, or 12,000 tons, including $10 million from the United States, according to the USDA. Brazilian exporters hope China’s trade deal with Washington will not inflict more pain on meat companies in the country because U.S. exporters will be targeting different, higher-end customers, said Abrafrigo, an association representing Brazil’s small meatpackers. To reopen U.S. trade, Beijing has accepted a U.S. proposal in principle that would require producers to document the locations where cattle raised for beef exported to China are born and slaughtered, the USDA said. The system would be less onerous than tracking cattle throughout their entire lives, during which they can be kept at up to four different locations. Peel, a livestock expert, estimated that U.S. producers trace the movements of less than 20 percent of the nation’s cattle. Under another proposed rule, U.S. beef exported to China must pass tests showing it is free from detectable residue of a class of growth-enhancing drugs known as beta-agonists that includes Elanco’s Optaflexx, according to the USDA. Elanco, owned by Eli Lilly and Co, declined to comment. A trade group for veterinary drug companies, the Animal Health Institute, said China should accept beef from cattle raised with beta-agonists because they are safe. U.S. beef shipments to China also will have to come from cattle under the age of 30 months, according to the USDA. Most U.S. cattle will meet that requirement, the U.S. Meat Export Federation said. The terms of the deal are a win for the United States over Canada, which is approved to ship only frozen beef to China. China already bans meat from Canadian cattle fed with Optaflexx, according to the Canadian Meat Council. It also requires that Canadian beef be produced from cattle that are less than 30 months old and can be tracked to the farm where they were born.

328,LLY,CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis drug succeeds in trial,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said on Wednesday its oral rheumatoid arthritis drug succeeded in a late-stage study on patients who had not adequately responded to standard treatments. The drug, upadacitinib, is a once-daily pill belonging to a class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors, which block inflammation-causing enzymes called Janus kinases. Pfizer Inc’s Xeljanz is the only U.S.-approved JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis – a chronic inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks tissues in the joints, affecting more than 23 million people. AbbVie’s success comes almost two months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected baricitinib, a rival JAK inhibitor developed by Eli Lilly and Co and Incyte Corp. If approved, upadacitinib could help AbbVie lower its reliance on its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira – the world’s top selling medicine that will soon face competition from biosimilars in the United States. AbbVie’s shares were up 1.4 percent at $68.81 on Wednesday afternoon. They earlier hit a session high of $69.32, their highest since August 2015. In AbbVie’s 12-week study on upadacitinib, two doses of the drug were tested against a placebo on patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. AbbVie said 64 percent of patients given a 15-milligram dose and 66 percent of patients given a 30-mg dose experienced a 20 percent reduction in symptoms, measured using a commonly used rheumatoid arthritis scale. The company said only 36 percent of patients given a placebo experienced a comparable drop in symptoms, meaning upadacitinib cleared the trial – the first of six testing the drug on patients with various cases of rheumatoid arthritis. As data from the other trials comes in, upadacitinib might prove to be more effective than Lilly and Incyte’s baricitinib, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said. Rheumatoid arthritis is currently treated with older drugs such as methotrexate, Pfizer’s JAK inhibitor Xeljanz as well as injected biologics such as Amgen Inc’s Enbrel and AbbVie’s Humira. Humira generated more than $16 billion in sales last year, but competition is looming. AbbVie is trying to block the launch of an FDA-approved biosimilar, made by Amgen, arguing that its patents on Humira offered protection until at least 2022. AbbVie is also evaluating upadacitinib for several other autoimmune conditions, including psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Holford estimated peak sales of $3.5 billion for the drug across all diseases. Pfizer’s Xeljanz generated sales of $927 million last year. (This story corrects paragraph 3 to clarify that Xeljanz is the only U.S.-approved JAK inhibitor.)

333,LLY,"Lilly signals long delay for arthritis drug, shares fall","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday outlined a likely multi-year delay for its experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug with blockbuster sales potential, and disappointed investors sent its shares down nearly 4 percent. In a surprise move, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April declined to approve the drug, baricitinib, calling for an additional clinical study. Lilly said on Tuesday the FDA was concerned about a small, but increased number of potentially dangerous blood clots seen in baricitinib patients in clinical trials. The company and partner Incyte Corp said compiling fresh data to address FDA safety concerns would delay its resubmission by a minimum of 18 months, followed by a fresh review of the new data by FDA prior to a final decision. Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said he does not expect a U.S. launch of baricitinib until 2021. Lilly said it disagrees with the FDA assessment of the drug that won approval in Europe and Japan, and remained confident in its clinical benefit and multibillion-dollar sales potential. EU and Japanese regulators updated the product’s label to include the increased safety risk. Eli Lilly shares were down 3.8 percent at $81.54. Incyte was down 3.3 percent at $133.75. The company said it was delaying a Phase III trial of baricitinib in psoriatic arthritis until next year, pending discussions with FDA, but was moving ahead with trials of the medicine in atopic dermatitis and lupus. Lilly said it believes it has patent protection through the end of the next decade. On a call with analysts, Lilly also outlined a renewed focus in oncology and said it would set a very high bar for moving medicines into late state development. Lilly said it wants to build an oncology portfolio of medicines capable of changing the standard or care or able to become the foundation of multiple combination therapies. It also said it was actively looking for early phase and preclinical oncology assets that can be combined with existing products. Excluding items, Lilly reported second-quarter profit of  $1.11 per share, topping average analysts’ expectations by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and it raised its full-year forecast to reflect that. It now expects adjusted earnings of $4.10 to $4.20 per share, up from $4.05 to $4.15, and sees 2017 revenue of $22 billion to $22.5 billion up from a prior view of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion. Strong demand for new products, including diabetes treatment Trulicity and Taltz for psoriasis, helped drive the results.

334,LLY,"US STOCKS-Strong earnings boost S&P;, Dow; Alphabet drags Nasdaq","* Caterpillar jumps after raising forecast for second time * McDonald’s hits all-time high as sales jump * Eli Lilly, 3M fall after posting quarterly results * Dow up 0.49 pct, S&P; up 0.34 pct, Nasdaq down 0.06 pct (Adds details, changes comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal July 25 (Reuters) - The S&P; and the Dow were higher in late morning trading on Tuesday, helped by a string of strong quarterly earnings from companies, including McDonald’s and Caterpillar, while the Nasdaq was little changed as a fall in Alphabet weighed. Shares of McDonald’s rose 3.5 percent and hit an all-time high after the fast-food giant posted the biggest rise in sales at established restaurants globally in five years. Caterpillar was up 4.7 percent, touching a more than five-year high, after the company raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. “It looks like earnings are coming in better than expected and that’s giving the market a jump this morning,” said Ken Moraif, senior adviser at Money Matters, a wealth management and investment firm. However, Alphabet fell 3.3 percent, after the tech giant warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices. The S&P; tech index has been the best performing sector this year, but there have been concerns about stretched valuations, putting earnings from big tech companies in the spotlight. The sector fell 0.3 percent on Tuesday, leading the decliners. Amazon and Facebook, part of the high-flying “FANG” stocks, report results later this week, while Apple is due to report next week. “My concern is that it seems like these companies can do no wrong and when you have so much concentrated on such a small group, eventually these stock prices are going to become unrealistic,” Moraif said. “If the rest of the market isn’t there to support them, it could impact the sector in a big way.” Earnings are expected to have climbed 8.8 percent in the second quarter, compared with an 8 percent rise estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 10:50 a.m. ET (1450 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 105.3 points, or 0.49 percent, at 21,618.47. The S&P; 500 was up 8.53 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,478.44, slightly easing from its all-time high of 2,479.58. The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.63 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,407.17. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the energy index’s 1.66 percent rise leading the gainers. The Fed kicks off a two-day meeting later in the day and while no rate hike is expected due to subdued inflation, the central bank’s statement on Wednesday will be parsed for clues on the pace of future rate hikes. DuPont was up 1.5 percent after beating estimates for profit and results. Eli Lilly was down 3.3 percent, while 3M fell 5.7 percent after reporting results. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,808 to 944. On the Nasdaq, 1,679 issues rose and 1,006 fell.

339,LLY,UPDATE 3-CVS Health's dull Q3 forecast overshadows profit beat,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp forecast current quarter profit below Wall Street estimates and said it has been ordered to cooperate with investigations into possible false claims submitted to a government healthcare program and drug pricing. Shares of the company, which also reported its fourth straight decline in quarterly comparable sales, fell 1.4 percent to $78.03.   The No.2 U.S. drug store chain, however, reported quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates on strength in its pharmacy benefits management business (PBM), which helped to more than offset a 2.6 percent drop in same-store sales.      “Retail side of the business is struggling even if PBM was better than expected and actually pretty strong for what was expected,” Jeremy Bryan, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. CVS Health forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of  $1.47 to $1.50 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $1.63, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said the attorney general for the Southern District of New York has sought information on possible false claims submitted in connection with reimbursements for Medicare Part D prescription drugs. (bit.ly/2ul9Tfy)   Minnesota’s attorney general has also sought information from it regarding a probe into pricing of insulin and epinephrine drugs, CVS Health said.     Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co and Novo Nordisk were named in a proposed class action lawsuit, which alleged the firms simultaneously hiked insulin prices by over 150 percent in the past five years. Mylan NV, the maker of emergency epinephrine injectors EpiPen, is facing investigations after it doubled the cost of its syringes used to treat severe allergic reactions. On Monday, a class-action lawsuit was filed against CVS Health, which alleged the company colluded with third-party PBMs to raise generic drug prices. “The allegations against us made in this proposed class action suit are built on a false premise and are completely without merit,” CVS Health spokesman Michael DeAngelis said in a statement on Tuesday. Net income attributable to drug store chain rose about 19 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30.   Excluding items, the company earned a profit of $1.33 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.31. Net revenue rose 4.5 percent to $45.69 billion, beating expectations of $45.37 billion.

345,LLY,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-FDA declines to approve J&J; arthritis drug sirukumab,"(Reuters) - (The Sept. 22 story has been corrected to remove the reference to Humira being a Jak-inhibitor in the final paragraph. Humira is a TNF-inhibitor.)  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has declined to approve Johnson & Johnson’s rheumatoid arthritis drug sirukumab, saying additional clinical data is needed to further evaluate its safety, the company said on Friday. The FDA’s decision is in keeping with an advisory panel’s recommendation in August that the FDA reject the drug. Panelists were concerned about an imbalance in the number of deaths in patients taking sirukumab compared with those taking a placebo. The most common causes of death were major heart problems, infection and malignancies. “We are disappointed by this development as we feel the data accumulated to date support the efficacy and safety of sirukumab,”  He added that the company is seeking to “gain a full understanding of FDA requirements for U.S. approval” and plans to have a follow-up discussion with the agency. Sirukumab blocks a cytokine in the body known as interleukin 6 that can contribute to the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder that affects more than 23 million people worldwide. Other drugs in the same class include Roche Holding AG’s Actemra and Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Kevzara. Analysts on average had expected sirukumab, which would be known as Plivensia if ultimately approved, to generate annual global sales of $426 million by 2020. J&J; originally developed sirukumab with GlaxoSmithKline Plc but GSK recently said it would end the program and return all rights to J&J.; GSK had rights to the drug in North, Central and South America.  In April the FDA declined to approve a rheumatoid arthritis drug made by Eli Lilly and Co and partner Incyte Corp, saying additional clinical data was needed to determine the most appropriate doses of the drug, baricitinib, and to further characterize safety concerns. Baricitinib belongs to a class of drugs known as Jak inhibitors that include Pfizer Inc’s Xeljanz.

358,LLY,"Lilly mulls sale, other options for animal health business","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) said on Tuesday it is considering the sale of its Elanco animal health business and expressed optimism that its rejected rheumatoid arthritis drug would pass muster with U.S. regulators when it resubmits its application. Lilly, which reported third-quarter profit that exceeded  analysts’ expectations and raised its adjusted full-year earnings forecast by 5 cents per share, promised to provide an update on its plan for Elanco by the middle of 2018.  It said other options include a spinoff or keeping the business that generated global sales of $740.6 million in the quarter, but is facing increased competition. The Elanco news is not surprising given a trend in the pharmaceutical industry to break off diversified businesses from the parent company, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. Lilly shares, which were up more than 18 percent for the year, fell more than 2 percent, possibly on fears of stiff competition for some of the its important new growth drugs, such as the diabetes treatment Trulicity and psoriasis medicine Taltz. “Anything that causes concern over those two assets would be reasons why people might consider selling,” Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said. Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) is expected to soon get U.S. approval for a Trulicity rival with a heart safety benefit that the Lilly medicine cannot claim. Lilly is also girding for biosimilar competition for its top-selling insulin product Humalog. The company said it was on track to resubmit a U.S. marketing application for its potential blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, before the end of January, with a Food and Drug Administration decision six months later. The FDA initially rejected the medicine, asking for more safety data. Christi Shaw, Lilly’s president for bio-medicines, said the resubmission would include real world data from patients using the drug in Europe, where it is approved and exceeding the company’s early sales expectations.       Shaw said she was “very optimistic” about the prospects for U.S. approval, and that the rate of concerning blood clots was no higher than would be expected from the patient population not taking the medicine. Lilly now expects full-year adjusted profit of $4.15 to 4.25 per share on revenue of $22.4 billion to $22.7 billion. The company said it had the momentum to achieve its 5 percent compound annual growth rate target through 2020. Excluding items, Lilly earned $1.05 per share for the quarter, topping analysts’ expectations by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results were helped by efforts to cut costs and streamline operations.  Revenue rose 9 percent to $5.66 billion, driven by growth of newer products led by Trulicity with sales of $527.7 million.  Lilly also said its manufacturing sites sustained minimal damage from hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last month. It said it sees no product supply risk or other significant financial impact from the storm at this time. Eli Lilly shares fell $2.22 to $85.24.

362,LLY,FDA approves Novo Nordisk diabetes drug Ozempic,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Novo Nordisk A/S’s diabetes drug Ozempic, setting the stage for a heated battle with Eli Lilly & Co’s Trulicity. Ozempic, known generically as semaglutide, will compete with others in a class known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates the production of insulin. Ozempic is a once-weekly injection that Novo Nordisk hopes will take market share from Trulicity, which has been cutting into sales of Novo Nordisk’s once-daily Victoza. Novo Nordisk is also developing an oral form of semaglutide.  The company said it plans to price the drug at $676 per prescription, which it described as “at parity” to current market-leading drugs in the same class.     The approval comes as Novo Nordisk faces pricing competition to its existing diabetes products. The company is banking on Ozempic to help drive the overall growth of the GLP-1 market, which includes Trulicity and AstraZeneca Plc’s once-weekly Bydureon. Novo Nordisk is betting that Ozempic’s proven heart benefit and weight-loss advantage over rival products will increase its attractiveness both to physicians and insurers. Analysts on average expect annual sales of Ozempic to reach $3.17 billion by 2023, with sales of Trulicity, which was approved in the United States in late 2014, reaching $3.71 billion over the same period, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts at Credit Suisse estimate that by 2022 Novo Nordisk will have captured roughly 60 percent of the GLP-1 market compared with an expected 53 percent in 2017. They expect Lilly’s GLP-1 share will increase to 33 percent from 29 percent over the same period. Diabetes drug companies are under pressure from insurers to offer attractive prices in return for a formulary position, the list of medicines approved by an insurance company for reimbursement.  Dr Todd Hobbs, Novo Nordisk’s chief medical officer, has said the company planned to “take a very competitive strategy with the payors” in order to gain market share. He said the company has strong relationships with prescribers built up over the years with Victoza. GLP-1 products are also expected to face increased competition from biosimilars, less expensive versions of rival diabetes drugs.

366,LLY,Lilly's 2018 forecast beats on strength of new drugs,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) on Wednesday forecast 2018 profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street estimates on strong demand for recently launched drugs such as Trulicity and Taltz. Lilly said it was expecting a regulatory decision on its rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib, whose marketing application was initially rejected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The drugmaker also expects to launch a new indication for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis. Investors have been fearful about competition for its newer growth drivers such as psoriasis drug Taltz and diabetes drug Trulicity, with a rival for Trulicity by Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) expected to be launched soon. Competitive threats will be important to watch over the course of the year given the importance of Trulicity and the broader diabetes business to Lilly, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a client note. Lilly’s top-selling, older drugs have been facing the threat of competition, with Sanofi SA’s (SASY.PA) follow-on biologic to insulin product Humalog getting U.S. approval and the launch of a generic to rival Viagra causing concern for its Cialis franchise. The company said it expected 2018 revenue of $23.0 billion-$23.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $4.60-$4.70 per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $23.07 billion and earnings of $4.64 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lilly reaffirmed its expectation of at least 5 percent average annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, on a constant currency basis. The company also lowered its 2017 earnings forecast to  $1.56-$1.66, due to asset impairment, restructuring and other charges. It reiterated its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast of $4.15-$4.25 per share. The stock, which had been up about 18 percent this year, was little changed before the bell on Wednesday.

369,LLY,UPDATE 1-U.S. FDA approves new diabetes drug from Merck and Pfizer,"(Reuters) - A new drug developed by Merck & Co and Pfizer Inc won U.S. approval on Wednesday to treat type II diabetes, the Food and Drug Administration said, adding another competitor to a growing class of treatments. The oral drug, known generically as ertugliflozin, will be sold under the brand name Steglatro and compete with AstraZeneca Plc’s Farxiga, Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Jardiance. All four drugs belong to a class known as SGLT2 inhibitors, which work by causing patients to expel excess glucose through urine. Merck and Pfizer won approval for Steglatro as a single therapy and in fixed-dose combinations with Merck’s diabetes drug Januvia or with metformin, an older generic treatment typically given to newly diagnosed patients. Those will carry the brand names Steglujan and Segluromet, respectively. The approvals and prescribing information were listed on the FDA and Merck websites. The companies, in an emailed statement, said they expect to make the medicines available in early 2018. Under the collaboration Merck, which already has a sizable diabetes sales force, will sell the drug in the United States.   As type II diabetes progresses, many patients need additional treatments to better control blood sugar levels. Januvia is the top-selling drug in a class known as DPP-4 inhibitors. The combination with ertugliflozin will compete with combination products from rivals, including Eli Lilly’s Glyxambi, which combines Jardiance with its DPP-4 treatment Tradjenta. Jardiance, in a large study, demonstrated its ability to significantly cut the risk of heart-related deaths and hospitalizations from heart failure, claims now included in its label. Invokana has demonstrated similar heart protective qualities in high risk patients. Analysts are forecasting eventual annual sales exceeding $1 billion for Steglatro, but Merck and Pfizer will likely need to show similar heart protections if their medicine is to be competitive. Results of AstraZeneca’s heart safety trial of Farxiga are expected in 2019. Diabetes, characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, affects roughly 30 million Americans, and can lead to severe damage to a range of organs in the body, including the eyes and kidneys and significantly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Novo Nordisk, the world’s biggest insulin maker, launched Ozempic, known generically as semaglutide, in the United States this year after it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December. Ozempic is a once-weekly injection that Novo Nordisk hopes will take market share from Trulicity, which has been cutting into sales of Novo Nordisk’s once-daily Victoza. The drug has now been included on a 2018 formulary list of acceptable medicines drawn up by Express Script, one of the biggest pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the United States, with a tier 3 status, a Novo spokeswoman told Reuters.

380,LLY,UPDATE 2-FDA panel against higher dose of Lilly-Incyte arthritis drug,"(Reuters) - An arthritis drug developed by Eli Lilly & Co and Incyte Corp should not be approved at a 4-milligram dose, advisers to the U.S. FDA voted on Monday, in a setback to the drugmakers that were counting on the treatment as a future blockbuster. The advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, voted in favor of approving a lower, 2 milligram (mg) dose of the drug, baricitinib, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. An approval of just the lower dose would severely limit the business opportunity for Lilly  and Incyte , analysts have said. Baricitinib, which is already approved in over 40 countries including in the European Union and Japan, is used largely as a 4 mg dose that is crucial for patients who do not respond to available therapies, Christi Shaw, the president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, said in an interview. The vote comes a year after baricitinib was rejected by the FDA, which cited serious safety concerns. The agency has continued to raise those concerns, particularly the risk of developing deadly blood clots. The setback to Lilly and Incyte also comes as major drugs are already vying for a bigger slice of the lucrative market for rheumatoid arthritis drugs. Pfizer’s Xeljanz, AbbVie’s Humira and Amgen’s Enbrel are all approved to treat the disease. While the advisory committee agreed that both the 2 mg and 4 mg doses of baricitinib were effective, panelists were divided on the question of the drug’s safety. The committee’s recommendations, although not binding, are typically followed by the FDA. A patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis since the age of two described her struggles with the painful disease, telling the committee she had to resort to “eight aspirin a day for 10 years” back in the 1970s when treatment options were limited. “There is nothing left for someone like me,” the patient said, urging the committee to vote in favor of both doses. The panel voted 10-to-5 in favor of approving the 2 mg dose, noting that the drug’s benefits outweighed its risks. The panel also voted by a similar margin against approving the 4 mg dose. Lilly expects a decision from the FDA by the end of June, when it will announce further plans, Shaw said.

383,LLY,"Eli Lilly's profit beats on strong sales of diabetes, cancer drugs","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) lifted its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday after comfortably beating estimates for the first quarter, largely due to strong sales of its diabetes and cancer drugs and lower expenses. The upbeat results soothed some investor concerns after U.S. FDA advisers late on Monday voted against approving a higher dose of its rheumatoid arthritis drug. The company’s shares rose as much as 1.6 percent in early trading as sales of most of its promising drugs, including diabetes drug Trulicity and cancer treatment Alimta, beat estimates. Its best-selling diabetes drug, Humalog, which faces competition from biosimilars, brought in $791.7 million in sales, beating the consensus estimate of $680 million, according to brokerage Credit Suisse. Sales of the newly launched Trulicity were $678.3 million, beating the estimate of $614 million. Alimta, which is being tested in combination with Merck’s (MRK.N) Keytruda to treat a type of lung cancer, raked in about $500 million, also beating analysts’ estimates. However, sales of its psoriasis drug, Taltz, were disappointing, falling short of analysts’ estimate by about $50 million. Lilly reported net income of $1.22 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $110.8 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.34 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.13. The company’s operating expenses fell 5.3 percent to $2.67 billion in this quarter. Lilly raised its 2018 profit forecast to $5.10 to $5.20 per share from $4.81 to $4.91 per share, saying the increase was partly due to lower Medicaid utilization and more commercial insurance coverage for several products.

389,LLY,Lilly to buy Armo Biosciences for $1.6 billion to bolster cancer pipeline,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said on Thursday it would buy Armo BioSciences Inc for about $1.6 billion to expand its portfolio of drugs that helps body’s immune system fight cancer as the U.S. drugmaker chases rivals in a lucrative market. Lilly’s offer of $50 per share in cash represents a premium of 68 percent to Armo’s Wednesday close. Armo’s shares were trading close to the offer price at $49.73, while Lilly’s shares rose 1.2 percent to $80.22. The deal comes just four months after Armo went public and would give Lilly access to the smaller drug developer’s lead candidate, pegilodecakin. “This is one of the fastest post-IPO exits we’ve seen in a long time,” said Jefferies analyst Biren Amin, adding that the deal value looked fair considering that Armo has presented data for the drug in different types of cancer. The treatment is being evaluated in pancreatic cancer patients in a late-stage study as well as in earlier stage trials for other forms of cancer.  Armo’s lead treatment is a naturally occurring immune growth factor called a pegylated interleukin-10 that stimulates the survival, expansion and killing potential of a particular type of white blood cell in the immune system. Armo has several other drugs in various stages of pre-clinical development and that would give Lilly “a path and footing” in the immuno-oncology space, according to Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler.  Immuno-oncology is one of the faster growing areas of cancer treatment with major players such as Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb closely competing for a bigger share of the market. Last month, Lilly appointed the director of Thoracic Medical Oncology at New York University’s School of Medicine to lead its medical development in this area.  Lilly said it expected to close the deal by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Credit Suisse was the exclusive financial adviser to Lilly and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz its legal adviser.  Centerview Partners LLC was the lead financial adviser, while Jefferies LLC also advised Armo on the deal. Gunderson Dettmer was its legal adviser.
