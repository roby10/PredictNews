1,GD,"US, allies' share of world military spending shrinking-study"," * Combined total likely to plunge by 2015   * Decline partly reflects China’s growing economic weight   * US share dropping to 39 pct by 2015 from 41 pct in 2010   By Jim Wolf   WASHINGTON, July 7 (Reuters) - The share of world military spending by the United States and its closest allies is likely to plunge by 2015, but still account for nearly two-thirds of the total, a new study by a prominent research group said.   The Council on Foreign Relations’ survey, distributed on Thursday, took into account outlays by the United States, NATO allies, Japan, South Korea, Israel and Saudi Arabia.   This group’s combined share of global military spending fell from 77 percent in 2005 to 72 percent in 2010 and appeared set to drop to 66 percent by 2015, the researchers found.   “The U.S. and its allies retain a dominant share but it declines dramatically,” Paul Swartz, the report’s co-author who monitors links between international economics and military spending at the council, said in a telephone interview.   The study uses International Monetary Fund growth estimates for all countries surveyed.   Washington’s share of global military spending is set to decline to about 39 percent by 2015 from 41 percent in 2010 with U.S. economic growth projected to lag that of powers such as Russia, China and India, the study showed.   Even if the United States were to keep military spending at a constant share of its own GDP, its shrinking weight in the world economy would cut its share of the global total.   China’s share of world GDP is projected to jump to 11.8 percent in 2015, more than double its share in 2005, according to the IMF. The U.S. share, by contrast, is forecasted to fall to 21.1 percent from 27.7 percent in 2005.   President Barack Obama called in April for cutting projected national security spending $400 billion, by some counts about 6 percent, through 2023 as part of a deficit reduction push.   If the Obama plan is implemented, the U.S. share will fall further. And if China or some other rising power opts to make military spending a higher priority, U.S. military pre-eminence could decline even more sharply, the study showed.   Such trends have potentially significant implications for the sale of weapons made by top Pentagon suppliers such as Lockheed Martin Corp  (LMT.N), Boeing Co (BA.N), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), General Dynamics (GD.N), BAE Systems Plc  (BAES.L) and Raytheon Co  (RTN.N) .   The cost of military hardware has grown more than inflation, the study said, such that today’s spending “results in less procurement” than in the past.   It found that the United States must spend about 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on weapons just to maintain existing levels of equipment.   Post World War Two U.S. military spending as a percent of GDP has ranged from a 15 percent high in 1952 during the Korean War to a low of 3.7 percent in 2000, a period of relative calm before the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacking attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Today, it accounts for just under 6 percent, according to the study.   A decline in the U.S. share of world military spending seems likely in the absence of a new sense of insecurity, the study said.   Sebastian Mallaby, a globalization expert at the council, said in a related piece on Thursday in the Financial Times newspaper that the United States could sustain its global dominance if it has the political will to allocate a rising share of GDP to the Pentagon.

5,GD,Defense contractor sales miss Wall Street view,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Two top U.S. defense contractors posted sales that missed Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday in a sign that federal efforts to rein in military spending are starting to take a toll.  General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) nonetheless managed to beat earnings expectations, reflecting their drive to scale back less-profitable businesses at a time of declining U.S. defense spending.  With lawmakers in Washington battling over how to cut the nation’s deficit — and whether to raise the debt ceiling or to allow the U.S. to slip into default — defense contractors acknowledge their businesses will be in the cross-hairs in the coming years.  “Although it is not yet certain today how or when the debt ceiling is raised, it is clear that defense spending will play a role in helping to ease the country’s economic challenges,” said General Dynamics Chief Executive Jay Johnson, on a conference call with analysts.  He expects the heaviest cuts to the nation’s defense spending to come in the second half of the current decade rather than in the next few years.  Army General Martin Dempsey, the nominee to become the nation’s top military officer warned a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday that it would be “extraordinarily difficult” to cut $800 billion from the nation’s defense budget.  That $800 billion cut represents a doubling of President Barack Obama’s prior proposal that some in Congress have suggested as way to reduce the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt.  Despite the weak revenue, both General Dynamics and Northrop raised their full-year profit forecasts, a day after the No. 1 Pentagon supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), did likewise.  “We are increasing our EPS guidance and maintaining our guidance for cash generation, despite a reduced top line outlook that reflects the realities of our current budget environment,” said Wes Bush, CEO of Northrop, with businesses that include making unmanned spy planes.  Both companies’ shares fell on a day that U.S. markets were broadly lower, spooked by the debt talks and worries of a slowing U.S. economy. General Dynamics shares were down 3 percent to $68.24 and Northrop fell 4.5 percent to $62.46. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  Fellow defense contractors Raytheon Co (RTN.N) and L-3 Communications (LLL.N) are scheduled to report their earnings on Thursday.  Northrop raised its 2011 profit target to a range of $6.75 to $6.90 per share, which at its midpoint would represent an increase of a little under 1 percent from 2010. Its previous forecast implied a 2.5 percent drop. That move came even as it lowered its full-year sales forecast by 2 percent to $27 billion.  “While we think there will continue to be long-term margin pressure for defense names, Northrop continues to hold in well,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard, in a note to clients.  General Dynamics, which makes tanks, ships and Gulfstream jets, raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of $7.15 to $7.20 per share from continuing operations, representing growth of about 5 percent. Its prior forecast had implied growth of 3 percent.  Northrop has been moving to streamline its operations over the past year, and in March spun off its ship operations, citing little synergy with its other businesses that include drones and ballistic missile defense work. The spin-off created Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N).  Its second-quarter net profit fell 27 percent to $520 million, or $1.81 per share, compared with $711 million, or $2.34 per share, a year earlier, when Northrop recorded a large tax benefit.  Analysts, on average, had looked for profit of $1.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Northrop reported revenue of $6.56 billion, down 9.6 percent and shy of the  $6.98 billion analysts had expected.  General Dynamics’ second-quarter net income was $653 million, or $1.76 per share, up less than 1 percent from $648 million, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier.  Factoring out one-time items, profit came to $1.79 per share, above the $1.72 that analysts had forecast.  Revenue fell 2.8 percent to $7.88 billion, below the $8.24 billion analysts had expected.  As of Tuesday's close, General Dynamics shares were little changed for the year, while Northrop had risen close to 11 percent. The Dow Jones U.S. defense index .DJUSDN was up 6 percent for the year, a slightly lower gain than the overall U.S. market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX.

Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) spun off its ship operations in March, and ITT Corp (ITT.N) expects to spin off water and defense divisions by year-end.  “L-3 is the third defense company to go down the spin route (after Northrop and ITT), and investors have applauded these prior moves,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a note to clients.  L-3 said the spinoff would also help it avoid perceived conflicts of interest in business and that it followed a company strategic review.

10,GD,Debt impasse may pressure defense contractors-Moody's," * Payment disruptions could squeeze liquidity   * Blue-chip companies could still access capital markets   * Index surveys 53 companies in aerospace/defense sector   NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractors could face a liquidity squeeze from disrupted payments if the government fails to raise the debt ceiling, Moody’s Investors Service said on Friday.   “U.S. military contractors are already feeling increasing pressure from the ongoing deficit debate, political posturing and more stringent contract terms,” Russell Solomon, a Moody’s senior vice president, said in a statement.   Moody’s warned that companies with above-average dependence on revenue from the government and relatively limited existing liquidity were more vulnerable to a government shutdown.   Moody’s new Defense Contractor Liquidity Index surveys 53 public and private companies with primary operations in the aerospace and defense industry and calculates near-imminent available sources of liquidity relative to estimated annual U.S. government revenue.   While the more exposed group in the index contains three of the five largest defense contractors — General Dynamics (GD.N), Raytheon (RTN.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) — Moody’s said it believes these investment-grade companies could readily access the capital markets if unexpected payment disruptions occur for an extended period of time.   In a report on the sector, Moody’s said overall liquidity was reasonably robust, even though about half of the average company’s $11 billion in annual revenue stems from government business.   Average cash balances are about $1.2 billion, and almost 90 percent of revolving lines of credit remain undrawn and available for borrowing if needed, Moody’s said.

An SAIC-led team that included Boeing Co(BA.N), Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall was passed over.  BAE is partnered in its effort with Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N). General Dynamics is partnered with Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N).  The rival teams are to “develop competitive, affordable and executable designs for a new Army Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) over the next 24 months,” the Defense Department said in a statement.  The Pentagon’s top arms buyer, in a memo signed on Wednesday, approved the Army’s technology development strategy and said that a fixed-price type contract with incentive fee was appropriate for this phase of the program.  BAE Systems Land and Armaments won a $450 million contract and General Dynamics Land Systems was awarded a $439.7 million deal for the same phase of the program, the Defense Department said in its daily contract digest.  The SAIC-led team was very disappointed by the outcome, said Melissa Koskovich, a SAIC spokeswoman. “Before we can evaluate where we go from here, we will ask the government for a complete debrief,” she said.  Army Secretary John McHugh, citing the budget crunch facing the United States, said it was imperative to “continually address requirements as we build a versatile, yet affordable, next-generation infantry fighting vehicle.”  The Army hopes to design, develop, build and test the new infantry fighting vehicle over the next seven years, the statement said.  The Army said it would update its “analysis of alternatives” for the vehicle and conduct separate technical and operational assessment of existing non-developmental vehicles.  Results from this assessment, along with contractors design efforts, will “facilitate a full and open competition for the next phase” of the program, the Army said.  The new ground combat vehicle will be the first designed from inception for battlefields characterized by roadside bombs, or improvised explosive devices, as the military calls them.  It will provide armor protection and the capability to maneuver cross-country with a nine-man infantry squad, Army Chief of Staff General Martin Dempsey said in the statement.

22,GD,Fighters head towards showdown with pro-Gaddafi town,"WISHTATA, Libya (Reuters) - - Libya’s new rulers sent a column of extra fighters toward the tribal bastion of Bani Walid overnight, preparing a showdown with supporters of ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi, possibly including his sons or even Gaddafi himself.  Gaddafi’s whereabouts have been a mystery since rebel fighters stormed his Tripoli headquarters two weeks ago. Bani Walid, one of the few towns still in the hands of his followers, has refused to surrender despite a stand-off lasting days.  Officials from the interim ruling National Transitional Council said they had sent reinforcements after reports that Gaddafi had issued a call for the town to fight.  Reuters reporters saw a convoy of NTC forces pickup trucks heading toward Bani Walid with dozens of fighters clutching RPGs and shouting anti-Gaddafi slogans.  “We will move into Bani Walid slowly. There was a message in Bani Walid from Gaddafi this evening,” NTC unit commander Jamal Gourji said.  “He was rallying his troops and calling on people to fight. He is hiding in a hole in the ground, like Iraq,” he said, in a reference to late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, captured hiding in a hole nine months after he was toppled in 2003.  Outside the town on Wednesday residents leaving through a sun-scorched NTC checkpoint at the nearby settlement of Wishtata painted an increasingly desperate picture.  “People are terrorized,” said Salah Ali, 39. “But many still support Gaddafi because they were paid by the regime, because many have committed crimes and are afraid of arrest.”  Aid agencies have raised concerns about humanitarian conditions there and in the few other cities still under control of Gaddafi loyalists. Communications with them have been cut.  The NTC has sent envoys to neighboring Niger to try to stop Gaddafi and his entourage evading justice by fleeing across a desert frontier toward friendly African states. A convoy arrived in Niger this week, but Niger says Gaddafi was not in it.  “We’re asking every country not to accept him. We want these people for justice,” Fathi Baja, the head of political affairs for the National Transitional Council (NTC), told Reuters in Benghazi, saying the ousted leader may be close to the Niger or Algerian borders, waiting for an opportunity to slip across.  “He’s looking for a chance to leave,” Baja said.  Another senior NTC official said Gaddafi was tracked this week to an area in the empty Sahara of Libya’s south.  But NTC officials near Bani Walid in the north said they believed two of Gaddafi’s sons and possibly the leader himself were inside the town.  “That would explain why Bani Walid is resisting,” NTC negotiator Abdallah Kanshil said of reports of Gaddafi’s presence in the town. “His two sons are definitely there.”  The Pentagon said it knew nothing to indicate the fallen leader had left Libya. Niger, which took in his security chief this week, insisted Gaddafi had not crossed its border.  Washington said it had also contacted the governments of Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Burkina Faso — a swathe of poor former French colonies which benefited from Gaddafi’s oil-fueled largesse in Africa. The State Department urged them to secure their borders and to detain and disarm Gaddafi officials.  Gaddafi and his son Saif al-Islam are wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said any country where he was found should hand him over to be tried, remarks that were echoed by U.S. ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz.  With his overthrow, however, have come revelations of the extent to which U.S. and British officials were until recently cooperating with Gaddafi — once a pariah in the West but rehabilitated by Washington and London in the past decade.  Papers found by Reuters in Tripoli showed a British arm of U.S.-based General Dynamics was modernizing tanks and troop carriers for a feared brigade led by Gaddafi’s son Khamis, as recently as late January.  The firm said the military vehicles might have been part of a $135 million 2008 contract, part of what it termed at the time “the United Kingdom’s initiatives to improve economic, educational and defense links with Libya.”  Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said: “The lesson is that if you are going to sell weapons to dictators, at some point down the line you’re going to be deeply embarrassed.”  In al-Qalaa, a town about 120 km southwest of Tripoli, thousands of people gathered to bury the bodies of 35 people they said were discovered nearby, their corpses packed into a shipping container.  “There are still many crimes and graves, and we will discover them,” said Moqtar Fernanah, head of the military council for the western region, speaking at the funeral.  “Our answer will be to capture these criminals and turn them to the courts for fair trials. They will be punished in accordance to the crimes they committed.”  ",9072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya/fighters-head-towards-showdown-with-pro-gaddafi-town-idUSTRE7810I820110907

He is a former head of state, he will not come incognito into Niger. If he has to come, our government will be informed, and if that happens we will inform you of our decision.”	   A French military source said Gaddafi might have been preparing to meet up with the convoy in Niger and head for Burkina Faso. That country offered Gaddafi exile on Aug. 24 but says he has not been in contact about seeking refuge.	   U.S. ambassador Cretz said the 69-year-old fugitive was still a threat while at large: “A Gaddafi free in Libya could pose a continuing danger to the success of the new government to make sure its writ is spread throughout the country.”	   NATO powers which helped topple Gaddafi have satellites and intelligence resources that could help track fugitives. But Cretz, briefing reporters online, said: “We will participate to the extent that we are asked to, but as of right now it’s a question for the Libyan authorities to find Gaddafi.”	   Among other discoveries in the wake of the Gaddafis’ flight, a home video showing the former leader playing with a grand-daughter reveals a mix of playfulness and, possibly, paranoia: “Do you not love me?” he asks, repeatedly, in the film made by his son Saadi and obtained by Reuters. 	   His six sons and daughter came to form part of a ruling entourage in Libya that was widely despised during the 42 years Gaddafi was in power. On Wednesday, the NTC’s chief negotiator at Bani Walid, a tribal stronghold of Gaddafi support 150 km (100 miles) south of Tripoli, said he believed heir-apparent Saif al-Islam and another son, Mutassim, were in the town.	   Asked about suggestions that Gaddafi himself might be there, as senior NTC commanders said last week, Abdallah Kanshil said he was checking: “That would explain why Bani Walid is resisting. His two sons are definitely there.”	   A standoff with NTC fighters outside the town has lasted for days. Outside Bani Walid on Wednesday, residents leaving through a sun-scorched NTC checkpoint at the nearby settlement of Wishtata painted an increasingly desperate picture.	   “People are terrorised,” said Salah Ali, 39. “But many still support Gaddafi because they were paid by the regime, because many have committed crimes and are afraid of arrest.” 	   Aid agencies have also raised concerns about conditions for civilians in the coastal city of Sirte, Gaddafi’s birthplace and another redoubt of tribesmen still loyal to him. Libya’s southern desert is also not under the control of the NTC.	   Aid agencies and local Tuareg nomads report many black Africans — some of them possibly former mercenaries for Gaddafi, most just migrant workers — trying to flee south in fear of attack.	   Niger’s desert north is a vast area, the size of France, and awash with bandits, rebellious nomads and a growing number of al Qaeda-linked gunmen blamed for deadly kidnappings.

25,GD,Exclusive: Documents detail Western arms firm's Libya deal,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A major Western defense firm was upgrading military equipment for an elite Libyan security brigade just before an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, documents show, showing how the West tried to foster ties with him during his final years in power.  Less than a month before the start of the revolt, the British arm of U.S.-based General Dynamics was making arrangements to improve communications systems for tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers for the Khamis Brigade, which played a lead role in cracking down on the revolt, according to documents found by Reuters at a brigade base.  General Dynamics said the upgrade was never completed. But the documents illustrate in detail for the first time what weapons were involved in the deal and that the firm was doing business with Gaddafi’s forces on the eve of the uprising.  It said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary’s May 2008 contract with Libya — an 85 million pound ($136 million) deal to provide a tactical communications and data system as part of what it termed at the time “the United Kingdom’s initiatives to improve economic, educational and defense links with Libya.”  This was after Gaddafi, widely ostracized abroad for much of his 42-year rule because the West accused him of supporting terrorism, abandoned his program of mass-destruction weapons in 2003, returning Libya to mainstream international politics.  The Khamis Brigade, led by and named after one of Gaddafi’s sons, was the best equipped of Libya’s security forces and was directly involved in putting down the uprising in cities such as Misrata and Tripoli, where thousands of people were killed.  Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director with Human Rights Watch, said the brigades commanded by Khamis, and another Gaddafi son, Mutassim, were able to become so strong thanks in part to procurement from Western countries.  “These elite brigades ... had access to the most modern weapons,” he said. “We’ve documented arms sales from not just the usual suspects but also Western companies.  “I think the lesson is that if you’re going to sell weapons to dictators, at some point down the line you’re going to be deeply embarrassed.”  A letter from a General Dynamics UK project manager, Simon Kirkham, to Libya’s defense ministry dated January 25 was found this week in the Khamis Brigade’s bullet-scarred compound near Tripoli.  That date marked the start of anti-government protests in Egypt, to Libya’s east. Libya’s neighbor to the west, Tunisia, had already toppled its president and political analysts were predicting similar protests could erupt against Gaddafi.  The note, and an Arabic document accompanying it, listed 40 T-72 tanks, eight Palmaria artillery pieces, four BTR-60 armored personnel carriers, 10 Shilka anti-aircraft systems and two M-113 armored personnel carriers to be upgraded.  “These platforms are required to meet the proposed 1 April conversion deadline,” said the letter, which listed offices in England and Wales.  A spokesman for General Dynamics, Rob Doolittle, said he could not comment specifically on the documents without seeing them, but said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary’s May 2008 contract with Libya.  That deal came as “part of the United Kingdom’s initiatives to improve economic, educational and defense links with Libya,” a statement released at the time said.  “It will provide communications and data handling capabilities, together with technical and training support, to the Elite Brigade of Libya’s armed forces,” the release said.  Doolittle said the firm did not finish deploying the system, involving a process sometimes referred to as “conversion” — switching from one communications system to another — and did not train Libyan forces in its use.  A small group of General Dynamics UK employees working on the system were withdrawn from Libya in early February, he added.  Inside the Khamis Brigade compound, a narrow road cuts through rows of planted cypress trees which shield the central area from view. The burned-out husks of tanks and ammunition crates lay tucked between the trees.  Human rights activists and analysts say the Khamis unit played a major role in the civil war, spearheading the fight against NATO-backed rebels who took up arms after a crackdown on anti-government protesters in February.  A leaked 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable said the brigade “effectively serves as a regime protection unit.” Libyans knew the brigade for its discipline and fierce loyalty to Gaddafi.  “This was a place of torture, a place of imprisonment, a place of mercenaries and a place of terrorism,” Abdel Hafidth Iswad, a former rebel now helping guard the compound, said.  The General Dynamics UK deal to provide communications technology to the unit came the year after former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s 2007 visit to Libya, a seminal moment in the push to warmer relations between Gaddafi and the West.  For years, Gaddafi had been shunned for his government’s alleged role in bombings and other attacks in Britain and elsewhere, and was accused by human rights activists of brutal repression of dissent at home.  The documents obtained by Reuters showed the General Dynamics UK work was scheduled up to and through the date the revolt broke out, with start dates between February 10 and February 24, and end dates between February 24 and March 17.  Separate documents found by Human Rights Watch in the unit’s compound, overrun by anti-Gaddafi fighters last month and now open to journalists, showed the brigade was receiving arms from a variety of countries and companies.  One 2004 order marked the delivery of Russian-made Kalashnikov rifles, and one from 2009 showed an unspecified delivery was made from South Africa. Another 2009 order showed rifles came from Belgium’s FN Herstal.  Boxes of those FN rifles now litter the compound, including the archives room where many of the documents related to the daily functioning, tactical planning and weapons procurement of the base were found.  “Is anyone surprised these weapons were used against his (Gaddafi’s) own people?” Bouckaert said.

The Pentagon is trimming at least $350 billion from its previously projected spending through the next decade under a debt-ceiling deal signed into law August 2. Additional defense-related cuts of up to $600 billon are to kick in if Congress fails by the end of the year to find at least $1.2 trillion more in deficit reduction over the same period.  Panetta will meet members of the industry group’s 18-member executive committee, Blakey said. The committee is currently chaired by James Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing Co’s (BA.N) commercial airplanes unit. Boeing is the Pentagon’s No. 2 supplier by sales, behind Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).  The chief executives of Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), BAE Inc (BAES.L) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) are also committee members.  The industry will also seek to discuss strategy to preserve the U.S. industrial base, Blakey said.

27,GD,WRAPUP 2-Libya fighters amass near pro-Gaddafi town," (Adds Gaddafi speech on Syrian TV)	   * NTC fighters advance towards loyalist stronghold   * NTC sends mission to Niamey, urging no refuge for Gaddafi   * Documents show US-UK firm worked on Gaddafi tanks this year    By Maria Golovnina	   WISHTATA, Libya, Sept 8 (Reuters) - - Libya’s new rulers sent a column of extra fighters towards the tribal bastion of Bani Walid overnight, preparing a showdown with supporters of ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi, possibly including his sons or even Gaddafi himself.	   Gaddafi, in a call to a Syrian-owned TV station on Thursday, vowed continued resistance to the rebels and NATO and said a military convoy that entered neighbouring Niger this week, fueling speculation he might be about to flee, was “not the first”. 	   “Columns of convoys drive into and out of Niger carrying goods and people inside and outside (of Libya) say Gaddafi is going to Niger,” he said in the call that Arrai TV reported was made from within Libya.  	   “This is not the first time that convoys drive in and out of Niger.”  	   Gaddafi’s whereabouts have been a mystery since rebel fighters stormed his Tripoli headquarters two weeks ago. Bani Walid, one of the few towns still in the hands of his followers, has refused to surrender despite a stand-off lasting days.	   Officials from the interim ruling National Transitional Council said they had sent reinforcements after reports that Gaddafi had issued a call for the town to fight.	   Reuters reporters saw a convoy of NTC forces pickup trucks heading towards Bani Walid with dozens of fighters clutching RPGs and shouting anti-Gaddafi slogans.	   “We will move into Bani Walid slowly. There was a message in Bani Walid from Gaddafi this evening,” NTC unit commander Jamal Gourji said.	   “He was rallying his troops and calling on people to fight. He is hiding in a hole in the ground, like Iraq,” he said, in a reference to late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, captured hiding in a hole nine months after he was toppled in 2003.	   Outside the town on Wednesday residents leaving through a sun-scorched NTC checkpoint at the nearby settlement of Wishtata painted an increasingly desperate picture.	   “People are terrorised,” said Salah Ali, 39. “But many still support Gaddafi because they were paid by the regime, because many have committed crimes and are afraid of arrest.”	   Aid agencies have raised concerns about humanitarian conditions there and in the few other cities still under control of Gaddafi loyalists. Communications with them have been cut.	   The NTC has sent envoys to neighbouring Niger to try to stop Gaddafi and his entourage evading justice by fleeing across a desert frontier toward friendly African states. A convoy arrived in Niger this week, but Niger says Gaddafi was not in it.	   “We’re asking every country not to accept him. We want these people for justice,” Fathi Baja, the head of political affairs for the National Transitional Council (NTC), told Reuters in Benghazi, saying the ousted leader may be close to the Niger or Algerian borders, waiting for an opportunity to slip across.	   “He’s looking for a chance to leave,” Baja said.	   Another senior NTC official said Gaddafi was tracked this week to an area in the empty Sahara of Libya’s south.	   But NTC officials near Bani Walid in the north said they believed two of Gaddafi’s sons and possibly the leader himself were inside the town.	   “That would explain why Bani Walid is resisting,” NTC negotiator Abdallah Kanshil said of reports of Gaddafi’s presence in the town. “His two sons are definitely there.”	   The Pentagon said it knew nothing to indicate the fallen leader had left Libya. Niger, which took in his security chief this week, insisted Gaddafi had not crossed its border.	   Washington said it had also contacted the governments of Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Burkina Faso — a swathe of poor former French colonies which benefited from Gaddafi’s oil-fueled largesse in Africa. The State Department urged them to secure their borders and to detain and disarm Gaddafi officials.	   Gaddafi and his son Saif al-Islam are wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said any country where he was found should hand him over to be tried, remarks that were echoed by U.S. ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz.	   With his overthrow, however, have come revelations of the extent to which U.S. and British officials were until recently cooperating with Gaddafi — once a pariah in the West but rehabilitated by Washington and London in the past decade.	   Papers found by Reuters in Tripoli showed a British arm of U.S.-based General Dynamics was modernising tanks and troop carriers for a feared brigade led by Gaddafi’s son Khamis, as recently as late January. 	   The firm said the military vehicles might have been part of a $135 million 2008 contract, part of what it termed at the time “the United Kingdom’s initiatives to improve economic, educational and defence links with Libya”.	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said: “The lesson is that if you are going to sell weapons to dictators, at some point down the line you’re going to be deeply embarrassed.”	   In al-Qalaa, a town about 120 km southwest of Tripoli, thousands of people gathered to bury the bodies of 35 people they said were discovered nearby, their corpses packed into a shipping container.	   “There are still many crimes and graves, and we will discover them,” said Moqtar Fernanah, head of the military council for the western region, speaking at the funeral.	   “Our answer will be to capture these criminals and turn them to the courts for fair trials. They will be punished in accordance to the crimes they committed.”	 	  (Reporting by Mohammed Abbas, Christian Lowe and Alex Dziadosz in Tripoli, Sherine El Madany in Ras Lanuf, Maria Golovnina in Wishtata,  Abdelaziz Boumzar in al-Qalaa, Barry Malone, Sylvia Westall and Alastair Macdonald in Tunis, Sami Aboudi, Amena Bakr and Omar Fahmy in Cairo, Nathalie Prevost and Bate Felix in Niamey, David Brunnstrom in Brussels, Mathieu Bonkoungou in Ouagadougou, Richard Valdmanis and Mark John in Dakar, and Ahmed Tolba in Cairo; Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Peter Graff and Michael Roddy)	  ",9082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/libya/wrapup-2-libya-fighters-amass-near-pro-gaddafi-town-idUSL5E7K74ST20110908
28,GD,U.S. faces tough choices on defense budget,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ten years after the United States embarked on a war against terrorism in the rubble of the September 11 attacks, the country finds itself financially exhausted and facing hard strategic choices as it grapples with new budget realities.  After spending heavily for a decade on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon now faces potential cuts of up to nearly $1 trillion over 10 years at a time when it sees rising competition from countries like China and a need to replace its fleet of aging planes and ships.  While some lawmakers are promising to act to avert the heaviest of the budget cuts, Todd Harrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, says postwar cost-cutting of 25 percent to 50 percent has been the norm since the Korean War. That means something has to give.  “Given the budget outlook we see in the coming years, it’s simply not realistic for DoD (Department of Defense) to continue to do all of the things it does today with fewer and fewer resources,” Harrison told a briefing this week on the impact of the September 11 attacks.  “This means we will need to make a number of strategic choices about how and where we plan to compete in the future,” he said. “And these choices will have to be constrained by the resources available.”  As the United States marks the 10th anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington, analysts say September 11 and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have had a profound impact on the way the Pentagon fights and views the threats it is likely to face in the future.  “I think for the Department of Defense it (September 11) really was a watershed event,” said Jim Thomas, another analyst with the CSBA. “I don’t think it struck people immediately ... but as we look at the cumulative effect over the past decade, I think we can say in retrospect that it truly was.”  In Iraq and Afghanistan, the military has increasingly emphasized shadowy special operations strikes instead of major set-piece battles.  With less than 1 percent of the population in uniform, the United States went to war undermanned and backed by an army of defense contractors, a move that has cemented close ties between the industry and the military.  “It had a profound effect,” Northrop Grumman Corp Chief Executive Wes Bush said of the September 11 attacks. “And it had a profound effect in many dimensions.”  The rush of patriotism that followed the attacks led many young college graduates to seek careers in the defense industry, reshaping the demographics of companies like Northrop, Bush told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit this week.  “Many of our employees spend every day working side by side with service members,” Bush said. “(September 11) has, I would say, increased the sense of shared mission, shared responsibility.”  The attacks also marked a shift in U.S. economic fortunes. Before al Qaeda operatives slammed hijacked planes into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon near Washington, budget officials had projected surpluses that would have virtually eliminated the federal debt over the course of the decade.  Instead, tax cuts and war spending led Washington to rack up a string of deficits that have added $6.1 trillion to the national debt, pushing it to $14.3 trillion, or about $46,500 for every man, woman and child in the country.  Pentagon spending over the decade rose from about $400 billion annually to nearly $700 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars, even though the overall size of the armed forces remained roughly the same, Harrison said.  In addition to war spending, the Pentagon paid more for personnel and saw the cost of its day-to-day operations rise. The services also spent $50 billion on developing weapons systems that were never actually produced.  “We canceled programs knowing that we will need to start a replacement program to do essentially the same thing,” Harrison said. “Now, we will have fewer resources available in the coming years to do that.”  Under the debt-reduction agreement signed by President Barack Obama in August, the Defense Department is working to cut $350 billion from its projected spending over the next 10 years.  The Pentagon could face another $600 billion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts unless a congressional supercommittee agrees on alternatives by the end of the year to reduce the federal deficit.  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and the Pentagon’s top uniformed personnel have warned that the first round of cuts is proving difficult. A second round would be disastrous, they say, and would increase the risk to national security.  Defense industry leaders acknowledge the need for some cuts in defense spending, but they warn that in the current tough economic environment, reductions will jeopardize the jobs and innovation needed for further growth and expansion.  “We understand the urgency of wanting to focus on reducing deficits that exceed a trillion dollars,” Lockheed Martin Corp Chief Executive Robert Stevens told the Reuters Summit. “Our preference would be that we align national security resources to national security challenges and not have it a function of an automatic budget reduction.”  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aero-arms-summit-budget/u-s-faces-tough-choices-on-defense-budget-idUSTRE7885VZ20110909
29,GD,U.S. military-industrial said no longer so complex,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fifty years after President Dwight Eisenhower famously warned the United States to guard against the “military-industrial complex,” the reality has changed and the term is outdated, the head of a group that represents arms makers said.  “The word ‘complex’ implies a larger and (more) interwoven industry than you have today,” Marion Blakey, president of the Aerospace Industries Association, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington on Thursday.  “In a sense it’s an old-fashioned term that’s outmoded,” she said. “It is more historical than a real-life term.”  The phrase generally signifies mutually reinforcing interests between the armed forces and the for-profit companies that produce their weapons and provide services.  The term also may be used to refer to ties with members of Congress crucial for political support for spending on weapons programs and enhanced by political contributions.  Eisenhower, in a farewell address to the nation on January 17, 1961, cautioned against the “unwarranted acquisition of influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.”  Blakey’s group, known as the AIA, represents leading U.S. makers of everything from civil and military aircraft to space systems and missiles to unmanned weapons systems and aircraft engines.  “The assumption that the defense industry is the military-industrial complex of the Eisenhower era is wrong,” she said.  Only about seven U.S. prime contractors remain for the military today, down from more than 150 companies after World War Two, she said.  “There is no comparison to the enormous industry that can absorb major changes ...as it did during that period,” Blakey said. “Things have changed a great deal. In those days industry worked hand in glove with the (armed services) chiefs.”  Those relationships, she said, have been altered with an eye to accountability.  “The idea that industry and those who fight the wars have a close-knit set of relations is belied by reality,” Blakey said.  As a share of the economy, U.S. spending on its military peaked in 1944 at about 38 percent, according to Todd Harrison, who tracks these figures for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington research group. Today, defense spending is about 5 percent of gross domestic product.  Members of the AIA’s 18-strong executive committee are set to meet Defense Secretary Leon Panetta at the Pentagon next Tuesday to discuss their concerns about possible deep cuts to the Defense Department budget, Blakey disclosed at the same time.  “We certainly will want to be discussing the circumstances that we’re in, in terms of the overall budget situation,” she said.  Panetta has called the prospect of automatic, across-the-board cuts to defense spending a “doomsday mechanism.”  The Pentagon is trimming at least $350 billion from its previously projected spending through the next decade under a debt-ceiling deal signed into law August 2. Additional defense-related cuts of up to $600 billon are automatic if Congress fails by the end of the year to find at least $1.2 trillion more in deficit reduction over the same period.

With job creation a political priority amid 9.1 percent unemployment, defense industry executives are applying pressure with $330 billion in cuts already in the pipeline and billions more possible through the early part of the next decade.   Companies, their workers and their lobbying forces are placing stronger relevance in their outreach to lawmakers and the Obama administration on economic issues as big reductions are weighed in an uncertain fiscal climate in addition to always prominent national security arguments.   “I think they need to temper their thinking and their decisions with the benefits that industry has to the economy,” Pratt & Whitney Chief Executive David Hess told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit. Pratt & Whitney is a division of United Technologies (UTX.N).   More than 10 percent of U.S. manufacturing demand is supported by aerospace and defense spending, industry figures show. About 800,000 jobs are directly tied to the sector, which supports numerous other jobs.   Other leading companies in the sector include Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), Boeing (BA.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), General Dynamics (GD.N).   Total industry sales of planes, missiles, ships, ground equipment and other technology topped $214 billion last year.   Additional business related to Energy Department, Homeland Security, and satellite programs add to the economic engine.   “Nobody in the government thinks about that impact systematically, and politicians often describe military outlays as if they are a drag on the economy rather than a stimulus,” Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, wrote this week in a Forbes column.   “Political leaders can’t seem to grasp that money spent by the Pentagon is just as potent in creating jobs as money spent by the Department of Transportation,” Thompson said.   He told Reuters separately that President Barack Obama’s $300 billion proposal on Thursday night to create jobs throughout the economy with his reelection fortunes sagging comes as the government considers $300 billion or more in military spending reductions.   At the same time, Thompson told Reuters that companies and their allies historically have not made a coherent case about the economic impact of their business.   Industry is working overdrive to minimize spending cuts, which could lead to tens of thousands of lost civilian jobs, analysts said. These, in many cases, would include higher wage engineering and technology positions and specialized assembly jobs.   In an unusual alliance, the Aerospace Industries Association trade group joined last week with organized labor in a letter to Obama to tout the industry’s impact on jobs.   The Sept. 1 letter urged Obama to “keep in mind the many thousands of aerospace and defense workers that face the loss of their jobs in these difficult economic times.”   The group plans to next circulate a similar letter to key members of Congress.

35,GD,NATO's Rasmussen calls for open defense markets,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and European countries should do more to open up their defense markets to competition at a time of tight budgets, the head of NATO said on Monday.  NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen also said he planned to appoint a special envoy to help ensure that countries were getting value for money for defense spending.  “We need equal opportunities for European Union and American defense companies to compete across the Atlantic,” Rasmussen told an industry conference in London.  He noted that 90 percent of the Pentagon’s procurement budget went to U.S. companies, while Europe often favored its own contractors.  Rasmussen welcomed moves by President Barack Obama to reform export licensing programs which should allow U.S. companies to play a greater role in Europe.  NATO’s 28 allies needed to prioritize spending, improve coordination and adopt a multinational approach, he said.  Rasmussen said he wanted a specific package of multilateral measures to be on the table in time for the next NATO summit in Chicago in May 2012.  NATO is worried that financial hardship among member countries could hurt the alliance’s military capability unless steps are taken to make procurement more efficient.  “I think for most of us, it is the worst economic crisis we have ever faced and it has an impact on everything we do,” Rasmussen told reporters. “Of course, NATO defense budgets are falling, the cost of defense capabilities is rising and security threats are more complex and less predictable.”  “We can’t ask the allies to spend more, we have to ask them to spend better.”  The Pentagon is shaving at least $350 billion from its previously projected spending over the next decade. European allies are also making deep defense cuts.  Rasmussen repeated his criticism of the shortcomings of the NATO operation in Libya, citing lack of intelligence and transport capabilities of an operation led by its European members and Canada.  U.S. officials have said the Libyan operation showed the need for European allies to spend more on defense.

37,GD,Contractors battle against further military cuts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense contractors launched a broad lobbying campaign on Wednesday to drum up public support for holding the line on U.S. military spending cuts.  Alarmed at the prospect of Congress dictating steep new reductions on top of more than $350 billion in cuts already in the pipeline from Pentagon streamlining, contractors based their urgent appeal on economic as well as national security grounds.  Industry lobbyists are highlighting the role of small business in aerospace production and asking the general public to contact lawmakers directly to support their position.  “Our position is: no more,” Marion Blakey, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, told a news conference on the stepped-up lobbying effort. “Defense has been cut to the bone. We are there already.”  Boeing Co; engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp; and other companies under the AIA umbrella are looking to create general awareness about the potential impact of extended spending reductions.  A congressional “super committee” on deficit reduction is trying to find at least $1.2 trillion in budget savings over the next decade.  The worst-case scenario coming out of the panel by year’s end — if it cannot reach agreement on additional cuts — would be an additional defense cut of up to $600 billion over the same period.  Industry calls this possibility “draconian.” Senior U.S. civilian military officials, including the nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 post, Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter, told the Senate this week that cuts “over and above” the level already in the works would be devastating.  Beyond traditional lobbying that includes CEO visits to “super committee” members this week, the AIA trade group — which also represents Lockheed Martin Corp, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and others — is launching a grass-roots strategy.

Alarmed at the prospect of Congress dictating steep new reductions on top of more than $350 billion in cuts already in the pipeline from Pentagon streamlining, contractors based their urgent appeal on economic as well as national security grounds.   Industry lobbyists are highlighting the role of small business in aerospace production and asking the general public to contact lawmakers directly to support their position.   “Our position is: no more,” Marion Blakey, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, told a news conference on the stepped-up lobbying effort. “Defense has been cut to the bone.

A congressional “super committee” on deficit reduction is trying to find at least $1.2 trillion in budget savings over the next decade.   The worst-case scenario coming out of the panel by year’s end — if it cannot reach agreement on additional cuts — would be an additional defense cut of up to $600 billion over the same period.   Industry calls this possibility “draconian.” Senior U.S. civilian military officials, including the nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 post, Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter, told the Senate this week that cuts “over and above” the level already in the works would be devastating.

41,GD,FACTBOX-Defense industry united as debt panel weighs cuts," Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. military contractors are united in their push to stem additional cuts in defense spending that could come out of a congressional “super committee” charged with finding ways to lower the deficit.   Boeing Co (BA.N); engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of UTX Corp (UTX.N); Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), General Dynamics (GD.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) and others have launched a multi-pronged lobbying campaign that seeks to draw public support for their position.   Following are facts about current and possible defense cuts and the Pentagon and industry’s response. For a related story please click on [ID:nS1E78E0I4].   — The leading budget proposal in the Senate recommends roughly $630 billion in spending for the 2012 fiscal year beginning in October, freezing the Pentagon’s base budget at $513 billion and calling for $118 billion for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Defense Department awards $400 billion in contracts each year.   — House and Senate leaders agreed in August to $350 billion in cuts to national security spending over 10 years as part of its deficit-reduction package. The worst-case scenario coming out of the “super committee” by year’s end — if it cannot reach agreement on additional cuts — would be an additional cut of up to $600 billion over the same period.   — Top lobbyists for the military contractors say the industry is fragile, having cut thousands of jobs in the defense industry slowdown. But defense experts contend the Pentagon’s budget has become bloated over the past decade in a spending run-up and could absorb as much as $1 trillion in total budget cuts over the next 10 years. This includes the $350 billion already in the works.   — Chief executives of military contractors led by Boeing Co (BA.A) commercial aircraft CEO Jim Albaugh, who is also chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, have lobbied “super committee” members directly. The group has also launched a public lobbying campaign to highlight the economic impact of defense spending cuts on small business and jobs. AIA figures show the industry directly employs more than 1 million people in the United States and affects nearly 2 million other jobs. The AIA this week gave an award to Senator Patty Murray, a “super committee” member whose state is home to Boeing aircraft assembly operations.   — Defense company executives met on Tuesday with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Panetta underscored the importance of maintaining the skills and capabilities of the defense industrial base as well as continuing to invest in research and development, the companies and a Pentagon spokesman said. But Panetta also stressed the need to work together to find efficiencies in the current tight-budget climate.   — Senior U.S. civilian military officials, including the nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 post, Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter, told the Senate this week that cuts “over and above” the level already in the works would be devastating. Carter said a failure by the “super committee” to reach an agreement on spending would be particularly bad because the ensuing cuts would hit everything equally.   — Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program, is under close scrutiny for budget savings in Congress. The Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee proposes to cut it by $695 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It also recommended termination of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Program, a possible replacement for Army and Marine Humvee vehicles. The panel rejected the Navy’s request for a Mobile Landing Platform vessel, saying it should be delayed for a year.

43,GD,"BAE, Babcock, General Dynamics eye UK defence assets"," LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - British defence companies BAE Systems and Babcock International and U.S. arms maker General Dynamics have approached the British government about buying the Defence Support Group (DSG) — its armed forces equipment management unit.	   “We have received some early and speculative approaches from a number of companies, including BAE Systems, Babcock and General Dynamics UK,” Britain’s defence minister Peter Luff said in a written answer to parliament, adding that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) was not yet in a position to invite formal expressions of interest in the sale.	   “MoD officials have met informally with BAE and Babcock, at the request of the companies, to allow them to explain their interest in the DSG in more detail.”	   Last year, the British government said it would sell the DSG as part of its strategic defence and security review.

44,GD,Bigger firms seen in next defense consolidation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) interest in acquiring Goodrich Corp GR.N marks the start of a more active consolidation phase in the U.S. aerospace and defense industry that could ultimately winnow the current field of five or six prime contractors.  Industry executives expect more takeovers of second- and third-tier defense suppliers in coming months and say there could even be changes in the top tier, depending on the depth of defense spending cuts mandated by U.S. budget deficits.  For years, experts ruled out further consolidation among the biggest arms makers after the mega-mergers sparked by the end of the Cold War. But the prospect of deep spending cuts and continued pressure on companies to generate profits have revived the specter of bigger mergers.  Deals in recent years have been smaller, punctuated only by the $5 billion takeover of U.S. defense contractor DRS Technologies by Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA SIFI.MI in 2008.  If United Tech prevails in its bid to acquire Goodrich — a deal likely valued at around $12 billion — that would probably be the harbinger of other large deals.  “This changes the whole spectrum,” said one senior defense industry executive. “Everything’s on the table now. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but it’s a whole new ballgame.”  Another senior executive agreed, saying, “This feels like the early 1990s again. We’re in for some turbulent times.”  The biggest companies in the U.S. defense market are Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Boeing Co (BA.N), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N), as well as Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L).  After a decade of sharp growth in defense spending, the U.S. Defense Department is now scrambling to cut at least $350 billion from previous spending projections, and that could rise to $900 billion unless Congress finds at least $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts by year-end.  Budget pressures have already scaled back new weapons programs, and lawmakers have taken aim at additional projects in recent weeks — leaving less work for defense companies to divvy up. Many companies have shifted into services, and that trend will continue. Others are looking to diversify into more commercial work to offset the drop in government orders.  “You have a lot of defense companies that are cash-rich and are looking at ways to move into adjacent areas; it’s possible that they would expand what they do in commercial aerospace,” said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy in Fairfax, Virginia.  Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter and other officials had tried for the past year to assure industry executives that they would be able to stave off big spending cuts.  But those hopes have been overtaken by a new reality, said defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute. “What Secretary Carter told the defense industry about its future prospects just isn’t panning out,” he said.  Brett Lambert, deputy assistant secretary of defense, manufacturing and industrial base policy, this month acknowledged the toll that uncertainty was taking on the sector.  Given the difficult economic climate, the Defense Department fully expects more mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs in coming years, mostly in the supplier base, Lambert told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington.  While the Pentagon was comfortable with the current number of prime contractors, it was not “ruling anything out,” he said.  Adam Palmer, who manages aerospace and defense investments for the Carlyle Group private equity firm, told Reuters that defense officials might rethink their opposition to big mergers if spending cuts gut the market for certain types of weapons.  Carter, nominated for the No. 2 job at the Defense Department, is no stranger to defense consolidation, having attended the 1993 “Last Supper” where his friend and mentor, then-Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry, urged arms makers to consolidate.  Carter often talks about that experience in public speeches, and he says the department has a responsibility to pay attention to the impact of its decisions on the industrial base, especially given the slowdown in defense spending.  Thompson does not expect mergers at the top tier, but he says there will clearly be contraction in defense electronics. He said companies such as Harris Corp (HRS.N) and ITT (ITT.N), which plans to spin off its defense unit, are probably more vulnerable to takeovers than bigger players such as Northrop and Raytheon.  “It’s going to be a big change, but I don’t think there’ll be a ‘Last Supper’ in the sense that the DoD (Department of Defense) will tell everybody what they expect and what needs to be done and companies will go do that,” said Norm Augustine, former chief executive of Lockheed, who attended the Perry event.  John Young, who served as the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer before Carter, warned that further consolidation would likely increase already high prices of new weapons.  He said defense officials should adopt strict policies against any mergers that create monopolies, while easing tough auditing rules and other barriers that keep more innovative companies and nontraditional suppliers out of the market.  “The truth is that if (the bigger firms) shed some overhead and closed some plants, they would be better positioned for the next upward cycle in the defense budget,” Young said.  Jacques Gansler, who headed Pentagon procurement under former President Bill Clinton, agreed, saying the department also needs to allow more competition throughout weapons programs instead of handing contracts to one supplier.  “They don’t understand how competition works,” he said. “Monopolies tend to raise prices, not lower them.”  ",9202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-defense-consolidation/bigger-firms-seen-in-next-defense-consolidation-idUSTRE78J4MY20110920

He said companies such as Harris Corp (HRS.N) and ITT (ITT.N), which plans to spin off its defense unit, are probably more vulnerable to takeovers than bigger players such as Northrop and Raytheon.   “It’s going to be a big change, but I don’t think there’ll be a ‘Last Supper’ in the sense that the DoD (Department of Defense) will tell everybody what they expect and what needs to be done and companies will go do that,” said Norm Augustine, former chief executive of Lockheed, who attended the Perry event.   John Young, who served as the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer before Carter, warned that further consolidation would likely increase already high prices of new weapons.   He said defense officials should adopt strict policies against any mergers that create monopolies, while easing tough auditing rules and other barriers that keep more innovative companies and nontraditional suppliers out of the market.   “The truth is that if (the bigger firms) shed some overhead and closed some plants, they would be better positioned for the next upward cycle in the defense budget,” Young said.   Jacques Gansler, who headed Pentagon procurement under former President Bill Clinton, agreed, saying the department also needs to allow more competition throughout weapons programs instead of handing contracts to one supplier.   “They don’t understand how competition works,” he said. “Monopolies tend to raise prices, not lower them.”  (Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; additional reporting by Karen Jacobs; editing by John Wallace)   ",9202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/defense-consolidation/bigger-firms-seen-in-next-us-defense-consolidation-idUSS1E78I1I420110920
46,GD,Analysis: Latest 401(k) lawsuit highlights ongoing fee concerns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - While workers can’t do much when a stock market sell-off hits their 401(k) balances, they can speak up about poor investment choices and unreasonable plan fees. Now, more are taking those complaints to the courts as they bring lawsuits against employers they believe have allowed poorly-performing and overly-expensive funds into their retirement plans.  The most recent 401(k) fee lawsuit was filed last week against Ameriprise Financial Inc, which bills itself as “America’s leader in financial planning.” The suit, which was brought on behalf of several employees and is seeking class action status, alleges the financial firm pushed workers into expensive and untested proprietary funds at a cost the lawyers for the employees say is more than $20 million.  It’s one of some three dozen lawsuits filed in recent years in the ongoing tussle over 401(k) costs. Experts don’t expect those cases - or high 401(k) fees - to disappear anytime soon, even though a rule scheduled to kick in by mid-2012 should give workers much more insight into the fees built into their plans.  “They put people into their products, and they were not vetted and were excessively expensive,” Jerome Schlichter, who is representing the Ameriprise employees, told Reuters in an interview. He says the company was “self dealing.”  Donald E. Froude, president of the Ameripise’s Personal Advisors Group, defended his firm on Monday, while speaking at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit. “We feel we’ve acted appropriately,” he said, adding, “This law firm has done several other cases.”  Schlicter’s firm, Schlichter, Bogard & Denton, has filed many of the class action suits in the last five years. A number of those cases have been thrown out or remain in litigation, but others - notably those against Caterpillar Inc., and General Dynamics Corp. - resulted in multimillion dollar settlements for thousands of employees. “These lawsuits have really helped shine a light on the fact that there are very large plans that have fees that are too high,” said Mike Alfred of Brightscope, a firm which monitors and grades 401(k) plans.  In recent years, the down market has focused greater attention on 401(k) fees, many of which are very difficult for workers and even employers to ferret out. A survey released in April by AARP found that more than seven in 10 of plan participants incorrectly reported that they did not pay any fees.  At issue are not just the management fees of the mutual funds held in the plans, but other fees that can be buried in plan management contracts. There can be wrap fees, annuity contract fees and even sales and marketing charges on the mutual funds. Alfred contends that large companies, in particular, have the muscle to negotiate low per-participant management costs and very low-fee investment options for their workers.  Those fees can keep 401(k) management costs down for companies, but their effect on workers’ retirements can be significant. A worker with a $25,000 balance in her 401(k) account, who earned 7 percent annually and paid 0.5 percent a year in fees would have $227,000 saved after 35 years. If an extra 1 percent in fees were drained out of her account every year, she’d only have $163,000 at the end of that period, according to an estimate published by the Labor Department.  Beginning in May, 2012, companies will have to disclose far more information about 401(k) fees to their workers, under rules issued by the Labor Department.  But workers shouldn't wait for that, says Alfred. He suggests that a first step can be checking out your company's plan at his firm's web site, Brightscope.com. (There, Ameriprise logged a ""grade"" of 76 - about average for its peer group. The average 401(k) participant in the plan is missing out on some $50,600 in lost retirement savings because it's not a top plan, according to the Brightscope calculations.)  Workers can also ask their human resources departments for a breakdown of their 401(k) fees, and find out how plan chores - such as recordkeeping - are paid for. Employers may not have all of that information at the ready, but will be required to by May, 2012.

47,GD,Buyers circle Comtech amid activist pressure,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Communications equipment maker Comtech Telecommunications Corp (CMTL.O), under pressure from an activist investor to evaluate a sale, is attracting potential takeover interest from several government contractors, people familiar with the situation said.  Comtech, which makes satellite-based communications equipment for the government and commercial customers, is working with Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) for defense and strategic advice in response to pressure from New York-based hedge fund MMI Investments LP, four of the people said.  It is unclear if Comtech would be receptive to a sale at this point. But the list of potential suitors could include EADS EAD.PA, General Dynamics Corp (GD.N), L-3 Communications (LLL.N), Harris Corp (HRS.N) and BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) among others, according to the people familiar with the situation.  No bid has been made for Comtech, and it remains to be seen if any of the potentially interested parties would actually step up to make an offer for Comtech. The U.S. defense industry is grappling with uncertainty presented by looming budget cuts and the pullout of troops from the Middle East.  MMI, which has amassed stakes in several defense technology companies over the past year and successfully pushed for deals in some cases, reported a 3.3 percent stake in Comtech last week and urged the company to evaluate a sale.  Comtech, which has said it will pursue growth with targeted acquisitions, is scheduled to meet with shareholders in the next few weeks to hear their views, three of the people said.  Shares of Comtech rose 0.8 percent to $28.20 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, valuing the company at about $660 million. The stock rose 8 percent in aftermarket trading to $30.50.  Representatives for Comtech, Goldman Sachs and MMI declined to comment.  Comtech has long been seen as a takeover candidate for larger aerospace and defense companies, and over the past several years has held multiple discussions with potential buyers, people familiar with the matter said.  Airbus parent EADS was close to buying Comtech in 2008 but abandoned the deal as it faced threats to its cash pile from costly aircraft delays and penalties, these people said, adding that EADS had also explored a Comtech takeover several years prior to that.  Comtech also held a series of discussions with interested buyers as recently as 2010, after it scrapped plans to buy smaller rival CPI International Inc, but those talks fell apart over price, two of the people said.  Over the past two years, Comtech lost two of its largest military contracts in its mobile data communications business that together represented roughly half of the company’s total revenue for fiscal 2010 and 2011.  Comtech expects fiscal 2012 revenue to be “materially lower” than the $600 million seen in 2011, after the loss of the two contracts. It had $558.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of July and has been under pressure to use that cash to grow or return more to shareholders.  Potential buyers, both trade and private equity buyers, have been concerned about Comtech’s declining revenue outlook stemming from the contract loss, sources said.  “Now that they’ve gone through most of the decline already, by the time you buy it that decline is no longer as much of an issue as it was six to nine months ago,” one of the people said.  Its longer-term growth outlook is also supported by the changing nature of global warfare, where governments increasingly focus on information and communications technology as security threats evolve from tanks and guns to the bits and bytes of cyber and communication networks.  The aerospace and defense sector has seen increasing shareholder activism over the past year as stocks languish across the board amid worries about severe budget pressure.  Last year, MMI urged long-time takeover target Applied Signal Technology to solicit buyout offers, resulting in a $490 million sale to Raytheon Co (RTN.N). MMI was also behind the $506 million sale of satellite company EMS Technologies to Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) earlier this year.  Over the summer, MMI amassed a near 10 percent stake in Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS.O), spurring a strategic review by the company.  Kratos has received little buyer interest, according to people familiar with the situation, and the company’s stock has declined about 40 percent since early August, when MMI first disclosed its stake.

The contract involves upgrading 550 light armored vehicles (LAV) to better protect them against land mines and improvised explosive devices, extending their lifespan to 2035. The vehicles, which were used in Canada’s military mission in Afghanistan, will become safer for soldiers to ride in and have greater mobility, the government said in a statement. “They are state-of-the-art combat vehicles used to transport infantry on the battlefield while providing defensive protection and firepower,” it said. Defence Minister Peter MacKay first announced the upgrade project in July 2009 and named GDLS as the prime contractor at that time. The announcement on Friday further defines the scope of the work and its value. As part of the contract, GDLS agreed to reinvest 100 percent of the contract value in Canada. The project is expected to maintain more than 2,000 jobs. ",10212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics-canada/general-dynamics-canada-lav-contract-worth-1-bln-idUSN1E79K0RO20111021

52,GD,"General Dynamics CEO sets sights on further growth, acquisitions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The defense budget is shrinking, but General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) still sees growing demand for its combat vehicles and warships, coupled with unprecedented opportunities to sell its popular Gulfstream business jets in China and other emerging markets. Chief Executive Jay Johnson, a former F-14 fighter pilot and chief of naval operations, shies away from phrases like “off the charts,” but his steep hand gesture depicts a bright future for the commercial aerospace sector, and he’s not too worried about the defense outlook, at least for now. In fact, tighter U.S. defense budgets will generate good acquisition opportunities for General Dynamics in coming years, Johnson told Reuters in a rare interview at the company’s headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia. “We don’t have time to wring our hands. For us it’s all about performing for the customer and delivering to the shareholder,” says Johnson, who said the company remained committed to paying strong dividends, but would also keep enough cash on hand to take advantage of possible acquisitions. The company’s strategy seems to be paying off, with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recently making a significant investment in GD after selling its stake 10 years ago. “It’s the Warren Buffett seal of approval, which I think counts for a lot,” he said. Buffett has not disclosed the size of his holding, he said. U.S. defense companies are scrambling to cut costs and find alternate revenue sources as they brace for a big decline in spending after a decade of double digit growth. Many analysts consider GD the best-positioned company in the sector, given the mix of its weapons expertise and red-hot prospects for its Gulfstream business, which already has 200 orders for the new GS650 jet entering service next year. STILL GENERATING “CONSIDERABLE” CASH AND EARNINGS Analysts expect General Dynamics, one of the five largest U.S. arms makers, to boost revenues by about $1 billion to over $33 billion in 2011, with sales growing modestly over the next two years. Revenues will be buoyed by an order backlog of over $58 billion and rising international sales. “We still will generate considerable earnings and cash in the defense space,” said Johnson, noting GD would benefit from continued demand for upgrades to tanks and other ground combat vehicles, even as U.S. forces withdrew from Iraq. Demand from military commanders would ensure continued shipbuilding sales “as far as the eye can see,” said Johnson, who met with top Navy officials in Hawaii last month on the sideline of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. GD is one of two builders of Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines, and recently won praise from Defense Secretary Leon Panetta for building the latest submarine, the USS Mississippi for $50 million below target and a year ahead of schedule. The company is also “very excited” about the prospects for its commercial aerospace division, Johnson said, adding that demand from emerging markets was fueling growth “in a way that I don’t think we’ve ever seen before.” In time, the division could generate about 30 percent of revenues, up from 20 percent now, Johnson said. Analysts say GD’s earnings potential is excellent, given growing demand from China and other emerging markets for its Gulfstream jets, which Morgan Stanley analyst Heidi Wood calls “one of the world’s sexiest and most respected brands.” GD has forecast that operating earnings from commercial aerospace could grow to over 35 to 40 percent of company-wide operating earnings in the next five years, from 20 percent now. Wood says they could reach as high as 50 percent. Not surprisingly, Johnson said he has no plans to sell Gulfstream, despite repeated suggestions from outsiders that the company should sell the unit to monetize its success. In fact, GD plans to invest about $500 million in the Savannah, Georgia plant where it builds the jets, and just opened a new business office in Beijing on December 7. Although Johnson says analysts are “just gaga” about Gulfstream’s prospects, he prefers a more measured approach, especially since GD still has to establish relationships in new countries for long-term maintenance of the business jets. “I don’t like overdriving our headlights,” he says. At the same time, Johnson says declining defense spending could generate interesting acquisition opportunities for GD, and the company is keeping sufficient cash on hand to pounce if it sees good prospects in cyber security, health care information technology (IT), intelligence or aerospace. GD in August acquired Vangent, a health care IT company that together with an existing unit, will make the company a top tier provider in that sector, Johnson said. Johnson said GD would use its cash reserves to find companies like Vangent that fit with or enhance an existing business area, or allow it to more into an adjacent area. He declined to give details on how large of a deal might be considered, but said he did not expect mergers and acquisition activity to involve top tier companies, at least for now. At the same time, GD is continually looking for ways to restructure, divest and save money in other ways, Johnson said. Already lean and decentralized, the company has fewer than 200 people at its leased corporate headquarters site. For now, Johnson said he was happy with that structure, and the 13 separate business units GD has, but he said there could those structures could change in the future, if it made sense. As GD braces for defense cuts, Johnson is drawing on his experiences overseeing the last downturn in defense spending while serving as chief of naval operations from 1996 to 2000. Back then, Johnson strongly backed the E/F variant of the Boeing Co (BA.N) F/A-18 fighter jet to ensure that the Navy had sufficient fighters for its carriers, rather than waiting for the development of the Joint Strike Fighter, a new fighter being developed by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Johnson says he expects Pentagon officials to pursue a similar approach this time around, with more money to flow into upgrades and incremental improvements than into new programs. The Pentagon has already canceled one big GD program to develop a new amphibious vehicle, the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle or EFV, for the Marine Corps, and it may delay work on two new Army vehicle programs that GD had hoped to bid for. There has been some talk of the Navy slowing work on development of a replacement for the strategic Ohio-class of nuclear submarines, but Johnson said he expects that program to continue, albeit possibly at a slower pace. He said Panetta understands how devastating wholesale program cuts would be for the industrial base, and will keep those issues in mind. “Mr. Panetta gets it,” he said.

53,GD,General Dynamics sees new G650 bolstering margins,"Feb 23 (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp said on Thursday that its new G650 Gulfstream business jet was already bolstering margins in its aerospace sector and that margins on the plane could reach unprecedented levels once it reaches full rate production. Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson told an investor conference that General Dynamics was very pleased with progress on manufacturing the new business jet at a facility built for that purpose in Savannah, Georgia. The first jets coming off that production line were already adding to margins in the sector. “As we hit full rate production, you’re going to see this airplane exceed ... anything we’ve ever done at Gulfstream,” Johnson told a conference hosted by Barclays Capital in Miami. Johnson said the company was increasing the efficiency of the G650 production line “essentially every day,” flight testing was going well, and demand remained strong for the new plane, which he said would redefine the “top end of the business jet market” when it enters service around midyear. Johnson said the company saw a huge international market for business jets, but North America was also showing encouraging signs of recovery. “It’s not a stampede, but it’s certainly coming back,” he said. General Dynamics has a more muted outlook for defense, given expected declines in spending over the next five years, Johnson said, but added that the fiscal 2013 budget reflected steady orders for the shipbuilding and information systems sectors. Ground vehicles were scaled back more, but General Dynamics would work hard with U.S. lawmakers to increase proposed funding for the M-1 Abrams tank program, he said. “We know we’ve got some work to do,” he added. “We’re prepared to do it.” Johnson said that while U.S. spending on military vehicles was going down, the Pentagon was continuing to move ahead with plans to replace the workhorse Humvee and build a new ground combat vehicle in future years. International sales are also expected to account for a growing share of revenues in that sector, he said. Johnson said orders for its information systems division would probably be back-weighted toward the end of 2012, given ongoing uncertainty about additional defense cuts slated to take effect in January 2013 unless Congress reverses them.",2232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics/general-dynamics-sees-new-g650-bolstering-margins-idUSL2E8DN3TM20120223

Novakovic will report to Jay Johnson, who will remain chairman and chief executive, the company said in a statement. The management changes take effect May 2. Sources familiar with the decision said Johnson, 65, would likely leave his position within a year, making room for Novakovic, 54, to become chief executive. Fortune magazine last year named Novakovic, a one-time CIA officer, one of the “50 most powerful women in business.” “This is the beginning of a succession process,” said defense analyst Loren Thompson. “Jay Johnson is 65 and the board has now put in place a process for installing his successor.” The sources said Novakovic was strongly backed for the position by Nick Chabraja, the former chief executive of General Dynamics who has a seat on the company’s board. Board members discussed the management change during a leadership retreat in January, but picked Novakovic for the newly created position of president and chief operating officer at a board meeting at the company’s headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, late on Wednesday. Johnson said Novakovic “is more than ready to assume a larger role in the corporation,” noting that she has performed well in her role as executive vice president of Marine Systems and previously as senior vice president of planning and development. He said Novakovic will assist him with “the oversight and management of the company’s business groups as well as its headquarters operations.” Rob Stallard, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said General Dynamics is following a model used by Lockheed Martin Corp  and Northrop Grumman Corp in developing a succession plan, and he expects Novakovic to become CEO, should everything go smoothly. “This will be an opportunity for Phebe to broaden her operational experience across the company, which should be good preparation for the next step up,” Stallard said in an analyst note after the company announcement. He said the changes are not expected to affect the company’s strategy. “We see this as a positive step, as we think Novakovic has a good reputation with investors, and this clarifies GD’s management succession plans,” he said. General Dynamics shares were trading 63 cents or 0.9 percent higher at $71.88 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Novakovic became an executive vice president of General Dynamics in May 2010, and is responsible for the company’s Marine Systems group, which includes three companies:  Bath Iron Works, Electric Boat and NASSCO. Novakovic previously served as a senior vice president in charge of planning and development, and as vice president for strategic planning.",3082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics/update-2-general-dynamics-names-phebe-novakovic-president-idUSL2E8E87PA20120308

61,GD,UPDATE 2-Two U.S. defense companies beat estimates,"* Northrop and Boeing do better than expected * General Dynamics has Q1 earnings drop of 9 pct * Companies warn of U.S. budget peril By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp  and Boeing Co did better than expected in the first quarter and raised their full-year profit forecasts. General Dynamics Corp, the other big U.S. defense company to report results on Wednesday, had a 9 percent drop in first-quarter earnings, and cited budget anxiety that was slowing government contract awards and a $67 million charge from its European combat systems operations. The companies warned in calls with industry analysts that their outlooks could dim if U.S. lawmakers do not take action to avoid an additional $500 billion in across-the-board defense spending cuts that are due to take effect in January under a process known as “sequestration.” Those cuts would come on top of $487 billion in defense cuts already being implemented for the next decade. Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush said sequestration represented an “ugly cloud” that would have a devastating effect on the industry and was forcing defense companies and the Pentagon to map out contingency plans. But he said there was too much uncertainty to give any specifics at this point. Given the difficult budget environment, Northrop and the other firms stressed that they were keenly focused on improving their performance and cutting costs wherever possible. Backlogs were strong across all three companies, but General Dynamics and Northrop reported lower revenue. Margins remained strong at all three companies. Northrop reported a 2 percent increase in profits from continuing operations in the first quarter, citing cost-cutting across the company. Northrop’s net earnings fell 4.5 percent, reflecting a $34 million gain in the year-ago period from discontinued operations from Northrop’s spinoff of shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. The maker of unmanned spy planes and electronic sensors said income from continuing operations was $506 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared with $496 million, or $1.67 a share, a year ago. It raised its guidance for the full year nearly 30 cents to $6.70 to $6.95 per diluted share. Boeing’s defense business saw revenue rise 8 percent, with operating profit up 11 percent, bolstered by the first booking for F-15 fighter sales to Saudi Arabia. Excluding a gain related to a satellite contract dispute, Boeing’s earnings were $1.11 per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of 94 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company increased its profit forecast for 2012 to a range of $4.15 to $4.35. The previous upper range had been $4.25 per share. Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital, said Boeing could raise its earnings estimate and guidance as the year progresses after a “very good start” in both its defense and commercial divisions. Indeed, revenues at Boeing’s commercial division rose 54 percent to $10.9 billion on higher delivery volume. General Dynamics said net earnings had fallen to $564 million, or $1.57 per share, from $618 million, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped to $7.6 billion from $7.8 billion. The company affirmed its forecast for full-year earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.20, below analysts’ forecasts of $7.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but said strong demand for Gulfstream jets could provide some upside later in the year. The charge from the European operations reduced the General Dynamic’s earnings per share by 13 cents in the quarter. Excluding the charge, earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates by a penny. Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson said the company’s first-quarter performance reflected continued growth in its aerospace segment and healthy North American demand for Gulfstream aircraft. He said the uncertain federal budget environment had slowed government orders early in the first quarter, but activity had begun to pick up in recent weeks. The issue was particularly acute in the company’s information systems and technology division, even for contracts whose funding has already been approved, Johnson added. General Dynamics shares finished trading Wednesday down 3.6 percent at $67.56 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Northrop shares gained 0.4 percent and Boeing ended 5.3 percent higher.",4252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/defense-earnings/update-2-two-u-s-defense-companies-beat-estimates-idUSL2E8FP9NU20120425

Lockheed beat out General Dynamics Corp, which previously ran the center, to win the contract in January, but the award was held up by a protest filed with the General Accountability Office. General Dynamics had protested the contract award but dropped its protest after securing a subcontract with Lockheed, according to a source familiar with the decision.

72,GD,General Dynamics to buy 4G wireless network provider,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp, one of the largest U.S. weapons manufacturers, said it plans to acquire privately-held wireless network equipment maker IPWireless Inc as defense spending in the United States begins to decline. General Dynamics expects to complete the purchase of the San Francisco-based company in the third quarter as it taps into “a fast current of growth” in the rapidly expanding 3G and 4G wireless market, said Gerard DeMuro, executive vice president of the company’s information systems and technology division. He gave no details on the purchase price, but said IPWireless, which has about 90 employees, was expected to generate sales of $65 million to $75 million this year. The acquisition would give General Dynamics a technological and pricing edge in future upgrades to the secure communications networks it already provides for the U.S. military and civilian agencies such as the Coast Guard, Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security, DeMuro said. It will also help General Dynamics compete for billions of dollars of orders as the United States moves to create a nationwide broadband network for first responders over the next 10 years. Congress set aside funding and wireless frequencies to build a national broadband network for first responders as part of the payroll tax cut extension approved earlier this year. “We’re confident that this will bring us double-digit growth in this...business segment which will be difficult to come by in our traditional market, given the current fiscal constraints,” DeMuro said. The acquisition could provide a boost for DeMuro’s information systems division, which saw sales drop 13 percent in the first quarter, and is now projecting a 5 percent decline for the full year, down from earlier projections of flat sales. DeMuro said the acquisition would help General Dynamics meet growing demand from the U.S. military to expand fourth generation capabilities to the battlefield, which could amount to tens and tens of millions of dollars of new business a year. Another main driver was the push for a national broadband network dedicated exclusively to public safety, an area that could generate $15 billion to $20 billion in new business in coming years, according to some estimates. Morgan Keegan recently outlined significant growth opportunities in the public safety market, noting that to be successful, companies would need significant expertise in the wireless and first-responder end markets, as well as experience building and maintaining networks. DeMuro said the acquisition would give General Dynamics valuable product content that it could adapt and integrate into its proposals, setting it apart from other competitors like Raytheon Co and Harris Corp. “This is about keeping the portfolio relevant and competitive in the near and long term,” he said. General Dynamics said IPWireless already provided equipment and solutions to the military and first responders, including the network used by all five boroughs of New York City, the largest multi-agency government network in the United States. It also provides the network for a wireless broadband communications system in Adams County, Colorado, that is being built by Raytheon. IPWireless components and systems allow first responders to access data at very high speeds, including real-time fingerprint identification and high resolution video. DeMuro said the acquisition had been approved by both boards, and IPWireless would be renamed General Dynamics Broadband when the transaction was completed.

74,GD,"Saudi, Egypt orders to keep US tank plant running","* Saudi Arabia to have tanks assembled in Ohio, not overseas * Army sees foreign work offsetting pause in US production * General Dynamics seeking $181 mln for 33 US tanks in FY13 By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Army says a decision by Saudi Arabia to have Abrams tanks assembled at a Lima, Ohio plant run by General Dynamics Corp will help maintain a low level of production at the plant despite a planned three-year halt in U.S. orders. General Dynamics is expected to receive $755 million in orders this year to convert old M1A1 tanks owned by Saudi Arabia to a “like new” M1A2S configuration at the Lima plant, instead of shipping kits for assembly in Saudi Arabia, as originally planned, Army officials said. The company will also receive about $650 million for continued work on 125 kits to modernize M1A1 tanks for Egypt, according to Army officials. Army Lieutenant Colonel Torry Brennan, product manager for the Abrams tank system, said the Army had carefully analyzed the situation and believed the foreign military sales, and a separate vehicle order from Israel, would provide enough direct labor hours to keep the Lima facility open. News of Saudi Arabia’s decision to have the tanks rebuilt in Ohio comes against the backdrop of intense efforts by General Dynamics, lawmakers, local politicians, unions, and business leaders to reverse the Army’s plans to temporarily halt U.S. tank production for the first time since World War Two. General Dynamics says halting U.S. tank production could endanger over 920 jobs at the Lima facility and thousands more at suppliers around the country. A total of 14,000 direct and indirect jobs are linked to 70-ton tanks, the company says. Army and Pentagon officials say they need to cut Abrams funding to help achieve $487 billion in required defense spending reductions over the next decade. They say they will continue to fund up to $400 million in design work on new engines and software upgrades for the next modernization of the tanks to keep some design engineers on the job until production resumes around 2016 or 2017. “We’re not shutting them down. There is going to be a reduction to the rate at which they’re building things,” said Scott Davis, the Army’s program executive officer for ground combat systems. Company officials estimate that it will cost $1.6 billion to stop U.S. production temporarily, far more than it would cost to keep making a small number of U.S. tanks. That is because of the high cost of storing machines and the likely loss of highly skilled workers, many of whom may retire or move elsewhere to find work. They say foreign sales already on the books are not sufficient to keep the facility running at an economical rate, and note that finalizing foreign orders can take a long time. One source familiar with the process said the Saudi order could help achieve the minimum sustaining rate needed for the plant, but negotiations with the Gulf country were not slated to begin until June and such talks often take longer than expected. The broad outlines of the arms sale now being finalized were first approved by the U.S. government in July 2006. Ending U.S. tank production at the Lima facility could actually jeopardize foreign orders and increase their cost since the overhead costs of the facility would be spread over fewer orders, said Keith Deters, the General Dynamics official who manages the Lima plant, the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. He said the U.S. Marine Corps was also planning to remove a huge, computerized and highly sophisticated $16.5 million machining system that it had paid to install at the facility for production of the amphibious Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, which was cancelled in January 2011. General Dynamics officials are still fighting the move, which could also raise the cost of building the Saudi tanks at the plant, and the Namer armored personnel carrier being built for Israel, and say they have even offered to buy the equipment from the Marines. Army officials first proposed halting Abrams production last year, as part of its fiscal 2012 budget, but lawmakers blocked the move, adding $255 million to continue work converting old A1M1 tank hulls into new A1M2 tanks. General Dynamics is expected to receive about $126 million of that amount, since some of the funds go for Army expenses and other government-furnished equipment. No new tanks have been built since the 1990s, and about 75 percent of the old tanks are re-used in the conversion process. Two U.S. House of Representative committees have already voted to provide $181 million for production of Abrams tanks in the budget for fiscal 2013, which begins in October, but such a measure must still be approved by the full House and the Senate.",5112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics-tanks/saudi-egypt-orders-to-keep-us-tank-plant-running-idUSL1E8GAKML20120511
75,GD,Novakovic to succeed GD's Johnson as CEO,"WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) - General Dynamics on Wednesday announced that Chief Executive Jay Johnson will retire at the end of the year, to be succeeded by Phebe Novakovic, who took over as chief operating officer and president last month. Johnson, who celebrated his 66th birthday this week, will receive a bonus of $3.6 million, plus an additional $825,000 for consulting services through the end of June, General Dynamics said a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Novakovic, 54, a one-time CIA officer, was running the company’s marine division before being named president and chief operating officer in March. She had the strong backing of Nick Chabraja, the powerful former chief executive of the company who still holds a seat on the board, according to sources familiar with the process. The same sources had predicted in March that Johnson would leave his position within a year, making room for Novakovic  would to move up to the top spot, but an announcement had not been expected until later in the year. The General Dynamics’ board made the decision at a regular meeting on Wednesday. Johnson, a former Navy fighter pilot who rose to become a four-star admiral and chief of naval operations, said the timing of the changes made sense. “The company is on an excellent financial footing,	 our operational performance is unmatched and our leadership team is very robust. This is the right time to transition,” he said in a statement released by the company. General Dynamics cited development of a new double-V hull Stryker combat vehicle, which protects soldiers from roadside bomb attacks, was among its most significant operational achievements during Johnson’s tenure. It said Johnson also oversaw the start of two-per-year production of Virginia-class attack submarines, and the final development of two new aircraft for Gulfstream, the ultra-long-range Gulfstream G650 and the super mid-sized Gulfstream G280.  Both aircraft are scheduled to enter service this year.

77,GD,UPDATE 1-General Dynamics' Novakovic to succeed Johnson as CEO,"* CEO change caps months of behind-the-scenes wrangling * Novakovic becomes top-ranking woman at big US defense firm * Johnson to get $3.6 million bonus, plus consulting fee By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor General Dynamics said on Wednesday that Chief Executive Jay Johnson would retire at the end of the year, to be succeeded by Phebe Novakovic, who took over as president and chief operating officer just last month. Johnson, who celebrated his 66th birthday this week, will receive a bonus of $3.6 million, plus an additional $825,000 for consulting services through the end of June, General Dynamics said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Novakovic, a one-time CIA officer named by Fortune magazine last year as one of the “50 most powerful women in business,” was running the company’s marine division before being named to her current role in March. She will take over as CEO on Jan. 1. The management changes cap months of behind-the-scenes wrangling about the future leadership of the company, which builds everything from Navy destroyers and nuclear submarines to Army tanks and Gulfstream business jets. In March, General Dynamics said it was splitting the company’s leadership to make Novakovic, 54, president and COO. At the time, sources predicted that Johnson would leave his position within a year, making room for Novakovic to move up to the top spot. But Wednesday’s announcement came earlier than expected, amid mounting concerns about slowing sales and a fall in the company’s share price. The latest move will also make Novakovic the highest-ranking woman to run a major U.S. defense contractor, following a path blazed by Linda Hudson, a former General Dynamics official, who now heads the U.S. unit of Britain’s BAE Systems. “The defense industry is undergoing a demographic revolution in which women for the first time ever are rising to the most senior jobs at places like General Dynamics and BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin,” said defense consultant Loren Thompson. “Twenty years ago you wouldn’t have believed that this industry was capable of such a transformation.” Lockheed Martin Corp announced in April that Marillyn Hewson, who has held a wide array of leadership posts, would become president and chief operating officer in January. Novakovic, who joined General Dynamics in 2001, had the strong backing of Nick Chabraja, the powerful former chief executive of the company who still holds a seat on the board, according to sources familiar with the process. The General Dynamics board made the decision at a regular meeting on Wednesday. Johnson, a former Navy F-14 fighter pilot who rose to become a four-star admiral and chief of naval operations, said the timing of the changes made sense. “The company is on an excellent financial footing, our operational performance is unmatched and our leadership team is very robust. This is the right time to transition,” he said in a statement released by the company. But defense consultant Jim McAleese said Johnson’s earlier-than-expected departure reflected the board’s concern about first-quarter declines in sales and earnings in the information systems sector, which generates about a third of overall sales. Those results, and signs that a key customer, the U.S. Army, was slowing spending even before tough budget cuts take effect, had driven General Dynamics shares down by about $3 in April. “Clearly the company needs a catalyst to reenergize the stock,” McAleese said, adding that Novakovic was seen by investors as shrewd, charismatic and decisive. Before joining General Dynamics, Novakovic spent nearly four years as a special assistant to the defense secretary and deputy secretary of defense from 1997 to 2001. General Dynamics shares closed $1.64 or 2.46 percent higher on Wednesday at $63.62, still well below a year high of $75.92 reached in July 2011. General Dynamics cited development of a new double-V hull Stryker combat vehicle, which protects soldiers from roadside bomb attacks, as among its most significant operational achievements during Johnson’s tenure. It said Johnson also oversaw the start of two-per-year production of Virginia-class attack submarines, and the final development of two new aircraft for Gulfstream, the ultra-long-range Gulfstream G650 and the super mid-sized Gulfstream G280.  Both aircraft are scheduled to enter service this year. Johnson, who joined General Dynamics’ board in 2003, was the chief executive of Dominion Virginia Power before taking a top management job with General Dynamics in 2008. He moved into the CEO job in June 2009 when Chabraja retired. Johnson said he felt he met his objectives to extend the company’s “excellent performance, enhance the relevance of the products and services we deliver to our customers and continue the development of a strong group of well-qualified executives who would be ready to lead the company into a new era.” Thompson said Novakovic would face tough challenges when she assumes power, including the prospect of $500 billion in additional defense spending cuts on top of $487 billion already slated to take effect over the next decade. “Johnson is leaving General Dynamics in pretty good shape, but his successor is going to face some really daunting challenges in terms of budget sequestration and declining military demand,” he said.",6072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics-ceo/update-1-general-dynamics-novakovic-to-succeed-johnson-as-ceo-idUSL1E8H6M9B20120607

81,GD,General Dynamics announces second acquisition in a week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) on Monday announced its second acquisition in a week, moves the company said were aimed at expanding its portfolio and keeping its offerings relevant. General Dynamics on Monday said it had acquired the defense operations of Gayston Corp, a privately held company that supplies precision metal components used in munitions programs, such as the Hydra-70 rocket for military helicopters. It said the deal was a cash transaction but did not disclose anything else other than to say it would be accretive to earnings in 2013. Gayston’s defense operations employ 187 people at a state-of-the-art facility in Springboro, Ohio, where the company makes rocket motor tubes and other aluminum parts. Michael Mulligan, president of General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products division, said the acquisition would expand the company’s ability to produce high-precision parts in large quantities for lower cost. Last week, General Dynamics said it was acquiring Fidelis Security Systems Inc, a cybersecurity company that employs about 70 people in Maryland and Massachusetts to provide real-time network visibility, analysis and control. The value of the cash transaction was not disclosed. “By acquiring companies that enhance our capabilities or open doors to new customers, we are able to expand our portfolio and maintain the relevancy of our offerings,” said General Dynamics spokesman Rob Doolittle. Defense consultant Jim McAleese said General Dynamics was pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy to help it expand revenue after disappointing second-quarter results. Most other big companies in the defense sector have put their acquisition plans on hold until the budget outlook for 2013 becomes clearer, but General Dynamics has “a much more immediate requirement,” McAleese said. “In the short term it will counteract the revenue contraction that they’re seeing in the information systems and technology sector,” he said, noting that the company also faced weaker demand from the U.S. Army due to the end of the war in Iraq and the drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

89,GD,General Dynamics flags possible risk on Portugal arms contract,"WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp  said on Tuesday it had filed a demand for arbitration against Portugal’s defence minister after he said he planned to terminate the company’s seven-year contract to build 260 Pandur armoured vehicles for the Portuguese government. General Dynamics said in a statement that the Portuguese defence minister had said on Oct. 16 that he intended to terminate the contract due to an alleged breach by the U.S. company. It gave no further details on the allegation. The weapons and aircraft maker said it had been in discussions with Portugal about restructuring the contract, but had not been officially notified of any termination plans or breach of contract, and did not believe it had violated the contract. “To protect our rights under the contract, we have filed a demand for arbitration,” the company said in a 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the filing, the company said it could not predict whether the contract would ultimately be restructured or terminated, what the outcome of the arbitration proceeding would be, or what effect it would have on its operating results or cash flows. The company said its European Land Systems unit and Portuguese partner, Fabrequipa, had built and delivered 166 vehicles to the Portuguese armed forces, and were waiting to deliver 27 more vehicles that had been ready since 2011. No details were immediately available about the overall value of the Pandur deal. General Dynamics said the program supported over 200 direct jobs in Barreiro, Portugal, and many more workers at Portuguese companies producing parts and components. In the news release, General Dynamics said its team was “prepared and committed to manufacture the remaining vehicles required under the contract, subject to confirmation from the Ministry of National Defence that it is willing and able to accept and pay for the vehicles.” The company issued a news release earlier this week in Europe in which it first disclosed the arbitration request. Alfonso Ramonet, President of General Dynamics European Land Systems, said he was hopeful a solution could be found with the Portuguese government, noting that the company had made good on its pledge to build the vehicles, and transfer valuable technology and know-how to local industry. “We have consistently and repeatedly communicated to the Ministry of National Defence that General Dynamics European Land Systems is willing and able to work on a mutually-acceptable solution, taking into consideration the current economic situation in Portugal and the needs of the Portuguese Armed Forces,” said Ramonet said in a statement.",10312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics-portugal/general-dynamics-flags-possible-risk-on-portugal-arms-contract-idUSL1E8LUES520121031

94,GD,"General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls win huge U.S. submarine orders","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy last week awarded submarine contracts worth up to $4.5 billion to General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII.N), securing the funds from automatic budget cuts if Congress cannot reach agreement on other ways to reduce U.S. deficits. The Navy awarded General Dynamics a five-year contract valued at up to $1.99 billion if all options are exercised, for research and development work on a new submarine to replace the current Ohio-class vessels, which carry nuclear weapons. It awarded a separate contract worth nearly $2.5 billion for construction of two smaller Virginia-class submarines, work that will be split between General Dynamics’ Electric Boat division, based in Groton, Connecticut, and Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News shipyard. Connecticut Representative Joe Courtney welcomed the contract news, saying it would help stabilize the local workforce and ensure continued production of submarines, which he described as “a key component of our national security.” He said hundreds of new engineers and designers had already been hired to work on the new submarine program at a New London, Connecticut, facility. “This contract will leverage the unique skills of Electric Boat’s submarine and design workforce in designing a capable and cost effective replacement for our Ohio class submarines,” Courtney said, noting that Electric Boat had a record of building submarines ahead of schedule and under budget. General Dynamics spokesman Kendell Pease said the orders demonstrated the continued and increasing importance of submarines to U.S. national security, particularly given the Obama administration’s planned pivot to the Asia-Pacific region. “As we move to the Asia Pacific region, submarines will become increasingly important,” Pease said. The Pentagon announced the cost-plus, fixed-fee contract for design work on the Ohio-class replacement submarine late last Friday, and said it included special incentives. The contract is worth up to $1.99 billion if all options are exercised. The Pentagon said the contract included design work on the new submarine and continued work on a new common missile compartment being developed jointly by the U.S. Navy and Britain, as well as cost reduction initiatives and full-scale prototype manufacturing and assembly. Most of the work will be done at General Dynamics’ Connecticut facility, but about 7 percent of the work will be done by Huntington Ingalls. The Navy eventually plans to buy 12 new submarines to replace the current fleet of aging Ohio-class submarines, with construction slated to begin in 2021. The Navy also awarded a contract to General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls for construction of the last two Virginia-class submarines under a multi-year contract approved by Congress in fiscal 2008 that locked in a two-a-year production rate. General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls split the work on the Virginia-class submarines.

97,GD,UPDATE 1-General Dynamics tells 139 workers of pending layoffs,"* Would reduce Anniston, Alabama force to around 260 * Linked to reduced orders for Stryker vehicles * GD sees further layoffs if no U.S. Army orders received By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp  said on Monday it notified 139 of its employees at the U.S. Army Depot in Anniston, Alabama last week that they face layoffs beginning in March due to a reduction in the company’s production of Stryker armored vehicles. General Dynamics issued notices to the workers under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act, notifying them that the expected layoffs will kick in from March through April, said company spokesman Peter Keating. The company already laid off 98 people at the facility last year. The latest layoff notices will reduce the number of General Dynamics workers to around 260 from just over 400 now, Keating said. He said additional layoffs may be announced later, depending on the level of work to be done at the facility. Many of the workers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America union. General Dynamics says it could have staved off those layoffs if the Army had placed additional orders valued at around $170 million to retrofit existing Stryker vehicles with a tougher hull designed to survive roadside bombs, but those orders did not come through in time. The Army and other military services are unsure about future budget levels given mounting pressures on the overall defense budget, and the failure so far of lawmakers to avert $500 billion in additional spending reductions due to kick in on March 1. Over 300 workers at the General Dynamics plant wrote to Alabama lawmakers in December, urging them to continue their efforts to avoid what they called “unnecessary layoffs,” especially since Army officials have already said that more double V-hulled Strykers will likely be needed in the future. The Army has a total of 3,300 Strykers, including about 600 built with the double-V hulls, and nearly 50 that were retrofitted with the stronger hulls. General Dynamics says it can exchange the hulls on the wheeled military vehicles for about half the cost of building new ones. It says the new hulls protect soldiers about as well as Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles built specifically to reduce injuries and deaths caused by roadside bombs. It has urged the Army to place orders for additional upgrades now, arguing that interrupting production and restarting it later will be more expensive and will trigger layoffs at its own facility and those of key suppliers. Some of those workers could be rehired later, depending on when additional orders are placed. Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, warned the chief of staff of the Army, General Raymond Odierno, in a letter in December that delays in placing orders for a third brigade of Strykers with the double-v hull could jeopardize good jobs at the plant and would put U.S. soldiers’ lives at risk. In the letter, Shelby said Army officials had told him they planned to buy a third brigade of the upgraded vehicles, which he said offered an exponential increase in soldier safety, but could not give him a timeline for signing a contract with General Dynamics and starting production. “I ask that you personally engage on this issue to ensure our bureaucracy does not unnecessarily limit the rapid production and fielding of this needed capability,” he wrote. No comment was immediately available from the Army. Of the 406 General Dynamics workers now at the plant, about 350 currently work on the Stryker program, a company spokesman said. If no contract is signed with the Army for additional hull exchanges the total number of workers is likely to be reduced to around 159, the spokesman said.",1142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics-layoffs/update-1-general-dynamics-tells-139-workers-of-pending-layoffs-idUSL2N0AJFOT20130114

100,GD,"Charge, government spending cuts hammer General Dynamics results","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) reported a $2.1 billion loss and lower-than-expected revenue for the 2012 fourth quarter as one-time charges and shrinking government orders hammered results at the weapons and aircraft maker. The company’s new chief executive, Phebe Novakovic, told analysts she had worked with General Dynamics’ business units to develop more realistic operating plans and expected significant upside for future margins. But she said she was keeping her guidance for 2013 conservative for now. “We will focus this year on operations, drive cost out of our businesses and improve performance. But I do not intend to guide you to higher operating margins than are currently embedded in our plan because we have yet to earn them,” Novakovic said in her first quarterly call with analysts. She took over as CEO on January 1. Distancing herself from her predecessor, Jay Johnson, Novakovic said she was not a “particular fan” of some of the acquisitions made in recent years. But she said she had no plans for divestitures or significant portfolio reshaping at the moment. “It ought to be clear from the charges that in some respects we took our eye off the ball,” Novakovic said, vowing to be “focused like a laser beam” on returning value to shareholders. “We are not going to chase revenue. We are going to stick to our knitting and do what we know how to do,” she said, calling 2013 a year for reset. General Dynamics’ earnings report weighed on the company’s shares initially, driving them down as much as 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. But Novakovic’s remarks appeared to reassure investors and the stock recouped all its losses. The shares were up 50 cents at $71.21 in afternoon trading. “Phebe Novakovic used her first earnings call to set a different tone for the company and to clear the decks for improved performance in the future,” said Virginia-based defense consultant Loren Thompson. The company, which builds warships, ground combat vehicles and business jets, said its quarterly loss amounted to $6.07 per share, mainly due to a $2 billion noncash charge in its information systems business that reflected lower U.S. defense spending. It posted a profit of $603 million in the year-earlier period. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share dropped to $1.39 from $1.68 a year earlier. General Dynamics also took $867 million in other charges in the latest quarter, including $301 million in its aerospace and information systems businesses. Revenue declined nearly 12 percent to $8.08 billion, missing analysts’ average forecast of $8.8 billion. Three of the company’s four divisions reported lower revenue, and the aerospace division saw a sales increase of only 0.2 percent. For the full year 2012, the company posted a loss $332 million. Excluding one-time charges, it earned $6.48 per share. Novakovic forecast earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.60 to $6.70 in 2013 and said revenue would likely be flat to up 1.5 percent. “We have cleaned up our business, 2013 is our reset year,” she said, calling that a prudent strategy given continued uncertainty about future U.S. budget levels. She said the information systems business was likely past the worst pressures, shipbuilding programs were stable, and the combat systems division was poised to pick up some significant orders in the first quarter. The company’s aerospace business, which introduced two new Gulfstream business jet models in 2012, was gearing up for strong production in 2013 and should generate a 16 percent increase in revenue, Novakovic said. Overall, she said General Dynamics, one of the biggest Pentagon contractors, was well positioned to weather expected declines in U.S. military spending, barring any draconian new cuts. “The first quarter in charge for new CEO Phebe Novakovic has included some anticipated clearing of the decks, though the scale of the writedowns are pretty eye-watering,” analyst Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note. General Dynamics overpaid for some acquisitions, and the company’s short-cycle and vehicle businesses were declining faster than expected, he said. But the Gulfstream business is in good shape and shipbuilding looks stable, he said. The company, based in Falls Church, Virginia, said its backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $51.3 billion, down from $57.4 billion at the end of 2011.

Its shares fell nearly 5 percent in early trading on Wednesday. The company, which builds warships, ground combat vehicles and business jets, reported a quarterly loss from continuing operations of $2.1 billion, or $6.07 per share, mainly due to a $2 billion noncash charge in its information systems business, which it said reflected lower U.S. defense spending. It posted a profit of $603 million in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share dropped to $1.39, down from $1.68 in the year-earlier period. The company said it also took $867 million in other charges, including $301 million in its aerospace and information systems businesses, in the quarter. Revenue declined nearly 12 percent in the quarter, dropping to $8.08 billion from $9.15 billion, and missing analysts’ forecasts of $8.8 billion. Three of the company’s four divisions reported lower revenue in the fourth quarter, and the aerospace division saw a sales increase of only a 0.2 percent. For full-year 2012, the company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $332 million, a huge swing from a profit of $2.55 billion a year earlier. That resulted in a net loss per share of 94 cents, down from a net profit per share of $6.94 in 2011. Adjusted for the charge, full-year earnings were $2.3 billion, or $6.48 per share, the company said. New chief executive Phebe Novakovic, who took over on January 1, said the fourth-quarter charges and the full-year loss reflected contracting markets and a decline in government spending in the United States and overseas. She said the results also pointed to the need for improvement in some areas, and said the company would continue to manage its business aggressively. She provided no immediate details in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings release. The company, based in Falls Church, Virginia, said its backlog at the end of the quarter was $51.3 billion, down from $57.4 billion at the end of 2011.

The warnings come as military contractors weigh uncertainties over scheduled maintenance and repair work that may be put on hold as the federal government makes $85 billion in spending cuts. The U.S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) requires most companies with 100 or more employees to give notification 60 days in advance of mass layoffs or plant closings.

110,GD,"U.S. arms makers boost earnings, shares surge","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. weapons makers reported higher-than-expected profit and improved margins for the first quarter, even as revenue began to taper off after more than a decade of sharp growth in U.S. military spending. Boeing Co’s (BA.N) defense division, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) on Wednesday followed the lead of Pentagon supplier Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in reporting higher earnings and lower revenue. Shares of the companies rose sharply on their financial results, with General Dynamics shares closing nearly 7 percent higher at $71.73 in what analysts said amounted to a strong vote of confidence in the firm’s new chief executive, Phebe Novakovic. Boeing shares closed 3 percent higher at $90.83, while Northrop shares gained 3.2 percent to close at $73.77. Lockheed shares, which saw big gains on Tuesday, edged up another 0.65 percent higher to close at $97.69. Operating margins remained steady or improved across the sector, ranging from 10.3 percent to 12.4 percent, but executives warned that uncertainty about future military spending levels could weigh on revenue this year and next. “Weaker revenues and strong earnings are typical of this point in the defense spending cycle. However, the erosion in revenues is probably a leading indicator of where earnings are headed,” said defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute. “Earnings eventually will erode as the impact of sequestration is fully felt,” he said, referring to across-the-board federal spending cuts. Northrop Grumman, which builds unmanned planes and other military equipment, said it was focused on executing programs, cash deployment and tweaking its portfolio as mandatory spending cuts known as sequestration start to take effect. The company reported net earnings of $489 million, or $2.03 a share, compared with $506 million, or $1.96 a share a year earlier. Revenue dipped to $6.1 billion from $6.2 billion. “Looking ahead, we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain and constrained budget environment,” said Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush. Bush told analysts that he did not expect cancellation of any significant Northrop programs as a result of sequestration in fiscal 2013, but continuing uncertainty about future budget cuts could weigh on bookings this year. Sales and bookings in the third and fourth quarters would help clarify the outlook for 2014, Bush said. “It is very likely this is going to negatively impact sales in 2014,” he said. “To think that the sequester somehow dissipates and goes away and doesn’t impact the future is putting your head in the sand.” Bush said a broader strategic review initiated by U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and due to be completed next month would also help inform future budgets. He cited double-digit growth on programs in the cyber security arena. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said his office was closely involved in Hagel’s department-wide review. Kendall on Wednesday unveiled plans to further improve the way the Defense Department buys arms, including new guidelines on profits on fixed-price contracts, but he insisted the Pentagon did not aim to cut into companies’ margins. “We’re not after people’s profits as a way to reduce costs,” Kendall told reporters at the Pentagon. “We want to tie profit and performance together.” General Dynamics, which builds ships, tanks and Gulfstream business jets, reported slightly higher first-quarter earnings, far exceeding analysts’ forecasts, but revenue fell short of expectations. General Dynamics said net earnings rose to $571 million, or $1.62 per share, from $564 million or $1.57 per share, a year earlier. Revenue dipped to $7.4 billion from $7.58 billion. Novakovic, who has carried out a series of management changes since taking over on January 1, said the company was focused on operations, cost improvement and cash generation. “Going after overhead is critical to margin expansion in the down environment,” she told analysts. She said General Dynamics would continue to reduce its workforce as needed in the current budget environment but declined to forecast any specific areas targeted for layoffs. Boeing, the second-largest U.S. weapons maker, said its defense earnings rose 12 percent to $832 million, while revenue slipped 1 percent to $8.1 billion. Boeing’s operating margin remained the lowest among the companies that reported earnings this week, although it rose to 10.3 percent from 9 percent a year earlier. Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said Boeing expected growth in key areas such as space, unmanned systems, intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance, and cyber security. He said the company also expected expanding sales of its smaller commercial satellites.

112,GD,"General Dynamics earnings edge higher, beat forecast","(Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) reported slightly higher first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, far exceeding analysts’ forecasts, but revenue fell short of expectations. The maker of tanks, ships and Gulfstream jets reported net earnings of $571 million, or $1.62 per share, up from $564 million or $1.57 per share, a year earlier. The largely upbeat report drove the company’s shares nearly 5 percent higher in morning trading, with the stock trading $3.23 higher at $70.38. Joe Nadol at JP Morgan said the market’s concerns ahead of the results now appeared to have been “overdone” and the sales miss was more than offset by better operating margins. Revenues dipped to $7.4 billion from $7.58 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings of $528 million, or $1.50 per share, on revenue of $7.55 billion. Operating margins edged up to 11.4 percent from 11.3 percent a year earlier, the company said. Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic, who has carried out a series of management changes since taking over on January 1, said the company was focused on operations, cost improvement and cash generation. “Going after overhead is critical to margin expansion in the down environment,” Novakovic told an analysts call, noting that cost-cutting efforts would also make the company’s products more competitive. “So you ... better believe that we’re going to be very, very focused on taking costs out and we’ve done it. And we’ll continue to do it,” she said. She said General Dynamics would continue to reduce its workforce as needed in the current budget environment but declined to forecast any specific areas targeted for layoffs. Novakovic also underscored the company’s commitment to dividend increases and “shareholder-friendly” share buybacks. General Dynamics increased its quarterly dividend payment by 10 percent to 56 cents a share in March, a trend she called “important.” It repurchased 1 million shares in the first quarter and still had authorization to buy back over 9 million more shares, she said. Novakovic said the company also needed to strengthen its balance sheet “a touch” after charges in the fourth quarter, with no acquisitions on the near-term horizon. Novakovic called the first-quarter results “a strong start toward achieving our objectives for the year.” She said the Gulfstream business was expected to grow significantly over the longer term, while the company’s marine group would see expanded submarine sales. Margins would remain a key focus area for the information services sector, while international orders should help combat systems bridge to more robust U.S. Army spending in future years. “In general, I like ... the offsetting cyclicality we have embedded and in all respects, we see a clear way forward,” she said. General Dynamics’ backlog at the end of the quarter was $48.5 billion, down from $55.2 billion a year earlier. The company said the estimated value of various unfunded contracts and options that have not been exercised was $25.2 billion.

116,GD,"WRAPUP 1-U.S. arms makers boost earnings, but revenues weakening","WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - Top U.S. weapons makers reported higher-than-expected profit and improved margins for the first quarter, even as revenue began to taper off after more than a decade of sharp growth in U.S. military spending. Boeing Co’s defense division, Northrop Grumman Corp  and General Dynamics Corp on Wednesday followed the lead of top Pentagon supplier Lockheed Martin Corp  in reporting higher earnings and lower revenue. Operating margins remained steady or improved across the sector, ranging from 10.3 percent to 12.4 percent. “Weaker revenues and strong earnings are typical of this point in the defense spending cycle. However, the erosion in revenues is probably a leading indicator of where earnings are headed,” said defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute. “Earnings eventually will erode as the impact of sequestration is fully felt,” he said, referring to across-the-board federal spending cuts. Northrop Grumman, which builds unmanned planes and a range of other defense equipment, said it was focused on executing programs, cash deployment and tweaking its portfolio as U.S. defense budgets start to feel the bite of the mandatory spending cuts. The company reported net earnings of $489 million, or $2.03 a share, compared with $506 million, or $1.96 a share a year earlier. Revenue dipped to $6.1 billion from $6.2 billion. “Looking ahead, we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain and constrained budget environment,” said Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush. General Dynamics, which builds ships, tanks and Gulfstream business jets, reported slightly higher first-quarter earnings, far exceeding analysts’ forecasts, but revenue fell short of expectations.

The Defense Department and the Navy announced the 10-year contract with Huntington Ingalls, and a separate $2.84 billion deal with General Dynamics for four new warships, after the close of business on Monday. General Dynamics also got an option for an additional ship, which would bring the value of the company’s contract to $3.53 billion, if exercised, the Defense Department said. The Navy said it planned to buy the 10th ship as part of its spending plan for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, but needed to resolve funding shortfalls resulting from mandatory across-the-board spending cuts before signing that deal. The Navy said the competition generated estimated savings of $1.5 billion, while allowing the companies and their suppliers to plan more efficiently for future work. The two companies are the only makers of the Navy’s DDG 51 destroyers. The Navy has used a competitive strategy to buy DDG 51 destroyers since 1996 that gives the winning bidder a higher profit margin on the ships. In this case, Huntington Ingalls would earn a profit of 14 percent on the contract, said Navy spokesman Chris Johnson. He had no immediate details on the profit to be earned by General Dynamics, which won the upper hand in the previous competition. The Navy said Huntington Ingalls’ contract included options for engineering change proposals and other items that would bring the value of the contract to $3.38 billion, if exercised. Huntington Ingalls said the contract would allow it to build ships more efficiently by buying bulk material and moving the skilled workforce from ship to ship. Huntington Ingalls, which was spun off by Northrop Grumman Corp in 2011, has built 28 DDG 51 destroyers for the Navy to date, and has two more under construction. It will build the new ships at its shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, which was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",6032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/navy-ships/update-2-huntington-ingalls-general-dynamics-win-us-navy-orders-idUSL1N0EF1UN20130603
120,GD,General Dynamics to beat out Germany for Saudi tank deal-report,"FRANKFURT, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. defence firm General Dynamics is in talks to deliver battle tanks to Saudi Arabia, beating out German rival Krauss-Maffei Wegmann for the lucrative deal, a German newspaper reported. Handelsblatt daily cited industry sources as saying on Friday that a deal for Saudi Arabia to buy M1 Abrams tanks from General Dynamics was already in sight. General Dynamics and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann were not immediately available for comment. There has been speculation for months that Saudi Arabia could order more than 200 Leopard 2 tanks from Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, though the company has never confirmed such reports. According to other unconfirmed media reports, Germany gave pre-approval for the export of 270 Leopard 2 tanks to Saudi Arabia in 2011. Defence sources in Germany have said that the German government wanted to hold off making a decision until after federal elections in September, and Handelsblatt speculated on Friday that Saudi Arabia was no longer willing to wait. Arms exports are a sensitive issue in Germany given its Nazi past as well as the role arms makers such as Krupp played in feeding 19th and 20th century wars with exports to both sides of conflicts. Peer Steinbrueck, a leader of the opposition Social Democrats running against German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the election, has criticised her government for letting arms exports surge. After World War Two, successive West German and later united German governments placed tight restrictions on arms exports, especially to regions where there were armed conflicts or where human rights were poorly respected.",7122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-saudi-arms/general-dynamics-to-beat-out-germany-for-saudi-tank-deal-report-idUSL6N0FI0RV20130712
121,GD,UPDATE 1-General Dynamics raises outlook as profit beats Street,"* Company committed to share buybacks, dividends * Raises full-year earnings guidance * Aerospace division profit up 51 pct By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, July 24 (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp  reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, with strength in its Gulfstream jet division offsetting declines in a defense business feeling the heat of Pentagon budget cuts. The company also raised its guidance for full-year earnings, sending its shares up sharply in morning trading to a new 52-week high of $86.39. Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said the quarterly results were ahead of the company’s plans, but she remained focused on improving performance further - especially given the difficult Pentagon budget climate - and making shareholders happy through stock buybacks and dividends. “The best antidote to a budget cut is performance,” Novakovic told analysts on a conference call. “I would note that bears eat the sick and the young first, so we are very focused on maintaining our good execution on each of our programs, because without that execution, you become more vulnerable.” She said General Dynamics expects to deploy almost all, if not all, of its free cash flow to share buybacks and dividends, with no big acquisition targets on her radar screen. Going forward, she said the company was focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to seize opportunities if they appear. General Dynamics, which makes tanks, ships and Gulfstream jets, reported net earnings of $640 million, or $1.81 per share, up from $634 million, or $1.77 per share, a year earlier. Revenue was little changed at $7.91 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings per share of $1.62 on revenue of $7.73 billion. The company raised its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $6.85 to $6.95 per share, up from an earlier forecast of $6.60 to $6.70. Novakovic said she would revise the guidance again if mandatory Pentagon budget cuts under a process known as “sequestration” hit harder in the 2013 second half. The company’s backlog was $49.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 5.6 percent from a year earlier. Novakovic said the aerospace business, which includes Gulfstream business jets, reported the highest revenue, operating earnings and margins in the last six quarters. The division’s operating earnings were up 51.4 percent and its margin jumped to 18.9 percent from 16 percent. Novakovic described the division’s results as “a clear manifestation of jet aviation’s return to profitability and the performance improvement at Gulfstream.” She said the division expected a less stellar performance in the third quarter due to cost increases on several key supplier contracts, lower production rates, and a shift in the mix of production models toward lower-margin airplanes. But she said the fourth quarter would see a return to second-quarter production levels and other improvements. In the combat systems division, revenue dropped 28 percent in the second quarter and operating earnings fell 32 percent. Novakovic said the division was hurt by a delay in large international orders, which are now expected in the second half. She forecast higher operating margins for the division going forward. Revenue was up 6.4 percent in the marine systems division, but earnings were down 2.7 percent. The information systems and technology division had largely flat revenue, which earnings fell 12.4 percent. Margins were lower in all three defense businesses.",7242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics-results/update-1-general-dynamics-raises-outlook-as-profit-beats-street-idUSL1N0FU0T020130724

The fixed-price contract, which carries an incentive fee, also covers construction of a new aft peripheral launch system to launch missiles from the ship. The contract runs through December 2016, the Pentagon said in its daily digest of major weapons deals. Chris Johnson, spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command, said the Navy initially planned to buy a composite deckhouse and the missile launch system for the ship from Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N). But it decided to launch a new limited competition after failing to reach agreement after a year of negotiations with Huntington Ingalls. Ultimately, he said, Navy officials chose a cheaper offer submitted by General Dynamics for a steel deckhouse after concluding it would not compromise the weight and stealth requirements for the ship, Johnson said. In a statement, the Navy said work was progressing well on all three Zumwalt class destroyers that General Dynamics is building for the Navy. The new class of destroyers will provide advanced land attack capability in possible future wars. Work on the first destroyer, DDG 1000 is due to be completed in fiscal 2014, with the second ship to follow in fiscal 2016 and the third in fiscal 2018. The Navy awarded General Dynamics a $1.826 billion contract for construction of the last two ships in September 2011. Huntington Ingalls said it was disappointed but remained committed to working closely with the Navy to complete its work on the second destroyer by the first quarter of 2014. “Ingallls Shipbuilding continues to perform well in building the composite products for the DDG 1000 program.

129,GD,UPDATE 2-U.S. Navy says all weapon programs under budget reviews,"By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said all Navy and Marine Corps weapons programs were being examined for possible cuts or cancellation if mandatory, across-the-board budget cuts remained in effect in coming years. “Everything’s got to be on the table. There are no sacred cows now,” Mabus told military officers at the National Defense University in Washington. “No matter how well we do it, they’re going to be incredibly hard choices.” Mabus urged lawmakers to give the Pentagon the flexibility to make choices about implementing $500 billion in cuts over the next decade. Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin said he was hopeful of reaching a balanced deal to replace automatic, across-the-board spending cuts. He said a deal would have to include more spending cuts, reductions in entitlement programs and new revenues, possibly by closing tax loopholes. Current law requires an across-the-board cut of all Pentagon spending accounts, which will not allow the services to prioritize their spending levels. Mabus said the Navy was reviewing service contracts, which comprise one quarter of its annual spending of $160 billion. He did not give examples of programs on the chopping block if mandatory cuts required under sequestration stayed in place, although he cited decisions in recent years to cancel the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle developed by General Dynamics Corp for the Marines, and to truncate the five-year-old DDG 1000 destroyer program, also built by General Dynamics. Defense officials say the Navy is looking at an array of options, including buying fewer coastal warships built by Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia’s Austal, and delaying orders for the Navy’s F-35 C-model, also built by Lockheed to land on aircraft carriers. Lockheed, Austal and other Navy suppliers such as General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc are  awaiting news about how the Navy would cut spending in its fiscal 2105 budget plan now being prepared. The services are working to finalize their plans in coming days so they can send them to top Pentagon leaders for review. Mabus said the Navy was doing all it could to protect training and readiness, but warned that if the cuts stayed in place, sailors and Marines might have to deploy without adequate training within 12 to 18 months. Training and maintenance had already been scaled back, while protecting funding needed for deployments, but the forecast cuts would eventually begin to affect those areas, he said. He said naval forces remained in the Middle East at the ready to deal with Syria, but ongoing budget cuts could undermine the Navy’s ability to provide those military options to the president in the future. “Unless we act to address the damage of continuing resolutions and sequestration, there are options which may be limited or just not available in the future,” Mabus said. Continued budget cuts could force the Navy to eliminate more than three dozen planned maintenance periods for its warships, and ground more than 200 aircraft. Mabus also warned that the Navy’s efforts to rebuild its fleet and drive down acquisition costs would be jeopardized if budget cuts forced it to break multiyear acquisition contracts.",9112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-budget-navy/update-2-u-s-navy-says-all-weapon-programs-under-budget-reviews-idUSL2N0H71KE20130911

133,GD,"WRAPUP 1-U.S. arms makers post higher profit, decry budget cloudiness","* Top four U.S. weapons makers report lower sales * Executives say U.S. budget uncertainty hinders investment * Boeing’s overall profit up but defense earnings down * Defense stocks mostly rise, General Dynamics falls By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Major U.S. weapons makers posted higher third-quarter profit on Wednesday despite budget cuts, their margins remained largely solid or rose in places, and revenue fell less than expected. But executives at the top four weapons makers - Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co, General Dynamics Corp  and Northrop Grumman Corp - said the outlook remains hazy given lingering uncertainty over defense budgets in the United States and abroad. Raytheon Co is due to report earnings on Thursday. The companies say they are weathering the initial stages of the downturn in military spending thanks to aggressive cost-cutting, workforce reductions and facility closures, and a sharper focus on executing contracts on time and on budget. All the major players expect lower revenue and mounting pressure on margins unless Congress reverses a law that would cut Pentagon spending by $500 billion on top of $487 billion in cuts already planned for the next decade. Phebe Novakovic, chief executive of General Dynamics, which builds U.S. Navy warships, combat vehicles and Gulfstream business jets, told analysts that the political brinkmanship over the U.S. debt ceiling and the recent government shutdown were sobering reminders that companies need to be cautious and hold on to cash. “The government took the nation to the edge on the debt ceiling extension. We were forced to gaze into the abyss where we saw the full faith and credit of our principal customer at risk,” she told analysts on a conference call. Novakovic said there was a chance that the entire showdown experience could be repeated in January when the debt ceiling is due to be breached again. “It’s entirely possible that we find ourselves in an extended period of time trapped in Dante’s first circle of hell,” she said. “All of that suggests that we need prudence and caution ... until we can get a more stable plan from the government with respect to both the debt ceiling and funding.” Novakovic said budget uncertainty had driven orders from the U.S. Army lower than expected, which was taking a toll on revenue at the company’s combat systems business. But she said the government shutdown and debt ceiling concerns were also making private companies reluctant to buy new business jets. Executives at Northrop, Lockheed and Boeing raised similar concerns during their earnings calls with analysts. Northrop Grumman Chief Executive Wes Bush forecast a further decline in revenue in 2014 given the uncertainty over funding levels and projected cuts in military spending, and said it was difficult to plan for investments and other projects. Bush said he was particularly worried that the uncertain fiscal situation was depressing investment in the research and development efforts that underpinned the U.S. economy. The repeated failure by Congress to enact proper budgets every year and to rely instead on so-called continuing resolutions to fund the government also has also had a negative effect, he said. It has effectively capped funding at the previous year’s levels and prevented the Pentagon from starting most new programs unless it received a special waiver. “We need to return to a functional appropriations process in managing our country’s affairs, and ending the sequester should be a first step in that direction,” Bush said. Shares of major weapons makers rose across the board on Wednesday with the exception of General Dynamics, which closed 2.2 percent lower at $86.23 amid concerns about its combat systems business, which saw quarterly revenues drop 30 percent. General Dynamics reported higher overall earnings and operating margins for the third quarter and raised its full-year earnings forecast by 5 cents a share to a range of $6.90 to $7.00. Lockheed shares rose 1.5 percent to close at a year high of $131.98 after the company reported higher earnings and lifted its earnings forecast for the full year. Boeing shares rose 5.3 percent to close at $129.02 as the company reported a surprising 12 percent jump in quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast. But Boeing’s military aircraft revenue fell 5 percent, and earnings in the defense, space and security division fell 19 percent. Northrop shares ended 4 percent higher at $105.56 as the maker of Global Hawk unmanned planes posted an 18 percent increase in earnings per share despite a slight drop in sales, and raised its forecast for full-year sales. Raytheon, which is expected to report results on Thursday, closed 3 percent higher at $78.49. The U.S. Navy on Wednesday ordered Raytheon to halt work on a new radar program worth up to $1.6 billion after Lockheed filed a protest against the contract award.

140,GD,"UPDATE 2-General Dynamics boosts profit, raises full-year forecast","* Q3 EPS up 8.2 percent, tops estimates * Operating margins rise 90 basis points to 12.3 percent * Forecast still modest on continued budget uncertainty By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp, the maker of Gulfstream business jets and U.S. Navy warships, reported higher earnings and operating margins for the third quarter despite a dip in revenue, and nudged its full-year earnings forecast higher. Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic said the better-than-expected results allowed General Dynamics to increase its guidance for full-year earnings per share by five cents to between $6.90 and $7.00. It earned $6.48 per share in 2012. But during an earnings conference call on Wednesday Novakovic told analysts that General Dynamics was keeping its forecast moderate given continued uncertainty in the U.S. budget environment and the resulting slowdown in orders. Concerns about a drop in orders in its combat systems business pushed the company’s shares lower. The CEO also said a similar slowdown could reoccur in January if U.S. lawmakers are unable to reach a broad budget deal. “It’s entirely possible that we find ourselves in an extended period of time trapped in Dante’s first circle of hell,” Novakovic said. The company said quarterly net earnings rose 8.5 percent to $651 million from $600 million a year earlier, while revenues fell 1.7 percent to $7.93 billion. Earnings per share rose 8.2 percent to $1.84 from $1.70. Revenues were largely in line with Wall Street estimates, but earnings beat expectations from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, who had forecast EPS of $1.68. Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets said General Dynamics’ defense revenues were down, but not as much as expected, and its aerospace division was producing solid growth. General Dynamics said company-wide operating margins rose 90 basis points to 12.3 percent on improved performances in the aerospace, combat systems and information systems divisions. Margins in the marine systems division remained steady as it completed the T-AKE line of dry cargo and ammunitions ships that it built for the U.S. Navy. Shares of most major weapons makers rose on Wednesday, but General Dynamics shares closed 2.2 percent lower at $86.23, amid concerns about its combat systems business, which saw quarterly revenues drop 30 percent. Joe Nadol at JP Morgan said the combat systems results looked “even tougher than feared” and a 190-basis point margin beat in the segment was not enough to fully offset the top-line disappointment. He said the record-high margin of 16.4 percent in the sector looked unsustainable. Novakovic said the combat division’s revenues fell because  U.S. Army orders had slowed more than expected amid uncertainty about future budget levels and the end of U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

142,GD,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-AIRSHOW-Lockheed sees more clarity on Saudi naval buy in next months,"(Corrects name, maker of radar in 16th paragraph) By Andrea Shalal-Esa DUBAI, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp  expects news about a multibillion dollar programme to modernise the Saudi Arabian Navy in the next several months, senior company executives told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow on Wednesday after meetings with Saudi officials. “We’re hopeful in the next several months that some clarity will present itself on how they want to go forward on what hull, what design, and what mission equipment,” said Patrick Dewar, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin International. Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson discussed the naval modernization programme and other issues during the air show with Prince Salman bin Sultan, the Saudi deputy defence minister, who was appointed in August, Dewar said. “We understand the new Saudi deputy defence minister is doing his own assessment on how they should go forward,” Dewar said. “We’ve had good meetings with them here at the show as well as in the (Saudi) kingdom over the last couple of months.” U.S. executives and government delegates said they had not seen any signs of a chill in U.S. ties to Saudi military officials after Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan last month said the kingdom was hoping to make a major shift away from the United States. Saudi Arabia is continuing to evaluate a range of options for the naval modernisation programme, including purchases of up to 12 of Lockheed’s steel monohull Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) or the larger DDG-51 destroyer built by General Dynamics Corp , executives said. General Dynamics had no immediate comment. The number of ships would depend on whether Saudi Arabia opted for the smaller or larger of the hull forms, they said. The Saudi Naval Expansion Program II, or SNEP programme, has been under discussion for years, but U.S. industry and government officials say the effort has picked up some fresh momentum in recent months. Earlier estimates had put the value of the programme at around $20 billion. Dewar said proposals submitted to Saudi officials by the U.S. government also included Lockheed’s Aegis combat system, an MH-60R helicopter it builds with Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and a fast missile craft it designed with VT Halter Marine, a unit of ST Engineering. He said no decisions had been made on the programme. Paul Lemmo, Lockheed senior vice president for corporate strategy and business development, told Reuters in a separate interview at the air show that the LCS ship was one of the options still being evaluated by Saudi Arabia. The USS Freedom, the first LCS ship built by Lockheed, this week picked up supplies in Brunei and joined the relief effort in the Philippines after completing a deployment in Singapore. The U.S. Navy had planned to buy 52 of the faster, more agile warships, but may scale back that order due to mounting budget pressures, which makes any possible foreign orders that much more important for Lockheed. Australia’s Austal builds a different aluminium-hulled trimaran version of the LCS ship, but the Saudi government is not looking at possible purchases of that model at this time, U.S. officials said. The U.S. LCS ships were designed to carry interchangeable mission packages or “modules” for the Navy, but Lemmo said Saudi Arabia and other potential foreign buyers all wanted permanent weapons capabilities built into the ship. He said Lockheed had proposed outfitting the ship with a lighter version of the Aegis combat system that would carry vertical missile launchers and the Aegis SPY-1F radar that Norway installed on five frigates for Norway. That is a smaller radar with less range than the Lockheed SPY-1D radar that is installed on the DDG-51 destroyers built by General Dynamics. Lemmo said Saudi was still evaluating if it needed larger ships that could carry the large missile defence system, or a larger number of smaller, multi-mission ships. He said the smaller LCS ships could be outfitted with vertical launch systems that could fire smaller missiles, including the SM-2 missiles. No comment was immediately available from the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees major foreign arms sales.

143,GD,UPDATE 2-BAE picks former General Dynamics exec to head U.S. unit,"LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Britain’s BAE Systems Plc chose Jerry DeMuro to head its U.S. business, pinning its hopes on the former General Dynamics  executive to steer the weapons maker through U.S. military cuts that are expected to bite over the next decade. DeMuro, who will begin as president and chief executive of the U.S. unit on Feb. 1, will replace Linda Hudson, who announced her retirement in August last year. BAE, which announced the appointment on Tuesday, generates about 40 percent of its total revenue in the United States. Defense suppliers to the U.S. government face a challenging time over the next decade, given $487 billion in planned cuts to the U.S. military budget and additional sizeable reductions mandated by Congress. DeMuro, age 58, follows Hudson, 63, to BAE from U.S. weapons manufacturer General Dynamics. He was previously executive vice president and corporate vice president at General Dynamics’s $11 billion information systems and technology group. DeMuro left General Dynamics in February 2013 after being passed over for company’s top position, a job now held by Phebe Novakovic. “His experience will be of immense benefit as the company strives to maintain its strong performance in the United States core defense market and increase its focus on new international and commercial opportunities,” BAE Chief Executive Ian King said. At General Dynamics, DeMuro managed the acquisition and integration of 22 companies, as well as 8 divestitures, with a cumulative value of $5 billion, according to a fact sheet compiled by BAE. In its global business, BAE faced investor worries over its growth prospects last year after the United Arab Emirates pulled out of talks to buy 60 Eurofighter Typhoon combat jets in a $9.8 billion deal. Hudson, the first woman to head a major U.S. defense operation, said she worked closely with DeMuro at General Dynamics for many years and called him “an experienced and compassionate leader.” “Jerry is an excellent choice to take the helm of this company that - thanks to your collective efforts over the past several years - has established itself as a major player in aerospace and national security,” Hudson said in a blog posting for employees. Hudson, who joined BAE in 2007, said she would remain on the board of the U.S. unit as an outside director until April 2015. “After many decades in this industry I have been through good times and bad, seen spending go up and down, but the very best people and companies adapt, endure and continue to move forward to meet the needs of our customers,” she said. Shares of BAE ended down 1.2 percent in trading Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.

146,GD,General Dynamics shares rise on buyback pledge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) shares rose more than 5 percent on Wednesday after the maker of Gulfstream business jets and Navy ships posted higher-than-expected quarterly results, and pledged to buy back 11.4 million shares in the first quarter. Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic, marking her first year on the job, forecast lower earnings and revenues in 2014 but said there was more upside than downside on revenues and that the company would likely adjust its earnings guidance upward in the second quarter after the share repurchase. The news sent the company’s shares as high as $100.55 on the New York Stock Exchange, although they slipped to trade at $98.90 by early afternoon, up 3.8 percent from Tuesday. “Phebe Novakovic likes to underpromise and overdeliver,” said Christian Mayes, an analyst with Edward Jones Equity Research, who has a buy rating on the stock. “With the company targeting to return nearly all free cash flow to shareholders in 2014 through dividends and buybacks, investors are happy.” The Falls Church, Virginia-based company reported earnings of $624 million, or $1.76 per share, from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2013, on revenue of $8.1 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected earnings from continuing operations of $615 million, or $1.75 per share, on revenue of $7.99 billion. For the full year, General Dynamics posted earnings from continuing operations of $2.5 billion, or $7.03 per share, while sales edged lower from a year earlier to $31.2 billion. Fourth quarter net profit was $495 million, or $1.40 per share, including a $129 million loss in discontinued operations related to the pending settlement of a long-standing dispute over the A-12 stealth plane, which was canceled in 1991. The company had reported a $2.1 billion loss and lower-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012. At the time, Novakovic vowed to improve operating margins and develop more realistic operating plans. The company’s fourth quarter report showed strong improvements in operating margins in all four of the company’s sectors: aerospace, combat systems, marine systems and information systems and technology. Its quarterly operating margin was 11.4 percent versus a negative margin of 23.5 percent a year earlier. Operating margins rose to 11.8 percent in 2013 from 2.6 percent in 2012. Novakovic told analysts on an earnings call that the company remained focused on improving operating margins in 2014 and expected international sales to account for 30 percent of revenue, up from 25 percent in 2013. She said the combat systems business expected to land a $1.2 billion foreign order in the first quarter that had initially been expected last quarter. If the deal slipped again, revenues in that division could erode further, she said, adding that she was confident that it would be booked soon. She said Gulfstream business jets remained the primary growth engine for earnings and revenue across the company, but other business areas were producing steady revenues and profit. “Only two of our 11 businesses are in a significant down cycle,” Novakovic said, citing the company’s land systems and information systems business with the U.S. Army, which has been hard hit by U.S. military spending reductions. She said the company was reducing its exposure to Army orders and the other units were “earnings and cash powerhouses.” “We’re getting close to the bottom,” Novakovic said, adding that a two-year budget deal reached by Congress had given the company a greater sense of stability in funding. General Dynamics said its backlog totaled $46 billion at the end of the year, boosted by significant orders for Gulfstream jets, additional double V-hulled Stryker combat vehicles and early work on new Navy submarines.

Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic, marking her first year on the job, forecast lower earnings and revenues in 2014 but said there was more upside than downside on revenues and that the company would likely adjust its earnings guidance upward in the second quarter after the share repurchase. The news sent the company’s shares as high as $100.55 on the New York Stock Exchange, although they slipped to trade at $98.90 by early afternoon, up 3.8 percent from Tuesday. “Phebe Novakovic likes to underpromise and overdeliver,” said Christian Mayes, an analyst with Edward Jones Equity Research, who has a buy rating on the stock. “With the company targeting to return nearly all free cash flow to shareholders in 2014 through dividends and buybacks, investors are happy.” The Falls Church, Virginia-based company reported earnings of $624 million, or $1.76 per share, from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2013, on revenue of $8.1 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected earnings from continuing operations of $615 million, or $1.75 per share, on revenue of $7.99 billion. For the full year, General Dynamics posted earnings from continuing operations of $2.5 billion, or $7.03 per share, while sales edged lower from a year earlier to $31.2 billion. Fourth quarter net profit was $495 million, or $1.40 per share, including a $129 million loss in discontinued operations related to the pending settlement of a long-standing dispute over the A-12 stealth plane, which was canceled in 1991. The company had reported a $2.1 billion loss and lower-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012. At the time, Novakovic vowed to improve operating margins and develop more realistic operating plans. The company’s fourth quarter report showed strong improvements in operating margins in all four of the company’s sectors: aerospace, combat systems, marine systems and information systems and technology. Its quarterly operating margin was 11.4 percent versus a negative margin of 23.5 percent a year earlier. Operating margins rose to 11.8 percent in 2013 from 2.6 percent in 2012. Novakovic told analysts on an earnings call that the company remained focused on improving operating margins in 2014 and expected international sales to account for 30 percent of revenue, up from 25 percent in 2013. She said the combat systems business expected to land a $1.2 billion foreign order in the first quarter that had initially been expected last quarter. If the deal slipped again, revenues in that division could erode further, she said, adding that she was confident that it would be booked soon. She said Gulfstream business jets remained the primary growth engine for earnings and revenue across the company, but other business areas were producing steady revenues and profit. “Only two of our 11 businesses are in a significant down cycle,” Novakovic said, citing the company’s land systems and information systems business with the U.S. Army, which has been hard hit by U.S. military spending reductions. She said the company was reducing its exposure to Army orders and the other units were “earnings and cash powerhouses.” “We’re getting close to the bottom,” Novakovic said, adding that a two-year budget deal reached by Congress had given the company a greater sense of stability in funding. General Dynamics said its backlog totaled $46 billion at the end of the year, boosted by significant orders for Gulfstream jets, additional double V-hulled Stryker combat vehicles and early work on new Navy submarines. The backlog totaled $51.3 billion at the end of 2012.",1222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/generaldynamics-results/update-2-general-dynamics-shares-rise-on-buyback-pledge-idUSL2N0KW0L520140122
148,GD,"General Dynamics sees lower revenues, earnings in 2014","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic forecast a slight drop in earnings per share and revenue for 2014 on Wednesday, but said the company would aggressively return cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Novakovic forecast an 11 percent increase in aerospace revenue, but said sales would likely decline in combat systems and the information systems businesses. Overall, she forecast revenue of $30 billion in 2014, down from $31.2 billion in 2013. Earnings per share would be around $6.80-6.85, down slightly from $7.03 per share in 2013, and the company would likely adjust its guidance after share buybacks in the first quarter, she said. Novakovic said the company planned to repurchase 11.4 million shares in the first quarter after taking a pause due to pension rules in the fourth quarter of 2013. She said General Dynamics would seek authority for more repurchases at its February board meeting.

The agreement resolves the last of series of legal cases spawned in 1991 when then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney canceled the A-12 Avenger II program after it ran into major schedule delays and cost overruns in the 1980s. At the time, the government demanded the companies pay back $1.3 billion they had already received for work on the next-generation, carrier-based tactical airplane. The Justice Department announced the agreement, which was authorized as part of the 2014 defense authorization bill, noting that the U.S. government would not pay any money in connection with the companies’ claims. The companies had sued the U.S. government in federal claims court to retain the money they had received, plus more than $1 billion in additional amounts, plus interest. They argued that the government had wrongfully terminated the contract. “It’s long been time to move on,” said Virginia-based defense consultant Loren Thompson, noting that the dispute centered on the way that Cheney chose to terminate the program, not the actual cancellation. “What this illustrates is how one careless decision by a senior government official can cost taxpayers a huge amount of money.” The case dragged on for over two decades, spanning five trials and three appeals, including one to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 2011 threw out a ruling that could have forced the companies to repay $3 billion in contract fees and interest. It said the decision would make neither side happy. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus welcomed the agreement, under which the Navy will receive three EA-18G electronic attack aircraft from Boeing, and a $200 million credit from General Dynamics toward its work on a new DDG-1000 destroyer. “We are closing a 23-year-long chapter in the annals of naval aviation and further strengthening, through the contractors’ in-kind payment, the Navy’s capabilities and capacities,” Mabus said. “The litigation was protracted and difficult, but it saved the Navy billions of dollars.” The case was one of the longest-running disputes over military procurement in history.

158,GD,A-12 settlement won't extend Boeing's F/A-18 production line,"NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The settlement of a dispute over the cancelled A-12 aircraft calls for Boeing Co to build three more EA-18G electronic attack planes for the U.S. Navy, but those jets won’t extend the F/A-18 production line in St. Louis, according to Navy officials and company executives. The U.S. Justice Department announced a $400 million settlement agreement with Boeing and General Dynamics Corp  last week that includes the additional jets, which will be paid for by Boeing. U.S. Navy officials this week said the planes would be built along with 21 Growlers already being funded in fiscal year 2014 and delivered in calendar year 2016. Boeing officials said the additional jets would not extend production of the F/A-18 line beyond the currently planned date of the end of 2016. The company is awaiting details of the Pentagon’s budget plan to fiscal 2015 to see if any additional orders for F/A-18s or EA-18Gs will be included, although Pentagon officials have repeatedly said they do not plan additional orders. Loren Thompson, analyst with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said he expected Boeing to launch a massive lobbying campaign to get more F/A-18s, also called Super Hornets, or their electronic attack cousins, added to the 2015 budget. “Boeing is determined to get more Super Hornets into the defense budget because if that doesn’t happen they will soon have no fighter production line in the whole company,” Thompson said. He said the company faced an uphill climb given continued pressure on military spending. “In a budget environment where defense spending is capped, any money spent on a new initiative has to come out of some other program, which makes this an Olympic-scale selling job on Capitol Hill,” Thompson said. Boeing says it needs to build about two F/A-18s a month to ensure economical production rates, which would require a foreign order, or a new U.S. order valued at just under $2 billion. Canada, which helped fund development of Lockheed Martin Corp’s F-35 fighter, is expected to make decisions in coming months about whether to proceed with F-35 orders or launch a new tender that could result in orders for the F/A-18 or other fighter planes. Boeing’s F-15 fighter line, also in St. Louis, is slated to continue through 2018, buoyed by a large Saudi Arabian order.",1282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-fighter/a-12-settlement-wont-extend-boeings-f-a-18-production-line-idUSL2N0L214H20140128

160,GD,General Dynamics Canada wins Saudi deal worth up to $13 billion,"OTTAWA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) has won a contract worth up to $13 billion for its Canadian division to build light-armored vehicles for Saudi Arabia, in what Ottawa said was the largest advanced manufacturing export win in Canadian history. General Dynamics said on Friday the 14-year contract for military and commercial vehicles and training and support services has a value of $10 billion, but could be worth about $13 billion if all options were exercised. The company did not identify the customer, but Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast issued a statement saying the vehicles would be sold to Saudi Arabia and would create and sustain 3,000 jobs each year in Canada. Fast led trade missions to the Saudi kingdom in 2012 and 2013. The deal is facilitated by Canada’s international government-to-government contracting organization, the Canadian Commercial Corp. “The whole-of-government approach to export sales gives us a strategic advantage as we pursue international markets,” Danny Deep, vice president at General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada, said in a statement. The Saudi order provides a huge shot in the arm for General Dynamics, whose combat systems business has seen declining revenues in recent years given the end of the war in Iraq and the U.S. reduction of troops in Afghanistan. “That’s a biggie,” said Byron Callan, analyst with Capital Alpha Securities. “The Saudi order for light-armored vehicles is a clear positive for General Dynamics. It is confirmation not only of the 2014 guidance, but of a more stable combat systems outlook in 2015 and beyond.” General Dynamics continues to bid for other international orders, including one from Morocco, he said. General Dynamics’s chief executive, Phebe Novakovic, flagged the deal — without identifying the buyer — during the company’s earnings call last month and said she was confident that the contract would materialize in the first quarter after protracted negotiations. At the time, she said a delay in the contract and a slowdown in spending by the U.S. Army had contributed to a $1.4 billion shortfall in revenues for General Dynamics’s combat systems sector in 2013.

163,GD,Ex-Spirit Aero staff claim their high health costs led to layoffs,"NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Former employees of Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc, a major supplier to plane makers Boeing and Airbus, filed charges with federal agencies on Wednesday alleging that Spirit illegally used health care information to target those who were costing the company most for layoffs. Ten former employees claim they were selected when the company cut 360 positions last summer because they or covered family members had costly disabilities or medical conditions. Spirit’s health care administrators shared information with high-level managers “so that Spirit - in its role as employer - could identify the employees associated with the most expensive medical claims and target them for termination,” according to one of the charges filed on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters. The charges, filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Civil Rights, request class status and also allege age discrimination, disability discrimination and violations of privacy rights, said Diane King, a lawyer with King and Greisen, a Denver law firm that assisted the employees. Ken Evans, a spokesman for Spirit, said the allegations “are filled with distortions and misstatements. Personal health information is certainly not used to make layoff decisions.” All of the charges relate to the July 2013 layoffs, when Spirit cut the positions at its facilities in Wichita, Kansas, including 221 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), a Seattle-based union that also represents workers at Boeing. Evans said SPEEA had made unfounded allegations before, including several charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board last year related to the job cuts that were either withdrawn or dismissed by the board. “While terminations are always difficult, all such decisions are based on job-related, non-discriminatory criteria, and Spirit has made every effort to carry them out with respect for our employees,” Evans said in a statement. The job cuts were necessary in a competitive, cost-sensitive industry, Evans said, and Spirit provided the laid-off employees with severance and help finding new jobs. King said circumstantial evidence supports the employees belief that top Spirit managers misused individual employees’ health care information, but she declined to provide details. She did not immediately provide any statistical analysis showing that a higher proportion of those with expensive medical costs were among those laid off. Spirit has been under pressure to cut costs and since 2012 has set aside more than $2.2 billion in provisions for future losses on unprofitable contracts. The company was formed in 2005 when Boeing Co spun off some of its facilities. It makes parts for all major Boeing jets, including about 40 fuselages a month for Boeing’s top-selling 737 jetliner. Spirit also makes parts for Airbus, Bombardier Inc , Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp  and Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota Motor Corp. The losses at Spirit prompted it to undertake a strategic review last year and consider sale of facilities in Oklahoma. If the employee charges are substantiated, penalties could include back pay, out-of-pocket health care costs, job reinstatement or forward pay through retirement in lieu of employment, plus attorneys fees, according to lawyers with knowledge of these kinds of claims. The case raises questions about possible misuse of health information gathered by companies through self insurance or wellness programs. In interviews, two former Spirit employees said they were singled out by upper management and that their own supervisors didn’t know their performance ratings were being cut until just before it happened. “They tried to make it look like it was performance issues,” said Debra, 54, a former quality analyst, whose husband is in need of two organ transplants. She and other employees and family members who spoke with Reuters declined to have their full names used out of concern for the privacy of their medical and employment information. She said she received a “B” retention rating on Spirit’s A-C rating scale during a previous review. On July 1, her rating was lowered to a “C,” and she was told she was not eligible for recall rights if she was laid off. Her direct supervisor wanted to give her an “A,” she said.

164,GD,U.S. Navy looks to leverage submarine work to keep costs down,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy hopes to save money and time by leveraging industry investments as it replaces its Ohio-class nuclear-armed submarines with the Virginia-class attack submarines now built by General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. Navy chief weapons buyer Sean Stackley told the Senate Armed Services Committee’s seapower subcommittee on Thursday that Navy officials were studying ways to drive down the cost of the new submarine, including a combined purchase that would include another batch of Virginia-class submarines. The first Ohio-class ship will be funded in fiscal 2021, with advanced procurement to begin in 2019. The congressional Government Accountability Office estimated last month that it would cost $95 billion to develop and build a dozen new submarines to replace the current fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines as they begin to retire in 2027. The Navy views the Ohio-class replacement as its biggest priority, but is asking Congress to help find funding from elsewhere in the Pentagon budget, given that the program will eat up the lion’s share of the Navy’s annual shipbuilding budget from 2021 on. Stackley said the Navy was also exploring other ways to drive down the cost of the huge new program and ensure that U.S. companies were ready to take on the increased work. “What we want to do is leverage the volume between the two programs going through the industrial base ... so that we get the affordability we need and hold onto the quality and the schedule performance that we currently enjoy on the Virginia-class program,” Stackley told reporters after a hearing about the Navy’s shipbuilding budget. Stackley said the acquisition strategy for the new submarines was still being worked out, including how the work would be divided between General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls at a time when they will also be building more Virginia-class submarines. He said there was no talk about shifting to just one producer, given the importance of the submarine industrial base. “Nothing has been decided,” Stackley said. General Dynamics is the prime contractor working on the design of the warships, while Huntington Ingalls is a subcontractor, but that could change when the Navy moves into procurement, Stackley said. Stackley said the need to invest in facilities, tooling and other equipment for construction of the new submarines would help determine a schedule for the Navy’s acquisition strategy since the Navy wanted to avoid having the companies duplicate investments. “We’ll be engaging with industry at the right time,” he said. “We’re going to build the strategy that best fits the cost, quality and schedule for (building) the Ohio replacement ... and the Virginia-class side-by-side” he said.

The aircraft order, signed in the fourth quarter, represents firm sales and an option for additional jets, Gulfstream said in a statement without disclosing financial terms. The sale includes a range of aircraft, from the mid-size G280 jet to the ultra-large cabin G650. Savannah, Georgia-based Gulfstream is competing against Brazil’s Embraer SA, Cessna Aircraft Co, and Bombardier Inc to gain a foothold for business jets in the fast-growing China market, which each company sees as a crucial region for future growth.

169,GD,"U.S. Navy delays submarine commissioning, says more work needed","WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Wednesday said it would delay the commissioning of the North Dakota, a new Virginia-class submarine that was due to enter active service on May 31, to carry out more design work and resolve quality problems with certain components. The submarine, built jointly by General Dynamics Corp  and Huntington Ingalls Industries, is returning to drydock for the additional work, according to the submarine’s Facebook site. It said no new commissioning date had been set. Colleen O’Rourke, spokeswoman for Naval Sea Systems Command, said the Navy decided to delay the commissioning because the ship needed additional design and certification work on its redesigned bow, and because of “material issues” with certain vendor-assembled and delivered components. “The Navy is committed to ensuring the safety of its crews and ships. High quality standards for submarine components are an important part of the overall effort to ensure safety,” O’Rourke said. She did not provide details on the faulty parts. It was not immediately clear who would pay for the additional work, or how soon the ship would be commissioned. O’Rourke said the lessons learned from work on the North Dakota were already being applied to the other follow-on ships in the next batch of submarines being built. Bob Hamilton, spokesman for Electric Boat, the General Dynamics unit that serves as the prime contractor for the submarines, said his company still expected to deliver the ship by the original deadline of Aug. 31. Sources familiar with the submarine program said the Navy was taking a second look at 63 different components, including some used in the ship’s stern, rudder and hydraulic systems. Typically in weapons manufacturing, if quality problems are found with one component, all other components made by the same supplier are also reviewed carefully. The Congressional Research Service estimates that each Virginia-class submarine costs about $2.7 billion to build. The first of the new class of submarines entered service in 2004. The North Dakota is the first of eight ships in Block III of the Virginia-class submarines, a new design that is about 40 percent different from the previous submarines. That means the ship is essentially the first in a new class, and the first ship often has problems associated with a new design.

170,GD,WRAPUP 2-Strong U.S. defense firm profits defy regular gloomy warnings,"(Adds comments from Northrop, General Dynamics CEOs, updates shares) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, April 23 (Reuters) - U.S. arms makers complain regularly that lower Pentagon spending on ships, jets and other hardware will hit their earnings, but a string of better-than-expected results this week show that layoffs and cost-cutting have kept profits flowing, and growing. Defense majors Lockheed Martin Corp, General Dynamics Corp, and Northrop Grumman Corp have all reported higher profits this week and raised their full-year forecasts. In response, the Dow Jones index that tracks the 10 biggest aerospace and defense companies rose 2.2 percent on Wednesday. Weapons makers turned to workforce cuts and other efficiency efforts as early as 2007 to shore up their profits, and have also concentrated on stock buybacks and strong dividends, said defense consultant Loren Thompson. “The gradual decline in military spending has given the companies fewer opportunities to invest in new programs, so they  are returning their cash flow to shareholders,” said Thompson, who runs the Virginia-based Lexington Institute. He said the crisis in Ukraine and other emerging threats could strengthen demand for military equipment in the United States and overseas, and help stave off an expected decline in defense shares as spending cuts further erode revenues. Company executives say the budget environment remains tough,  since mandatory federal cuts are due to resume in 2016. Still, work on big-ticket items like ships, planes and satellites would shore up revenues since those orders are either already on the books or part of multi-year agreements being negotiated now. Lockheed shares were up 3.3 percent at $161.94 after Australia announced plans to buy 58 more of the company’s F-35 fighter jets in coming years. Lockheed, the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier, had on Tuesday reported a 23 percent jump in first-quarter net profit and raised its 2014 earnings-per-share outlook by 2.5 percent. Lockheed, General Dynamics and Northrop all reported higher operating margins in the latest quarter, and said they would continue efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Northrop, which makes unmanned planes, the B-2 bomber and electronic equipment, on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook by about 2 percent, to a range of $8.90 to $9.15 per share.  Northrop shares rose 1.8 percent to $121.96. CEO Wes Bush attributed the rise in Northrop’s EPS in part to share repurchases; the company had about 9 percent fewer shares outstanding during the latest quarter. “While the U.S. budget environment continues to be challenging, particularly for our short-cycle businesses, we have a good long-term set of opportunities that includes ... potential for continued growth in international sales,” Bush told analysts on an earnings call. He said the sale of Global Hawk unmanned planes now being negotiated with South Korea could lead to additional foreign sales of unmanned systems for the company. General Dynamics, which makes Gulfstream business jets, tanks and U.S. warships, raised its guidance for 2014 earnings per share by nearly 4 percent after posting higher-than-expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter. Its shares were up 3.6 percent at $111.90 in late trading. Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic told analysts that U.S. weapons spending had “troughed,” or hit a low point, and that a big rise in backlog showed the company is well-positioned. She said the firm planned to return “most, if not all” of its free cash flow to investors via stock repurchases or dividends. Novakovic described “blocking and tackling” to lower costs. “I don’t think you can ever get away from the absolute requirement to improve your operating performance quarter over quarter,” she said. “You are never done.” General Dynamics’ combat systems division, which posted a quarterly operating loss, would show improved sales, earnings and margins over the course of the year, Novakovic said. The marine division also has “considerable upside” given that it expects to get a multi-year contract for more Virginia-class attack submarines from the U.S. Navy, and is working on a new submarine to replace the current Ohio-class submarines that carry nuclear weapons, she said.

179,GD,UPDATE 1-U.S. GAO affirms Army decision to skip vehicle prototype,"(Adds BAE comment) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - The Government Accountability Office on Friday told lawmakers the U.S. Army made a “sound” decision when it decided to skip prototypes in a $6 billion competition for a new combat vehicle that was unsuccessfully challenged by General Dynamics Corp. The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the Army had taken other actions to reduce cost and risk on the new vehicle program, including reducing requirements and opting to modify an existing vehicle. General Dynamics says the terms of the competition favor the tracked Bradley Fighting Vehicle made by Britain’s BAE Systems Plc over its wheeled Stryker vehicle, but the Army earlier this month rejected a protest filed by General Dynamics. The GAO agency is required by law to review any Pentagon decision to waive a 2009 federal law that is aimed at saving money and time by requiring competitive prototypes before work starts on any new major weapons programs. In this case, GAO said, the Army had concluded that it would cost between $198 million to $341 million to build up to six vehicle prototypes and would add 19 to 31 months to the program’s schedule while generating no benefits. The Pentagon notified Congress last November that it had waived the prototyping requirement for the Army’s Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program due to “excessive cost,” triggering a mandatory review by GAO. GAO said that in justifying the lack of prototypes, the Army and Pentagon cited market research that found the requirements for the new vehicle could be met by modifying existing combat vehicles with mission packages that had already been fielded and prototyped. The agency said it reviewed the Army’s cost-benefit analysis and found it be consistent with Pentagon guidelines. It said the Army could have more fully evaluated the potential benefits of reducing development risks through prototyping but that its decision to skip prototypes for the new vehicle appeared sound. General Dynamics spokesman Pete Keating  said the GAO report provided further evidence that the Army wanted to use the BAE vehicle and was not open to other entrants. “This is clear evidence that the competition and requirements are structured in such a way that ... we could not compete,” Keating said. He said the Army had also rebuffed General Dynamics’ efforts to obtain data on the Bradley vehicles so it could produce its own modified version. Several lawmakers who back General Dynamics have said they hope to draft legislation that would require the Army to buy a mixed fleet of modified Bradley and Stryker vehicles for the new armored combat vehicle program. Brian Roehrkasse, spokesman for BAE Systems, said the GAO report was consistent with the Army’s statements that it plans to select a single vendor for development of the new vehicle. “Clearly the Army expects the offerings to compete on their substantiated performance and values the importance of a low risk, cost effective solution that meets the Army’s critical survivability requirements,” he said.

184,GD,"UPDATE 1-General Dynamics, Huntington win huge U.S. Navy contract","(Adds details and background) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Monday awarded a $17.6 billion contract for 10 more Virginia-class, nuclear-powered attack submarines to General Dynamics Corp  and its major subcontractor, Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc, the largest ever Navy shipbuilding contract. The contract, which funds work on two Virginia-class submarines per year from fiscal year 2014 through 2018, will net savings of over $2 billion, effectively giving the Navy 10 ships for the price of nine, said Navy Captain David Goggins, program manager for the Virginia-class submarines. Rear Admiral David Johnson, the Navy’s program executive officer for submarines, said the new contract would result in additional reductions in procurement costs and will also lower operating costs. “The Block IV award is the largest shipbuilding contract in U.S. Navy history in terms of total dollar value and builds upon the Virginia-class program’s successful Navy and industry relationship,” he said in a statement. Johnson said the contract would reduce the number of major maintenance visits for the submarines to three from four, which meant that each of the new subs would be able to carry out 15 full-length deployments instead of 14. “With the decrease in cost and the increase in capability, we are essentially getting more for less,” he said. The Navy spent 20 months negotiating the contract with General Dynamics’ Connecticut-based Electric Boat unit and Huntington Ingalls’ Virginia-based Newport News Shipbuilding, the biggest subcontractor on the program. The contract was formally awarded to General Dynamics, but continues the teaming agreement between the two companies. The Navy is already operating 10 Virginia-class submarines, with eight more submarines from a third block under contract. The Navy this month delayed the commissioning of the first of the Block III Virginia-class submarines to carry out more design work and resolve quality issues. The Navy’s Virginia-class submarines are equipped to fight submarines and surface ships, strike targets on land, support special operations, and engage in surveillance. General Dynamics closed at $107.39 and Huntington Ingalls closed at $99.08 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, both down about 1.5 percent.

186,GD,U.S. Navy names best-performing arms suppliers for 2014,"* Top weapons buyer says “No silver bullet” * U.S. Navy names General Dynamics, Lockheed units “superior suppliers” * Shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls fails to make U.S. Navy list By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Friday named units of top arms makers General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co as part of its list of the top-performing nine suppliers for 2014 based on their performance over the last three years. The Pentagon said on Friday it would use such public recognition of “superior suppliers,” incentives and competition as key tools in its ongoing drive to end years of cost overruns and schedule delays on key weapons programs. Top U.S. arms buyer Frank Kendall said the Navy developed the list as a pilot project this year, but he had asked the Air Force and Army to compile their own lists this year as part of the continuing effort to improve defense acquisition. “We want to recognize their performance, but we also want to motivate our performers who are not on that list to do better,” Kendall told reporters as he released a second annual report on the Pentagon’s procurement, development and operating budgets, which totalled over $350 billion in fiscal 2015 budget request. The nine companies also included units of General Electric , Northrop Grumman Corp, a venture of Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and Britain’s Rolls Royce Holdings Plc. One notable exception was Huntington Ingalls Industries , one of the Navy’s largest suppliers, and builder of aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships. Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley said the suppliers that did make the list would be offered the chance to reduce certain contract requirements, including removal of some procedures, inspections or requirements, which could lead to cost savings. Kendall said the Pentagon had imposed affordability targets on 30 of its biggest programs and all but two or three were within those caps. But he said uncertainty about future budget levels continued to hamper more efficient investment decisions. He said the Pentagon remained focused on improving the way it buys hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and services each year, but there was no single “silver bullet” to do that. Instead, he said the department needed to work on multiple fronts, including efforts to simplify the overlapping laws that govern defense acquisitions, better training for federal workers that administer contracts, and deeper analysis of past programs. “Defense acquisition is complicated and varying,” he wrote in the 116-page report. “We must empower, encourage and train our workforce to think - not dictate a cookbook that workforce members blindly follow.” The report cited good results from contracts with incentive fees, but said incentives were sometimes counterproductive and the Pentagon did not always use such measures as well as it could. Kendall also highlighted the importance of competition, but  said the department needed to get more creative about injecting competition into the process given declining defense budgets and growing consolidation in the industry.

187,GD,U.S. defense firms raise profit forecast in tight spending backdrop,"(Reuters) - U.S. weapons makers General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) raised their 2014 profit forecasts as cost cutting allowed them to improve profitability even as defense spending by the U.S. government remained low. The companies, which reported better-than-expected second-quarter profits on Wednesday, have kept a tight lid on operational costs to overcome the effect of U.S. budget cuts. They have also held their stock prices up by returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and strong dividends. General Dynamics, maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, said on Wednesday it expected to repurchase shares in the second half of 2014. The company has spent about $2.7 billion on share buybacks so far this year. “Such results will continue to build (General Dynamics’) investors’ confidence in the CEO’s focus on profitability and cash deployment,” RBC Capital Markets’ Robert Stallard wrote in a note.  The company raised its forecast for full-year earnings to $7.40-$7.45 per share from $7.05-$7.10. General Dynamics said its total potential contract value, the sum of all backlog, rose 29 percent to $99.5 billion in the second quarter ended June 29 - its highest in the past four years. “Overall defense spending is still sluggish given U.S. budget concerns, but General Dynamics’ defense units are looking like they’ll do better this year than was initially expected,” Christian Mayes, an analyst at Edward Jones Equity Research, told Reuters. General Dynamics reported an increase in orders in its marine systems division - which sells to the U.S Navy - suggesting that the government spending on defense may be stabilizing. However, smaller rival Northrop was not as optimistic. “While we are encouraged by the tone of fiscal year 2015 budget negotiations, we remain cautious regarding the longer term,” Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush said on a conference call with analysts. The company, which makes unmanned aircraft, the B-2 bomber and electronic equipment, raised its 2014 earnings forecast to $9.15-$9.35 per share from $8.90-$9.15.  Northrop said its profit was boosted by a lower pension liability - the result of higher interest rates that changed the discount rate used to calculate the company’s pension liabilities. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the Pentagon’s largest defense supplier, also reported a better-than-expected 3.5 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday and said it planned to resume share repurchases in the current quarter.

194,GD,"Gulfstream launches two new jets, signs deals with Flexjet, Qatar Airways","(Reuters) - Gulfstream Aerospace Corp, a unit of General Dynamics Corp (GD.N), said it had launched two new business jets, the G500 and G600, and signed agreements for orders of up to 70 aircraft from Flexjet LLC and Qatar Airways. Dallas-based Flexjet LLC, a provider of fractional jet ownership and leasing services, will order up to 50 aircraft, including the 16-seater G450, the wide-cabin G500 and the flagship G650, Gulfstream said.  Qatar Airways, the state-owned flag carrier of Qatar, will order up to 20 Gulfstream aircraft, including the newly launched G500 and the G650ER.  Gulfstream said the new G500 and G600 aircraft would be made at its plants in Savannah, Georgia. The company said it would also produce the wings and vertical and horizontal stabilizers for both aircraft. Gulfstream’s move to swap out a couple of major suppliers and manufacture wings at its own plants is likely to reduce the company’s risk, RBC Capital Markets analysts Robert Stallard wrote in a note. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N) is the wing supplier for Gulfstream’s G650 and G280 jets, while Triumph Group Inc (TGI.N) supplies wings for the company’s G450 and G550 jets. “Spirit continues to produce wings for Gulfstream products. Our workscope with them remains unchanged,” a Gulfstream spokeswoman told Reuters in an email. Spirit recorded a loss of nearly $531 million from the Gulfstream program as of Dec. 31, 2013 and has been trying to sell the Tulsa, Oklahoma plant at which it makes wings for Gulfstream’s jets. Spirit and Gulfstream are in a dispute over unpaid dues, with an arbitration set to be heard next January. Spirit claims Gulfstream owes it about $135 million for the G650 program for deliveries from 2010 through the end of the third quarter of 2013. The G500’s first flight is scheduled for 2015, Gulfstream said. The 18-seater G600 is projected to enter service in 2019.

195,GD,"UPDATE 2-Gulfstream launches two new jets, signs deals with Flexjet, Qatar Airways","(Adds analysis and details about price and buyers; closing stock price) By Ankit Ajmera Oct 14 (Reuters) - Gulfstream Aerospace Corp, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, launched two new business jets on Tuesday, the G500 and G600, with orders of up to 70 aircraft from Flexjet LLC and Qatar Airways. The new planes, available in 2018 and 2019, respectively, feather into Gulfstream’s product line at the large end of the business-jet market, fitting between its G450 and G650 models and adding competition for Bombardier Inc and Dassault Aviation. The announcement did not include orders for the G600 jet, and Gulfstream left unclear how many of the 70 jets are firm orders as opposed to options. The new jets are likely to draw customers wanting the “panache” of the latest plane but in a jet tailored to the most popular routes, said Jeff Trance, a senior vice president at charter company Air Partner PLC. “These aircraft are made to link specific cities” more efficiently, and “still give passengers the same amenities” of current Gulfstream jets, he said. Dallas-based Flexjet, a fractional jet ownership and leasing company, will order up to 50 aircraft, including the 16-seat G450, the new G500 and the flagship G650, Gulfstream said. Qatar Airways, the state-owned flag carrier of Qatar, will order up to 20, including the G500 and the G650ER for its Qatar Executive charter service. The G600 has a list price of $54.5 million and is able to fly from London to Singapore at Mach 0.85, Gulfstream said, and the $43.5 million G500 can fly from London to Bangalore at the same speed. The prices are about $10 million less than the G550 and G650 models. Both new jets will have shorter ranges than Gulfstream’s longest range G650ER. The G500 cabin will be seven inches wider than the G550, and seven inches narrower than the G650. Both will seat up to 19 passengers. The jets will be made at Gulfstream’s plants in Savannah, Georgia. Pratt and Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp , will supply the PW800 engines. Gulfstream will produce the wings and vertical and horizontal stabilizers. Replacing major suppliers for the parts will reduce risk, RBC Capital Markets analysts Robert Stallard wrote in a note. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc is the wing supplier for Gulfstream’s G650 and G280 jets, while Triumph Group Inc  supplies wings for the company’s G450 and G550 jets.

Spirit and Gulfstream are in a dispute over unpaid dues, with an arbitration set to be heard next January. Qatar Airways plans to use the jets to expand its Qatar Executive private jet service for families and businesses, a spokesman said. Qatar Executive’s current fleet consists of Bombardier Inc’s  Global Express, Global 5000 and Challenger 605 aircraft, which carry between 11 and 13 passengers and have a range of up to 6,150 nautical miles (11,390 km). Flexjet will build out its current fleet of 150 jets. It already has 245 aircraft on order from Bombardier and 70 from Embraer. The Gulfstream G500 “expands the long-range large-aircraft spectrum of our fleet,” Flexjet said. General Dynamics’ shares ended up about 0.8 percent at $119.19 on the New York Stock Exchange.

204,GD,"U.S. military readiness for war, competitive edge worsening: officials","SIMI VALLEY Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. military’s ability to stay ahead of technology advances by other countries and respond to multiple crises around the world is already in jeopardy and will get worse unless mandatory budget cuts are reversed, top U.S. officials warned on Saturday. Former defense secretary Robert Gates said the budget cuts were eroding confidence in U.S. leadership around the world and that it was time to end the “incredibly stupid” reductions. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert told Reuters the Navy would have to cut forces and reduce its ability to position ships around the world if lawmakers did not ease or reverse the cuts, which are due to resume in fiscal 2016. “Electronic warfare, electronic attack, anti-submarine warfare - all of these higher-end areas - will fall further behind because we’re just not investing in them,” he said in an interview at a conference at the Reagan Presidential Library.  He said the Navy’s ability to stay ahead of potential adversaries would “degrade significantly” unless the cuts ended. On Saturday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced a push for new weapons, including robotics, autonomous systems, miniaturization, big data and additive manufacturing, to ensure continued U.S. military dominance.  Greenert and other U.S. officials are urging Congress to end the cuts known as “sequestration”, citing growing strains amid increasing threats, including Russia’s aggression in the Crimea region, and Islamic State militancy in Iraq and Syria. Executives with Lockheed Martin Corp, Huntington Ingalls Industries and Raytheon Co said they were cutting overheads to drive down weapons costs but budget uncertainty limited their ability to make needed investments. Republican Senator John McCain, who is expected to take over as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee in January, said ending military budget cuts would be his highest priority. Admiral James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the conference that procurement of new weapons had slowed, even as escalating demands around the world made it difficult to restore the military’s readiness for new missions. “We aren’t modernizing as fast as we should in a highly competitive, technical landscape. Almost every element of our forced structure is shrinking while potential threats expand,” he said. Air Force Secretary Deborah James said half of U.S. combat air forces were not at the needed level of training and maintenance to respond to crises. Marine Corps Commandant General Joseph Dunford said only half of Marine Corps forces at home were ready to deploy.

The company’s shares rose more than 3 percent after Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said revenue should increase in 2016 and 2017. “We expect last year to be our low water mark for revenue,” Novakovic said on a conference call with analysts. U.S. weapons makers have cut costs in recent years to increase profitability in the face of lower defense spending.

Following is a list of key programs and funding levels proposed for the fiscal 2016 year, which begins Oct. 1, the department said Monday. All measures must still be approved by Congress. The budget requested: - $10.6 billion for 57 Lockheed F-35 fighter jets. - $3.4 billion for 16 P-8 maritime surveillance planes built by Boeing Co. - $1.3 billion for five E-2D battle management aircraft built by Northrop Grumman Corp. - $3 billion for continued development of Boeing’s KC-46A refueling planes, or tankers. - $1.2 billion for a new bomber for the Air Force, which plans to announce a winner soon in a competition that pits Northrop against a Boeing-Lockheed team. - $1.4 billion for continued work by General Dynamics Corp  and Northrop on a replacement for the aging Ohio-class submarines that carry nuclear weapons. - $11.6 billion for nine new ships, including smaller coastal warships built by Lockheed and Australia’s Austal  , an aircraft carrier being built by Huntington Ingalls Industries, and other submarines and ships built by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls. - $1.6 billion to improve the reliability of interceptors in the Ground-based Missile Defense system managed by Boeing. - $1.56 billion for 79 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. - $1.2 billion for CH-47 helicopters built by Boeing. - $1.1 billion for 64 remanufactured Boeing Apache AH-64 helicopters. - $821 million for procurement of more MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft built by privately held General Atomics. - $5.5 billion for cybersecurity programs which could benefit Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop and Raytheon Co , among others. - Accelerates by two years the development of a new Long Range Stand-Off Weapon to be used on the new bomber. The Pentagon budget plan would boost funding for research and development programs by 6.3 percent to $69.8 billion, a move welcomed by industry, which has long urged the Pentagon to keep investing in longer-term projects. It would fund high-speed strike weapons, a new initiative to start work on a sixth-generation fighter, a railgun weapon that fires at seven times the speed of sound, as well as improved navigation and timing equipment, and high-energy lasers. - The budget again seeks to retire the popular A-10 “Warthog” close air support aircraft for savings of $382 million, a move sure to anger Congress, which rejected a similar proposal last year. - It proposes $87 million in additional savings by halting production of the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) built by Raytheon. The Navy said it had sufficient JSOW weapons in inventory and other weapons to handle future needs.

212,GD,U.S. Air Force delays competition for ground surveillance planes,"WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force’s fiscal 2016 budget released on Monday delayed a long-awaited competition for a new air-ground surveillance aircraft to replace the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS). The budget plan said it had restructured the program’s acquisition strategy to allow more time for technology development and reduce risk, which delayed the target date for initial combat use by one year to fiscal 2023. The JSTARS program has been delayed repeatedly, although potential bidders had been heartened by statements from Air Force officials in recent months, as they began to talk about the program as a key priority. Northrop Grumman Corp built the current JSTARS based on a Boeing 707 commercial airliner, and is keen to bid to build a replacement. Boeing Co, Bombardier Inc, and General Dynamics Corp’s Gulfstream unit are also expected to bid for the work. To fund the new program, the Air Force said it would divest its E-8C test capability, and had drafted a plan to retire all E-8C between fiscal 2025 and 2026. It also said it would delay the retirement of five E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) to fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2016 to help meet the needs of military commanders.

213,GD,U.S. defense suppliers Harris and Exelis to combine,"(Reuters) - Harris Corp said on Friday it would buy Exelis Inc in a deal valued at about $4.75 billion, potentially kicking off a long-expected consolidation of mid-tier suppliers to the U.S. military after years of declining defense budgets. Harris Chief Executive William Brown said the deal was “transformational” and would increase the company’s scale, broaden its technology base and expand its customer base in existing markets. “This powerful combination creates an industry innovator with much greater scale, providing a broad spectrum of technology-based advanced communications solutions,” Brown told analysts. The new company would have combined revenue of $8.2 billion and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) about $1.6 billion, he said. “This is the first major merger among mid-tier defense companies. Clearly this was driven by cuts in the Army’s budget,” said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant. Exelis, spun off from ITT Corp in 2011, makes antennas for military aircraft, domes for Navy ships, sonar systems and GPS navigation systems. The company said in September it would work more closely with the U.S. Air Force and Navy, which have fared better in recent defense spending cuts than the Army. Harris’s products include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems for customers that include the U.S. National Security Agency and the Department of Defense. The company’s website cites a 2012 report that ranked it the 11th largest supplier to the U.S. government. U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp  and General Dynamics Corp have cut costs and increased exposure to international markets as the Pentagon tries to reduce spending by $1 trillion over a decade. Harris is offering $16.625 in cash and 0.1025 of its shares for each Exelis share. The total offer of $23.75 per share, a premium of about 34 percent to Exelis’ Thursday close, values Exelis at about $4.44 billion based on shares outstanding as of Oct. 28. Exelis shares traded as high as $24.05 before the bell on Friday. Harris’s shares were up 7.6 percent at $74.75. Harris shareholders will own about 85 percent of the combined company, which will have about 23,000 employees globally. Exelis spun off its lower-margin government services business last year to focus on its arms business.

Revenues gained 7.1 percent to $7.78 billion from $7.26 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S looked for earnings per share of $1.94 on revenues of $7.42 billion. Operating margins improved in three of its four business groups, rising to 13.2 percent companywide from 12 percent in the first quarter of 2014. Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic said a 20.4 percent margin posted in the aerospace sector would likely not be sustained over the full year. General Dynamics did not revise its outlook for the full year, but Novakovic told analysts the company was ahead of its plan. “We’re off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectations,” she said. “We will work to consolidate our improvements and continue to outperform.” Novakovic said about 5 cents of the 20-cent beat on earnings per share was due to a lower-than-projected tax rate of 29 percent for the quarter. The company said the strong U.S. dollar depressed revenues and operating earnings by about $120 million and $20 million, respectively. The funded backlog grew to $56 billion at the end of the first quarter from $53 billion at the end of last year, with the total backlog reaching $70.5 billion. It said it had $25.6 billion in additional unfunded contracts and options. General Dynamics said it repurchased 4.56 million shares in the quarter, and planned to continue returning cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  Novakovic said mergers and acquisitions were “not on my radar screen” because she was not seeing interesting new opportunities. Revenues rose at three of the company’s four divisions, while operating earnings rose across the board, led by a 47 percent increase in earnings at the combat systems division. General Dynamics’ shares rose $5.26 at $138.74 on the New York Stock Exchange.

225,GD,"Mitsubishi eyes technological leap, and exports, with armoured vehicle","* Mitsubishi testing amphibious assault vehicle prototype * In talks with BAE Systems and General Dynamics on body design * Eyes overseas sales after PM ended ban on arms exports - sources * Prototype was shown to senior U.S. Marine general - sources * Japan forming own marine unit as it shifts defence posture By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo TOKYO, June 24 (Reuters) - In January, a top U.S. Marine general visited Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan to look at a prototype of an amphibious assault vehicle that could one day be a key pillar in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push to sell weapons abroad. Using engines adapted from the main battle tank the company makes for Japan’s military and new water jet propulsion technology, the full-size prototype is undergoing pool tests, although it is in the early stages of development and production could be years off. Nevertheless, the maker of the wartime Zero fighter plane is eyeing overseas sales after Abe lifted a decades-old ban on arms exports in April last year as part of his more muscular security agenda, two Japanese defence industry sources said. Mitsubishi designers believe the prototype shown to U.S. Marine Corps Pacific commander Lieutenant General John Toolan will be more maneuverable and faster across the water than the 40-year-old AAV7 amphibious assault vehicle used to carry U.S. marines onto beaches from naval ships anchored offshore, the sources said. The AAV7 is built by the U.S. unit of Britain’s BAE Systems . The prototype’s engines in particular could be fitted onto other armoured vehicles, the sources added. “It’s an opportunity for Mitsubishi Heavy to tap overseas markets for its engine technology,” said one of the sources, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media. Mitsubishi Heavy wants to build an amphibious armoured vehicle that can move through water at 20 to 25 knots (37 to 46 km per hour) compared to the more than 7 knots (13 km per hour) reached by the AAV7, said the sources. “If the Japanese can get 20 knots in the water without compromising maneuverability on land, we will be very interested,” said one Marine Corps official who saw the prototype in January but declined to be identified. “Whether that’s possible remains to be seen.” A Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman said the prototype had been shown to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, but declined to give details about the vehicle. At a Paris arms show last June, a suitcase-sized model of an eight-wheeled armoured troop carrier was the centerpiece display at the company’s exhibition booth. The Ministry of Defense was aware of Mitsubishi Heavy’s research into amphibious vehicles but was not involved in the project, a ministry spokesman said. Manny Pacheco, a spokesman for U.S. Marine Corps procurement, declined to comment on the prototype. But he said the Marine Corps was “always interested in the technological advances of industry” and encouraged manufacturers to use “every opportunity to showcase their wares and get their products submitted through our competitive procurement process”. Amphibious vehicles are central to marine units around the world, allowing forces to operate on land and sea. But there has been little significant technological advancement in such vehicles in recent decades. A tracked Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle that was being developed for the U.S. Marine Corps by U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp was cancelled in 2011 after big cost increases and technical issues. The Marine Corps last year kicked off a competition for a new wheeled amphibious combat vehicle (ACV) that could operate on shorelines and shallow water. Pacheco said the Marine Corps was reviewing proposals from five manufacturers to build a prototype. He did not identify the companies. A feasibility study by BAE and General Dynamics had recommended against using current technology to build a vehicle in line with Marine Corps requirements, a U.S.-based BAE spokeswoman told Reuters. “The study concluded that although the technology existed, it would not be fielded at an affordable price,” she said. BAE was talking to Mitsubishi Heavy about being a potential partner on the body design of the new Japanese vehicle, the BAE spokeswoman added. General Dynamics was in similar talks with Mitsubishi Heavy, said sources in Japan. General Dynamics said it did “not have any information to provide at this time”. Mitsubishi Heavy has been making armoured vehicles for Japan’s military for around 80 years, beginning with the Imperial forces in the 1930s. It also builds fighter aircraft, naval vessels, submarines and missiles. The company also makes high-speed marine engines and water jet propulsion systems, according to its website. “Japan’s technology is good enough that we have to look at it,” said a U.S. military industrial source familiar with the amphibious vehicle plans. Although a coastal nation, post-war Japan only formed an amphibious military unit in 2012. The 3,000-strong unit will be equipped with more than 50 AAV7s. It was disappointment at the speed of those vehicles over water that spurred Japan to build a new one, Japanese defense officials told Reuters. Japan’s military is also concerned about the ability of the caterpillar-tracked vehicles to ride over coral reefs, a common feature in the East China Sea, where Tokyo is embroiled in a territorial dispute with China. The BAE spokeswoman acknowledged the desire of the U.S. Marine Corps to increase water speed, adding there should be “no operational concern” with coral reefs.

226,GD,UK signs 390 mln stg contract for military vehicle support,"LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Britain has awarded a 390 million pound ($610.35 million)contract to General Dynamics  to provide maintenance and support services to the new armoured tank vehicles it has on order. The government last year signed a 3.5 billion pound deal with the same company to buy 589 Scout Specialist Vehicles. Defence companies which supply Britain with equipment were bouyed earlier this month when the government committed to meeting NATO’s defence spending pledge of two percent of GDP for the next five years. The announcement comes after years of cuts - Britain has reduced defence spending by about 8 percent in real terms since 2010 to help cut a record budget deficit. The contract announced on Thursday would extend a current arrangement to 2024 and as a result, U.S. company General Dynamics would move vehicle testing and assembly to its base in Wales, creating 250 jobs in the region.

The central bank’s comments on the economy and inflation after its two-day pow-wow appeared to do little to drastically change wide expectations that the first rate hike will come in September or possibly December. No move on rates was expected this week. U.S. interest rates have remained near zero for almost a decade and the Fed has said it will raise rates once it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. “The statement tried to just give an update on the state of the economy, which is showing some modest improvement,” said Guy Haselmann, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Scotiabank in New York. “They were trying not to create extra volatility in a market already on edge.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.69 percent  to end at 17,751.39. The S&P; 500 gained 0.73 percent to 2,108.57 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.44 percent to finish at 5,111.73. All 10 major S&P; sectors were higher with the energy index’s  1.28 percent rise leading the way. The S&P; 500 has bounced about 2 percent higher in the past two days following a deeper near-3 percent drop over the preceding week that had been caused in part by a rout in China’s stock markets. With second-quarter earnings season more than halfway done, analysts now expect overall earnings of S&P; 500 companies to edge up 0.8 percent and revenue to decline 3.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. While earnings are expected to increase this quarter, valuations remain a concern. The S&P; 500 is trading near 16.9 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. After the bell, Facebook and Whole Foods Market  dropped 4 percent and 11 percent, respectively, following quarterly reports that left investors wanting more. During the session, Twitter shares fell 14.5 percent to a year-low of $31.24 after the microblogging company said its number of monthly average users rose at the slowest pace since it went public in 2013. General Dynamics rose 3.93 percent after its earnings. It sparked a sector-wide rally across major aerospace stocks including Northrop Grumman, Spirit Aerosystems , Lockheed Martin and Transdigm Group. Cytec soared 27.06 percent after Belgian chemical group Solvay agreed to buy the company for $5.5 billion. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2.69 to 1. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was 1.28 to 1. The S&P; was chalked up 26 new 52-week highs and 1 low; the Nasdaq posted 43 new highs and 62 lows.

Investors are focused on the outcome of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting with markets divided on whether it will take a hawkish or dovish stance. No move on rates is expected this week. In a recent congressional testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen neither ruled out a September interest rate hike nor guided the market toward thinking it was a done deal. The statement is expected at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). U.S. interest rates have remained near zero for almost a decade and the Fed has said it will raise rates once it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. Recent concerns surrounding the Greek debt crisis and the rout in Chinese markets have prompted some investors to bet that the Fed may hold off raising rates until the end of the year. “I don’t expect anything different out of the FOMC meeting today. Investors tend to take a cautious stand ahead of such meetings and that’s why we aren’t seeing too much a rally today,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. At 12:50 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 104.29 points, or 0.59 percent, at 17,734.56, the S&P; 500  was up 10.24 points, or 0.49 percent, at 2,103.49 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 9.37 points, or 0.18 percent, at 5,098.58. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher with the telecommunications index’s 1 percent rise leading the advancers. Pledges from Chinese regulators to buy shares to stabilize stocks if needed and hints of more policy easing from the central bank also soothed sentiments. U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Tuesday, breaking a five-day losing streak as attention shifted from trouble in Chinese equities to U.S. corporate earnings. With second-quarter reports well under way, analysts now expect overall earnings of S&P; 500 companies to edge up 0.8 percent and revenue to decline 3.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. While earnings are expected to increase this quarter, valuations remain a concern. The S&P; 500 is trading near 16.9 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. “Earnings have been fairly good but the problem is that we haven’t seen organic revenue growth and are also seeing tepid guidance from companies in face of the strong dollar,” said Hogan. Companies scheduled to report after the bell include Facebook MetLife and Whole Foods Market. Twitter shares fell as much as 14.3 percent to a year-low of $31.30 after the microblogging company said its number of monthly average users rose at the slowest pace since it went public in 2013. Yelp slumped as much 29.4 percent to a nearly two-year low of $23.66 after the operator of consumer review website Yelp.com, reported a surprise loss and forecast disappointing revenue for the current quarter. Cytec soared 26.5 percent to $15.45 after Belgian chemical group Solvay agreed to buy the company for $5.5 billion. General Dynamics rose as much as 6.3 percent to hit a record high of $153.39 after earnings, and lead a sector-wide rally across major aerospace stocks. Northrop Grumman, Spirit Aerosystems, Lockheed Martin and Transdigm Group were all up between 2.5 percent and 7.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,087 to 882. On the Nasdaq, 1,536 issues rose and 1,120 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 25 new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 56 new lows.

The initiative faces an uphill battle in Congress, which has been politically divided for years over mandatory budget cuts  and where many Republicans remain skeptical about climate change. Huntington Ingalls built the newest icebreaker in the U.S. fleet, the USCG Healy, which was delivered in November 1999. Huntington Ingalls spokesman Bill Glenn said his company had responded to a request for information from the Coast Guard on icebreaker design and construction in January as the service began developing a formal acquisition plan for the program. “HII has the capability and capacity to build both heavy and medium icebreakers and welcomes the opportunity to expand discussion on that subject with the U.S. Coast Guard or other government agencies supporting an icebreaker requirement,” Glenn said. General Dynamics also welcomed Obama’s announcement. “General Dynamics NASSCO is very interested in supporting a new icebreaker program. We have extensive experience in manufacturing heavy- and medium-weight steel commercial ships, and the manufacturing skills and methods needed to build modern polar icebreakers,” spokeswoman Lucy Ryan said. She said NASSCO was currently building 10 commercial ships, including the world’s first series of energy efficient container ships powered by liquefied natural gas. The Coast Guard, which has long sought funding for a new icebreaker, had no immediate comment. Coast Guard officials argue that increasing commerce and traffic in the Arctic Ocean, including petrochemical exploration and fisheries, require the United States to maintain robust polar icebreaking capability to ensure year-round Coast Guard presence in the region.

239,GD,UPDATE 1-General Dynamics profit beats on higher aircraft sales,"(Adds details, shares) Oct 28 (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp, which makes ships, tanks and business jets, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, partly helped by higher aircraft sales. The company’s share were up 1.4 percent at $150.50 in premarket trading on Wednesday. General Dynamics said it delivered 31 “outfitted” large-cabin aircraft in the third quarter, six more than a year earlier, while deliveries of mid-cabin jets doubled to 12. An aircraft’s outfittings include exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors. The company’s net income from continuing operations rose to $733 million, or $2.28 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 28, from $694 million, or $2.05 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 3.1 percent to $7.99 billion. Revenue from General Dynamics’ aerospace business, its biggest, rose 2.4 percent. Only the marine systems business, the third-biggest among the company’s four units, posted higher revenue growth, of 14.7 percent. Revenue from the combat systems business fell 3.6 percent and revenue from the information systems and technology business, General Dynamics’ second-biggest, declined 1.2 percent. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.13 per share, on revenue of $7.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Up to Tuesday’s close of $148.40, the company’s stock had risen about 8 percent this year, compared with an increase of about 4 percent in the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index .

243,GD,General Dynamics fourth-quarter profit beats expectations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp, maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, with higher operating margins for its aerospace and information systems segments.    The company’s earnings rose to $764 million, with diluted earnings per share at $2.40. The net earnings were a 9 percent increase from a year ago.  Revenue in the fourth quarter, however, was lower than expected at $7.8 billion, compared with $8.36 billion last year. General Dynamics’ shares were up 2.3 percent at $130.34 in midday trading after falling in the morning. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast $8.24 billion in revenue with earnings per share of $2.38 and reported net income of $752.2 million. Revenue for 2015 was two percent higher than in 2014 at $31.5 billion. Chief Financial Officer Jason Aiken said foreign exchange rate volatility played a greater role in 2015 compared to previous years. “In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our combat systems group given they’re increasing international activity,” Aiken said in an earnings call. The company had a backlog, which usually translates into future sales, of $66.1 billion in 2015, the report said.  On the call, Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said fully diluted earnings per share guidance for 2016 was $9.20 per share. For 2015, earnings per share were at $9.08.   Novakovic said that in 2016, General Dynamics expected revenue between $31.6 billion and $31.8 billion with an operating margin of about 13.3 percent.  Operating margins for the year just ended were at 13.3 percent compared with 12.6 percent in 2014 for the company. An analyst with Edward Jones, Jeff Windau, said while business jets and international markets could be a potential weakness, General Dynamics was doing “very well” in those markets. Windau added that the outlook for 2016 and beyond was positive.  In the aerospace division, fourth-quarter operating margins rose to 19.1 percent from 18.4 percent, while margins in the information systems and technology division increased to 10.6 percent from 8.6 percent. Revenue in all four divisions decreased in the fourth quarter. The aerospace division reported that for the fourth quarter, it delivered 38 “outfitted” aircraft compared with 42 a year earlier. An aircraft’s outfittings include exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors.     Novakovic said the delivery target for 2016 included 104 large cabin Gulfstream and 34 medium cabin.

253,GD,Damaged warship to head to San Diego for repairs: Navy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The USS Fort Worth, a U.S. warship that suffered damage to its combining gears in Singapore in January, will travel to San Diego under its own power for extensive repairs at a General Dynamics Corp shipyard, the U.S. Navy said Wednesday. The new coastal warship, built by Lockheed Martin Corp, will use its gas turbine engines to travel to its homeport of San Diego this summer from Singapore, where it has been deployed since December 2014, the Navy’s Pacific Fleet said in a statement. The trip is expected to take about six weeks. The cost of the expected repairs to be carried out by General Dynamics at its NASCCO shipyard was not yet clear, a Navy spokesman said. General Dynamics last year won a contract to perform maintenance of the Navy’s two different types of Littoral Combat Ships, including the steel monohull version built by Lockheed. The Navy last month removed Commander Michael Atwell as commander of the Fort Worth after an investigation into the Jan. 12 incident, which has been linked to crew error. The issue occurred during an operational test of the ship’s port and starboard main propulsion diesel engines, when a lack of lube oil triggered high-temperature alarms on both sets of gears, a Navy official has said. Combining gears allow the Fort Worth to configure different types and combinations of engines for propulsion at sea. The ship left San Diego in November 2014 and was on a 16-month deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet. The Navy said it decided to complete full repair of the combining gears in San Diego due to maintenance timelines, the efficiency of repairs and available docking space at the shipyard. Doing the repairs during a previously scheduled maintenance period would reduce the overall cost, it said. The Navy’s newest class of warships, which were designed to carry out a range of missions, including hunting for mines, submarines and surface warfare, have suffered a series of technical issues in recent years. The accident occurred just weeks after Defense Secretary Ash Carter told Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to end orders of the LCS class ships at 40, instead of ordering 52 ships as previously planned.

Shares of General Dynamics, whose products include Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, were up by about 2.3 percent in morning trading. The company’s slightly lower first-quarter revenue was in part due to a drop in aircraft sales.

279,GD,General Dynamics profit beats Wall St; shares jump 3 percent,"(Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on higher sales across all its business units, particularly in combat systems, sending shares up more than 3 percent on Friday. The shares touched a record high of $183.61 on Friday before paring gains.  Chief Financial Officer Jason Aiken said the aerospace and defense company expected 2017 company-wide revenue to rise 2.5 percent to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion. On Friday’s investor call Aiken forecast 2017 revenue would rise at three of the company’s four business units. Aiken also said he anticipated a future increase in defense spending which could benefit the maker of aircraft, ships and armored vehicles. The Falls Church, Virginia-based company said revenue for its aerospace unit, which makes Gulfstream business jets, could rise 6.4 percent in 2017.  However, Aiken forecast revenue for the Marine Systems segment, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, could decline to $7.9 billion a drop of 2.6 percent from 2016 levels. Sales in the Combat Systems unit, which makes the medium-weight Stryker combat vehicle, rose 10.5 percent to $1.68 billion in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, the U.S. Army placed a $320 million order related to Stryker.  Revenue for Combat Systems was forecast to rise by more than 6.6 percent this year.  General Dynamics said net income increased to $797 million, or $2.58 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $764 million, or $2.40 per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were $2.62 per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of $2.52, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth quarter sales from the aerospace business, the company’s largest unit, rose 3.8 percent to $2.22 billion. Total revenue for the quarter rose 5.4 percent to $8.23 billion but missed the analyst estimate of $8.29 billion.

289,GD,General Dynamics profit beats on strength in aerospace business,"(Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N), maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by increased aircraft deliveries that offset lower demand from the military. Sales to the U.S. government were slowed by the election and some of the decision-making mechanics of the administration change, CEO Phebe Novakovic said on Wednesday’s conference call with analysts.  Despite that, the company’s aerospace division, its second-biggest, delivered 30 aircraft in the first quarter ended April 2, compared with 28 a year earlier. Large-cabin aircraft deliveries rose to 23 aircraft during the quarter, from 20 a year ago.  The company anticipated 2017 aerospace revenue would increase about 6 percent over last year, and Novakovic “noted sharp increases in activity levels in Europe and improved activity in China.” Margins of over 20 percent for aerospace also beat expectations, Barclays analyst Carter Copeland said in a note. Smaller rival Textron Inc (TXT.N) last week reaffirmed its aviation unit’s 2017 revenue forecast. Results were dragged down by lower quarterly revenue from  Marine Systems, which makes submarines and surface ships for the U.S Navy, and Information Systems and Technology, which provides combat software solutions and combat-ready computing equipment.  Information Services and Technology (IS&T;) suffered because of a “slowdown in the execution” of contract line items on a number of programs due to the election, Novakovic said. IS&T;’s  quarterly revenue dropped 7.8 percent from the first quarter of 2016. Marine System’ quarterly revenue declined 8.9 percent from last year. The company is preparing to build Columbia class submarines beginning in 2021. Despite the soft demand from the U.S. government, the order backlog grew by approximately $1.5 billion to $53.3 billion.  Net income from continuing operations rose 16.7 percent to $763 million, or $2.48 per share, in the first quarter.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected $2.32 per share.

Shares of defense firms General Dynamics, Raytheon , and Lockheed Martin all hit record highs before easing to trade up between 0.4 percent and 1.6 percent. Boeing was up 1.3 percent and the second-biggest boost to the Dow. U.S. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals through which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Trump’s visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former FBI head last week and investigations into his administration’s possible links to Russia. Worries about the outlook for Trump’s domestic agenda causes a selloff in stocks last week. “We’re still recovering from that scare last week. Invariably in this bull market, there’s still a lot of money on the sidelines. When the market goes down, many investors view it as an opportunity to buy the dip,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Tech shares were the day’s best performers, with Amazon , Microsoft and Apple the biggest drivers on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 88.01 points, or 0.42 percent, to 20,892.85, the S&P; 500 had gained 11.17 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,392.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 43.77 points, or 0.72 percent, to 6,127.48. While the strong earnings season and positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible to political developments and what they mean for Trump’s agenda of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett as chief executive, responding to investors’ growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

While the strong earnings season and positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible to political developments and what they mean for Trump’s agenda of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. “Investors are growing skeptical,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, said in a note. “The likelihood of President Trump’s pro-growth agenda getting signed into law is fading as the Administration and Congress fends off and sorts out the constant barrage of headlines.” Also bolstering the market was a 0.8 percent gain in oil prices on rising confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, or even deepen cuts. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett, who heads its unit developing self-driving cars, as chief executive, responding to investors’ growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,928 to 892. On the Nasdaq, 1,740 issues rose and 987 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 39 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 86 new highs and 38 new lows.

315,GD,"General Dynamics profit tops expectations, revenue falls","(Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N), maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, reported higher-than-expected earnings on Wednesday, helped by battle tank sales even as indecision in Washington hurt revenue. A 1-percent year-over-year drop in quarterly revenue to $7.6 billion missed Wall Street analyst estimates of $7.94 billion, sending shares down 1.8 percent. Lower-than-expected sales in the Information Systems and Technology unit (IS&T;) to the Army hurt third-quarter results as caps on government spending hampered the Army’s decision making. “And, of course, the change in administrations slowed some execution as well,” said Chief Financial Officer Jason Aiken on a conference call with Wall Street analysts.  General Dynamics’ IS&T; is the largest unit by revenue and has thousands of shorter sales-cycle service contracts which can reflect delays quickly. IS&T; revenue increased by $50 million, or 2.3 percent, over the second quarter, but was down 7.6 percent compared with the same quarter last year. In July, General Dynamics’ CEO Phebe Novakovic had warned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s failure to fill dozens of senior-level positions at the Pentagon made it difficult for defense contractors to forecast business. Aiken said by the end of 2017, IS&T; will be flat versus last year.   Despite missing Wall Street’s expectations for total revenue, third-quarter 2017 results showed net earnings from continuing operations up 4.5 percent to $764 million, or $2.52 per share, up from $731 million or $2.36 per share a year ago.  Wall Street analysts expected $2.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company raised its earnings per share forecast for the year by 5 cents to a range of $9.75 to $9.80. It said this quarter’s earnings-per-share were aided by a lower-than-expected effective tax rate of 25.6 percent. Growth in 2017 has come from international programs within the Combat Systems unit, Aiken said, including deliveries of some of the 130 Abrams battle tanks and 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment ordered by Saudi Arabia last year.  Combat Systems revenue jumped 13 percent versus last year. Aiken said that unit’s revenue would also increase next quarter by about 15 percent. Revenue at General Dynamics’ Aerospace unit, which contains the Gulfstream private-jet business, was up $70 million or 3.6 percent. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the world’s largest weapons maker, disappointed Wall Street when it reported results on Tuesday, sending the stock down 2.3 percent for the day. Though the Bethesda, Maryland-based company expected increased defense spending under Trump, it forecast only a 2-percent rise in sales in 2018. Trump is seeking a $54-billion increase in overall U.S. defense spending, a proposal that must be passed by Congress and faces skeptical lawmakers. Political gridlock in Washington could stall the process further. General Dynamics did not make any 2018 projections on Wednesday.  The Falls Church Virginia-based defense contractor said its total order backlog at end of third-quarter 2017 was $63.9 billion, up 9.2 percent from the end of the previous quarter.​ The company-wide operating margin was 13.9 percent, a 60 basis-point increase. General Dynamics had also improved operating margins by 60 basis points during the prior quarter. Shares of U.S. defense companies have rallied since November on Trump’s promises during his election campaign to spend more on defense.  General Dynamics shares were down $3.84 to $208.24 in afternoon trading.

331,GD,General Dynamics cites slow government action for sales miss,"(Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) said on Wednesday the U.S. administration’s lack of appointees at the Pentagon and failure of Congress to pass a federal budget contributed to the  aerospace and defense company missing analysts’ sales expectations. Although revenue grew to $8.28 billion from $7.65 billion last year, it was below expectations for $8.38 billion.  General Dynamics Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said on a call with analysts the company was not able to convert its backlog of orders into revenue quickly enough last year, blaming the new administration and the use by Congress of Continuing Resolutions in lieu of a federal budget. She said the situation had changed later in 2017 and during 2018, growth would come back in the company’s information systems and technology business unit. The business was hit because its shorter sales-cycle service contracts likely slowed when the contracting process stalled.   Shares rose 2.3 percent in morning trading after Novakovic’s call with analysts, after falling in premarket trading. Last August, Novakovic said during her company’s quarterly earnings conference call that “without these (Pentagon) appointments, it is difficult to process contracts” and to make progress on defense-related projects. By mid-2017, the Pentagon had yet to fill many positions. The Pentagon and White House did not immediately provide comment. General Dynamics beat expectations for fourth-quarter profit, helped by higher sales for its combat systems unit that makes tanks. Sales in the combat systems unit rose 7.6 percent to $5.95 billion. In December, the General Dynamics unit was awarded a $2.6 billion contract for upgrading M1A1 configured Abrams vehicles and for upgrading M1A1 vehicles. Sales in the aerospace division, its biggest, rose 4 percent to $8.13 billion as it delivered 30 Gulfstream aircraft in the quarter, up from 28 a year earlier.     General Dynamics is expected to benefit from a move by the U.S. military to increase spending after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis unveiled the “National Defense Strategy” on Friday that put countering China and Russia at the center of a new strategy. Shares of U.S. defense companies have rallied since November on U.S. President Donald Trump’s election promise to spend more on defense. Earnings from continuing operations rose to $636 million, or $2.10 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $570 million, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier.

Northrop’s shares rose as much as 4 percent to a record high on Thursday after the company reported a 3.7 percent rise in fourth-quarter sales, boosted by higher sales in its businesses that make parts for F-35 fighter jets. Northrop did not specify if its fourth-quarter results were affected by slow government action, but flagged concerns at customers. “We’re about a quarter away through the fiscal year. And if as challenging as this might be on the industry side, the real pain here, and I mean, Pain with a capital P, is on our customers’ side,” Northrop Chief Executive Wesley Bush said on a post-earnings call. “This has gotten to a ridiculous point and we’ve got to get it solved,” he said. General Dynamics was more critical of the government, blaming Congress’ use of Continuing Resolutions in lieu of a federal budget on Wednesday for missing analysts’ sales expectations. Northrop reported sales of $6.63 billion for quarter ended Dec. 31, beating the average analyst estimate of $6.35 billion. (bit.ly/2DBxzFn) The company, which said it expects lower tax rate to boost its profit in 2018, forecast 2018 earnings of $15.00 to $15.25 per share, above the average estimate of $14.23. The maker of Global Hawk surveillance planes expects full-year revenue of about $27 billion versus expectations of $26.91 billion. However, Northrop said its 2018 segment operating margin would be in the low- to mid-11 percent range, largely below the 11.5 percent reported in the year ended Dec. 31. “There is likely some conservatism in the margin guidance, but this may also be driven by new business wins, which  typically have lower margins in the early stages,” Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote in a note. Northrop, like its peers in the United States, is benefiting from higher demand for weapons, fighter jets and tanks amid heightened security concerns and is expected to gain from an increase in U.S. defense spending under President Donald Trump’s administration. Net income fell 66.1 percent to $178 million, hurt by a higher tax expense and $500 million pre-tax pension contribution.

337,GD,General Dynamics to buy federal services provider for $6.8 billion,"(Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) said on Monday it would buy CSRA Inc CSRA.N, a smaller provider of government services for about $6.8 billion, to expand the services it offers to the U.S. Department of Defense. Federal information technology and services spending, down sharply over the past few years after the government mandated defense budget cuts, is expected to pick up again as President Donald Trump seeks to bolster military spending.  General Dynamics is betting that the deal with CSRA - provider of IT, mission, and operations-related services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and homeland security - will help it grab more of the revised budget. Trump’s budget request for the Pentagon is set to be announced on Monday. CSRA’s shares were trading at $40.50, just shy of the $40.75-per-share cash offer, which represents a 32 percent premium to CSRA’s Friday close. General Dynamics’ shares fell 0.5 percent.     “An increasing budget going forward gives us cause for optimism that the services market is going to come back to pre-2011 characteristics,” said Daniel Johnson, head of General Dynamics’ information systems and technology unit. The move comes after General Dynamics disappointed investors with weaker-than-expected revenue in the past two quarters, hurt by Congress’s indecision to pass a federal budget. Shares of General Dynamics, which also makes the Gulfstream aircraft, have underperformed the broader Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace and Defense index .DJUSAE in the past 12 months,  hurt also by a subdued business jet market. “If we get a two-year budget deal ... it helps to allow a lot of big projects especially in IT to move forward without hesitation or uncertainty,” Loop Capital analyst Joseph Vafi told Reuters. General Dynamics, which also makes tanks and U.S. Navy ships, said the deal is valued at $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion in CSRA debt.  General Dynamics said its information technology business and CSRA will be merged and report as a new financial segment. This business is expected to have about 60 percent fixed-price type contracts, which is a key to higher margins. “CSRA has been trading at a slight discount to the other services companies in the government services sector. This combined with the fact that General Dynamics’ own services business has a similar profit margin and business lines made it a more attractive purchase for General Dynamics,” a person familiar with the deal told Reuters.      General Dynamics said it expects the deal to add to its earnings per share and free cash flow per share in 2019 and generate annual pre-tax cost savings of about 2 percent of the combined company’s revenue by 2020.

The move comes after CSRA agreed last month to sell itself to General Dynamics, another defense contractor, for $40.75 per share in cash, as companies in the sector seek to position themselves for a pickup in government spending under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. CACI’s shares have jumped by more than a fifth in the last four months, emboldening the Arlington, Virginia-based company to use its stock as currency to pursue a transformative deal. CACI has a market capitalization of $3.9 billion, compared with CSRA’s $6.7 billion. CACI’s $44 per share offer for CSRA consists of $15 per share in cash and 0.184 CACI shares for each CSRA share, CACI said in a statement. Under the terms of CACI’s offer, CSRA shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined company. CACI said it expects to realize $165 million annually in net run-rate cost synergies, beating the cost benefits of CSRA’s deal with General Dynamics. It also argued its stock would make the deal more attractive to CSRA shareholders.  CSRA said on Sunday that its board of directors, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, will carefully review CACI’s proposal. General Dynamics’ tender offer is currently scheduled to expire on April 3. General Dynamics said later on Sunday it believes its all-cash offer is superior to CSRA shareholders and that it intends to proceed with the offer to buy CSRA. “General Dynamics has secured all necessary regulatory approvals and has the funding in place to complete the transaction in early April,” it said in a statement. CSRA provides information technology and related services to the U.S. Department of Defense and the intelligence community. General Dynamics is hoping that CSRA will help it grab more of the recently increased U.S. defense budget. Under the terms of their deal, CSRA would have to pay General Dynamics a $204 million breakup fee to do a deal with someone else. CACI has also been seeking to build scale through dealmaking. In 2016, it acquired the government services division of L3 Technologies Inc for $550 million in cash. It also made an unsuccessful offer to merge with Lockheed Martin Corp’s government information technology and services businesses. Other recent deals in the sector include U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp’s agreement last September to buy Orbital ATK Inc for about $7.8 billion, a deal that gives it greater access to lucrative government contracts and expands its arsenal of missile defense systems and space rockets. CACI on Sunday also raised its 2018 diluted earnings per share guidance from its previous $10.95 to $11.19 range to a new range of between $11.26 and $11.50.

General Dynamics said later on Sunday it believes its all-cash offer is superior to CSRA shareholders and that it intends to proceed with the offer to buy CSRA. “General Dynamics has secured all necessary regulatory approvals and has the funding in place to complete the transaction in early April,” it said in a statement. CSRA provides information technology and related services to the U.S. Department of Defense and the intelligence community. General Dynamics is hoping that CSRA will help it grab more of the recently increased U.S. defense budget. Under the terms of their deal, CSRA would have to pay General Dynamics a $204 million breakup fee to do a deal with someone else. CACI has also been seeking to build scale through dealmaking. In 2016, it acquired the government services division of L3 Technologies Inc for $550 million in cash. It also made an unsuccessful offer to merge with Lockheed Martin Corp’s government information technology and services businesses. Other recent deals in the sector include U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp’s agreement last September to buy Orbital ATK Inc for about $7.8 billion, a deal that gives it greater access to lucrative government contracts and expands its arsenal of missile defense systems and space rockets. CACI on Sunday also raised its 2018 diluted earnings per share guidance from its previous $10.95 to $11.19 range to a new range of between $11.26 and $11.50.

350,GD,General Dynamics raises bid for sector peer CSRA to fend off CACI,"(Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor General Dynamics (GD.N) on Tuesday raised its offer for sector peer CSRA Inc CSRA.N to $9.7 billion, including $2.8 billion in debt, in an attempt to top an unsolicited bid from CACI International Inc (CACI.N). General Dynamics’ revised offer under a merger agreement with CSRA’s board represents an equity value of $6.9 billion or $41.25 per share in cash, compared with the prior $6.8 billion or $40.75 per share. The revised bid from General Dynamics for CSRA, a provider of information technology and related services to the U.S. defense department, is just shy of CACI’s $41.79 per share cash-and-stock offer, based on CACI’s closing price on Monday. Given the all-cash nature of General Dynamics’s offer, it has considerably less risk and may prevail over CACI’s bid, analysts have said. “We still think the likelihood of General Dynamics and CSRA deal remains high,” CFRA Research analyst David Holt wrote in a note. Shares of CSRA rose as much as 1 percent to $41.44, while those of General Dynamic gained 1.3 percent to $226.90. On Sunday, CACI, which sells information services to national security agencies, offered to buy CSRA for $44 per share, consisting of $15 per share in cash and 0.184 CACI shares for each CSRA share. CACI’s stock fell 7.5 percent on Monday, lowering the offer’s overall price. The company’s shares rose as much as 5 percent to $152.80 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. “The rally in CACI’s shares is a reflection of investors thinking that General Dynamics will prevail, and that CACI will not put itself in this leveraged position,” Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn told Reuters over the phone. “It remains to be seen though if the CACI management sees it differently.” CACI said on Tuesday it was reviewing General Dynamics’ revised offer. While CACI has been trying to scale up through acquisitions, General Dynamics expects a deal with CSRA to help grab more of the revised defense budget. Federal information technology and services spending, down sharply over the past few years due to cuts in defense budget, is expected to pick up again as President Donald Trump seeks to bolster military spending.

369,GD,Trump launches effort to boost U.S. weapons sales abroad,"WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - The Trump administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy on Thursday aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it will bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home. The White House aims to cut the time it takes to approve arms deals, lowering the hurdle to bigger sales and sales of more powerful weapons, and increasing the role of senior U.S. officials in shepherding deals across the finish line, as earlier reported by Reuters. The initiative builds on President Donald Trump’s efforts to personally boost arms sales on calls with foreign heads of state. Companies that stand to benefit from the new policy most include Boeing Co and the other top U.S. defense contractors, Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co, General Dynamics Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp. The plans have been in the works for a year, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro playing a major role in driving the project forward. Navarro said in a statement the new policies “will create American manufacturing jobs, strengthen our allies and partners, support a robust defense industrial base at home, and promote American economic and security interests abroad.” Human rights will now carry equal weight alongside other considerations in planned arms sales including the needs of allied nations and the economic loss if the U.S. contractor does not win the sale when decisions are made on whether to approve an arms deal. “This is a balanced policy,” said Ambassador Tina Kaidanow, an official with the State Department who oversees arms export agreements. “We absolutely look at human rights as one of a set of considerations that we look at.” The planned revision of U.S. weapons export policy also includes a new drone export policy that allows smaller lethal drones that can fire missiles and surveillance drones of all sizes will soon become more widely available to U.S. allies, Reuters reported in March. Two potential beneficiaries of the rule changes, Textron Inc and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions Inc, currently market smaller armed drones internationally. The full text of the drone policy will remain classified along a list of potential buyers being given fast-track treatment is expanding to include more countries, a State Department official told Reuters this week. Previously, U.S. government sources had said that more NATO members, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf partners as well as treaty allies such as Japan and South Korea would be given the favorable treatment regarding drone sales. Trump has pressed foreign governments to buy more U.S.-made weapons in nearly every call he has had with a head of state of major allies, a State Department official said earlier this week. The new policy will go well beyond a relaxation of rules for foreign military sales under President Barack Obama in 2014 that enabled U.S. arms contractors to sell more overseas than ever before.

370,GD,Union accuses General Dynamics subsidiary of wage theft at call centers,"The Communication Workers of America filed complaints with the U.S. Labor Department on Monday accusing a General Dynamics Corp subsidiary of unlawfully underpaying federal contract call center workers, claiming the company may owe workers $100 million in back wages. The union alleged that General Dynamics Information Technology in Fairfax, Virginia misclassified workers as being in lower-paying positions even though they were performing the work of positions that paid more. The union said GDIT is the top federal contractor in the call center industry and has misclassified tens of thousands of call center workers since 2013.

371,GD,General Dynamics' jet delivery delay hurts profit beat,"(Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, with sales of tanks and weapons systems lifted by greater U.S. defense spending, even as overall sales figures were dented by fewer corporate jets deliveries. The company’s shares dropped $9.42 or 4.2 percent to $212.49 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Sales in the combat systems unit, which makes boats and tanks, rose 11.9 percent to $1.44 billion in the quarter ended April 1. But the company’s aerospace division, its biggest unit, reported a 12 percent drop in revenue due to lower deliveries of its larger cabin Gulfstream aircraft.  The delivery delay of two Gulfstream jets was done at the request of the customers, CEO Phebe Novakovic said during a call on Wednesday with Wall Street analysts. “They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter, but were delayed for the convenience of the customer.” Novakovic said. The business jet market has struggled to recover since the financial crisis, with overall global sales last year about half of the 1,317 planes delivered in 2008.     “We think Gulfstream business jet deliveries have found a bottom and the aerospace segment will begin growing again,” Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins said in a pre-earnings note.  The company’s earnings per share beat expectations but quarterly profit margins shrank 5 percent from 14.1 to 13.4 percent since last year. The company increased investment in research and development. In addition to strong arms sales during the quarter, earnings were also buoyed by favorable changes in the U.S corporate tax law that passed late last year. The effective tax rate was 16.8 percent for the quarter, CFO Jason Aiken said on the call. Last year General Dynamics reported it had 28.6 percent effective tax rate. In order to take further advantage of the new tax law, Aiken said the company planned to increase its pension contribution from $300 million to $550 million. He said move would impact operating cash forecasts.  In the first quarter, cash flow was negative $600 million which Aiken attributed to the timing of “payments from customers and payments to suppliers.” Earlier this month, General Dynamics bought peer CSRA Inc CSRA.N in a deal valued at about $9.7 billion. The competitive sale process for CSRA was won by General Dynamics because it was able to pay cash, something other bidders were unable to do. The purchase will begin to help earnings per share in the third quarter of the year, management said on the call.  During the quarter, the Falls Church, Virginia-based company’s order backlog shrank from $63.1 billion at the end of 2017 to $62.1 billion. Net earnings rose to $799 million, or $2.65 per share, in the quarter ended April 1 from $763 million, or $2.48 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.49 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $7.5 billion from $7.4 billion.

375,GD,Tax activists slam U.S. reporting exemption for defense firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tax activists this week criticized a U.S. government move to exempt large defense contractors from a financial disclosure rule meant to fight international tax dodging, saying the need for a national security exemption was unproven. The Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition’s criticism came after the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service sided in late March with defense contractors that had asked the agencies for the exemption. The new rule, part of a global tax accountability push that the United States has largely supported, requires U.S.-based multinational corporations with revenues exceeding $850 million to report revenue annually on a country-by-country basis. The disclosure is meant to give tax authorities a clearer idea of a company’s business commitments in specific countries, especially low-tax nations where multinationals often funnel revenues to minimize their tax liabilities. But defense contractors, represented by both the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), argued that the reporting rule would also result in disclosure of other information. “We are concerned that militarily sensitive information would be contained in or extractable from country-by-country reports envisioned by the proposed rule, particularly with respect to reporting on personnel, sales, and tangible assets in each country,” the AIA said in a March 2016 letter to the IRS. AIA’s members include contractors such as General Dynamics Corp. (GD.N), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT.N), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC.N), Raytheon Co. (RTN.N) and Boeing Co. (BA.N)  Treasury and the IRS sided with the contractors and exempted entities with more than 50 percent of annual revenue derived from contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense or other U.S. intelligence or security agencies. The IRS said in a March 30 notice that they had sought input on a possible national security exemption when crafting the original rule. Subsequent consultations with the Defense Department and Treasury prompted the exemption, the IRS said. But, in a letter this week to the Treasury, the FACT Coalition, which represents 100 groups including organizations on tax fairness, government ethics and international poverty, said the agencies had provided no “reasoned analysis justifying creation of the national security exception.” “The notice’s creation of an immediate national security exception to the (country-by-country) reporting requirement is arbitrary and capricious,” the FACT Coalition wrote in the April 30 letter.  The IRS could not immediately be reached for comment on the FACT letter. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The country-by-country IRS rule was intended to align with 2015 recommendations from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international group of advanced economies that has been working to curb corporate tax dodging. The FACT letter said the IRS failed to acknowledge that the Defense Department, when crafting the original rule, had said that country-by-country revenue information “generally does not pose a national security concern.” ",5012018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tax-corporate/tax-activists-slam-u-s-reporting-exemption-for-defense-firms-idUSL1N1S81FP
