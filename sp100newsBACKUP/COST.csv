The ADP national employment report set to be released at 8:15 a.m. [1215 GMT] was expected to show U.S. private hiring increased 68,000 in June after a rise of 38,000 in May, which was influenced by temporary factors, such as layoffs from auto shutdowns.

4,COST,U.S. chains' June sales likely lifted by bargains," * Thomson Reuters same-store sales index seen up 4.9 pct   * Walgreen, Hot Topic, Zumiez all topped expectations   * Bulk of retailers report monthly sales on Thursday    By Phil Wahba	   NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Top U.S. retailers are expected to report healthy sales gains for June, helped by bargains that lured shoppers contending with high gasoline prices and a wobbly economy.	   The 25 chains in Thomson Reuters monthly sales index include Target Corp , J.C. Penney Co , Gap Inc and Saks Inc . Analysts expect them to post a 4.9 percent increase in June sales at stores open at least a year, compared with a 3.1 percent increase last June.	   Despite that strong number, consumers remained under pressure from high food and gasoline prices, and retailers found themselves having to offer deals to get them to shop.  “You have to incentivize them (customers) with value,” said Al Sambar, a partner at retail strategy firm Kurt Salmon. “You’re now seeing a reluctance to spend.”	   Consumer confidence took a hit in June as shoppers fretted about high unemployment, prompting many to open their purses and wallets only tentatively. 	   “The economy has changed (my shopping habits) big-time. I don’t shop as much compared to a year ago, two years. I definitely wait for sales,” said Karen Anderson, 41, a stay-at-home mother from Frankfort, Illinois.	   Several companies have already reported June sales. Drugstore chain Walgreen Co said same-store sales rose 4.8 percent, beating Wall Street forecasts. Rite Aid’s  same-store sales rose 1.8 percent.	   Teen retailer Hot Topic’s same-store sales rose 0.4 percent, outpacing analysts’ expectations for a 2.4 percent drop. Rival Zumiez posted a 9.8 percent increase versus analysts’ average forecast of 5.6 percent.	   Discount chains, especially those that sell gasoline at lower prices, are expected to show the biggest sales gains.	   Costco Wholesale Corp is expected to report a 12.7 percent increase, or a 9.4 percent rise excluding gasoline sales, while analysts predict BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc  which last week said it was selling itself to two buyout firms, will post a 7 percent gain, and only 3.1 without gas sales.	   At the other end of the price spectrum, Saks and Nordstrom Inc are also expected to show strong June numbers. According to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, luxury spending rose 8.2 percent last month.	   Easing gas prices, strong Father’s Day sales and warm weather that accelerated purchases of summer clothing also likely helped, Retail Metrics said in a note on Wednesday.

7,COST,Analysis: Wal-Mart ruling no knock-out blow for class actions,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The end of the road for a class-action discrimination lawsuit brought by female employees of Wal-Mart Stores Inc has not spelled doom for employment lawsuits facing other big U.S. companies.  A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision last month siding with the world’s largest retailer was widely seen as a blow to many other would-be class-action plaintiffs.  But some employment class-action lawsuits, particularly those involving disputes over overtime and other wage-and-hour claims, are surviving and have even been strengthened by the ruling, as judges have issued opinions arguing the Wal-Mart decision does not apply to a given case.  The Wal-Mart case centered on whether a group of up to 1.5 million current and former workers at the retailer, who contended they were paid less than men and denied promotions, was properly certified as a class. The Supreme Court said the women could not sue jointly, finding they did not have enough in common to band together.  Plaintiffs who sue en masse have more power, because they can pool resources and combine claims into one lawsuit. Following the Supreme Court’s June 20 ruling, Wal-Mart workers will now have to sue in smaller groups or as individuals.  In the past three weeks, courts and attorneys have rushed to interpret the ruling. A day after the decision, a federal judge in New York ruled that about 600 employees of Tyco International Ltd unit SimplexGrinnell can sue jointly on their claims that they were underpaid.  On June 29, a federal judge in Florida denied Starbucks Corp’s attempt to decertify a class of more than 700 workers in a lawsuit on overtime pay, saying there were enough similarities to justify keeping class members together.  That same week, a federal judge in California denied trucking company C.R. England Inc’s attempt to decertify a class of up to 1,000 drivers in a wage-and-hour class action, and a federal judge in Ohio upheld class certification in a similar case against nursing home company HCR ManorCare.  To be sure, the plaintiff classes so far kept intact or certified are small compared with the Wal-Mart group, and their lawsuits do not involve the same type of sex bias allegations. The Wal-Mart case is expected to have more of an impact in other nationwide discrimination class actions, including pending cases against Costco Wholesale Corp, Toshiba Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Cigna Corp and Bayer.  At least one wage-and-hour case has come apart in the wake of the Wal-Mart decision. Citing the ruling, a federal judge in California on July 7 decertified a class of several hundred Dollar Tree Inc employees that accused the discount chain of denying them overtime pay.  Lawyers defending companies in other types of lawsuits, including cases accusing banks of misleading investors about complex mortgage investments, are also citing the Wal-Mart ruling as they try to block plaintiffs from linking together to sue.  NOT ABOUT WAL-MART  But plaintiffs’ attorneys contend that class actions involving alleged wage-and-hour violations should not be affected by the ruling in the Wal-Mart case, formally known as Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores. They cite legal arguments about the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor laws.  “Plaintiffs’ lawyers are looking for ways to distinguish their cases from the Wal-Mart case,” said Howard M. Erichson, a professor at Fordham Law School. “They’re using other case law to show it’s easier to establish commonality than it was in Dukes vs. Wal-Mart.”  In cases involving state labor law, plaintiffs’ lawyers argue that classes of proposed plaintiffs are much narrower than the sprawling one in the Wal-Mart case. In the SimplexGrinnell case, U.S. District Judge Steven Gold upheld class certification for about 600 workers who allege the Tyco fire and safety equipment unit violated New York labor law.  “The relevant facts and circumstances in Wal-Mart have little bearing here,” Gold concluded.  Cases brought under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act are also proceeding. Class certification for these cases do not have to satisfy the same strict requirements as discrimination cases, such as the Wal-Mart lawsuit, brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.  Both the Starbucks and the HCR ManorCare lawsuits faced the less stringent certification standard. HCR attorneys asked Ohio federal judge Jack Zouhary to consider the impact of the Wal-Mart ruling to their wage-and-hour case. “This Court concludes the concerns expressed in Dukes simply do not exist here,” Zouhary wrote in a July 1 order.  Employer-side attorneys say some judges are misinterpreting the Wal-Mart ruling, keeping alive class-actions that do not merit certification.  “A lot of the judges are reading the Dukes case narrowly,” said Allan King, an employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson. “If they were to read it more broadly, plaintiffs would have to make a much stronger case much earlier in the litigation.”  ",7122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walmart-classaction/analysis-wal-mart-ruling-no-knock-out-blow-for-class-actions-idUSTRE76B52H20110712
8,COST,Union grocers stuck in California pressure cooker,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A high-stakes supermarket labor dispute in southern California, the nation’s toughest and most trend-setting food retail market, is exposing the challenges facing the grocery business and its union workers.  In 2003, the region played host to the longest work stoppage in the history of the U.S. grocery industry. That bitter, four-and-a-half-month standoff shifted more than $1 billion in sales, and the loyalty of some shoppers, to competitors.  Back then, the threat was Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s push into groceries. The growth of Wal-Mart and other nonunion food sellers has turned southern California into one of the hardest markets for union supermarkets to prosper.  Now, union membership is dwindling among U.S. retail workers, along with the market share controlled by unionized grocers. As in many union battles across the country, a big issue is who should pay for rising healthcare costs.  “The grocers don’t want to pick up that tab if their competitors don’t have to do it,” said supermarket consultant David Livingston.  Experts said many other U.S. markets may one day mirror California’s diversity and hyper-competitiveness.  “California tends to be the leading indicator for the rest of the United States,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.  Southern California workers and management side-stepped a strike in 2007, but the threat of another stoppage is back.  The 62,000 employees of Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons stores have been without a contract since it expired in March. They have authorized a strike and have been busy picketing.  Ralphs owner Kroger, Vons owner Safeway and Albertsons owner Supervalu are negotiating as a group — adding complexity to the talks.  Grocery employees are members of seven union locals. The biggest is United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770.  This time, the retailers and the unions face unprecedented pressure, Flickinger said.  In the 1970s and 1980s, Albertsons, Vons, Ralphs and Stater Bros, a private, unionized supermarket chain not involved in the negotiations, controlled close to 90 percent of the southern California retail food market. That has fallen to less than 40 percent, Flickinger said.  The number of union retail workers also has shrunk.  Union membership among U.S. retail workers fell from a high of 933,000 in 2003 to 687,000 in 2010 — a decline of more than 26 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which does not break out figures for individual states.  Southern California is now crowded with nonunion rivals including Wal-Mart, Costco, Tesco’s Fresh & Easy, Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe’s, Winco, Hispanic supermarkets like Superior Grocers and deep discounters such as 99 Cents Only Stores. Even Target is adding grocery sections more than 100 existing stores in the area.  Those colliding trends have made southern California home to some of the most contentious supermarket labor battles.  “My hope is that cooler heads prevail ... It is in no one’s interest to have a strike,” said Walter Stackow, senior research analyst at Manning & Napier, which owns shares of Kroger, Safeway and Supervalu.  While Kroger has outperformed Safeway and Supervalu, analysts said supermarket profits are not growing.  Kroger and some other grocers have made progress closing the price gap with Wal-Mart, which has pulled away from short-term deep discounts and is focusing on low prices and matching rivals’ advertised prices.  Labor costs remain a hot issue because every penny of expense counts when retailers compete on price.  The unions say supermarket operators want workers to shoulder a burdensome share of their own healthcare costs.  “As it is, I barely make enough money to make ends meet,” said Lisa Marie Wheeler, 41, a checker at Vons in San Pedro. The single mother of four works two part-time jobs.  “If I have to pay more just to keep the insurance, and then more for the costs that they don’t cover, where will I be? I’ll be devastated,” said Wheeler.  Kroger spokesman Keith Dailey said workers’ healthcare cost increases would be modest, and that the proposal on the table will not lower the grocer’s healthcare costs, only moderate future cost increases. Safeway and Supervalu declined comment.  “The irony is, the harder they each pull on the rope, the higher the likelihood that the damage to both parties will be bigger,” Bill Bishop, chairman of consultancy Willard Bishop, said of the negotiations.

10,COST,Tengelmann expects to exit A&P; in bankruptcy process," MUEHLHEIM AN DER RUHR, Germany, July 14 (Reuters) - German retailer Tengelmann expects to exit its holding in Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea (A&P) GAPTQ.PK when the U.S. grocery store chain emerges from bankruptcy protection.   “We hope that A&P can be led out of its insolvency. But we do not believe that we will be significant shareholders after the process ends,” Tengelmann Chief Executive Karl-Erivan Haub told reporters on Thursday.   A&P, once the largest U.S. grocer, filed for bankruptcy protection in December as it ran low on cash and was squeezed by discounters like Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).   “A&P is currently in freefall,” Tengelmann’s Chief Financial Officer Jens-Juergen Boeckel said.   Tengelmann, which owns about 38 percent of A&P, said last year it expected the company to be combined with another retailer in the long term. It has now fully written off the value of its stake in A&P.   Haub also said on Thursday that Tengelmann’s home improvement store chain OBI would not take over peer Praktiker PRAG.DE, in part or in whole.   Praktiker declined to comment on the matter.

Lawyers for the women will argue in U.S. District Court in San Francisco that they should be able to press ahead with multiple, narrower class-action claims against the retailer.   Wal-Mart, however, wants to make sure any potential class actions are kept firmly in the grave.   Women who say the company denied them pay raises and promotions because of gender bias are regrouping after the Supreme Court dismantled a class of up to 1.5 million current and former Wal-Mart workers last month.   Had the class-action lawsuit gone forward, Wal-Mart could have been liable for billions of dollars in back pay and other damages. The court concluded that the group did not have enough in common to band together to sue the company.   Friday’s hearing marks the first time both sides have appeared in court following the landmark decision.   Since the case cannot move forward as one massive case, plaintiffs must reformulate claims into more tailored groups — or as individual lawsuits.   Joseph Sellers, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs and a partner at law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll in Washington, said plaintiffs will propose a smaller class-action lawsuit in California, and could bring similar cases elsewhere in the country. He declined to comment before the hearing on how many smaller class-action lawsuits there could be.   “There was this sense after the Supreme Court decision that the case was dead, and we dispute that,” Sellers said.   “We think the decision leaves open the possibility of bringing more narrowly tailored class actions.”   Plaintiffs could carve up the larger group of current and former Wal-Mart workers according to different stores or regions, and different job descriptions and time frames of employment. It is unclear what Wal-Mart’s potential liabilities could be in this scenario if it loses the case.   Sellers said hundreds of attorneys have contacted his firm expressing interest in representing plaintiffs in revised litigation. His firm spent about $7 million on the original lawsuit against Wal-Mart that landed at the Supreme Court, and so far has not seen a return on its investment. [ID:nN1E75K1P7]   The Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the plaintiffs’ bias claims, only whether they could link together to sue. The ruling has been applauded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group but denounced by women’s organizations.   Wal-Mart has said that the ruling means that current or former workers wishing to sue for sex discrimination would have to do so on an individual basis — not through a series of smaller class actions.   “We strongly believe the Supreme Court’s decision forecloses any reconfigured class,” said Theodore Boutrous, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles and lead attorney for Wal-Mart.   At Friday’s hearing, the plaintiffs will also argue that current and former Wal-Mart workers need more time to file discrimination claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or new lawsuits against the company before the statute of limitations runs out.   In a court filing last month, Sellers asked that the court give former members of the dismissed class an additional four months to file new EEOC claims or litigation. Wal-Mart opposes granting the extra time.   The Wal-Mart ruling is expected to have widespread impact on many types of class-action lawsuits, making it more difficult to win certification of large groups of plaintiffs.   On July 18, a Michigan state court cited the decision when it decertified a class of more than 3,000 property owners suing Dow Chemical Co DOW.N.   Pending sex-discrimination class actions that could be impacted by the Wal-Mart ruling include cases against Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Toshiba Corp (6502.T), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Bayer (BAYGn.DE).   The case is Betty Dukes et al v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case no. 01-cv-02252.

14,COST,"Goldman Sachs fights bias lawsuit, cites Wal-Mart","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said a recent landmark decision throwing out a class-action lawsuit against Wal-Mart (WMT.N) means it should not face a wide-ranging case accusing it of systematic bias against women.  The investment bank in court papers said the three women who sued it last year have highly individual claims that cannot be readily applied to a wider class of plaintiffs.  Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court said a gender bias case against Wal-Mart on behalf of a group believed to exceed 1.5 million workers could not proceed because the plaintiffs’ claims did not have enough in common to sue as a group. The plaintiffs allege that Goldman underpays women and promotes them less often than men.  A grant of class-action status can result in larger awards and make it easier for people who otherwise could not sue on their own to recover.  “The (Wal-Mart) holding has powerful relevance here,” Goldman’s lawyers wrote in papers filed late Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan where the lawsuit is pending.  “The charge does not mention or allege any class-wide problem common to any ‘similarly-situated women’ plaintiff Chen-Oster seeks to represent. It does not set forth even one factual contention supposedly common to her and anyone else,” Goldman’s lawyers wrote.  The proposed class action seeks to represent “similarly situated” current and former female associates, vice presidents and managing directors employed by the company. Men at the company “are viewed more favorably, receive more compensation, and are more likely to be promoted,” the plaintiffs wrote.  Goldman Sachs is accused of violating Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act and New York City Human Rights Law. The women are seeking back pay, changes to compensation and promotion practices, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.  The June 20 Supreme Court ruling in Wal-Mart’s favor, known as Dukes et al vs. Wal-Mart, is expected to have a significant impact on sex discrimination class-actions, because it makes it harder to win certification of large groups of plaintiffs.  Pending sex-discrimination class actions that could be affected by the Wal-Mart ruling include cases against Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Toshiba Corp (6502.T), Cigna (CI.N) Corp and Bayer (BAYGn.DE).  The Wal-Mart decision asserted that “vague allegations of class-wide discrimination” are not enough to support a sex bias class action lawsuit, Goldman’s attorneys wrote in Thursday’s filing.

16,COST,"Discounts, warm weather seen helping July sales","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retailers are poised to report higher sales for July, a discount-driven month that may do little to lift their margins.  July sales figures will give investors an early read on demand in the consumer-driven U.S. economy at the start of the back-to-school season, the second-biggest selling period of the year after Christmas.  Retail chains ranging from Target Corp (TGT.N) to Saks Inc SKS.N will report closely watched sales at stores open at least year on Wednesday and Thursday. (For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/ryz82s)  Analysts are expecting same-store sales to show a 4.1 percent rise for July, compared with a year-earlier increase of 2.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.  “The hot weather has certainly helped drive people into malls and helped clear out summer seasonal merchandise,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics Inc.  At issue, he added, is whether retailers will be able to sell their wares at full price in the back-to-school season.  It is not uncommon for retailers to offer discounts in July as they try to clear store shelves for back-to-school merchandise. Some investors worry that the discounting may have been deeper than usual and could weigh on margins.  “There was a lot of clearance merchandise,” said Trutina Financial Chief Investment Officer Patricia Edwards. “While the sales may be there, the margins may not.”  The back-to-school selling season has important implications as consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, which barely grew in the first half of 2011.  Retail stocks have fallen in the past month. The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX is down 4.2 percent since retailers reported June sales, although the broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell more steeply at 5 percent.  NO STOMACH FOR FULL-PRICE GOODS  Analysts expect warehouse club operators such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N to post some of the largest sales gains in July.  Warehouse clubs, which charge customers an annual fee to shop in their stores, have won shoppers seeking low prices on necessities such as groceries or toiletries.  Analysts also expect healthy sales gains at dollar stores and off-price retailers TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) and Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O). Off-price chains sell sharply discounted designer merchandise often returned to vendors by department stores.  “I just don’t think that the consumer has the stomach right now to really pay full price, even for new ... back-to-school merchandise,” Perkins said. “Consumer confidence is not particularly strong right now.”  U.S. consumer sentiment fell in July to its lowest point in more than two years as anxieties over stagnant wages and unemployment deepened, a survey showed.  Rhonda Douma, who was shopping for her 3-year-old daughter at American Girl in a mall in Hollywood, California, said she planned to spend the same amount this back-to-school season as she did last year.  Her top destinations for the season highlight the price sensitivity of the post-recession American shopper.  “Usually it’s Walmart (WMT.N) and Target and Marshalls,” said Douma, 42. “We just found out about this store, and they have a lot of cute, fun stuff — and brand names for cheaper prices.

19,COST,Discounts help chains in July; tough battle ahead,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deep discounts brought shoppers to malls and helped many retail chains report sales gains in July, in an early sign that consumers will keep demanding bargains in the back-to-school season.  The 25 chains tracked by Thomson Reuters reported a 4.4 percent gain in sales at stores open at least a year. That just met analysts’ expectations for July, the month that kicks off the second-biggest selling season of the year after Christmas.  Most retail stocks fell.

The July sales numbers did little to dispel concerns about the economy, which barely grew in the first half of 2011.  “Back-to-school (sales) will be an increase over last year, but it will be a hard-fought increase for retailers,” said Joel Bines, a managing director at advisory firm AlixPartners. “This year’s promotional activity may end up being heavier than last year.”  Consumers face not only a tough economy but also a myriad of choices.  “August is the month that price increases from higher cotton and petroleum prices will be felt,” Bines said. “Retailers won’t want to wait too long to see if consumers will balk at higher prices.”  Michael Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, also urged investors not to get too optimistic over the sales gains in July, which came in below his expectations of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent, excluding higher gasoline prices.  “Overall, there’s a lot of worry where the industry and economy are heading,” Niemira said.  The ICSC is expecting same-store sales to rise 4 percent to 5 percent in August.  While sales held up “relatively well” for the quarter that ended in July, “the key question will be whether or not demand is starting to slow,” Goldman Sachs analyst Michelle Tan wrote in a research note.  “It’s a very Darwinistic environment in retail right now,” said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Clover Investment Advisors in Rochester, New York.  Warehouse clubs Costco (COST.O) and BJ’s BJ.N and luxury chain Saks SKS.N posted some of the biggest sales gains in July, highlighting the bifurcation in the U.S. economy. Department store and other retailers that cater to the middle were among those that disappointed.  “The folks that are doing well economically are going to continue to spend at a pretty good clip, and the families that have less means are going to continue to pick and choose and only spend on what they need versus what they want,” said Alison Paul, leader of Deloitte’s U.S. retail practice.  The July figures made some chains, such as Target Corp (TGT.N), optimistic about demand heading into the second-biggest selling period of the year after Christmas.  “Back-to-school sales are off to a solid start, contributing to our confidence in the strategies we have in place and our ability to execute them,” Target Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel said on Thursday.  The discounter reported a better-than-expected 4.1 percent rise in same-store sales and forecast a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase for August.  “My mom is paying the bills, and they’re telling me that they need to cut back on me spending all this money on me buying clothes,” said Ed Rush, 15, who was shopping at a Target store in Chicago.  Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 10 percent rise in total July sales at stores open at least a year, beating the analysts’ average estimate of an 8.6 percent increase.  BJ’s Wholesale Club reported a 9.2 percent same-store sales rise, while analysts only expected 6.6 percent growth.  U.S. consumer sentiment fell in July to its lowest point in more than two years as anxieties over stagnant wages and unemployment deepened, a survey showed.

The discounter reported a better-than-expected 4.1 percent rise in same-store sales and forecast a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase for August.   “My mom is paying the bills, and they’re telling me that they need to cut back on me spending all this money on me buying clothes,” said Ed Rush, 15, who was shopping at a Target store in Chicago.   Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 10 percent rise in total July sales at stores open at least a year, beating the analysts’ average estimate of an 8.6 percent increase.   BJ’s Wholesale Club reported a 9.2 percent same-store sales rise, while analysts only expected 6.6 percent growth.   U.S. consumer sentiment fell in July to its lowest point in more than two years as anxieties over stagnant wages and unemployment deepened, a survey showed.

Theresa Danza sued Costco in her hometown of Brooklyn, New York, claiming she was hospitalized for spinal and shoulder trauma and needed months of treatment by a chiropractor after a tumble in a Costco in North Miami, Florida, on January 24, 2009.  “I didn’t know what hit me,” she said. “I just went flying.

32,COST,"Irene likely dented August auto, retail sales","NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene hit the U.S. East Coast at the most inopportune time for many businesses, keeping millions of shoppers away from stores and auto dealerships during what should have been a busy weekend.  Irene struck a wide area from North Carolina to Vermont, inflicting damage on the August sales results that automakers and many big U.S. retailers are set to report later this week.  The weight of low consumer confidence, the stock market and low inventories of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co (7267.T) vehicles are the key reasons auto analysts expect U.S. new vehicle sales to fall in August from July or be flat at best.  Still, analysts predict a 5.2 percent increase from August 2010, though that tally was made before the weekend’s storm shut many East Coast auto dealerships.  “What’s concerning to us is a huge percentage of sales come in the last weekend or the last week of the month so it hit at that really crucial time,” said Edmunds.com analyst Michelle Krebs. “The good news is that sales are better than May and June.”  The storm also forced stores including Macy’s Inc (M.N) and TJ Maxx in New York to close over the weekend, a period when people are more likely to be shopping.  A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that analysts expect the 25 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Target Corp (TGT.N), J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Saks Inc SKS.N — to report a 4.7 percent increase in August sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales.  The chains that report monthly sales represent only about 10 percent of retailers, and the storm affected roughly 15 percent of the U.S. population, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, who lost power at his Connecticut home early on Sunday.  “There will be a few retailers that will use the hurricane as an excuse for poor performance, but these are some of the same people who have been performing poorly for months now,” he said. “Gap’s numbers are going to be lousy this month, Aeropostale’s will not be good, but they were bad before the storm.”  AUTO SALES UP - AND DOWN  As much as a fifth of U.S. auto sales are often generated in the states that were affected by Irene, said Paul Taylor, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association. In those states, August sales will likely be down about 10 percent.  A bigger problem related to Irene may affect September sales as well, Taylor said.  “The real issue is going to be flooding,” he said.  The average forecast of 44 economists surveyed by Reuters was 12.1 million vehicles were sold on an annualized basis, up from 11.5 million a year ago, but off slightly from 12.2 million in July.  Honda appears to be struggling the most. Edmunds.com and TrueCar.com expect Honda’s sales for August to drop by 22 to 25 percent from last August, and for Toyota’s sales to fall 11 percent to 14 percent.  They show General Motors Co’s (GM.N) August sales up 20 percent, Ford Motor Co (F.N) up 12 to 14 percent, Chrysler Group LLC up 21 to 22 percent and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) up 16 to 22 percent. Chrysler is under the management of Italy’s Fiat SpA. FIA.MI  Jim Ziegler, a dealer consultant who spoke with dozens of dealers on Monday, said August auto sales figures will “definitely take a hit” due to Irene.  Due to power outages and flooding, Ziegler said, customers are not expected to return in big numbers until the upcoming Labor Day weekend in early September.  Still, auto dealers are happy the storm was not as damaging as some had expected.  “Almost everybody has the feeling that they dodged a bullet,” Ziegler said.  Retailers that sell back-to-school items likely felt Irene’s pinch as the storm essentially shut down malls on a weekend when parents normally shop for clothes and notebooks, not bottled water and flashlights.  “This is a major weekend of sales that were planned, but that won’t happen, in one of the most densely populated regions,” said Joel Bines, a managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners.  The damage could take 1 percentage point off August same-store sales, said Bines, adding that leftover merchandise will likely be discounted, damaging gross margins.  Department stores including Penney and Macy’s and such clothing chains as Gap Inc (GPS.N) and Aeropostale Inc ARO.N are seen as most exposed to a slowdown.  Most retailers’ monthly reporting periods ended on Saturday, meaning the pain of Sunday’s missed sales will carry over into September’s tally. Chains that report monthly sales and are heavily exposed to the East Coast include BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N).  Home improvement chains like Home Depot (HD.N) and supermarkets like Supervalu (SVU.N) likely received a boost that will continue as people pump water from their basements and focus on repairs.  However, those chains as well as others such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), do not report monthly sales.  A large portion of back-to-school sales, retailers’ second-most important season after the winter holidays, could be lost for good, especially if it takes time for the transportation infrastructure to get back in place.  “There are millions of dollars in economic activity and productivity that were lost and simply will not and cannot be recouped,” said weather tracking firm Planalytics.

33,COST,"PREVIEW-UPDATE 1-Irene likely dented Aug. US auto, retail sales","   * August auto sales due Thurs; retail sales Wed/Thurs   * Auto sales seen up 5.2 pct yr-over-yr before Irene hit   * Same-store sales rise of 4.7 pct seen as of Monday   * Storm boosts spending at many retail chains not in index  (Adds comment by auto dealer consultant on impact of Hurricane Irene)   By Phil Wahba and Bernie Woodall   NEW YORK/DETROIT, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene hit the U.S. East Coast at the most inopportune time for many businesses, keeping millions of shoppers away from stores and auto dealerships during what should have been a busy weekend.   Irene struck a wide area from North Carolina to Vermont, inflicting damage on the August sales results that automakers and many big U.S. retailers are set to report later this week.   The weight of low consumer confidence, the stock market and low inventories of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co (7267.T) vehicles are the key reasons auto analysts expect U.S. new vehicle sales to fall in August from July or be flat at best.   Still, analysts predict a 5.2 percent increase from August 2010, though that tally was made before the weekend’s storm shut many East Coast auto dealerships.   “What’s concerning to us is a huge percentage of sales come in the last weekend or the last week of the month so it hit at that really crucial time,” said Edmunds.com analyst Michelle Krebs. “The good news is that sales are better than May and June.”   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Auto & retail sales graphic: r.reuters.com/deb53s  Same-store sales graphic:    r.reuters.com/juz43s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   The storm also forced stores including Macy’s Inc (M.N) and TJ Maxx in New York to close over the weekend, a period when people are more likely to be shopping.   A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that analysts expect the 25 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Target Corp (TGT.N), J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Saks Inc SKS.N — to report a 4.7 percent increase in August sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales.   The chains that report monthly sales represent only about 10 percent of retailers, and the storm affected roughly 15 percent of the U.S. population, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, who lost power at his Connecticut home early on Sunday.   “There will be a few retailers that will use the hurricane as an excuse for poor performance, but these are some of the same people who have been performing poorly for months now,” he said. “Gap’s numbers are going to be lousy this month, Aeropostale’s will not be good, but they were bad before the storm.”   AUTO SALES UP - AND DOWN   As much as a fifth of U.S. auto sales are often generated in the states that were affected by Irene, said Paul Taylor, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association. In those states, August sales will likely be down about 10 percent.   A bigger problem related to Irene may affect September sales as well, Taylor said.   “The real issue is going to be flooding,” he said.   The average forecast of 44 economists surveyed by Reuters was 12.1 million vehicles were sold on an annualized basis, up from 11.5 million a year ago, but off slightly from 12.2 million in July. [ID:nL4E7JQ2ED]   Honda appears to be struggling the most. Edmunds.com and TrueCar.com expect Honda’s sales for August to drop by 22 to 25 percent from last August, and for Toyota’s sales to fall 11 percent to 14 percent.   They show General Motors Co’s (GM.N) August sales up 20 percent, Ford Motor Co (F.N) up 12 to 14 percent, Chrysler Group LLC up 21 to 22 percent and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) up 16 to 22 percent. Chrysler is under the management of Italy’s Fiat SpA. FIA.MI   Jim Ziegler, a dealer consultant who spoke with dozens of dealers on Monday, said August auto sales figures will “definitely take a hit” due to Irene.   Due to power outages and flooding, Ziegler said, customers are not expected to return in big numbers until the upcoming Labor Day weekend in early September.   Still, auto dealers are happy the storm was not as damaging as some had expected.   “Almost everybody has the feeling that they dodged a bullet,” Ziegler said.   Retailers that sell back-to-school items likely felt Irene’s pinch as the storm essentially shut down malls on a weekend when parents normally shop for clothes and notebooks, not bottled water and flashlights.   “This is a major weekend of sales that were planned, but that won’t happen, in one of the most densely populated regions,” said Joel Bines, a managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners.

Sinegal will be replaced by Craig Jelinek, currently president and chief operating officer, the company said.

36,COST,Costco CEO's legacy continues as he steps down,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Jim Sinegal built a retail empire with a simple credo: don’t overcharge for anything, not even hot dogs.  Over 28 years, Sinegal turned Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) from one warehouse into a $78 billion global chain, selling everything from gasoline to diapers and big-screen TVs.  He’s now handing the CEO reins to another company veteran, Craig Jelinek, who would do well to heed Sinegal’s philosophy.  Costco keeps expenses low, everywhere from its Issaquah, Washington headquarters to stores, where shoppers who pay annual membership fees of up to $100 carry purchases out in their own bags or reused cardboard boxes.  Members paid more than $6 billion to fill up at Costco’s gas stations during fiscal 2010, but it is the $1.50 hot-dog-and-fountain-drink combo sold inside the food courts that is most emblematic of Sinegal’s business doctrine.  The price of that combo has been the same since Costco started selling hot dogs from a cart in 1985. In 2010, it sold more than $140 million worth worldwide.  “That $1.50 hot dog and drink makes them prove, every day, their value proposition,” said Patty Edwards, chief investment officer at Trutina Financial, who lives in Costco’s hometown.  “Anything in the store, the top margin it can have is 14 percent,” said Edwards. The only exception is products under Costco’s own brand, Kirkland Signature, whose margins are allowed to go a notch higher to 15 percent.  Sinegal, who started as a supermarket bagger, opened the first Costco warehouse in Seattle in 1983 with co-founder Jeff Brotman. Ten years later, Costco merged with The Price Company, known as the initiator of the warehouse club concept.  Since then, Costco has ballooned into one of the world's top 10 retailers even though it still has fewer than 600 stores. Of course, the average store is 145,000 square feet and Costco also sells items online. (Click r.reuters.com/cyp53s to see graphic on Costco sales, stock)  Sporting glasses, gray hair and a mustache, Sinegal is one of the most prominent and yet unassuming figures in American retail.  “This is Jim Sinegal, and here’s the beep,” says the message when Sinegal’s line is dialed.  Yes, he often answers his own phone, as do other long-time executives including Richard Galanti, who has been Costco’s chief financial officer since 1985.  Costco has a relatively small investor relations staff and no public relations staff.  Sinegal has groomed Galanti, Jelinek and others to hold the line on margins, reward workers with health benefits and make other decisions that some on Wall Street consider costly.  The company could raise prices, especially now as commodity costs have soared, but it tries to keep them down as long as possible, letting other retailers take the lead. Most of its membership fees have held steady since 2006.  When the cost of bananas went up earlier this year, Costco raised the price by 4 cents to 5 cents for a three-pound bunch in markets such as Chicago, only to retreat when costs fell.  This strategy has helped Costco retain members through the U.S. economic recession, though the company did see a string of monthly declines in sales at established stores from October 2008 through August 2009, after financial markets tumbled following Lehman Brothers’ collapse.  Other retailers also felt pressure as shoppers held back, and many continue to underperform Costco. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) has posted nine straight quarters of sales declines at established stores, though sales have been growing at its Sam’s Club warehouse chain.  Shares of Costco have risen nearly 40 percent in the past year, whereas Wal-Mart shares are up just 6 percent even though the world’s largest retailer enjoys a gross profit margin of close to 25 percent compared with Costco’s 10.8 percent. Shares of another competitor, BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N, have risen about 21 percent over the last year.  LONG-TIME LIEUTENANT  Sinegal plans to step down as CEO on January 1, 2012, his 76th birthday, though he will remain with the retailer for another year to help with the transition.  Those who follow Costco do not expect big changes under Jelinek, who got his start at the company as a warehouse manager in 1984 and was long seen as the next CEO once Sinegal decided to retire.  Jelinek has been Costco’s president and chief operating officer since February 2010.  “We do not think the strategic vision of the company will change,” said Credit Suisse analyst Michael Exstein. “Craig Jelinek has been the heir apparent for some time and we believe he is well equipped to continue executing the company’s vision in his new role.”  In an interview with the Seattle Times, Sinegal said his age and the fact that Costco is in good shape made January the right time to step down as CEO.  Members often recognize Sinegal when he visits stores, though he does not have quite the cult following of another West Coast CEO who recently announced he was stepping down.  “He is the most prominent CEO in terms of setting corporate culture that I can recall,” said Trutina’s Edwards, whose firm holds some Costco shares, though not as many as in the past because the stock price has gone up.  “He’s basically the retail Steve Jobs,” she said.  However, Costco shoppers have to go elsewhere for any of Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPads, iPhones or other gadgets. Sam’s Club is the exclusive warehouse chain for Apple products.  Like Jobs, who famously earned $1 a year, Sinegal has kept his own salary constant for years and relied on stock holdings in the company to increase his net worth.  Sinegal has earned $350,000 a year since fiscal 1999, and Costco’s board has often commented on how the company’s executives are underpaid.  It remains to be seen if that changes under Jelinek, though he isn’t answering his own phone.  A call to Jelinek’s office on Thursday was answered by a live person. Not Jelinek himself. Not even his recording.  ",9012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-costco/costco-ceos-legacy-continues-as-he-steps-down-idUSTRE7805VW20110901

39,COST,Retailers' August sales just miss Wall St view,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retailers reported mixed August sales results after Hurricane Irene drove away business at some chains and boosted it at others.  The final tally on Thursday, based on reports from 23 retailers, showed that sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent in August, just shy of the 4.6 percent rise analysts expected.  The results raise the possibility that certain back-to-school sales are lost for good.  Chains were evenly split between those that beat expectations and those that missed. For a graphic on same-store sales, click r.reuters.com/hep53s “You can’t be over-exuberant about it, but I think you’re seeing steady progress,” said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.  Discount stores such as BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and Target Corp (TGT.N) saw a lift in sales ahead of Hurricane Irene, as shoppers along the Atlantic coast stocked up on necessities like batteries, flashlights and bottled water.  BJ’s said same-store sales, including those of gasoline, rose 11.5 percent, blowing past the analysts’ forecast of 7.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.  Target beat analysts’ expectations of a 3.5 percent gain with a 4.1 percent increase. The company said the pre-storm rush lifted same-store sales in August by about 0.5 percentage points and would reduce them in September by a little less than that. It sees September same-store sales up at a low to mid-single-digit rate.  While “the pace of the economic recovery is uneven and uncertain,” Target had “solid results” in the back-to-school and back-to-college categories, said CEO Gregg Steinhafel.  The discounter benefited from moves such as putting dorm-sized refrigerators next to clothing in some stores.  Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), the largest U.S. warehouse club and the biggest retailer to report monthly same-store sales, posted a higher-than-expected 11 percent rise late on Wednesday.  “August was a period like many others for Costco throughout the economic recovery, showcasing an upper middle-income consumer continuing to be fully engaged in the process of saving where applicable,” Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi wrote in a research note.  Costco also said legendary co-founder Jim Sinegal plans to step down as CEO in January.  The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX was up 0.1 percent in late morning trading, in line with the wider S&P 500 .SPX.  STORM RAINS ON BACK-TO-SCHOOL  August is the peak of back-to-school shopping, the second-most important period for U.S. retailers after the year-end holiday season. Sales in recent months have held up despite weak economic indicators, offering hope for August and the rest of the year, until the hurricane disrupted shopping along the East Coast during a key weekend.  Macy’s Inc (M.N), which closed more than 100 stores for all or part of last Saturday due to Irene, said the storm shaved about 1.5 percentage points from its August same-store sales. Still, it posted a 5 percent gain, topping the analysts’ estimate of 4.5 percent.  “We expect the hurricane’s effect on sales will be substantially offset as we move through September and the third quarter,” said Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren.  J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) both missed August same-store sales estimates and blamed the storm.  TJX, the operator of the off-price TJ Maxx chain, reported a 1 percent same-store sales gain, below the 2 percent forecast. Following Irene, it said business rebounded solidly early in the September reporting period, leaving it comfortable with its quarterly sales and earnings forecasts.  Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), whose sales also came in lower than expected, blamed weak traffic and its stores and said it would focus more on pricing this fall to “reverse this trend.”  The monthly sales tally speaks to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Still, major retailers that saw brisk storm-related business, such as grocers, Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), do not report monthly results.  The storm’s full sales impact will not be known until September’s monthly report, since many retailers’ August reporting periods ended on Saturday.

U.S. chain stores are expected to post a 4.6 percent gain in August sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, based on analysts’ expectations of sales at 25 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters.

Sales in recent months have held up despite weak economic indicators, offering hope of consumer resiliency in August and the rest of the year.   “If August continues as June and July did, I think that could bode well for a solid (year-end) holiday. I’m not saying that we’re going to have a blow-out holiday, but a solid holiday,” said Madison Riley, managing director of retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon.   The holiday shopping season, which traditionally starts the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, can make up as much as 40 percent of a retailer’s annual revenue.   Graphic on same-store sales: r.reuters.com/juz43s  IRENE HITS BACK-TO-SCHOOL SALES   Hurricane Irene, which hit a wide area from North Carolina up to Vermont, essentially shut down malls during the last weekend of August, hurting sales of traditional back-to-school items like clothes, shoes and electronics.   Macy’s Inc (M.N) and J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) were among the many chains forced to shut stores in the New York area.   “The storm’s impact is clearly a wild card heading into Thursday’s reports,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.   Apparel retailers are expected to show the smallest sales gains in August, according to Thomson Reuters data. A glut of unsold merchandise could lead retailers to offer discounts to clear it, which could hurt quarterly profit margins.   By contrast, discount chains and drugstores are expected to show the biggest increases, helped by hurricane-related sales of things like batteries and bottled water. Walgreen Co WAG.N, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, will not report its monthly tally until next week, leaving investors to wait and see just how well that sector did.   The storm’s full impact on monthly sales will not be felt until September’s monthly report, since many retailers’ August reporting periods ended on Saturday.

42,COST,UPDATE 3-Costco CEO to step down in 2012; COO to take over," * CEO change effective Jan. 1, 2012   * President and COO to take reins   * August same-store sales up 11 percent; tops estimates  (Adds new CEO details, company description, rivals, byline)   By Dhanya Skariachan   NEW YORK, Aug. 31 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) said its co-founder and CEO, Jim Sinegal, has decided to step down as chief executive of the largest U.S. warehouse club, effective Jan. 1.   Sinegal, who has been a director since the company was formed and will turn 76 next year, will be replaced by President and Chief Operating Officer Craig Jelinek, Costco said on Wednesday.   In an interview with the Seattle Times, Sinegal said his age and the fact that Costco is in good shape made January the right time to step down as CEO.   Sinegal will remain with the retailer through January 2013 to help Jelinek during the transition. He also will continue to serve on Costco’s board and stand for reelection at the January 2012 annual meeting.   Jelinek started as a warehouse manager in Costco in 1984 and assumed the position of president, COO and director in February last year.   Costco, which sells products from paper towels to diamond necklaces at a discount to its members, reported an 11 percent rise in August same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, helped by rising gasoline prices and currency benefits.   On that basis, analysts were expecting a 9.3 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Warehouse clubs Costco, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N have benefited as members fill up their gas tanks at below-market prices at pumps operated by the clubs and often head inside to shop.

43,COST,Ex-Petters execs must face Ponzi claims lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former executives who worked for convicted Ponzi scheme operator Thomas Petters can be sued by an investment firm victimized in his $3.65 billion fraud, a federal appeals court ruled.  The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Paul, Minnesota on Tuesday revived a civil racketeering and fraud lawsuit against Mary Jeffries, who was president of Petters Group Worldwide Inc, and Camille Chee-Awai, who was chief executive of its Petters Capital LLC unit.  Ritchie Capital Management LLC, a private equity and asset management firm, had accused the defendants of conspiring with Petters to fraudulently extract more than $100 million of loans.  It said the defendants had represented that the money would be secured by assets of camera company Polaroid Corp, which Petters owned and where Jeffries was also chief executive.  A federal judge in Minneapolis had dismissed Ritchie’s case in 2010, citing a bankruptcy court ban on new lawsuits that interfered with the assets or documents of Petters’ companies, which had been put in receivership.  But Judge Kermit Bye wrote for the 8th Circuit that the ban was not meant to cover the lawsuit by Ritchie against other defendants it believed were actively involved in the fraud.  It would “drastically expand the scope of the anti-suit injunction” to cover lawsuits that required the interpretation of documents possessed by companies in receivership, Bye wrote. “We think such interpretation goes too far.”  Petters, 54, was sentenced to 50 years in prison in April 2010 after a St. Paul federal jury convicted him the prior December on all 20 criminal counts he faced, in one of the biggest Ponzi schemes on record. His appeal of his conviction and sentence is pending before the 8th Circuit.  Prosecutors said Petters bilked investors who thought he was using their money to buy consumer electronics for resale to retailers such as BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp.  Andrew Birrell, a lawyer for Jeffries, and Terrence Canade, a lawyer for Chee-Awai, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

45,COST,U.S. expands E. coli ban in beef; consumers cheer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The government will test for six more strains of E. coli bacteria in raw beef, officials announced on Tuesday, a step sought by consumer groups but opposed by the cost-conscious meat industry.  Inspectors in March will begin testing beef trim for the  “Big Six” bacteria strains that have caused thousands of sicknesses each year, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters.  Consumer groups have called for the six strains to be named adulterants alongside the single strain now banned, E. coli 0157:H7. That strain was barred from foods in the 1990s after an outbreak at a fast-food hamburger chain.  The Agriculture Department believes non-0157 strains are responsible for more than 112,000 illnesses per year, with more than 36,000 attributable to beef, Vilsack said.  “One of the reasons we’re doing this is because these pathogens can survive ordinary cooking,” he told reporters. “The reason why there’s a focus on food safety is because it saves lives, it saves medical expenses and it keeps people productive.”  The American Meat Institute and other industry groups said the measures impose additional costs on beef producers, which could lead to higher beef prices for consumers.  Tyson Foods spokesman Gary Mickelson said the world’s largest meat producer already has multiple measures in place that prevent various forms of E. coli.  “Tyson has a comprehensive testing program in place for O157:H7,” Mickelson said. “We’ll be working with our trade associations to review and comment on the USDA’s proposed directive, which we currently believe will be much more costly to implement than the government is projecting.”  Consumer and food-safety groups have long argued E. coli 026, 0111, 045, 0121, 0103 and 0145 should be treated the same as the more notorious 0157:H7.  Representative Rosa DeLauro, an early proponent of food safety reforms enacted this year, wrote to Obama administration officials this summer calling for the strains to be barred.  Tanya Roberts, chairman of the board at the Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention, said the USDA will have the power to remove “contaminated products out of the food chain, out of restaurants and grocery stores, and off our plates at minimal cost...this is not only good for public health but it is also good for business.”  Vilsack said some food companies were already testing for E. coli strains for that reason.  Costco Wholesale requires that some suppliers test for several forms of the bacteria, he said.

47,COST,Kleenex hopes cooling tissue will heat up sales,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kleenex is hoping that consumers will pay significantly more per tissue to soothe their noses with coconut oil, aloe extract and ingredients often used in anti-aging creams.  The patent-protected Kleenex Cool Touch tissues cost about 65 percent more than other premium Kleenex tissues, but Kleenex owner Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) thinks that consumers will be willing to pay extra, despite an economy that may be bordering on a double-dip recession.  Kleenex, which debuted in the 1920s, is a big business for Kimberly-Clark and one that is gaining market share even though shoppers have traded down to store branded goods in other categories such as paper towels and food.  Now, Kleenex hopes that despite the difficult economic climate, U.S. households will buy more than the average five boxes of tissues they purchase each year. A lot of that buying comes during the fall and winter, when cold and flu rates soar.  Kleenex Cool Touch tissues feel thicker than traditional tissues and react with body temperature to send a cooling sensation to people’s noses. They also cost a lot more than regular Kleenex.  “Consumers are willing to pay a premium for what they perceive to be a value-added benefit,” Craig Smith, Kleenex brand director, said in an interview.  In Kleenex’s research, shoppers were even willing to pay more than the price the company set for the new tissues, said Tracy Buelow, Kleenex senior brand manager.  Kleenex Cool Touch have a suggested price of $2.19 for a box of 50, or 4.38 cents per tissue, though initial prices will likely be lower to get people to try them. Kleenex lotion and ultra soft tissues, two other high-end varieties, go for $1.99 for a box of 75 tissues, or roughly 2.65 cents per tissue.  “Innovation has to come without the price, that’s the problem that we have in this environment,” said RBC Capital Markets household products analyst Jason Gere, who has an “outperform” rating on Kimberly-Clark.  “As long as the sticker price seems more in line with some of the other products out there it should do OK,” Gere said, referring to the price per box, not per tissue.  Tissues are one category where store branded products have had less of an impact. Different varieties of Kleenex rang up more than $461 million in U.S. sales during the 52 weeks ended on August 7, excluding sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and wholesale chains such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), according to data from Chicago-based SymphonyIRI Group. While sales of Kleenex increased, sales of private label tissues fell, according to the firm’s data.  Kimberly-Clark said Kleenex gained 2 percentage points of market share in North America during the second quarter. Puffs, from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), are a distant No. 2 player in the category.  “If you have a consumer who wants the lotion and all of that stuff they’re going to stick with a brand, whether it’s Kleenex or Puffs,” said Gere.  While Kimberly-Clark appears comfortable with its Kleenex pricing strategy for now, the company is keeping an eye on prices for northern bleached softwood kraft, a benchmark for pulp paper prices in the industry. The company is cutting costs to help offset the higher material costs it faces and is raising some prices.  Kimberly-Clark is basing expectations for the year on the price of pulp staying between $1,000 and $1,020 per metric ton, versus $970 in the first quarter and $1,030 in the second quarter, Chief Executive Tom Falk said during a July conference call.

49,COST,No class action for now in Costco gender bias case,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp won a court decision that blocks women who accused the company of gender bias from suing as a group, but the court left open the possibility that the case could regain class-action status.  The case involved about 600 current and former female Costco workers who said the largest U.S. warehouse club chain made it harder for them to be promoted to general manager or assistant general manager, in part because it failed to post job openings.  Citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a lower court judge applied the wrong legal standard, having failed to decide whether there was enough in common among the women’s claims.  But the appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San Francisco to decide whether she could still certify a class, and whether the plaintiffs can seek back pay and punitive damages.  In its June 20 ruling in Wal-Mart Stores Inc v. Dukes, a divided Supreme Court had thrown out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of as many 1.5 million female workers who claimed that retailer gave them lower pay and fewer promotions than men.  Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit, Judge N. Randy Smith said that ruling requires Patel to now “determine whether there was significant proof that Costco operated under a general policy of discrimination.”  Smith nonetheless rejected what he said seemed to be Costco’s argument that the “rigorous analysis” required in the Wal-Mart case include an “in-depth” examination of the merits of the Costco plaintiffs’ case. “To hold otherwise would turn class certification into a mini-trial,” he wrote.  Denying class-action status can result in higher costs and lower recoveries, and cause some plaintiffs with smaller or weaker claims to drop their cases altogether.  The Costco lawsuit began in 2004. Patel in 2007 granted class-action status for the three named plaintiffs and others. The case was put on hold pending the Wal-Mart ruling.  Jocelyn Larkin, executive director of The Impact Fund, which handled the case for the women plaintiffs, said “we are absolutely delighted” with the 9th Circuit decision.  “The district court had found that Costco had a common process for promotions, and statistical evidence that this adversely affected women — sufficient for certification,” she said. “Costco did not get the outcome it wanted, a finding that we would be unable under any circumstances to get the class certified.”  Joel Benoliel, Costco’s chief legal officer, said: “We are extremely gratified that our major points in the case have been vindicated, and it’s clear the court has shut the door on a nationwide class.

51,COST,Southern California union takes major step toward strike,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The union representing many of the 62,000 workers at Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons supermarkets in southern California issued a required 72-hour notice of its plan to cancel its extended contract, a move that could pave the way for a strike.  The union and the supermarkets are at an impasse over healthcare coverage. Employees, who have been without a contract since it expired in March, have given the union the go-ahead to call a strike if an acceptable deal for a new contract cannot be reached.  In 2003, southern California played host to the longest work stoppage in the history of the U.S. grocery industry. That bitter, four-and-a-half-month standoff shifted more than $1 billion in sales, and the loyalty of some shoppers, to competitors.  “We’re ready to fight to preserve good jobs,” said Rick Icaza, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770, the largest of the seven union locals representing the Southern California supermarket workers.  The union accused the supermarkets of “stonewalling,” being  “unwilling to compromise” and squeezing workers who live paycheck to paycheck.  “We don’t want to strike, but if they won’t negotiate, we have no choice,” Icaza said.  Kroger Co owns Ralphs, Safeway Inc owns Vons and Supervalu is the parent of Albertsons.  “We are disappointed that union leadership decided to take this step,” Supervalu spokesman Jeff Swanson told Reuters.  Swanson, speaking on behalf of Supervalu, said the two sides are still in “active negotiations and have made progress during our talks this past week and a half.”  “We don’t want a strike, and we hope to continue bargaining rather than continue to alarm our associates and our customers,” Swanson said.  Representatives from Safeway and Kroger were not immediately available for comment. The three supermarket companies are negotiating as a group.  The union said grocery workers will begin final strike preparations following the 72-hour notice to cancel the contract.  Canceling the contract does not mean grocery workers will walk out in 72 hours.  After the contract is no longer in force, the union has the option to call a strike at any time. A nullified contract also would give supermarket owners the choice to lock out union workers.  LOSE-LOSE?  Southern California workers and management side-stepped a strike in 2007, but the threat of another stoppage has anxieties running high in what many experts see as one of the most competitive grocery markets in the United States.  Unionized supermarkets like Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons have seen their Southern California market share shrink over the last few decades, contributing to a decline in the number of union retail workers.  At the same time, non-union rivals including Hispanic supermarkets, dollar stores and big players like Wal-Mart, Costco and Whole Foods Market have been on the rise.  Persistent unemployment and the weak economy have been hard on supermarkets, which operate on razor thin margins.  While Kroger has outperformed Safeway and Supervalu, analysts said supermarket profits are not growing.  “I don’t think the strike is in either party’s interest,” said Walter Stackow, senior research analyst at Manning & Napier, which holds shares in Kroger and Supervalu.

53,COST,"SoCal grocers, union avert strike with deal","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Albertsons, Ralphs and Vons and the union representing their Southern California supermarket employees reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract on Monday, averting a threatened strike.  Negotiators for the United Food and Commercial Workers union said the new contract, which must be approved by union members, will cover 62,000 union supermarket workers in Southern California when it is ratified.  “The agreement increases wages, protects health care and pension benefits throughout the life of the three-year contract,” UFCW said in a statement.  The deal came after a negotiating session lasting more than 24 hours. Specific details were not released.  Southern California is one of the most competitive food retailing markets in the United States. Many analyst see the region as a trend-setter for the rest of the industry.  Parties to the latest talks were involved in a bitter 141-day strike in Southern California that spanned 2003 and 2004. It was the longest work stoppage in the history of the U.S. grocery industry, costing an estimated $1.5 billion in lost sales to competitors and permanently shifting the loyalties of some shoppers.  Since that time, nonunion food sellers ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Target Corp have been chipping away at their overall market share. At the same time niche players, ranging from upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc to ethnic chains and even dollar stores, have taken a bite.  “We are pleased to have reached a tentative settlement agreement with the union that continues to preserve good wages, secure pensions and access to quality, affordable health care - while allowing us to be competitive in the marketplace,” the grocers said in a joint statement on Monday.  Analysts said both sides had something to lose in the event of a strike. That’s because such standoffs can accelerate store closures, contribute to market share losses and ultimately reduce the number of union jobs.  “The contract is probably mutual pain and compromise,” BB&T Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf told Reuters.  The shares in Kroger Co, which operates Ralphs stores, closed up 0.04 percent at $22.38 amid a broader market sell-off prompted by European debt fears.  Vons owner Safeway Inc finished down almost 0.2 percent at $17.67.  Albertsons parent Supervalu Inc saw its volatile shares fall 3.5 percent to close at $7.42. Supervalu — which has been cutting workers, closing stores, selling assets and paying down debt — has lagged many of its rivals in recent years and could least afford a strike.  The UFCW, frustrated over unproductive negotiations on wages and healthcare, increased pressure on the supermarkets when it canceled its extended contract, effective Sunday night. That action opened the door for it to call a strike and sparked intense negotiations.

55,COST,UPDATE 1-U.S. pharmacy customers less patient - J.D. Power," * Good Neighbor, Target, Publix top pharmacy survey   * Kaiser Permanente again ranks as top mail-order firm   * Customers more satisfied when wait times shorter  (Adds J.D. Power comments, additional rankings)   By Jessica Wohl   Sept 20 (Reuters) - Patients filling prescriptions have become a lot less patient.   Customers who wait less than three minutes to give their prescription information to someone at a chain drugstore have a higher level of satisfaction than those who have to wait longer, according to the J.D. Power and Associates 2011 U.S. National Pharmacy Study released on Tuesday.   In 2010, satisfaction did not significantly fall until after seven minutes, the company said.   J.D. Power measured customer satisfaction with store pharmacies and mail-order companies. Supermarkets had the highest average ranking, followed by drugstores, mail-order pharmacies and mass merchandise stores.   “Having the lowest cost doesn’t always equate with the highest customer satisfaction,” said Rick Millard, senior director of J.D. Power and Associates’ healthcare practice.   Retailers have promoted their pharmacies more heavily in recent years as they try to get customers to visit more often, and to buy other items when they come in to drop off or pick up prescriptions. Grocery stores, warehouse clubs and traditional drugstores offer services such as flu shots and health screenings as well.   The biggest improvement across all categories came from Duane Reade, the New York-based drugstore chain Walgreen bought in 2010. Its ranking went up 36 points to a score of 724 out of a possible 1,000.   “It’s interesting that it didn’t go down, which is sort of what the conventional wisdom is” after a company is acquired, Millard said.   Among drugstore chains, two smaller companies, Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Health Mart, tied for the highest ranking, with a score of 851. The Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy came in third, followed by Walgreen Co WAG.N, Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) stores.   Among supermarkets, privately held Publix came in first for the second straight year, with a score of 867, followed by another private chain, Wegmans. Both chains typically rank high in customer-satisfaction surveys. Winn-Dixie Stores Inc WINN.O ranked third.   For mail-order pharmacies, overall satisfaction fell from 2010, due mainly to lower satisfaction in prescription ordering and delivery.   Still, fewer customers said they would switch to buying their medications in a store instead of through a mail-order service, possibly because they find going to a store less convenient or because their insurance providers require them to use a mail-order service for certain prescriptions.   Kaiser Permanente Pharmacy was the top-ranked mail-order pharmacy for the third year in a row, with 848 points, followed by Humana Inc’s (HUM.N) RightSourceRx and Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O). Caremark Mail Service, part of CVS, came in sixth.   Target Corp (TGT.N) was the highest-ranked mass merchandise store for the fifth year in a row, with a score of 846. Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) Sam’s Club was second, followed by Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O).  The study was based on responses from more than 12,300 customers who filled a new prescription or refilled a prescription during the three months prior to the survey, which was fielded during May and June.   The Department of Veterans Affairs had a higher score, 876, than any company in any of the four categories. However, it was excluded from the official survey rankings since it is only open to U.S. military veterans and their families.   J.D. Power is a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos Inc MHP.N.

September is a particularly important time for retailers focused on children’s and young adult apparel. Back-to-school shopping is the second-largest retail spending season behind the holiday period of November and December.   Retailers were upbeat earlier in the year as shoppers were eager to spend again. Now, as stores fill their aisles with Christmas trees and other winter items, lingering fears about the economy have been exacerbated by the stock market’s worst quarter since the depths of the 2008 credit crisis.   A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that analysts expect the 23 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Macy’s Inc (M.N) — to report a 4.6 percent increase in September sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales.   The tally highlights a small percentage of shopping at U.S. chains, as it does not include major stores such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Home Depot Inc (HD.N) or Kroger Co (KR.N). BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc, which was just taken private, was removed from the index.   The stock market’s steep decline affects shoppers’ habits, particularly those with higher incomes who shop at chains such as Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Saks Inc SKS.N, experts say.   “Whether or not you still have the ability to buy something, psychologically it impacts you and it makes you think twice about whether or not you really need to buy something,” said Al Ferrara, national director of the retail and consumer product practice at BDO USA.

Irene continued to have a bit of impact into September. The storm hit part of the country on Sunday, Aug. 28, during retailers’ September period, noted Nomura Equity Research analyst Paul Lejuez.

Limited itself forecast a low-single digit increase, and the average analysts’ forecast is 4.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.   Along with Limited, Davis expects sales and margins to expand at Saks and TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) as all three have compelling and differentiated merchandise and well-managed inventories.   Lejuez said that he also likes Limited and TJX, as well as Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O). He expects TJX and Ross to raise their forecasts this month.   September sales may also be a bit propped up as retailers have raised prices to mitigate the higher cost of cotton and other materials, making sales in dollar terms look better than sales in unit terms, BDO’s Ferrara noted.   The typical lull seen in October and November is “likely to be even more pronounced this year given the macro backdrop, putting sales and margins at risk,” Nomura’s Lejuez said in a note.   Analysts are not expecting much improvement at Gap Inc (GPS.N), where September same-store sales are expected to fall 3.7 percent after a 6 percent drop in August.   The biggest gain is expected at Costco, which caters to higher-income families and owners of small businesses. Its same-store sales are expected to rise 10.1 percent, aided by U.S. sales of discounted gasoline and by its international stores.

61,COST,Top U.S. Mexican dining chain files for bankruptcy,"(Reuters) - The leading Mexican restaurant operator in the United States filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and put its El Torito, Chevys Fresh Mex and Acapulco Mexican Restaurant chains up for sale.  Real Mex Restaurants Inc REALM.UL said in documents filed in Delaware’s bankruptcy court that it would soon run out of money. The company said it was suffering from a sluggish economy, high lease and debt obligations and sharp increases in food costs.  An affiliate of Sun Capital Partners Inc holds the largest stake in the company, which operates or franchises more than 200 restaurants, mostly in California.  Several other restaurant and food companies have struggled as food costs have risen and the U.S. economy has limped out of a deep recession, with prepared food maker Chef Solutions Holdings LLC also seeking bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.  Restaurant chains including Perkins & Marie Callender’s Inc, Sbarro Inc, Fuddruckers and Charlie Brown’s Steakhouse have recently filed for bankruptcy, as did chicken producer Allen Family Foods Inc.  Friendly’s, another Sun Capital investment, is also reported to be preparing to file for bankruptcy.  Sun Capital did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  Real Mex said it had assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million, according to a court filing.  The Cypress, California-based company traces its roots back to the first El Torito restaurant which opened in 1954 in Encino, California.  The company has been hard hit by the housing market crash and economic slump in California. Annual revenue has dropped from $553 million in 2008 to $478 million last year.  The company said it plans to market and sell itself over the next three months. While it did not name an initial, or stalking horse, bidder, as bankrupt companies often do, it said it could sell the business to holders of its second-lien notes.  Those creditors include Tennenbaum Capital Partners, Credit Suisse Asset Management and JPMorgan Investment Management Inc, according to court documents.  Real Mex said in court documents it was down to its final $1 million in cash. The company planned to ask Delaware’s bankruptcy court for approval of a $49 million bankruptcy loan, or DIP loan, from General Electric Co’s (GE.N) GE Capital to pay employees and other costs while in bankruptcy.  A source close to the negotiations said Z Capital, a major holder of an unsecured loan to the company, was preparing to ask the court to approve its competing bankruptcy loan — a rather unusual request in a bankruptcy.  A hearing to consider the bankruptcy loan and other so-called first day motions is scheduled for Wednesday, according to a company spokesman.  Chef Solutions also filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday in Delaware. The company’s Orval Kent business is the second-largest maker in North American of prepared food, according to court documents.  The company provides side dishes and deli salads for retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Trader Joe’s and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), but was pinched between rising costs and weak demand.  Chef Solutions was purchased from Lufthansa in 2004 by funds associated with Questor Management Co, a firm founded by turnaround guru Jay Alix of AlixPartners and investment banker Dan Lufkin of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.  Questor declined to comment.  In its bankruptcy, Chef Solutions proposed a quick sale to a venture formed by Mistral Capital Management LLC and Reser’s Fine Foods Inc, which makes salads and side dishes.  The two would bid about $62 million in a mixture of cash and debts owed to Mistral as a creditor to Chef Solutions and cash. The pair also agreed to assume some liabilities.  The proposed sale is subject to higher offers and must be approved by the bankruptcy court. The money raised will help pay off Chef Solutions debts.  The company estimated its assets and debts at between $100 million and $500 million.  The cases are In re: Real Mex Restaurants Inc, Case No. 11-13122, and In re: Chef Solutions Holdings LLC, Case No. 11-13139, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware.

63,COST,"PREVIEW-September likely solid, not stellar, for US chains"," * September retail sales due Wednesday and Thursday   * Same-store sales rise of 4.7 pct seen - Thomson Reuters   * Discounters likely outpaced other sectors   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Shoppers hunting for back-to-school deals gave a nice boost to U.S. discount chains in September, though the rocky stock market and economic malaise may have curbed some people’s desire to spend more.   September is a particularly important time for retailers focused on children’s and young adult apparel. Back-to-school shopping is the second-largest retail spending season behind the holiday period of November and December.   Retailers were upbeat earlier in the year as shoppers were eager to spend again. Now, as stores fill their aisles with Christmas trees and other winter items, lingering fears about the economy have been exacerbated by the stock market’s worst quarter since the depths of the 2008 credit crisis.   A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that analysts expect the 24 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Macy’s Inc (M.N) — to report a 4.7 percent increase in September sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales.   The tally highlights a small percentage of shopping at U.S. chains, as it does not include major stores such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Home Depot Inc (HD.N) or Kroger Co (KR.N).   The stock market’s steep decline affects shoppers’ habits, particularly those with higher incomes who shop at chains such as Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Saks Inc SKS.N, experts say.   “Whether or not you still have the ability to buy something, psychologically it impacts you and it makes you think twice about whether or not you really need to buy something,” said Al Ferrara, national director of the retail and consumer product practice at BDO USA.   U.S. consumer sentiment improved late in the month, though worries remained about jobs and finances, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s final September reading. [ID:nS1E78T0KY]   Same-store sales rose 4.4 percent in September, according to data released by the Johnson Redbook Retail Sales Index on Tuesday. That index measures a sample of large general merchandise retailers. [ID:nN9E7K900I]   Click here for a same-store sales graphic: link.reuters.com/baw24s  September’s expected increase will come after a 4.4 percent rise seen at 23 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters in August, when Hurricane Irene crimped some spending on apparel as shoppers on the U.S. East Coast stocked up on storm supplies.   Irene continued to have a bit of impact into September. The storm hit part of the country on Sunday, Aug. 28, during retailers’ September period, noted Nomura Equity Research analyst Paul Lejuez.   Even if September is good, Lejuez said he would not be optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.   One potential star was Limited Brands Inc LTD.N, said   Lazard Capital Markets analyst Jennifer Davis.   She expects that same-store sales at Limited — which runs the Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and La Senza chains — rose 5 percent. Limited itself forecast a low-single digit increase, and the average analysts’ forecast is 4.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.   Along with Limited, Davis expects sales and margins to expand at Saks and TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) as all three have compelling and differentiated merchandise and well-managed inventories.   Lejuez said that he also likes Limited and TJX, as well as Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O). He expects TJX and Ross to raise their forecasts this month.   September sales may also be a bit propped up as retailers have raised prices to mitigate the higher cost of cotton and other materials, making sales in dollar terms look better than sales in unit terms, BDO’s Ferrara noted.   The typical lull seen in October and November is “likely to be even more pronounced this year given the macro backdrop, putting sales and margins at risk,” Nomura’s Lejuez said in a note.   Analysts are not expecting much improvement at Gap Inc (GPS.N), where September same-store sales are expected to fall 3.7 percent after a 6 percent drop in August.   The biggest gain is expected at Costco, which caters to higher-income families and owners of small businesses. Its same-store sales are expected to rise 10 percent, aided by U.S. sales of discounted gasoline and by its international stores.

European finance ministers expressed a new sense of urgency about the region’s financial crisis and appeared ready to prepare a plan to recapitalize banks. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L51U3]   The move higher followed a late rally on Tuesday after European Union officials said they would act to safeguard banks.   The deepening debt crisis in Europe has been among the biggest stock market pressures, along with signs a recovery in the already weak U.S. economy was stalling.   “It was very clear that sentiment was extremely weak and needed some support, and they found support in news that EU officials were looking for ways to recapitalize the banks,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York.   At the same time, Wednesday’s U.S. data “doesn’t suggest ... that more selling is called for at this point.”   The U.S. private sector added 91,000 jobs in September, according to the ADP National Employment Report, topping forecasts and increasing optimism about Friday’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department. [ID:nN1E794098]   The Institute for Supply Management said the U.S. economy’s services sector expanded in September, slightly faster than forecast by a Reuters poll. [ID:nN1E79407S]   Materials, energy and industrials, sectors tied to economic growth, were the top-performing stocks. The S&P materials index .GSPM gained 2 percent.   The Nasdaq outperformed the other two major indexes, led by gains in Research in Motion Ltd RIMM.O, up 13.7 percent at $23.87 on speculation the BlackBerry maker could be acquired.   The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 88.33 points, or 0.82 percent, at 10,897.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 13.48 points, or 1.20 percent, at 1,137.43. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 46.31 points, or 1.93 percent, at 2,451.13.   Over the last six sessions, the S&P has fallen 10 percent, and on Tuesday it fell into bear market territory, marking a 20-percent drop from its recent high.   In that fall, the S&P 500 broke support at 1,120 but held above that level on Wednesday.   But investors who bet against the market were forced to cover short positions as equities rallied strongly late in the day.   “It seems unlikely that we’ve reached an ultimate bottom here, and so we’re fairly defensively positioned,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.   On the downside were shares of warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), which fell 2.5 percent to $79.64. It reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that missed expectations.   Volume in early afternoon trading was 5.2 billion, with advancers beating decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by about four to three, while on the Nasdaq winners topped losers by about 13 to 10.

Early trading was choppy as the market struggled for firm direction after a dramatic turnaround late on Tuesday in which shares ended sharply higher on reports European officials would act to safeguard banks.   Over six sessions, the S&P has fallen 10 percent and investors who bet against the market were suddenly forced to cover short positions as the market shifted.   “All measures we look at indicate that the market is extremely cheap, but we’re all still waiting on developments from Europe,” said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer of Advisers Capital Management, LLC in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. “There remain questions about how it will all be resolved, and it is by no means certain that the resolution will come in a responsible way that won’t cause market turmoil.”   The S&P briefly dipped into bear market territory on Tuesday, meaning the index declined 20 percent from recent highs.   Big reversals late in a session are not often good predictors of direction. Since 2001, there have been nine days when the market rebounded from a 1 percent loss in the last hour — and in eight of those, stocks fell the next day, according to Bespoke Investment Group of Harrison, New York.   U.S. private-sector employers added 91,000 jobs in September, according to the ADP National Employment Report, topping forecasts and increasing optimism about Friday’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department. For details, see [ID:nN1E794098]   “This is obviously better than expected, but the correlation between this and payrolls has been weak so I don’t think anyone will get overly excited yet,” Lieberman said.   A report from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. services sector expanded slightly more than expected in September.   The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 5.41 points, or 0.05 percent, at 10,803.30. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was down 0.24 point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,123.71.

66,COST,Costco raises membership fees; profit misses view,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) is increasing annual membership fees by 10 percent for 22 million members, a long-awaited move that pleased analysts even as fourth-quarter profit missed forecasts.  The largest U.S. warehouse club operator sells products from paper towels to televisions at a discount to its members, who pay annual membership fees.  Before Wednesday’s announcement of fee increases, which take effect November 1 for most U.S. and Canadian members, Costco had not raised its main fees since 2006.  “I think Costco was very reluctant to take a membership fee increase, which is essentially inflation of the membership fee, when their core customer was already dealing with a lot of inflation,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan.  Now that some higher costs, such as cotton, food and gasoline, have subsided, it may have seemed like more of an appropriate time for the increase, he said.  At the same time, Costco waited until this year to raise its regular $50 membership fee to $55, as the new higher rate is not taxable for residents of California. Previously, the tax-free limit had been $50.  For the fourth quarter that ended on August 28, net income was $478 million, or $1.08 a share, up from $432 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected $1.10 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Shares of the Issaquah, Washington-based company fell 2.1 percent to $79.90 in early trading on Nasdaq.  The earnings miss was due in part to an inventory charge stemming from inflation. As Costco’s product costs rose for items such as food and clothing, it took an inventory charge of $32 million, or 4 cents per share, in the quarter.  The company took a total of 12 cents per share in such charges during fiscal 2011, after no such charges in 2010.  September sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 12 percent including fuel. Analysts, on average, had expected a 10.1 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters.  Costco’s September sales are “another data point that suggests despite all of the negative macro headlines, there’s not a lot of empirical evidence from the retailers yet that the U.S. consumer is slowing,” said McGranahan, who has a “market perform” rating on the shares.  Not all retailers are faring as well. September sales at top U.S. drugstore Walgreen Co WAG.N rose less than expected. [ID:nN1E7940AE] Several other U.S. chains will report September sales later on Wednesday and on Thursday. [ID:nN1E7931SX]  Costco’s membership fee increase follows a similar move by competitor BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc, which just went private. BJ’s raised its membership fee by $5 to $50 in January.  Costco’s U.S. and Canadian household and business memberships will cost $55 a year, up from $50 for most of those memberships.  Executive members, who receive rewards such as an annual rebate check to use in the store based on what they spend, will now pay $110, up from $100.  The fee increases affect a little more than 22 million members, roughly half of whom are executive members. Costco has roughly 35 million members overall.  While the increased fees could add 20 cents to 25 cents to earnings per share over the next two years as memberships are renewed, Janney analyst David Strasser expects roughly half of the fee increase will be used to hold down prices.  Membership fee revenue rose 10.7 percent to $590 million in the fourth quarter.  Costco previously reported that fourth-quarter sales rose 17 percent to $27.6 billion. Excluding inflation in gas prices and stronger foreign currencies, same-store sales rose 7 percent in the quarter.

72,COST,September likely good enough for most U.S. chains,"   * Same-store sales rise of 4.6 pct seen -Thomson Reuters   * Costco’s sales better than expected, Walgreen’s weaker   * Zumiez blows past expectations, raises guidance   By Jessica Wohl   Oct 6 (Reuters) - Bargain hunters helped retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) post strong September sales even as the stock market tumbled and consumer sentiment sagged.   Overall, U.S. retailers that report monthly sales are expected to post an average gain of 4.6 percent in sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters.   Retailers are doing what they can to appeal to shoppers such as Joanna Polowitz, who said that she lost her job a month ago and thinks that the economy is getting worse.   “I’m definitely holding back, only buying necessities, socks for my son, food because it’s reasonable here,” Polowitz said as she shopped at a Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey on Wednesday. “We’re buckling down, not going to dinner as much.” Most of the 23 retailers that still report monthly sales — chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) have abandoned the practice — issue their reports on Thursday.   Wednesday’s results were a mixed bag.   Costco, the largest warehouse chain, saw same-store sales, rise 12 percent in September, topping analysts’ forecast for 10.1 percent rise. [ID:nL3E7L517B]   And Zumiez Inc (ZUMZ.O), which sells clothing and equipment for sports such as skating and snowboarding, posted a 10.1 percent rise in same-store sales, while analysts were looking for just a 3.2 percent increase, and raised its profit forecast. [ID:nASA02WTM]   Walgreen Co’s WAG.N sales rose less than expected, due in part to a slower start to the flu season. [ID:nN1E7940AE]   The U.S. consumer in September “showed resilience in spite of all the troubling economic news,” but higher gasoline prices than a year earlier are still a factor, said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse.   McNamara and others noted that Hurricane Irene, which battered the U.S. East Coast at the end of August, may have shifted some spending in September to home improvement.   Chains including Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) and Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), which sell generators and other storm-related items, do not report monthly sales.   September is a particularly important time for retailers focused on children’s and young adult apparel. Back-to-school shopping is the second-largest retail spending season behind the holiday period of November and December.   Same-store sales rose 4.4 percent in September, according to data released by the Johnson Redbook Retail Sales Index on Tuesday. That index measures a sample of large general merchandise retailers.

With its $8.9 million contribution recorded on Monday, the largest U.S. warehouse club operator has put $22.5 million in cash and in-kind contributions toward the campaign for the measure, spokeswoman Lori Anderson said. The measure will be on next month’s ballot and will ask voters to allow retailers to sell liquor, now available only through 166 state-operated stores. Voters last year rejected another measure that aimed to break up the state’s monopoly on liquor sales.

74,COST,UPDATE 1-PREVIEW-US chain store sales seen up again in October,"* October U.S. chain sales due Wednesday/Thursday * Same-store sales rise of 4.5 pct seen-Thomson Reuters * Consumers spending, but still looking for deals By Phil Wahba Nov 1 (Reuters) - October sales reports this week will show steady spending by U.S. consumers, according to Thomson Reuters’ same-store sales index, as improving finances for many shoppers helped overcome a barrage of scary headlines about the economy. October can be a slow month, falling into the lull between the back-to-school season and the start to year-end holiday shopping. But it does give retailers a read into the shoppers’ mindset and intentions ahead of the Christmas blitz. A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that Wall Street analysts expect the 23 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp and Macy’s Inc  — to report a 4.5 percent increase in October same-store sales, or at stores open at least a year, well above the 1.6 percent increase in October 2010. Most of the chains will report monthly sales on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. “The consumer is out there spending,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. “Consumers are financially healthier now than they’ve been in years.” His preliminary estimate is that same-store sales rose 4.4 percent. Shoppers have paid down enough personal debt since the recession ended that those with jobs feel comfortable spending more and are doing just that, said Johnson, who last week forecast the best holiday season since 2004. But they are not spending with the reckless abandon of a few years ago and insist on good deals if they are to spend. “As has been the case for the past year, there will be a focus on value. Shoppers will be lured to specific promotions, especially for mid-tier retailers,” said Paul Lejuez, a Nomura analyst. Department stores should continue to show solid gains, particularly Macy’s Inc and Kohl’s Corp , which got boosts last month from their exclusive Karl Lagerfeld and J.Lo clothing lines, respectively, according to the Thomson Reuters index. At the high end, Nordstrom Inc and Saks Inc  are also expected to report strong October sales, helped by luxury’s continued recovery, according to the index. Costco is expected to log the biggest gain in the survey, with higher gas prices contributing to a 8.8 percent jump. The last in class is expected to be Gap Inc , hurt by a 7.1 percent drop at its struggling North American flagship chain and an even steeper overall drop abroad. The weather may also have dented sales. TJX Cos Inc , which operates the Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains, said last week that warm weather in the Northeast early in the month hurt sales of cold clothing. TJX nonetheless stood by its forecast of a 2 percent to 3 percent same-store sales rise for October at those chains. And while the record snowfall in the mid-Atlantic states and New England hit on the last reporting day of the month, Lejuez said it reduced odds of retailers beating Wall Street’s estimates.

Others not in the survey are Home Depot Inc, Kroger Co and Best Buy Co . TJX, Costco and Gap’s monthly numbers include international sales.

Limited Brands , the parent of Victoria’s Secret, reported a 6 percent jump in same-store sales, while teen retailer Zumiez reported a 3.3 percent gain, above Wall Street’s expectations. Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 9 percent increase, helped by higher gasoline prices and shoppers’ continued search for bargains. Overall, 23 major U.S.-based retailers that report monthly results were expected to post an composite gain of 4.5 percent in sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would come off a strong back-to-school season and suggest that U.S. shoppers are growing more comfortable spending. Consumer confidence was still low in October compared with historic levels, but did brighten a bit. And U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected last month, according to the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday. “What we’re seeing right now is a surprisingly resilient consumer,” said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. But October is the third-smallest month for sales, with shoppers taking a breather between back-to-school and the holidays. And while shoppers are hitting stores, they are still careful heading into the biggest spending season of the year. “Now going into the holiday season, consumers are going to start to be more selective,” said Kurt Salmon retail strategist Megan Donadio. “They want to make sure they are getting value.” Other retailers set to report October sales later on Thursday include Target Corp , Macy’s Inc and TJX Cos Inc .",11032011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail/corrected-wrapup-1-u-s-chain-store-sales-rise-in-october-idUSN1E7A10TA20111103

78,COST,Costco shares fall as margins shrink,"(Reuters)- Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) posted a quarterly profit in line with Wall Street’s expectations, but shares of the largest U.S. warehouse club operator fell as margins dropped more than expected. Analysts say the company, which sells products from chicken to couches at a discount to customers who pay annual membership fees, is willing to sacrifice margin to boost market share. In the first quarter ended November 20, the warehouse club operator posted earnings of $320 million, or 73 cents per share, compared with $312 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding the costs of a tax audit and political contributions to support change in alcohol laws in Washington state, earnings were 80 cents a share, matching the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts said merchandise margins fell 0.35 percentage point, a worse decline than expected. Issaquah, Washington-based Costco said last week that sales in the 13 weeks ended on November 27 rose 12 percent to $23.13 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 10 percent including fuel, it said at that time. But investors are aware of Costco’s continued strong same-store sales growth, and “further upside for the stock is largely dependent upon the company’s ability to raise retail operating margins going forward,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan, said in a note to clients. Costco shares fell 1.8 percent to $85.87 in morning trading. The company said membership fee revenue rose 7.5 percent to $447 million in the quarter. It had raised fees for most U.S. and Canadian members by 10 percent on November 1. ",12082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-costco/costco-shares-fall-as-margins-shrink-idUSTRE7B71E320111208

85,COST,Costco profit beats on sales of cheap gasoline,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp posted a bigger-than-expected increase in quarterly profit as the warehouse club’s discounted gasoline prices lured shoppers to its service stations and stores. Costco prices gasoline below nearby service stations. When gas prices rise, as they have recently, sales at Costco are buoyed. At the same time, Costco is willing to take a hit to margins in order to keep its prices low so that shoppers come to its stores more often. Costco typically prices everyday goods such as bananas below supermarket prices, for example, and hopes that once shoppers come in they stock up on other goods as well. During the fiscal second quarter ended February 12, Costco’s merchandise margins fell 0.3 percentage point to 10.53 percent, which was slightly below expectations of 10.61 percent, according to Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan. “It seems likely that underlying product margins may have declined for a second quarter as (Costco) reinvests in value and price,” McGranahan said. Shares of Costco were up 1.1 percent at $86.22 in morning trading on the Nasdaq. BMO Capital Markets analyst Wayne Hood has an “underperform” rating on the shares, citing concerns about operating margin pressure and a high valuation for the stock that leaves “little room for disappointment.” Shares of Costco trade at 22.1 times expected earnings, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc, whose chains include Sam’s Club warehouse clubs, trades at multiple of 12.1. Costco sells everything from strawberries to sweatpants. Its members pay annual fees to shop at hundreds of large stores and online. Selling gasoline drives revenue, but gas is less profitable than other goods. Costco has said in the past that about 30 percent of its members buy gas and shop on the same day. Costco said second-quarter profit rose to $394 million, or 90 cents per share, from $348 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts said the earnings were helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Sales in the quarter rose 10 percent to $22.51 billion.

88,COST,March sales brighten retailers' profit prospects,"(Reuters) - Summery weather and an earlier Easter prompted shoppers to buy bright-colored clothing, with many boosting retailers’ profits by paying closer to full price than in recent years. Of the 20 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters, 10 beat Wall Street sales estimates, with the biggest increases coming from clothing sellers. Victoria’s Secret parent Limited Brands Inc, Target Corp, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc were among the retailers that beat analysts’ expectations for sales at stores open at least a year as they lured shoppers with blue, yellow and pink clothes and other spring merchandise. For a graphic, click: link.reuters.com/jeg57s Target, TJX Cos Inc and Ross Stores Inc raised their earnings estimates after what analysts say was a month of fewer discounts. “Nobody’s telling you what the profit number is, but it does appear like the promotional environment has eased,” said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said other retailers were likely to raise their estimates as well, once the Easter holiday is behind them. “The companies have been seeing strong full-price sell-through, which means there is likely upside to first-quarter profit estimates,” Konik said. Michael Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said he expected April same-store sales to rise 3 percent to 4 percent. Based on ICSC’s tally of 22 retailers, March same-store sales rose 4.1 percent. The Thomson Reuters Same-Store Sales Index registered a 4.3 percent rise in comparable sales for March, well above the 1.8 percent gain of a year earlier. The Standard & Poor’s Retailing Index rose 1 percent, while the broad S&P; 500 stock index was unchanged. Shares of two of the biggest winners — Ross Stores and TJX — were up nearly 3 percent. Shares of Buckle Inc, which had the biggest miss, fell 6.3 percent. Last month was the warmest March in more than 50 years, according to weather tracker Planalytics. As in February, the higher-than-normal temperatures helped clothing retailers bounce back from December and January, when they stocked up on merchandise for a winter that never came. To give shoppers more incentive, the Easter holiday falls two weeks earlier in 2012, on April 8 compared with April 24 last year. But retailers and analysts were quick to attribute their sales to more than the weather and the calendar. One of the biggest reasons why clothes retailers did well was because of a broad change in their color offerings to go with the warm weather, most analysts said. Gap, which had been a drag on the sector until recently, posted an 8 percent rise in comparable sales — an indication that its brightly-colored spring clothes were selling well. Analyst Mark Montagna of Avondale Partners called the trend the “next big thing for apparel” and said Gap had done the best job with men’s colored pants and shorts. “People were out shopping in March like they haven’t in quite a few months,” said Joel Bines, managing director of AlixPartners’ retail practice, adding that most were paying more for new clothes and accessories. Barbara Kahn, director of the Wharton School’s Jay H. Baker Retailing Center and a marketing professor, said consumers were feeling more optimistic. “Color is back,” she said. “People are excited about it. I think it’s happy, happy, happy.” Consumer confidence rebounded to a 13-month high at the end of March, as optimism about jobs and income overcame higher prices at the gasoline pump. One surprise miss came from Costco Wholesale Corp. NBG Productions analyst Brian Sozzi said the warehouse club chain, which charges a membership fee to its customers, did not seem to draw as many shoppers as he would have expected, given its low prices. “Costco has an outsized exposure to California, the state with the fourth-highest gasoline prices in the U.S.,” he wrote in a note to clients. “Somewhere there is a tie-in between stretched household budgets as a result of gas price creep and Costco’s bulk offerings, which do require a hefty upfront investment.” “The misses that you see this month are more to do with the retailer’s offerings than to do with the shopper,” AlixPartners’ Bines said, “because the shopper was buying.” ",4052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-retail-sales/march-sales-brighten-retailers-profit-prospects-idUSBRE8340IS20120405

92,COST,Wholesale inventories data points to Q1 GDP downgrade,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Stocks of unsold goods at wholesalers rose modestly in March, according to government data on Wednesday that suggested a downward revision to the initial first-quarter growth estimate. Wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent to a record $480.4 billion, the Commerce Department said, after an unrevised 0.9 percent rise in February. The increase was half what economists polled by Reuters had expected, leaving them to conclude that the government would likely lower its first-quarter GDP estimate to an annual pace of 1.9 percent from the 2.2 percent rate it reported last month. The change in inventories is a key component in the calculation of GDP. However, the actual size of the revision would be depend on data next week on overall business inventories for March. Trade data for March to be released on Thursday will also have an impact on the first-quarter GDP estimate. The government used estimates for both business inventories and the trade balance for its first GDP estimate, published last month. Economists said the wholesale numbers, particularly the ex-autos component that goes into the GDP calculation, had come in softer than the government’s assumptions. “Combined with data on manufacturing inventories that had already been reported, it now looks like the change in inventories in will be revised down from the first estimate of $69.5 billion to about $58 billion,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “This downward revision should be a positive for second-quarter growth because less inventory accumulation in the first quarter implies that inventories should be less of a headwind for growth in the second quarter.” Inventories contributed 0.6 percentage point to first-quarter GDP growth, far less than the 1.81 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Wholesale inventories in March were held back by a 5.9 percent drop in the value of petroleum stocks, the largest decline since May 2010, partly reflecting retreating crude oil prices. Automobile inventories climbed 0.4 percent in March after declining 1 percent the prior month. There has been a strong demand for motor vehicles, prompting manufacturers to ramp up production. Economists, however, warn manufacturers will have to scale back on production to prevent an unwanted inventory build. In March, sales at wholesalers rose 0.5 percent after rising 1.1 percent in February. Economists had expected sales to increase 0.7 percent in March. Sales at wholesalers in March were mixed, with automobiles falling 1.7 percent, the largest drop since May last year. Petroleum sales increased 2.7 percent after rising 4.4 percent in February. At March’s sales pace it will take 1.17 months to clear shelves, unchanged for the sixth straight month. “This suggests that recent stock building has been a planned response to expectations of rising demand, rather than reflecting weaker sales,” said Peter Newland, an economist at Barclays in New York.

The largest warehouse club operator earned $386 million, or 88 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended May 6, up from $324 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, looked for earnings of 87 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

97,COST,UPDATE 5-Costco to buy out partner in Mexican unit,"* Deal with Comerci for about $766.8 mln * Costco Mexico to pay cash dividend of about $344 million * Dividend to be split equally between Costco, Comerci MEXICO CITY, June 14 (Reuters) - Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp plans to buy out its joint venture partner Comercial Mexicana’s 50 percent stake in its Mexican unit for 10.7 billion pesos ($766.79 million) and take full control of the business in its third-largest market. The joint venture, Costco Mexico, which is operated by Costco Wholesale, will pay a cash dividend of about 4.8 billion pesos ($343.98 million), to be split equally between Costco and Comerci, as the Mexican retailer is locally known. Costco will use the dividend to fund the purchase. Shares of Comerci, which has been struggling under a heavy debt load, surged on the news and closed up 11.6 percent, their biggest one-day percentage jump since October 2009. Comerci, which operates the upscale City Market stores, discount stores and restaurants, agreed to a debt restructuring deal with creditors in 2010 after heavy losses on currency derivatives caused it to default on obligations in late 2008. The company plans to use most of the cash payment from the transaction to pay off debt, Chief Financial Officer Jose Calvillo told analysts on a call. The Costco-Comerci relationship dates back to the early 1990s when Costco merged with Price Co, with which Comerci had a joint venture partnership. The deal is subject to approvals from the Mexican Federal Competition Commission and shareholders of Comercial Mexicana, the companies said in a statement. Shareholders and authorities should sign off on the deal shortly, Calvillo said, adding that Comerci expects to receive its payments in July and August and begin refinancing its debt in September. Jaime Gonzalez Solana will continue as CEO of Costco Mexico. Issaquah, Washington-based Costco operates 32 outlets in Mexico, its third largest market after the United States and Puerto Rico and Canada. The cash payments will allow Comerci to open more stores and ramp up sales. The company will seek to increase revenue by 8 percent in 2013 and 10 percent in 2014 and beyond, he said. When analysts on the call asked whether those were conservative targets, Calvillo explained it is becoming hard in Mexico’s competitive market to open stores rapidly. “I think it’s going to start to be more complicated to find spots (for stores and) it’s going to be more complicated to obtain licenses,” he said. Mexico’s retail market is dominated by Wal-Mart de Mexico , which is investigating allegations it bribed local officials to open stores more quickly. Walmex, which ended 2011 with 2,709 stores and restaurants in Mexico and Central America, said in February it plans to open a further 410 to 436 this year. Comerci, which ended 2011 with 274 stores and restaurants,  said in January it would focus this year on paying down debt and open between 15 and 20 stores in 2013. The company expects to increase sales by 5 percent to 5.5 percent this year, Calvillo told journalists on a separate call.

104,COST,"""Stagnant"" economy takes toll on U.S. retailers' June sales","(Reuters) - Stubbornly high unemployment and anxiety about the economy took a toll on top U.S. retailers’ sales in June, raising concerns that shoppers are penny-pinching ahead of the back-to-school season. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Macy’s Inc (M.N), Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) all reported disappointing June sales at stores open at least a year. “In part, this was a function of a macroeconomic environment that is stagnant at best,” Macy’s Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in statement. A steady stream of weak economic reports, stubbornly high unemployment and a volatile stock market hurt shoppers’ morale last month, underscored by a tumbling Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index. Lower-priced retailers, like TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N), which runs the T.J. Maxx chain, and Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O), reported some of the largest gains as shoppers looked for deals on designer-brand clothes and home goods. Both retailers raised their quarterly profit forecasts. “In June, the consumer put on a very cautious hat, they started pulling back,” said Keith Jelinek, a director in AlixPartners’ global retail practice. Sales for the 20 chains in the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S same-store sales index rose 0.1 percent, below the 0.5 percent analysts expected, and well below the 6.7 percent pace a year earlier. Macy’s reported a 1.2 percent increase, below expectations of 1.9 percent. Target’s 2.1 percent gain came in just below analysts’ projections. Mid-tier department store chain Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) reported a 4.2 percent decline as overly cautious inventory management led to a merchandise shortage, and the retailer failed to capitalize on sales declines at rival J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N). Still, Macy’s, Target and Kohl’s maintained their quarterly profit outlooks. The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX was up 1.3 percent, compared to a 0.1 percent drop in the broad S&P; 500 .SPX. “The anticipated sales slowdown is here, but it isn’t a disaster,” said Walter Stackow, an analyst with Manning & Napier, which owns retail stocks. Stackow noted that shares have been under pressure of late. There were also hopeful signs in the U.S. labor market. Private employers stepped up hiring in June, while the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits last week fell by the most in two months. The International Council of Shopping Centers forecast same-store sales rising by 1 percent to 1.5 percent in July. Macy’s shares were up 2.9 percent, while Kohl’s rose 6.9 percent. Other winners were TJX and Ross Stores, jumping 3.7 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Same-store sales graphic: link.reuters.com/vax29s The weak June numbers at many large chains showed how quickly shoppers can decide to put off spending — and could result in discounts during the upcoming back-to-school season, when parents buy clothes and supplies for school-age children. “June will unnerve retailers,” said Chris Donnelly, global managing director at Accenture’s retail practice. Adding to the risk, he said, retailers bought fall merchandise in February, when the U.S. economic recovery seemed more solid. If they have too much inventory, they may slash prices, hurting gross margins. “You’re going to have a tough back-to-school season,” Donnelly said. Limited Brands Inc LTD.N was a standout in June, reporting a 7 percent same-store sales gain, led by its Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain — easily beating the 2.4 percent estimate. Shares jumped 5.4 percent. Affluent shoppers appeared to be unscathed by the volatile stock markets. Upscale chains Saks Inc SKS.N and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) reported strong June sales, topping expectations. But sales declined at drugstore chains Walgreen Co WAG.N and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), two of the largest retailers in the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S index. Walgreen has been struggling since January, when it stopped filling prescriptions for members of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O). Still, Walgreen shares rose nearly 1 percent. Costco reported a companywide 3 percent increase in same-store sales, below estimates of 3.7 percent, hurt by unfavorable exchange rates.

Smaller chains like Cato Corp, and teen apparel chain Wet Seal Inc and The Buckle Inc also reported sales at stores open at least a year that came in below estimates. Costco Wholesale Corp reported a companywide 3 percent increase in same-store sales, below estimates of a 3.7 percent gain, hurt by unfavorable exchange rates. The warehouse club operator’s U.S. sales also came in below Wall Street views. “In June, the consumer put on a very cautious hat, they started pulling back,” said Keith Jelinek, director in AlixPartners’ global retail practice. He predicted shoppers would continue to be careful about splurging on non-essential items before children head back to school. Limited Brands Inc was a standout among the first group of companies to post June sales, reporting a 7 percent same-store sales gain, led by its Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain. Limited easily beat the estimate of a 2.7 percent gain. Analysts expected 18 top retail chains to report a modest 2.4 percent in June same-store sales, according to the Thomson Reuters same-store sales index — far less than the 7.7 percent gain a year earlier. The estimate excluded the Walgreen Co  and Rite Aid Corp drugstore chains. Macy’s Inc and TJX Cos Inc also reported early Thursday. Kohl’s Corp and Saks Inc were due to report later in the day. A steady stream of weak economic reports, stubbornly high unemployment and a volatile stock market have weighed on shoppers. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index tumbled to 73.2 in June from 79.3 in May. The U.S. manufacturing sector grew in June at its most sluggish rate in 18 months as the pace of output, hiring and new orders all slowed, the Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index showed on Monday. After retailers posted good results earlier in the spring, several analysts said warm weather may have spurred people to buy summers clothes earlier, simply shifting sales from later months like June. The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) on Tuesday trimmed its forecast for June same-store sales to a rise of 1 percent to 1.5 percent from an earlier forecast of 1.5 percent to 2 percent. It cited severe storms in late June that left millions in the mid-Atlantic without power.",7052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-june/wrapup-1-costco-other-retailers-miss-june-sales-estimates-idUSL2E8I2F3R20120705
106,COST,Costco June same-store sales miss forecast,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) posted a 3 percent rise in same-store sales in June, missing analysts’ forecasts for the fourth time in a row, as a strong dollar hurt the value of its sales overseas. Analysts on average had expected sales in stores open for at least a year to increase 3.7 percent in June, including the impact of fuel prices and foreign exchange, according to Thomson Reuters data. “These results reflect both a negative calendar shift in the U.S. and the impact of the strengthening dollar, particularly against the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso,” Guggenheim Securities analyst John Heinbockel wrote in a note. Costco, which sells everything from potato chips to outdoor plants, typically prices gasoline below nearby service stations. Sales at Costco benefit when gasoline prices rise.

Analysts on average had expected sales in stores open for at least a year to increase 3.7 percent in June, including the impact of fuel prices and foreign exchange, according to Thomson Reuters data. “These results reflect both a negative calendar shift in the U.S. and the impact of the strengthening dollar, particularly against the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso,” Guggenheim Securities analyst John Heinbockel wrote in a note.

108,COST,Mexican retailer Comerci 2nd-quarter profit soars on Costco sale,"MEXICO CITY, July 25 (Reuters) - Comercial Mexicana  on Wednesday said its second-quarter profit soared more than 1,800 percent after the warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp bought out its stake from the Mexican retailer, known locally as Comerci. In June, Comerci agreed to sell its 50 percent stake in Costco’s Mexico unit for 10.7 billion pesos. After the sale, Comerci said second-quarter profit climbed to 5.38 billion pesos ($403 million) in the April-June period, up from 278 million pesos in the same period a year earlier. Without the windfall from the Costco sale, the company said net profit would have been 312 million pesos, up just 12.2 percent from the second quarter in 2011. The deal with Costco will help Comerci pay down debt. Comerci, which operates the upscale City Market grocery stores as well as discount stores and restaurants, agreed to a debt restructuring deal with creditors in 2010 after heavy losses on currency derivatives led it to default on obligations in late 2008. The Mexican retailer also said revenue rose 7.4 percent to 11.5 billion pesos in the second quarter, helped by higher supermarket sales.

112,COST,"Retailers fare well in August, sales beat estimates","(Reuters) - Nearly all U.S. retailers posted better-than-expected sales gains in August at stores open at least a year as parents and students wrapped up back-to-school purchases, setting the stage for a strong third quarter. August same-store sales rose 3.6 percent at retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, trumping forecasts for a 2 percent rise. The results exclude teen retailer Zumiez Inc (ZUMZ.O), which reports numbers later Thursday. “It’s a much stronger back-to-school season than even the most optimistic analyst could have forecast,” said Joel Bines, managing director of AlixPartners’ retail practice. The sales trend will give retailers confidence about the consumer mindset going into the holidays, Bines said. “They will be cautious and have planned promotions but can have more confidence about not needing unplanned promotions,” he said. Back-to-school is the second-biggest selling season for retailers in the United States, after the winter holidays. Retailers face a somewhat difficult climate. Earlier this week the U.S. Commerce Department said consumer spending in the second quarter was revised up a notch but was still below the first quarter’s pace. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Retail shares were modestly higher Thursday morning, with Buckle Inc (BKE.N) and Gap Inc (GPS.N) among the biggest gainers. Gap’s 9 percent rise in same-store sales topped analysts’ forecast for a 5.4 percent increase. The results were driven by strong back-to-school sales, particularly at its Old Navy chain, where North American same-store sales jumped 12 percent. Same-store sales are an important measure of retailer performance because they strip out the effects of store openings and closings. Teen retailer Wet Seal Inc WTSLA.O was the only company to miss sales estimates. A strong August at TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) has the off-price retailer now expecting third-quarter earnings per share near the high end of its estimated range of 56 cents to 59 cents. Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) got a big boost from the timing of its Anniversary Sale. Eight days of the sale, which offered discounts on fall merchandise, fell in August this year versus just one day in August of 2011. Same-store sales rose 21 percent, blowing past analysts’ expectations for an 11.1 percent rise. At Target Corp (TGT.N), sales were stronger in the second half of the month as shoppers responded to “compelling value for their back-to-school and back-to-college shopping,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel. Same-store sales were strongest in food, followed by health and beauty products. Limited Brands Inc LTD.N, which owns the Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works chains, saw same-store sales rise 8 percent, well above analysts’ average view of 4.2 percent.

A different judge had allowed the case to proceed as a class action against the warehouse club operator in 2007.

Analysts on average forecast earnings of $1.31 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Costco shares were up 3.8 percent at $103.46 in early trading. Membership fee revenue rose 18 percent to $694 million, due in part a 10 percent fee increase for most U.S. and Canadian members that went into effect starting in November 2011. Strength in membership fee revenue should continue due to the increase in fees, solid renewal rates, more sign-ups due to new club openings, and a continued shift to higher-priced “executive” memberships, Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said. Costco, which competes against Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) Sam’s Club and privately-held BJ’s Wholesale, is willing to take a hit on margins to keep prices low so shoppers visit stores more often. Costco typically prices everyday goods such as bananas below supermarket prices, hoping shoppers will stock up on other goods as well. “While merchandise margins appear unlikely to expand materially near-term (and perhaps contract slightly in any given quarter), we believe Costco’s recent pricing actions are decidedly tactical,” Robert W.

On November 19, Costco’s biggest rival, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, moved its planned dividend to late December from early January to help shareholders avoid any increase in the tax rate. The family of founder Sam Walton owns just over half of the company’s shares. One governance expert said it always raised suspicions whenever a company dominated by insiders decided to pay out a large dividend, since they reap the rewards. “We would automatically raise a red flag for a company if it was paying out an unusually large cash dividend at this point in the year simply to take account of potential tax hikes without taking into account long-term investment,” Paul Hodgson, chief research analyst at governance group GMI Ratings. But Hodgson said dividends like Costco’s could potentially be seen as something like corporate altruism, if insiders were not benefiting and a dividend was the best use of cash. Costco’s dividend is worth nearly $3.07 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding as of early September, the end of the company’s fourth quarter.

The third item on Costco’s code of ethics is to “take care of our employees.” Fifth on the five-point list, the company’s “ultimate goal” is to “reward our shareholders.” Costco keeps expenses low, everywhere from its Issaquah, Washington, headquarters to stores, where shoppers who pay annual membership fees of up to $110 carry purchases out in their own bags or reused cardboard boxes. The hot-dog-and-fountain-drink combo sold at Costco’s food courts is a longstanding signal of the chain’s focus on low prices.

It also posted higher-than-expected November sales, and shares rose 6.3 percent.

The S&P; 500 rebounded from a 1 percent decline, gaining more than 20 points from its low after Boehner, an Ohio Republican,  said he was optimistic that a budget deal to avoid big spending cuts and tax hikes can be worked out. President Barack Obama added to the good feelings, saying he hoped to get a deal done in the next four weeks. Whether or not those remarks reflect the reality of negotiations is another story. “The fiscal cliff is dominating the discussion, and short term, we’re a little bit too optimistic on it being fixed right away,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in New York. In expectation of higher dividend tax rates in 2013, companies have been shifting dividends or announcing special payouts to shareholders. Costco Wholesale Corp, up 6.3 percent at $102.58, was the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage gainer after it became the latest company to announce a special dividend. The market’s move marked the second straight day where a leading legislator dictated trading action. On Tuesday, stocks fell on pessimistic remarks from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada. The market has been swinging for weeks now on headlines from Washington, with Wednesday’s gyrations once again highlighting the importance that Wall Street is giving to finding a solution to avoid the series of tax increases and spending cuts that could push the U.S. economy into recession. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 106.98 points, or 0.83 percent, to 12,985.11 at the close. The S&P; 500  gained 10.99 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,409.93. The Nasdaq Composite added 23.99 points, or 0.81 percent, to close at 2,991.78. The S&P; 500 bounced off a strong support area near 1,385 that includes both its 200- and 14-day moving averages. It closed above 1,400 for the third session in four - an optimistic sign for stock bulls. Knight Capital Group Inc shares jumped 15.2 percent to $3.42 on news that Getco Holding proposed a $1.4 billion merger with Knight, while Virtu Financial offered to buy Knight for at least $1.1 billion. Apparel retailer Express Inc rose 8.9 percent to $14.15 after it forecast strong earnings for the current quarter as lower prices and easy-to-understand discounts led to robust Black Friday sales. The S&P; retail index gained 1.4 percent. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters surged 27.3 percent to $36.86 a day after it forecast quarterly and full-year earnings well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Nearly 6.1 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.48 billion shares. On the NYSE, roughly seven stocks rose for every three that fell, and on Nasdaq, five issues rose for every three that fell.

Shares of Costco Wholesale Corp jumped 5.5 percent to $101.81 after the retailer became the latest company to announce a special dividend in case taxes jump next year. The market sharply pared losses in volatile late morning trading after Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, said he  was optimistic that a deal on the “fiscal cliff” to avert large tax hikes and spending cuts could be reached. That helped reverse a slide of 1 percent. Adding to the more positive tone, the president, speaking later in the day, said he hoped to get a deal done before Christmas. For weeks now, the market has been swinging back and forth on headlines from Washington. Wednesday’s gyrations served to once again highlight the extent that the impasse is affecting the market and the likelihood of more volatility to come. “There’s only one issue in front of the financial markets, and it’s the debate on the fiscal cliff,” said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer of Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. “That’s the only issue out there, and I think in the short term, there’s not much that we can do other than watch, and try to anticipate what’s going to happen.” One possible result of the deficit-reduction talks is a rise in the tax rate on dividends, prompting some companies to issue special dividends or move up plans for dividends. The latest example is retailer Costco, which said it will pay a special dividend of roughly $3 billion to investors - the largest payout so far from any company ahead of a likely increase in the dividend tax. Costco also posted monthly same-store sales that beat forecasts. Costco’s stock hit an intraday high of $102.14, close to its 2012 high of $104.43 set on Oct. 10. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 79.75 points, or 0.62 percent, to 12,957.88. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 5.87 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,404.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 9.04 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,976.83. Knight Capital Group Inc shares jumped 14.1 percent to $3.39 on news that Getco LLC has sent a proposal for a merger between Getco and Knight Capital at a price of $3.39 per share, according to a regulatory filing. Obama is meeting on Wednesday at the White House with chief executives from top corporations, including Goldman Sachs , Deloitte LLP and Caterpillar Inc, to discuss U.S. fiscal problems. “While there’s little that the president and vice president could do at today’s meeting to improve moods in America’s corner office, we still believe a legislative compromise will be reached before ‘fiscal cliff’ detonates,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, in Chicago. “In the meantime, we expect daunting headlines and emotional market volatility.” On the earnings front, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc  forecast quarterly and full-year earnings well ahead of analysts’ expectations, helped by an expanded lineup of single-serve coffee makers and drinks. The company’s stock surged 24 percent to $35.91. The S&P; 500’s drop of 1 percent in the morning was partly caused by data that showed U.S. single-family home sales fell in October, casting a shadow over what has been one of the brighter spots in the U.S. economy. Housing stocks fell after the data. The PHLX housing index  slipped 0.5 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, the biggest U.S. home builder, fell 1.2 percent to $19.34.

The decline came despite encouraging corporate news, including Costco’s special dividend and a merger proposal for Knight Capital. Investors will get readings on new-home sales and the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book view of the economy later on Wednesday, but the market is mainly focused on the negotiations about long-term federal budget deficit reduction. President Barack Obama has invited to the White House chief executives from top corporations, including Goldman Sachs , Deloitte LLP, and Caterpillar Inc, to discuss U.S. fiscal problems. Obama’s meeting with influential leaders from the corporate world is part of his push for Congress to extend tax cuts for middle income Americans, one flashpoint in a standoff with Republicans in Congress over a series of tax hikes and spending cuts, dubbed the “fiscal cliff,” that will go into effect next year if lawmakers and the president cannot come up with a deal to stop them. “These CEOs know that the market will sell off without any resolution, so I think it’s encouraging that they are meeting with the president,” said Sal Arnuk, co-founder at Themis Trading at Chatham, New Jersey. One possible result of the deficit reduction talks is a rise in the tax rate on dividends, prompting some firms to issue special dividends or move up plans for dividends. The latest example is retailer Costco Wholesale Corp , which said it will pay a special $3 billion dividend to investors. The company posted monthly same-store sales that beat forecasts. The stock was up 3.4 percent at $99.74 in premarket trade. U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid expressed disappointment that there has been “little progress” in dealing with the fiscal cliff. S&P; 500 futures were down 7 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 39 points and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 8.75 points. Knight Capital Group Inc shares jumped nearly 20 percent to $3.52 in premarket trade on news that Getco LLC has sent a proposal for a merger between Getco and Knight Capital at a price of $3.50 per share, according to a regulatory filing. Deep divisions at the Federal Reserve were on display on Tuesday, just two weeks before the U.S. central bank’s next policy-setting meeting, with one top Fed official pushing for more easing, and another advocating limits. The Fed will release its Beige Book summary of regional economic conditions at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT). New home sales data is due at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).

134,COST,TEXT-S&P; rates Costco notes issue 'A+';affrms 'A+' CCR;otlk stable,"Rationale The ratings on Issaquah, Wash.-based leading discount club retailer Costco  reflect our view of the company’s “strong” business risk profile. The ratings  also reflect our re-evaluation of Costco’s financial risk profile to “modest”  from “minimal” following the issuance of the notes to fund the dividend. We  anticipate these profile assessments will not change in the next year. The proposed transaction adds a moderate amount of debt to Costco’s balance  sheet and its credit metrics are less robust. Pro forma for the addition of  $3.5 billion of debt, total debt to EBITDA increases to 1.7x as of Sept. 2,  2012, from about 0.8x before the transaction, and funds from operations (FFO)  to total debt ratio weakens to about 43% from 88% for corresponding periods.  EBITDA coverage of interest remains relatively unchanged at about 17%, given  only a modest increase in interest expense on the incremental debt. These  measures are characteristic of a modest financial risk profile. We do not  expect debt reduction in the upcoming year, but estimate that operational  gains will propel EBITDA growth leading to total debt to EBITDA improving to  1.6x at the company’s fiscal 2013 year-end, and FFO to total debt  strengthening to about 46%. We also project EBITDA coverage of interest will  improve to about the mid-18% area. We assess Costco’s business risk profile as “strong,” reflecting its leading  position as the largest membership warehouse club in the U.S., its narrow but  stable operating margins, strong membership renewal rate, and our expectation  for profitability gains over the next year. Despite charging membership fees  to allow for shopping at its warehouses, Costco successfully competes not only  with other large discounters such as Wal-Mart or Target, but also with  supermarkets and many specialty retailers. The company’s narrow, but carefully  selected offering of branded products, its strong private-label Kirkland  Signature, and a wide array of ancillary businesses that allow for a one-stop  shopping experience, provide value to customers and encourage members to shop  more frequently. Costco’s profitability highly depends on new membership acquisition and its  membership renewal rate, at slightly over 50% of its EBITDA for fiscal 2012,  came from membership fee income. Historically, Costco enjoyed a healthy  renewal rate of nearly 90%, and we believe that positive fundamentals in the  discount segment, along with the company’s leading position in the industry  will continue to support healthy renewal rates and drive operational gains. As  such, our projected performance for Costco in fiscal 2013 includes the  following assumptions: — Revenue growth of about 10% resulting from mid-single digit same-store  sales growth, incremental revenue from new warehouses, and strong membership  renewal rate of over 80%. — EBITDA margin remaining at about current 4% as benefits of sales  leverage offset inflationary pressures. — Capital expenditure of slightly over $2 billion to support opening of  nearly 30 new warehouses. — About 1.4 billion in free operating cash flow. — Continuous return of capital to shareholders in the form of dividend  and share buyback activities consistent with the past. Liquidity Liquidity is strong for Costco and the short-term rating is ‘A-1’. Relevant  aspects of the company’s liquidity profile, in our view, are as follows: — We expect that the company’s sources of liquidity over the next 12  months will exceed its uses by 1.5x or more. — We expect that net sources would be positive, even with a 30% decline  in EBITDA. — In our view, the company’s financial policies are conservative and no  additional debt issuances are contemplated in the next two years. — We also believe Costco has a high standing in the credit markets. The company’s consistently solid operating performance generates good cash  flow and the company’s strong balance sheet affords it good flexibility to  access the public debt and bank loan markets as needed. Pro forma for the transaction, Costco had nearly $5.3 billion of cash and  short-term investments on Sept. 2, 2012. Given its large cash position, Costco  maintains several small bank facilities in its foreign markets and a domestic  letter-of-credit facility. Although some of these mature in the near term, we  expect the company to renew these facilities at their respective maturity  dates. The total amount of these facilities was about $438 million on Sept. 2,  2012, with no short-term borrowings outstanding. We anticipate that Costco  will generate about $1.4 billion of free operating cash flow in 2013. Outlook The outlook is stable. We expect Costco to continue to demonstrate good  operating performance and generate healthy levels of cash flow, despite the  competitive environment in which it operates. Although unlikely, we could  consider a lower rating if total debt to EBITDA increases to about 2x as a  result of a significant deterioration in operating performance, specifically,  if EBITDA drops by 19% from the Sept. 2, 2012, level and debt remains constant  at the pro forma level. Higher leverage could also result from a more  aggressive financial policy, where Costco continues to use debt to finance its  share repurchase program or pay another dividend to its shareholders. In this  example, an incremental increase of about $2.3 billion of debt and our  projected EBITDA for 2013 would likely result in total debt to EBITDA  exceeding the threshold for a downgrade. Although we do not expect to raise our ratings on Costco over the next year to  two years, an upgrade could be contingent upon our reassessment of the  company’s financial risk profile to minimal. In this example we would expect  total debt to EBITDA to decline to below 1.5x and FFO to total debt ratio  strengthen to over 60%. In addition, an upgrade is subject to our comfort  level with future debt-financed shareholder initiatives and our belief that  the company will sustain its credit metrics at the levels indicated above.

On Nov. 19, Costco’s bigger rival Wal-Mart Stores  moved its planned dividend into late December from early January to help shareholders avoid a looming jump in the tax rate due to the so-called fiscal cliff. Costco’s special dividend will be paid on Dec. 18, with the record date set at Dec. 10. November sales at Costco stores open at least a year rose 6 percent, helped by higher gasoline prices and dollar weakness, the company said. That compared with a forecast for 5.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the effects of fuel and currency, Costco posted a November same-store sales increase of 5 percent.

139,COST,Costco profit jumps despite light membership fee growth,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp’s (COST.O) quarterly earnings beat Wall Street estimates, but the largest U.S. warehouse club chain collected less in membership fees than some analysts anticipated. Shares of Costco were up 0.8 percent at $99.11 in morning Nasdaq trading after a slight decline earlier in the session. Members pay up to $110 per year to shop at Costco’s cavernous stores and website, where they can buy everything from carrots to kayaks. The fee revenue pads Costco’s bottom line and allows it to offer low prices and take in thin profit margins on items it sells. Membership fee revenue rose 14.3 percent to $511 million in the first quarter ended on November 25, Costco said. The Issaquah, Washington-based chain raised fees for most U.S. and Canadian members by 10 percent on November 1, 2011. The fee increase seems to have had little to no impact on renewal rates, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said during a conference call. Still, the increase in membership fee revenue was not as great as some had anticipated, and growth declined from a rise of about 18 percent in the preceding quarter. BMO Capital Markets analyst Karen Short said she had expected membership fee revenue of $534 million, while Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said the $511 million in fees was $4 million shy of his forecast. Costco said it had earned $416 million, or 95 cents per share, in the quarter, up 30 percent from $320 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 93 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “While results were solid and clean in absolute terms, we believe this was largely line with expectations and unlikely to meaningfully move the stock,” said McGranahan, who rates Costco at “underperform.” Lower-than-expected interest expenses and taxes helped boost earnings per share, said Short, who has an “outperform” rating on the shares. Sales excluding membership fees rose 9.5 percent to $23.2 billion, just below the figure Costco gave last month, when it said quarterly sales rose 10 percent to $23.21 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 7 percent, including the effects of higher fuel prices. Excluding the impact of fuel and foreign currencies, Costco recorded 6 percent same-store sales growth. Costco said it planned to open a new warehouse store in South Korea before the end of 2012. It operates 621 warehouses, including 448 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 85 in Canada, 32 in Mexico, and 23 in Britain. For all of fiscal 2013, it plans to open up to 30 new stores. On November 28, Costco announced a $7 special dividend, set to be paid later this month. The special dividend amounted to roughly $3 billion, the largest payout so far from any company ahead of a likely increase in the U.S. dividend tax. The chain will use proceeds from a $3.5 billion debt offering to pay for the dividend.

140,COST,UPDATE 3-Costco profit jumps despite light membership fee growth,"* Quarterly profit of $0.95 a share exceeds estimate of $0.93 * Same-store sales up 7 percent, including fuel * Membership fee revenue rose 14.3 percent * Shares up after slight decline in early trading By Jessica Wohl Dec 12 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp’s  quarterly earnings beat Wall Street estimates, but the largest U.S. warehouse club chain collected less in membership fees than some analysts anticipated. Shares of Costco were up 0.8 percent at $99.11 in morning Nasdaq trading after a slight decline earlier in the session. Members pay up to $110 per year to shop at Costco’s cavernous stores and website, where they can buy everything from carrots to kayaks. The fee revenue pads Costco’s bottom line and allows it to offer low prices and take in thin profit margins on items it sells.

Among the chains reporting December sales at stores open at least a year, Costco stood out early with growth that topped expectations. Limited Brands Inc’s sales rose less than anticipated, marking a rare miss for the owner of the Victoria’s Secret chain. Wet Seal Inc’s sales fell even more than analysts expected, leading it to expect a fourth-quarter loss at or near the bottom of its prior forecast. Overall, analysts looked for 3.3 percent same-store sales growth for December across 17 chains, down from 4.2 percent growth in December 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Same-store sales rose a disappointing 1.6 percent in November. In December 2008, same-store sales fell 3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The holiday season was never expected to be stellar, but even the single-digit growth anticipated by chains and analysts came under pressure as Superstorm Sandy, the ever-present headlines about the “fiscal cliff” and the Connecticut school shootings affected consumers’ moods. Costco posted a 9 percent rise in December same-store sales, topping estimates for a 6.5 percent increase, boosted by an additional sales day in the reporting period. Higher fuel prices and a weaker dollar also helped. Excluding the effects of fuel sales and foreign exchange, Costco posted an increase of 8 percent. While Limited often tops expectations, in December its same-store sales rose 3 percent versus expectations of a 4.5 percent increase. Wet Seal, which caters to teens, said same-store sales fell 9.7 percent. Analysts predicted the chain would have the weakest sales of any of the 17 chains reporting, but only anticipated a 5 percent decline. Wet Seal now expects its fourth-quarter results to come in at or near the bottom of its forecast of a loss of 3 cents to 6 cents per share.",1032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-sales/mixed-bag-of-december-sales-show-u-s-chains-hits-and-misses-idUSL1E9C315I20130103

149,COST,UPDATE 2-Tiffany sues Costco over sales of engagement rings,"By Bernard Vaughan and Jonathan Stempel Feb 14 (Reuters) - Tiffany & Co sued Costco Wholesale Corp on Thursday to stop the largest U.S. warehouse club chain from selling what it called counterfeit diamond engagement rings bearing the luxury retailer’s name. The trademark lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court also calls on Costco to forfeit profits from the ring sales, plus damages of $2 million per infringement. Tiffany said it believes hundreds, if not thousands, of Costco members bought engagement rings they believed were authentic Tiffany products but in fact were not. Luxury retailers often sue to stop sales of alleged imitation products they believe cut into their own revenue streams and customer goodwill. “This is not the kind of behavior people expect from a company like Costco, and this case will shed a much needed light on this outrageous behavior,” said Jeffrey Mitchell, a lawyer for Tiffany. Mitchell also noted in the statement that Tiffany maintains an “aggressive and rigorous intellectual property program, and regularly takes actions against counterfeiters and infringers.” A spokesman for Costco was not immediately available. In November 2012, a person who was shopping at a Costco in Huntington Beach, Calif., complained to Tiffany that she was disappointed to see Costco offering for sale what were promoted on in-store signs as Tiffany diamond engagement rings, according to the lawsuit. A subsequent investigation revealed rings in a display case at the Huntington Beach Costco labeled with the Tiffany brand and that a salesperson there referred to them as Tiffany rings when they were not, according to the lawsuit. Tiffany also discovered that Costco was not using the Tiffany trademarks online for the same products at the same time to avoid detection, according to the lawsuit.

151,COST,"Costco, Limited Brands February sales beat forecasts","* Costco February comp sales up 6 percent, Limited up 3 percent * Same-store sales for 13 chains seen rising 1.2 percent-Thomson Reuters By Phil Wahba March 7 (Reuters) - Victoria’s Secret parent Limited Brands Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp reported better-than-expected sales for February, when consumer confidence about an improving job market offset the impact of higher taxes. After a difficult January, when shoppers first felt the effect of a payroll tax hike that lowered take-home pay by 2 percent, at least some retailers got a little relief in February from growing employment and a rising stock market. Warehouse club chain Costco on Thursday reported a 6 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, helped by higher gasoline prices as well as strong sales of fresh food and consumer electronics. Wall Street analysts were expecting a 5.1 percent gain, according to Thomson Reuters. Limited’s 3 percent same-store store sales increase also came in higher than expected. The Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain led the gains, suggesting shoppers were still willing to spend on some nonessential items. Some 13 U.S. retailers are reporting February sales results this week. Excluding drugstore chains Walgreen Co and Rite Aid Corp, whose sales are heavily weighted toward prescription drugs, Wall Street analysts expect the other 11 retailers to report a 3.3 percent same-store sales increase. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose to 77.6 in February from 73.8 in January, amid optimism over jobs. U.S. private employers added a larger-than-expected 198,000 jobs in February, according to the ADP National Employment Report. Still, the economy remained difficult for many shoppers. Low-price specialty apparel chain Cato Corp  reported a smaller-than-expected 3 percent drop in comparable sales, but it got help from shopping that was pushed off from January, when many shoppers’ tax refunds were delayed. “February sales reflect the continuing difficult economic environment,” Chief Executive Officer John Cato said in a statement. Despite encouraging signs in the economy, chains that cater to teenage shoppers, who have much less discretionary income, struggled last month. The Buckle Inc and Zumiez Inc   both reported a drop in comparable sales for February. Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters  no longer report monthly sales but have said business will be slow this quarter, which began last month. Several major retailers stopped reporting monthly sales this month, including Target Corp, Macy’s Inc and Kohl’s Corp, making the monthly figures less of an indicator of economic health than in the past.",3072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-february/costco-limited-brands-february-sales-beat-forecasts-idUSL1N0BZ2VT20130307

153,COST,Costco gains market share; profit tops Street view,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) lured shoppers with low prices on everything from produce to gasoline in the latest quarter, gaining market share at a time when other retailers saw shoppers pull back due to higher taxes and rising fuel prices. A membership fee hike also helped the warehouse club discount retailer, which reported higher-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profit on Tuesday. Shares of Costco were up 1.4 percent at $103.82 in afternoon trade. Last year, the retailer paid out $3 billion in a special dividend ahead of expected dividend tax increases. Costco, which has gas stations at its stores, is willing to take a hit on margins to keep prices low so shoppers visit more often. It offers everyday items like bananas below supermarket prices, hoping customers will stock up on other goods as well. Members pay up to $110 per year to shop at Costco’s cavernous stores and website, which sell items ranging from dog food to diamond rings. The fee revenue pads the bottom line, allowing the company to offer low prices and take in thin profit margins on products it sells. “The retailer’s ability to keep members engaged and coming back for more is unparalleled,” Planet Retail analyst Sandy Skrovan said, adding that Costco was outperforming its peers in terms of sales growth and productivity. Costco is the largest U.S. warehouse club chain and competes with BJ’s Wholesale and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) Sam’s Club. Last year, Costco retained the No. 1 spot among warehouse stores with a 46.5 percent share, compared to 38.4 percent for Sam’s Club, according to Euromonitor International. Costco’s market share grew from 2010 to 2012, a period when Sam’s Club’s share declined. Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser maintained his “buy” rating on Costco shares, saying Costco remained one of the most predictable retailers, with strong traffic growth and operating trends. “The machine, known as Costco, continues to gain market share and square footage growth,” Strasser said. Last month, Wal-Mart’s results showed U.S. consumers were worried about the impact of higher payroll taxes and gasoline prices, along with slow tax refunds that put some spending on hold. Costco, unlike some rivals, did not benefit when the United States lowered payroll taxes two percentage points two years ago and wasn’t hurt when that tax holiday ended on January 1, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a conference call with analysts. “It can’t help, but it doesn’t seem to really be impacting our numbers,” Galanti said. Costco’s net income rose to $547 million, or $1.24 a share in the second quarter ended on February 17 from $394 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit from a special cash dividend, Costco earned $1.10 a share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $1.06, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 8 percent to $24.34 billion, while membership fees rose 15 percent to $528 million. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, were up 5 percent in the United States and up 4 percent internationally. The Issaquah, Washington-based company raised fees for most U.S. and Canadian members by 10 percent on November 1, 2011. It previously said the fee increase seemed to have little to no effect on renewal rates. Shoppers also have been filling up tanks more often at Costco, which typically prices gasoline lower than nearby competing stations The company may have also benefited from redemptions of annual American Express rewards, which members received in February. Members who sign up for an American Express card through Costco earn cash back on eligible purchases, including what they buy at the chain. They can redeem or cash in their reward coupons at Costco stores through August. Costco has 622 warehouse stores around the world, including 448 in the United States and Puerto Rico.

157,COST,Prescription drugs cost least at Costco and most at CVS: study,"(Reuters) - Some of the most popular prescription drugs that recently became available in generic form are sold at the lowest prices at Costco and at the highest prices at CVS Caremark, according to an analysis by Consumer Reports. Failing to comparison shop for drugs - such as generic Lipitor to lower cholesterol or generic Plavix to thin the blood - could result in overpaying by $100 a month or even more, depending on the drug, the report said. The article will be available in the May issue of Consumer Reports. Consumers may find good deals at local independent pharmacies, Consumer Reports said. One of the big takeaway messages from the analysis is that the customer must ask the pharmacist for the best price, the publication said. “Especially for the independent pharmacies, if they want to retain your business and loyalty, they will help you get the best price,” Lisa Gill, an editor at Consumer Reports, said. One reason for the wild cost fluctuations may be that different types of stores have different business incentives, she said. “It really comes down to a store’s business model. For example, big box stores tend to use their pharmacies as a way to get consumers through the door with the expectation that they’ll buy other things,” Gill added. Victor Curtis, senior vice president of pharmacy for Costco, said the retailer does not sell below costs and that its pharmacy is a contributor to Costco’s overall profitability. Consumer Reports conducted its analysis by using “secret shoppers” who called more than 200 pharmacies throughout the United States to get retail prices, without using insurance, on a month’s supply of five blockbuster drugs that have recently become available as generics. The drugs were diabetes drug Actos (pioglitazone); antidepressant Lexapro (escitalopram); cholesterol fighter Lipitor (atorvastatin); blood thinner Plavix (clopidogrel); and asthma drug Singulair (montelukast). There was a difference of $749 between the highest and lowest priced stores. For example, one month’s supply of generic Lipitor costs $17 at Costco, Consumer Reports’ secret shoppers found.

Analysts were expecting sales to rise 5.2 percent, including the effects of fuel and foreign exchange, according to Thomson Reuters Data. Average gasoline selling prices for the month were $3.71 per gallon this year, compared with $3.93 a year earlier, David Sherwood, Costco’s director of finance and investor relations, said. Net sales at Costco rose 7 percent to $9.67 billion for the five-week period ended April 7. Costco is the largest U.S. warehouse club chain and competes with privately held BJ’s Wholesale and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s  Sam’s Club. The Issaquah, Washington-based company has 626 warehouse stores around the world, including 449 in the United States and Puerto Rico. It plans to open up to ten stores before Sept 1.",4112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/costco-results/costco-march-same-store-sales-miss-expectations-idUSL3N0CY3E720130411

163,COST,"WRAPUP 1-Costco, Victoria's Secret April sales gains miss forecasts","* Analysts: 4.3 pct same-store sales gains for top 13 chains * Costco, L Brands miss estimates By Phil Wahba May 9 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp and Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands Inc reported smaller-than-expected sales gains in April, when consumer mood swooned on concerns about the job market recovery. Costco reported a 4 percent gain in sales at stores open at least a year, slightly less than expected because of sharply lower gas prices compared with a year ago. Still, the warehouse club operator said sales of food and consumer electronics were good. L Brands same-store sales were up 2 percent, but sales were disappointing at all its major brands, including Bath & Body Works, and the company missed forecasts of a 4.6 percent again. Analysts expect 13 U.S. retailers who still report monthly sales, including T.J. Maxx parent TJX Cos and Gap Inc , to post a 4.3 percent rise in same-store sales for April, according to Thomson Reuters, better than the 0.8 percent gain a year earlier. April sales got a boost from Easter’s timing in late March.  But at the same time, the weather was cool in much of the country, delaying many shoppers’ purchases of spring clothing. Janney Capital Markets analyst Adrienne Tennant said in a note this week that retailers were more aggressive in offering discounts in April, but things eased at the end of the month, suggesting stores had not over-ordered, and making it likely they will avoid panicked markdowns. Despite what turned out to be strong hiring in April, consumer morale lagged the news. U.S. consumer sentiment dipped last month as Americans remained concerned about their employment and financial prospects, a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey late in April found. U.S. employment rose at a faster pace than expected in April and hiring was much stronger than previously thought in the prior two months, while the U.S. stock market indices marched to all-time highs. Teen retailers The Buckle and Zumiez Inc  each reported much better-than-expected April sales on Thursday. Last week, drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp reported same-store sales fell 4 percent in April, largely because of many lower cost generic drugs coming to market in the last year. Larger rival Walgreen Co reported a modest 1.2 percent rise, hurt by a drop in sales of general merchandise. Other chains expected to report later on Thursday include TJX, Gap and Ross Stores Inc. As previously announced, TJX and Ross will no longer report monthly sales after the April report. That will leave 11 U.S. chains reporting monthly sales, down from a peak of 68 in 2006. In the years since, big names such as Macy’s Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have dropped out of the same-store sales index.",5092013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-april/wrapup-1-costco-victorias-secret-april-sales-gains-miss-forecasts-idUSL2N0DP2G020130509

165,COST,UPDATE 1-Low prices help Costco's quarterly profit rise,"May 30 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp reported third-quarter profit just above analysts’ estimates, as its low prices for food and gasoline appealed to shoppers. The largest U.S. warehouse club chain typically offers everyday items like eggs below supermarket prices, hoping customers will stock up on other goods as well, and usually prices gasoline lower than nearby competing stations to attract members. Members pay up to $110 per year to shop at Costco’s big stores and website, which sell items ranging from food to furniture. The fee revenue pads the bottom line, allowing the company to offer low prices and take in thin profit margins on products it sells. Membership fees rose 12 percent to $531 million in the third quarter ended May 12. Costco said net income rose to $459 million, or $1.04 per share, from $386 million, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting profit of $1.03 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 8 percent to $23.55 billion but were below market estimates of $24.21 billion.

Eleven stores registered a 4.8 percent increase in June sales at stores open at least a year, topping analysts’ expectation of a 3.6 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters. The results show that same-store sales have perked up since May, when they rose 3.4 percent, and are much stronger than a year earlier, when they fell 1.8 percent. According to Thomson Reuters, a 3 percent increase in same-store sales reflects healthy consumer spending. U.S. consumer sentiment improved in late June, ending the month close to a nearly six-year high set in May, with the optimism more marked among higher-income families. Government data released on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, although the level still appeared to point to healing in the nation’s job market. Gap Inc, which sells clothing, accessories and personal care products via the Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix brands, reported a 7 percent rise in June sales after markets closed - far better than the 4.7 percent gain analysts expected. Costco Wholesale Corp, whose members pay annual fees of up to $110 to shop at its cavernous warehouse stores, said its same-store sales rose 6 percent last month. That result  surpassed analysts’ expectations of a 5.4 percent increase. “We get no sense from the company’s results that it is feeling any macroeconomic pressure at all,” said Cowen & Co analyst Faye Landes, who has a “market perform” rating on Costco shares. Sterne Agee analyst Charles Grom said Costco’s surprisingly strong sales came despite extreme heat on the West Coast, which has kept shoppers away in the past. Visits to Costco’s warehouses remained strong, with traffic up nearly 5 percent. Not all of the results were as good as those from Gap and Costco. L Brands Inc, the parent company of chains such as Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said same-store sales were flat, missing Wall Street’s expectations of a 2 percent increase and the company’s own forecast of a low-single digit percentage rise. Same-store sales at Victoria’s Secret fell 1 percent after rising 11 percent a year earlier. Still, L Brands said sales of regularly priced merchandise rose at Victoria’s Secret, whose clearance discounts were not as aggressive as a year earlier. The company expects its overall July same-store sales to rise in a low-single digit range. Shares of Gap, which closed up 1.5 percent at $44.76, rose another 0.9 percent in extended trading. Costco shares finished up 2 percent and L Brands added 3.4 percent for the day. Investors shrugged off weak same-store sales at teen chain Buckle Inc and clothing retailer Cato Corp. The results at both chains missed expectations, yet their shares rose modestly as the Dow and the S&P; 500 hit new closing highs. Cato still expects its quarterly profit to decline as same-store sales have been volatile so far this year, in part because of economic uncertainty and unseasonable weather, said Chief Executive Officer John Cato. “We believe this uncertainty will continue, and we remain cautious as we look toward the second half of the year,” he said. Some chains that focus on discounts fared well. Fred’s Inc, a general merchandise discount chain, posted a 4.5 percent jump in same-store sales, well above the analysts’ 1.1 percent estimate. Warm weather helped sales of lawn and garden, summer toys and other seasonal items after such categories were weak during a cool and wet May. Stein Mart Inc’s low-priced apparel continued to appeal to value-seeking shoppers, with same-store sales up 6.5 percent versus the analysts’ forecast of 4 percent. Shares of both companies rose more than 2 percent. On Wednesday, Family Dollar Stores Inc said it expected its customers to remain under financial pressure and hold back from purchases that are not absolutely necessary. The discount chain expects its same-store sales to rise 2 percent this quarter after increasing 2.9 percent in the three months ended June 1. At its peak in 2006, the monthly same-store sales index included 68 companies led by Wal-Mart Stores Inc, making it a much more significant gauge of consumer spending than the current group of 11.",7112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-june/update-2-u-s-retailers-sales-rise-some-shoppers-are-cautious-idUSL1N0FH0HE20130711

Bernanke, at an economic conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Wednesday, said a highly accommodative monetary policy was needed for the foreseeable future, and that the U.S. unemployment rate of 7.6 percent overstated the health of the job market. “His statement that they will be highly accommodative for the foreseeable future is pretty clear and the market loved it,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management in New York. “That statement was very clear and that is what the market is reacting to, because he is in charge.” The Fed chairman’s comments on May 22 had first raised the prospect of an earlier-than-expected move by the central bank to scale back its bond buying program, triggering a drop in the S&P; 500 of as much as 5.8 percent by June 24 from an all-time high of 1,687.18. Bernanke’s latest remarks sent the dollar lower and boosted commodities such as gold and copper. U.S.-listed shares of Barrick Gold climbed 6.4 percent to $14.90 while Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold  gained 4.1 percent to $28.40. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 152.05 points, or 0.99 percent, to 15,443.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 18.21 points, or 1.10 percent, to 1,670.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 39.92 points, or 1.13 percent, to 3,560.68. The benchmark S&P; 500 had risen 2.4 percent over the prior five sessions, its longest winning streak since early March, on optimism over improving economic data and anticipation of a better-than-expected earnings season. Economic data showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 360,000, above expectations calling for 240,000 new filings. Export prices fell by 0.1 percent, matching the expectation in a Reuters poll, while import prices slipped 0.2 percent last month versus expectations calling for unchanged import prices, signaling global economic growth may be cooling. Celgene Corp, up 8.4 percent to $135.56, was the top boost to both the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq 100 after the company said a late-stage trial of its cancer drug Revlimid met the main goal of improving survival in newly diagnosed blood cancer patients. Microsoft Corp rose 1.3 percent to $35.14 after the company announced a reorganization it said will allow the software maker to deliver multiple devices and services as a single company. Sales at U.S. retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp , and L Brands Inc, the company that runs Victoria’s Secret, suggest that overall U.S. consumer spending is improving while discretionary spending may remain under pressure. Costco shares gained 1 percent to $114.81 while the S&P; retail index advanced 0.7 percent. LTD was up 2 percent at $51.60.

According to a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Costco has never been an authorized retailer of Michael Kors handbags, yet it has recently run advertisements nationwide falsely suggesting that the handbags are available “starting at $99.” In one example cited, Costco in April sent an email ad touting a selection of handbags for Mother’s Day “starting at $99.99,” several of which were Michael Kors handbags featuring the company’s trademarks. But Michael Kors, which also makes shoes, watches and jewelry, said that its representatives visited Costco’s website and 19 retail stores, and found none carried its handbags. On the Michael Kors website on Friday, most full-size women’s handbags were priced between $298 and $1,195. The point of Costco’s ads is to “lure unsuspecting consumers away from bona fide Michael Kors retailers and into Costco stores,” the complaint said. “When a consumer ‘takes the bait’ and seeks to purchase Michael Kors handbags at a Costco store or on Costco’s website, no such handbags are available,” it added. Michael Kors is seeking a court order to stop Costco from advertising its products, and to recoup profits plus punitive damages stemming from the alleged false ads. A spokesman for Costco, based in Issaquah, Washington, was not immediately available for comment. The lawsuit resembles one that Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) brought against Costco in February. In that case, the jeweler accused Costco of using Tiffany’s trademarks online and on at least one in-store ring display case. The case is Michael Kors (USA) Inc et al v.

Ten of the 11 U.S. retailers that still release monthly sales figures for stores open at least a year reported a combined 4.2 percent gain, just below the 4.4 percent increase analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters. Gap Inc  will report after markets close. The Standard & Poor’s Retail Index was up 0.4 percent in morning trading, outpacing a 0.1 percent gain for the broad S&P; 500. Retail stocks took a hit earlier this week after American Eagle Outfitters Inc said the pressure to slash prices was intense in July and that quarterly same-store sales fell 7 percent. Costco Wholesale Corp said on Thursday that same-store sales rose 4 percent last month, below analysts’ expectations of a 5.1 percent increase. Gasoline, which its members can buy at lower prices, sold well, but shoppers pulled back on big-ticket items like electronics. Fred’s Inc, a small discount chain, said promotions were what lifted same-store above expectations sales last month. Cato Corp, which sells clothing, reported a 5 percent decline that Chief Executive Officer John Cato blamed on “continuing economic uncertainty.” L Brands Inc, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, was a stand-out, reporting a same-store sales gain of 3 percent for July, above forecasts for a 1.5 percent rise. Its shares rose 5 percent after it raised its profit outlook. But shoppers remain stressed and are hunting for deals, experts said. Last month, U.S. employers slowed their pace of hiring, with the number of jobs outside the farming sector increasing less than economists expected. “Consumers need a reason to go to the store,” said Barbara Kahn, a professor of the Wharton School of Business and director of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center. “It’s consistent with what we’ve been seeing from economic data: The recovery is sluggish.” International Council of Shopping Centers Chief Economist Michael Niemira said consumers had started their back-to-school shopping later this year than in 2012. That may mean a lot of goods remain unsold at the end of the season, he added. Back to school is the second-most important season for clothing retailers after the Christmas holidays and is particularly important for teen chains as well as department stores like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Kohl’s Corp and Macy’s Inc. Those companies will report quarterly results later this month. Zumiez Inc, which caters to teenagers, reported a weaker-than-expected 0.8 percent gain in July same-store sales. Rival chain The Buckle had a 2.1 percent increase, slightly below Wall Street projections. American Apparel Inc posted an 8 percent rise. Walgreen Corp said last week that its same-store sales rose 6.3 percent, but a Credit Suisse analyst said they had gotten help from deals on products like bottled water and soda aimed at bringing more shoppers. Rite Aid Corp reported a modest 0.7 percent increase in general merchandise such as toothpaste and deodorant.",8082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-july/wrapup-2-u-s-same-store-sales-rise-in-july-helped-by-promotions-idUSL1N0G820M20130808

JPMorgan Chase & Co was among the largest decliners on the Dow Jones industrial average; shares fell 1.3 percent to $54.60. The biggest U.S. bank by assets faces a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice over sales of mortgage-backed securities. The S&P; financial sector index was off 0.3 percent. Stocks had inched lower much of this week, pulling back from record levels, on concerns the Federal Reserve will start to reduce its stimulus efforts this year as the economy recovers. Gains in equities have been closely tied to the Fed’s stimulative policy, and many investors are concerned economic growth may lose steam without the Fed’s help. “If we end lower, this would be the first four straight days of losses this year. We’ve had this tremendous rally this year so the market is just taking a breather, digesting the good earnings season winding down,” said Ryan Detrick, senior strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 33.87 points, or 0.22 percent, at 15,436.80. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 0.28 points, or 0.02 percent, at 1,690.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 7.11 points, or 0.19 percent, at 3,661.12. The benchmark S&P; 500 is now about 20 points away from the all-time high of 1,709.67 set last week. Earlier in the session, it had risen above its 14-day moving average of 1,694.06. Lifting the Nasdaq, Microsoft Corp shares rose 2.5 percent to $32.86.

182,COST,UPDATE 3-Wal-Mart sales disappoint as U.S. shoppers curb spending,"By Phil Wahba and Lisa Baertlein Aug 15 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported a surprise decline in quarterly same-store sales in the United States, its biggest market, after shoppers came in less often because higher taxes and gasoline prices were leaving them with less spending money. The world’s largest retailer also cut its revenue and profit forecasts for its fiscal year, raising concerns about retail spending as the all-important holiday season nears. It cited weak results from the United States, as well as Canada, Mexico, Japan and other international markets that it is relying on for long-term growth. Shares of Wal-Mart were down 2.4 percent at $74.59 in midday trading. U.S. sales at stores open at least a year at the company’s main Walmart chain fell 0.3 percent in the second quarter ended in late July, the company said on Thursday. Wall Street analysts were expecting a 1 percent gain, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visits to those stores also fell 0.5 percent during the quarter. “That low-income customer is really struggling now, and that’s hitting Walmart,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Shoppers are contending with higher payroll taxes after a two-year cut ended in January, as well as high gas prices and a slow recovery in employment. Wal-Mart’s results came a week after a group of U.S. retailers reported modest gains in July same-store sales because they had to resort to bargains to lure shoppers who remained careful of their spending. Wal-Mart expects little improvement going into the fall. It forecast flat U.S. same-store sales in the current quarter, which includes the back-to-school season. Back-to-school is often seen as a barometer for the holiday period, when retailers get about 30 percent of sales and 40 percent of profits. Wal-Mart now expects overall sales to be up between 2 percent and 3 percent for the fiscal year, down from an earlier forecast of a rise of 5 percent to 6 percent. The retailer also cut its profit outlook by 10 cents per share, to a range of $5.10 to $5.30. “The retail environment was challenging across all of our markets,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke said in a recording. Second-quarter profit rose 1.3 percent to $4.07 billion, or $1.24 per share. Excluding a tax-related charge, earnings were $1.25 per share, in line with Wall Street estimates. Revenue increased 2.4 percent to $116.2 billion, below the $118.47 billion analysts expected. International sales rose 2.9 percent, not enough to lift the division’s operating profit. The company said it had more work to do to control costs in those markets. Wal-Mart’s international operating income fell 1.3 percent. Comparable sales in Canada, Mexico, Japan and Britain fell, while they rose slightly in Brazil and China. Same-store sales rose 1.7 percent at the company’s Sam’s Club chain, where shoppers did not balk at an increase in membership fees in May. Still, Sam’s Club’s same-store sales lagged those of rival Costco Wholesale Corp. In 2011, Wal-Mart began a probe into alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and whether it had handled such matters appropriately. The situation drew public attention in April 2012 when the New York Times reported that management at Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV had orchestrated bribes of $24 million to help it grow quickly in the last decade and that the U.S. parent’s top brass had tried to cover it up. Wal-Mart said it had spent $82 million on the probe in the second quarter, after forecasting spending of $65 million to $70 million back in May.",8152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/walmart-results/update-3-wal-mart-sales-disappoint-as-u-s-shoppers-curb-spending-idUSL2N0GG0BY20130815

Markets continue to deal with the possibility of a U.S.-led strike against Syria, and U.S. President Barack Obama faced growing pressure at the Group of 20 summit in Russia not to use military force. Growth in the U.S. services sector accelerated in August to its fastest pace in almost eight years, while new jobless claims last week fell to a near five-year low. The data bolstered views the Fed could start slowing its bond-buying program as soon as this month. The equity market is showing resilience in the face of a possible bombing of Syria and a smaller Fed stimulus due to the underlying strength in the economy, said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. He said the case for winding down the Fed’s $85 billion a month in asset purchases “is stronger than it has ever been,” with Friday’s jobs report the tipping point for the decision. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.61 points or 0.04 percent, to 14,937.48, the S&P; 500 gained 2 points or 0.12 percent, to 1,655.08 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 9.743 points or 0.27 percent, to 3,658.785. The strong data and expectations for the Fed’s taper triggered a selloff in bonds, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield brushing against 3 percent. Analysts said the recent bond selloff could persist. The ADP National Employment report showed U.S. private employers added 176,000 jobs in August, nearly matching expectations, while weekly initial jobless claims fell more than expected to a seasonally adjusted 323,000. Fastenal Co rose 6 percent to $48.60 as the best performer on the S&P; 500 after the seller of industrial and construction supplies reported a jump in August net sales as well as an increase in customers. Retail stocks rose as many U.S. retailers reported stronger-than-expected August sales, but had to use steep discounts to attract back-to-school shoppers. Costco Wholesale Corp reported same-store sales that beat expectations despite lower fuel prices, sending shares up 2.8 percent to $114.62. The Morgan Stanley retail index  gained 0.6 percent. Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia dropped 5.7 percent to $2.32 after a New York Post report that J.C. Penney is scrapping a line of products that rival Macy’s  has claimed violated its contract with Martha Stewart. J.C. Penney shares rose 5.3 percent to $14.22 and Macy’s added 2.7 percent to $46.02. In merger news, Kaydon Corp shares jumped 23 percent to $35.55 after Sweden’s SKF agreed to acquire it for $1.25 billion. About 5.3 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.26 billion shares. On the NYSE 1,413 issues rose and 1,578 fell, while on Nasdaq about three issues rose for every two decliners.

184,COST,WRAPUP 3-U.S. retailers rely on deep discounts to win back-to-school shoppers,"By Dhanya Skariachan NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Many U.S. retailers reported stronger-than-expected August sales on Thursday, but they had to use steep discounts to attract back-to-school shoppers. The unusually high level of discounting raised concerns about margins for this quarter. It also showed that apparel chains might have to keep offering bigger incentives at a time when consumers are spending more on their homes, cars and other durable items. The level of discounting “was certainly higher than last year,” said Ken Perkins, president of consulting firm Retail Metrics. “They seem to be above the norm. That was emblematic of just the lack of demand for back-to-school.” The back-to-school season is the second-biggest selling period of the year for U.S. retailers, behind the winter holidays. Same-store sales for the nine U.S. chains that reported August sales rose 2.9 percent, mainly hurt by Gap Inc  and L Brands Inc. Wall Street had expected a 3.2 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Retailers were primarily hurt by weak mall traffic, and a highly promotional environment at the beginning of August. “What you see is very strong durable goods spending” hurting demand for items like apparel, said Michael Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, which expects same-store sales to rise about 4 percent in September. Many consumers are buying cars and houses to take advantage of still-low interest rates but are holding back on shirts, dresses and shoes. In the run-up to the year-end holiday season, this does not bode well for many retailers. The Standard & Poor’s Retail Index was up 0.6 percent on Thursday morning, outpacing a 0.3 percent gain for the broad S&P; 500. Same-store sales are an important measure of a retailer’s performance because they strip out the effects of store openings and closings. Fewer than a dozen U.S. retailers report monthly sales, down from a peak of 68 in 2006. In the years since, big names such as Macy’s Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have dropped out of the same-store sales index. L Brands’ same-store sales rose 2 percent in August, falling short of the analysts’ average estimate of a 2.2 percent gain. The company is expecting low single-digit percentage increase for September. Mall-based apparel chain Cato Corp’s same-store sales fell 2 percent, while analysts expected a 3 percent drop. “We remain cautious in regard to the remainder of the year,” Chief Executive Officer John Cato said in a statement. Gap, which sells clothing, accessories and personal care products through the Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, Athleta and Intermix brands, reported a 2 percent gain in August same-store sales, slightly below the 2.2 percent gain analysts had expected. Buckle, which caters to teenagers, reported a 1 percent rise, beating estimates of a 0.4 percent increase. Teen-focused retailer Zumiez Inc  posted  same-store sales gain of about 3 percent, ahead of analysts’ estimate of 2.5 percent. Costco’s same-store sales, including those of gasoline, rose 4 percent, just beating analysts’ expectations of a 3.8 percent gain.

185,COST,Wall Street ticks up on data but Fed caution caps gains,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on Thursday, rising for a third day after strong data indicated improving economic conditions, with caution capping gains ahead of Friday’s payrolls report and its implication on the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program. Markets continue to deal with the possibility of a U.S.-led strike against Syria, and U.S. President Barack Obama faced growing pressure at the Group of 20 summit in Russia not to use military force. Growth in the U.S. services sector accelerated in August to its fastest pace in almost eight years, while new jobless claims last week fell to a near five-year low. The data bolstered views the Fed could start slowing its bond-buying program as soon as this month. The equity market is showing resilience in the face of a possible bombing of Syria and a smaller Fed stimulus due to the underlying strength in the economy, said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. He said the case for winding down the Fed’s $85 billion a month in asset purchases “is stronger than it has ever been,” with Friday’s jobs report the tipping point for the decision. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 6.61 points or 0.04 percent, to 14,937.48, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 2 points or 0.12 percent, to 1,655.08 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 9.743 points or 0.27 percent, to 3,658.785. The strong data and expectations for the Fed’s taper triggered a selloff in bonds, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield brushing against 3 percent. Analysts said the recent bond selloff could persist. The ADP National Employment report showed U.S. private employers added 176,000 jobs in August, nearly matching expectations, while weekly initial jobless claims fell more than expected to a seasonally adjusted 323,000. Fastenal Co (FAST.O) rose 6 percent to $48.60 as the best performer on the S&P; 500 after the seller of industrial and construction supplies reported a jump in August net sales as well as an increase in customers. Retail stocks rose as many U.S. retailers reported stronger-than-expected August sales, but had to use steep discounts to attract back-to-school shoppers. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) reported same-store sales that beat expectations despite lower fuel prices, sending shares up 2.8 percent to $114.62. The Morgan Stanley retail index .MVR gained 0.6 percent. Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia MSO.N dropped 5.7 percent to $2.32 after a New York Post report that J.C. Penney (JCP.N) is scrapping a line of products that rival Macy’s (M.N) has claimed violated its contract with Martha Stewart. J.C. Penney shares rose 5.3 percent to $14.22 and Macy’s added 2.7 percent to $46.02. In merger news, Kaydon Corp KDN.N shares jumped 23 percent to $35.55 after Sweden’s SKF (SKFb.ST) agreed to acquire it for $1.25 billion. About 5.3 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.26 billion shares.

186,COST,WRAPUP 3-US retailers rely on discounts to win back-to-school shoppers,"By Dhanya Skariachan NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Some U.S. retailers reported stronger-than-expected August sales on Thursday, but many of them had to resort to deep discounts to attract back-to-school shoppers. The unusually high discounting level raised concerns about margins for this quarter. It also showed that apparel chains might have to keep offering bigger incentives at a time when consumers are spending more on their homes, cars and other durable items. The level of discounts in general “was certainly higher than last year,” said Ken Perkins, president of consulting firm Retail Metrics. “They seem to be above the norm. That was emblematic of just the lack of demand for back-to-school.” For instance, American Eagle had 40 percent off all merchandise in stores and online, versus 30 percent off select goods last year. Rival Abercrombie’s Hollister chain offered 40 percent off in stores up to Labor Day, something it did not do last year, Perkins said. Gap also had promotions - 40 percent off tees, socks and underwear, compared with 30 percent off select styles last year. Saks had an “up to 60 percent off” sale on some apparel in late August that ran an extra day, compared with last year. Macy’s Labor Day sales had deeper discounts this year at 25 percent to 75 percent, versus 20 percent to 60 percent last year. The back-to-school season is the second-biggest selling period of the year for U.S. retailers, behind the winter holidays. Analysts were estimating a 3.1 percent rise in August sales at stores open at least a year at the retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Most, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Buckle Inc, beat expectations for the month, but L Brands Inc , parent of the lingerie chain Victoria’s Secret, missed them. Gap Inc and Zumiez Inc are due to report their same-store sales numbers later on Thursday. “What you see is very strong durable goods spending” hurting demand for items like apparel, said Michael Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, which expects same-store sales to rise about 4 percent in September. Many consumers are buying cars and houses to take advantage of still-low interest rates but are holding back on shirts, dresses and shoes. In the run-up to the year-end holiday season, this does not bode well for many retailers. The Standard & Poor’s Retail Index was up 0.6 percent on Thursday morning, outpacing a 0.3 percent gain for the broad S&P; 500. Same-store sales are an important measure of a retailer’s performance because they strip out the effects of store openings and closings. Fewer than a dozen U.S. retailers report monthly sales, down from a peak of 68 in 2006. In the years since, big names such as Macy’s Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have dropped out of the same-store sales index. L Brands’ same-store sales rose 2 percent in August, falling short of the analysts’ average estimate of a 2.2 percent gain. The company is expecting low single-digit percentage increase for September. Mall-based apparel chain Cato Corp’s same-store sales fell 2 percent, while analysts expected a 3 percent drop. “We remain cautious in regard to the remainder of the year,” Chief Executive Officer John Cato said in a statement. Buckle, which caters to teenagers, reported a 1 percent rise, beating estimates of a 0.4 percent increase. Costco’s same-store sales, including those of gasoline, rose 4 percent, just beating analysts’ expectations of a 3.8 percent gain. Demand was strong for health and beauty aids and food, but weak for electronics, the largest U.S. warehouse club chain said. Stein Mart Inc also topped same-store sales forecasts for the month, reporting a 3.8 percent rise on strong demand for everything from linens to women’s dresses.

Gains were limited as many investors were hesitant to make big bets going into Friday’s payroll report, while the possibility of a Western-led strike against Syria also loomed. U.S. President Barack Obama faced growing pressure from world leaders not to launch military strikes in Syria at the Group of 20 summit on the global economy. While the economic data was positive, it did little to change investor expectations about when the U.S. Federal Reserve might begin to ease its accommodative monetary policies, credited with fueling the equity market’s gains in 2013. “You’ve got the economy is taking us to a happy place, the international situation is taking us to a not-so-happy place and the Federal Reserve - nobody knows how that will react, so it’s just waiting,” said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Scottsdale, Arizona. The ADP National Employment report showed U.S. private employers added 176,000 jobs in August, nearly matching expectations for a gain of 180,000 jobs, while weekly initial jobless claims fell more than expected to a seasonally adjusted 323,000. Separately, the Institute for Supply Management’s read on the services sector rose more than expected in August, while factory orders fell less than had been anticipated. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.64 points or 0.12 percent, to 14,948.51, the S&P; 500 gained 2.87 points or 0.17 percent, to 1,655.95 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 8.873 points or 0.24 percent, to 3,657.915. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down, with the yield climbing to a 25-month high near the 3 percent mark. Analysts said the rout in Treasuries in recent months could persist. “The economy can tolerate quite a bit of an increase in interest rates before we see any real deceleration of economic activity, but that is the wild card,” said Florance. After falling 3.1 percent in August, its worst monthly performance since May 2012, the benchmark S&P; index has kicked off September with a 1.4 percent advance thus far. Geopolitical concerns also kept investors on the sidelines after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee backed a resolution for military strikes against Syria in retaliation for a possible chemical weapons attack against civilians. Market moves have recently been driven by the likelihood of a Western-led strike, with investors attuned to any possible impact on oil supplies. Fastenal Co, rose 6 percent to $48.60 as the best performer on the S&P; 500 after the seller of industrial and construction supplies reported a 2.5 percent jump in August net sales as well as an increase in customers.

193,COST,FACTBOX-U.S. companies affected by government shutdown,"(Adds Costco and Health Net) Oct 9 (Reuters) - As the U.S. government moved into the second week of a shutdown, Congress appears no closer to finding a way to end it, raising concerns about the economic consequences of a prolonged stalemate. The standoff, prompted by Republicans’ determination to halt President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms, could affect U.S. companies that rely on federal employees and funding, but a few have scaled back the number of its workers facing furloughs after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recalled most civilian defense employees. Following is a list of companies and financial institutions that have warned of project delays, employee furloughs and other consequences of a prolonged budget impasse: The U.S. warehouse club retailer has seen a “downward” effect in the Washington, D.C. area due to the government shutdown, but not overall, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a post-earnings conference call. The managed care company said payments for healthcare services it provides to military families would be delayed due to the U.S. government shutdown. The U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA) said on Oct. 2 that it would not be able to reimburse the company as it did not have the legal authority, Health Net said in a regulatory filing. The managed care company said the government shutdown would delay payments related to its military health services contract and that it could be liable for up to $175 million worth of claims if the payments do not come through. Humana provides administrative services to the government for healthcare, with the federal government covering the cost of the benefits and associated risk. The weapons maker said it would furlough about 2,400 of its workers, fewer than the 3,000 it expected on Friday, because the government facilities where they work are closed due to the shutdown or the company had received a stop-work order on their program. The number of employees was expected to increase every week if the shutdown continued, the company said on Friday. The diversified manufacturer canceled plans to temporarily lay off workers in its aerospace businesses as government quality inspectors return in the wake of the Pentagon’s decision to recall most its own furloughed civilian workers. The company, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and other items for the military, had said last week that it could furlough as many as 4,000 workers in its aerospace businesses if the shutdown continued through this week and possibly nearly 5,000 if the shutdown continued into November. The aerospace and defense company said there could be delays in its jetliner deliveries, including its new 787 Dreamliner, because thousands of U.S. aviation officials needed to certify the planes have been idled. The delays would also affect numerous programs and products in the company’s defense business. ** WAL-MART STORES INC The retailer’s Sam’s Club chain saw a slight slowdown last weekend at its warehouse club stores near government facilities but anticipates it could see a lift in food sales if military commissaries remain closed, the unit’s CEO, Rosalind Brewer, told Reuters. The chain is offering military families and retirees free access to its stores while the military commissaries remain closed, Brewer said. The uranium fuel supplier, which is awaiting funds from the U.S. government for an enrichment project, said it may have to furlough some workers or slow down work at the project if the shutdown extends past Oct. 15. Chief executives from major financial institutions have warned of “adverse” consequences if government agencies remain closed and lawmakers fail to raise the debt ceiling by mid-October. In a meeting with Obama on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein implicitly criticized Republicans for using their opposition to the healthcare law as a weapon that could lead to a U.S. default.

A group of nine U.S. retailers, excluding drugstores, reported a 0.4 percent rise in September same-store sales, lower than the 3.1 percent growth analysts had expected, the Thomson Reuters same-store sales index showed. Several apparel stores posted disappointing numbers. Gap Inc said overall sales at stores open at least a year fell 3 percent, with declines at its namesake chain, Banana Republic and Old Navy, and the clothier blamed growing economic uncertainty. Analysts expected comparable sales to rise 1.6 percent. Gap shares fell 4.2 percent in afterhours trading. L Brands Inc’s same-store sales grew 1 percent, missing Wall Street estimates of a 2 percent gain. At its Victoria’s Secret chain, it had to offer deeper promotions than it had expected, especially in its teen-oriented Pink brand. Same-store sales at Zumiez Inc, The Buckle Inc  and American Apparel Inc all fell last month, continuing a tough stretch for stores that cater to younger shoppers. “The consumer is still buying but it’s still the same story: the high end is holding up better than the lower end, where shoppers are more affected by different factors,” said Michael Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, which projects same-store sales to rise about 4 percent in October. Shoppers were lured by deals. On Wednesday, warehouse chain Costco Wholesale Corp  reported U.S. same-store sales that beat Wall Street expectations, as consumers sought out its less expensive merchandise and gasoline. Fred’s Inc, a discount general merchandise chain, reported better-than-expected sales, and Stein Mart Inc , which sells fashions at big discounts compared to department stores, reported a 5 percent increase. During the summer, many shoppers shifted spending to items like cars and homes and away from clothes, hurting retailers that have a heavy presence in malls, such as the teen-focused retailers and department stores. J.C. Penney Co Inc, which this week reported a 4 percent drop in comparable sales for September but is not part of the same-store sales index, said traffic trends at its mall stores remained “difficult.” Gap said in a recording that traffic deteriorated as September wore on. Shares in L Brands, which forecast October same-store sales would rise by a low single-digit percentage, fell 4.1 percent. Consumer confidence dropped in September on concerns about the short-term outlook for jobs and whether a slight improvement in the economy would keep its momentum, according to the U.S. Conference Board. In September, consumers were also worried about the prospect of a partial U.S. government shutdown. Those concerns were realized on Oct. 1 and the closure is now in its tenth day. U.S. business leaders have expressed concern about the impact of the political deadlock, especially with the holiday season looming. Indeed, if the U.S. debt ceiling is not raised by an Oct. 17 deadline, the United States - the world’s biggest borrower - could default on some debt, with ramifications for markets and economies domestic and worldwide. “If and when there’s a default, we will feel that,” Macy’s Inc Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said at a conference in New York last week. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Thursday the gridlock in Washington was hurting the U.S. economy and urged Congress to raise a cap on government borrowing to keep America from defaulting on its debt. Later, Republicans in the House of Representatives unveiled a plan that would avert a looming U.S. default. Last week, Rite Aid Corp reported comparable sales of general merchandise fell 0.5 percent, while at Walgreen Co  they rose 2.9 percent. Both chains get the bulk of their revenue from drug prescriptions. Including these two drugstore chains, Thomson Reuters same-store sales index rose 2.4 percent, less than the 4.5 percent forecast by analysts.",10102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-september/update-2-u-s-retailers-september-sales-rise-modestly-shoppers-wary-idUSL1N0I00JW20131010

199,COST,Sam's Club bets new merchandise will make customers buy more,"ROMEOVILLE, Illinois (Reuters) - Sam’s Club is trying to stand out against its larger, faster-growing rival Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) with trendier holiday merchandise this year, hoping that new goods will spur its members to spend more. Its previous moves, including improving food and adding “treasure hunt” items such as $6,000 Cartier watches, have failed to spur strong results. Sales and the growth trajectory at the retail warehouse chain, part of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), continue to lag behind Costco. “We’ve been underwhelming our members,” Chief Executive Officer Rosalind Brewer said as she toured a new Sam’s Club in Romeoville, Illinois, last week. Some goods just have not been “on trend” enough, she said. When Wal-Mart meets with analysts and investors on October 15, Brewer will give more details about the merchandising strategy for Sam’s Club, a membership-only retailer. The chain is adding 132 new general merchandise goods for the holiday season, up from 56 a year ago. They include everything from sets of “heirloom” Christmas ornaments that look like ones sold in boutiques, to women’s UGG boots priced below the $200 or more they sell for at department stores. Sam’s Club has lacked a bit of the “flair” that Costco has, said Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin. Adding new items may help but could be more of an “incremental positive” rather than really moving the needle, he said, without seeing the goods. Costco has not changed its holiday strategy and is keeping an eye on its rival, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on October 9. Sam’s Club’s discount booklets, launched months ago, are similar to ones Costco has used for years. “We are going to do what we do,” Galanti said on a conference call. “If they keep doing it, it must be working.” Sales at stores open at least a year, a retail metric known as same-store sales, show that Costco has an edge. Costco’s U.S. same-store sales rose 5 percent last quarter. Sam’s Club’s same-store sales rose 1.7 percent last quarter and it expects them to be flat to up 2 percent this quarter. “The results have not been consistently barn burning while Costco’s have,” said Cowen & Co analyst Faye Landes. In the past, Sam’s Club’s formula has not seemed to be “quite as nailed down as Costco’s,” she said. Sam’s Club, which has 627 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico and is opening 15 to 20 more a year, declined to forecast sales or profit margins on the new items. Costco runs 638 warehouses, including 454 in the United States and Puerto Rico, and plans to open 18 more U.S. ones this fiscal year. Sam’s Club, which got its start in Oklahoma 30 years ago, has been trying to stand out as a warehouse of brand names. It is the only club to sell Apple Inc (AAPL.O) devices and also stocks items such as The North Face fleece jackets from VF Corp (VFC.N) and Under Armour Inc (UA.N) shirts. It hopes to lure members like Sue Skeer to spend more. Skeer said she joined Sam’s Club 16 years ago and goes there about twice a week, mainly to buy fruits and vegetables. “I haven’t really found anything that would draw me in” to make many impulse purchases, said Skeer, who lives in Granite Bay, California.

201,COST,"U.S. retailers' October sales rise, but holiday concerns remain","(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp and Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands Inc were among the major U.S. retailers to report same-store sales gains for October, but many chains expressed caution heading into the holiday season. Consumer confidence has dipped, in part because of slow employment growth, and shoppers have gravitated toward bargains in recent months. A group of nine U.S. retailers reported an overall 3.7 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, better than analysts’ forecasts of 2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Apparel chain Gap Inc’s October same-store sales rose 4 percent, well ahead of the analysts’ average estimate of 0.1 percent and its shares rose in after-hours trading. The Standard & Poor’s Retail Index closed down about 2 percent on Thursday, while the broad S&P; 500 stock index fell 1.3 percent. Costco reported a slightly bigger-than-expected 3 percent gain in same-store sales. Fresh food was among its best-selling products, and the weakest category was consumer electronics. L. Brands said its same-store sales were up 8 percent, well above the 2.2 percent gain Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters. The 16-day U.S. government shutdown at the start of the month weighed on consumer confidence and slowed job growth. U.S. job growth probably slowed sharply in October, with the unemployment rate ticking higher, according a Reuters survey of economists published this week. The International Council of Shopping Centers is forecasting same-store sales will rise 3 percent to 4 percent in November, in part because the shutdown has ended, eliminating one source of consumer anxiety, Chief Economist Michael Niemira said. But the trade group still expects only modest growth this holiday season. Many retailers noted worrisome patterns as retailers head into the holiday season. Drugstore chains Walgreen Co and Rite Aid Corp reported softer sales of general merchandise and slower shopper traffic, continuing a trend many companies have noted in recent months. Fred’s Inc said more shoppers made greater use of its layaway program. Lower-income customers typically use such programs, paying for goods in installments before picking them up. J.C. Penney Co Inc, which is not in the same-store sales index, reported its first monthly increase in nearly two years, but deep discounting had a lot to do with that. “We expect the holiday season to be extremely competitive,” Penney Chief Executive Officer Myron Ullman said in a statement. Cool weather helped some retailers, such as low-priced clothing chain Cato Corp, as shoppers replenished their autumn wardrobes. But Cato also said it expected a tough holiday quarter, as did teen chain Abercrombie & Fitch Co. The Buckle and Zumiez Inc, which also cater to teens, reported only modest same-store sales gains for October. Morgan Stanley last week issued a research note forecasting the weakest holiday season since 2008, when the financial crisis decimated retail sales.

206,COST,RPT-Fitch Affirms Costco's IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable,"Nov 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Costco Wholesale Corporation’s (Costco) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A+’. Costco had $5.2 billion of debt outstanding at Sept. 1, 2013. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release. The affirmation reflects Costco’s strong competitive position, solid operating  performance, and ample free cash flow and liquidity. Costco benefits from a  focused merchandising strategy, with only 3,700 fast-turning products per  warehouse and limited pricing mark-ups, resulting in a loyal customer base and  highly productive warehouses that generate, on average, more than $160 million  in revenues annually. High frequency categories account for a significant  percentage of sales, with 56% of sales from food and sundries and 17% from  ancillary businesses, which include traffic-drivers such as gas stations and  pharmacies. These factors have enabled Costco to maintain strong comparable store sales  growth (excluding fuel and forex) of 6% each of the past three fiscal years  (ending August). In addition, membership renewal rates in the U.S and Canada  have remained high at around 90%. Costco’s margins have been steady, with a 3.2% EBIT margin in fiscal 2013 (ended  August), up from 3.0% in fiscal 2012 and 2011. Free cash flow after regular  dividends was $843 million in fiscal 2013, but was negative $2.2 billion after  the payment of a $3 billion special dividend. FCF is expected to track between  $700 million - $1 billion over the next three years as capital expenditures move  to a range of $2.3 billion - $2.5 billion, from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2012, to  support a faster pace of new store growth. Looking ahead, Fitch expects comparable store sales (excluding fuel and foreign  exchange) will continue to continue to grow in the low-to-mid-single-digit  range, and that operating profitability will remain within its historical range. Costco issued $3.5 billion of 3, 5 and 7 year notes in December 2012, with the  proceeds used to pay a special dividend of $7 per share, or $3 billion. Together  with its normal dividend, dividends totalled $3.5 during fiscal 2013. The effect  of the note issuance was to increase adjusted leverage from 0.8x at fiscal  year-end 2012 to 1.6x at fiscal year-end 2013. Looking ahead, leverage is  expected to remain in the mid-1x range over the next two years, showing gradual  improvement on EBITDA growth. Leverage could decline to the low-1x range in  fiscal 2016 should the company repay with cash a $1.2 billion note maturity. Costco repurchased only $36 million of its shares in fiscal 2013, following $632  million of repurchases in fiscal 2012. Fitch expects ongoing share repurchases  will be financed with free cash flow and existing cash. Costco’s liquidity is solid. The company has maintained significant cash and  short-term investment balances ($6.1 billion at Sept. 1, 2013). The company does  not have a committed U.S. bank facility as it does not need to access the CP  market and can fund working capital internally. Positive: Continued strong operating momentum combined with a sustained  reduction in lease-adjusted leverage to the low-1x area could lead to a positive  rating action. Negative: Additional shareholder-friendly actions that push adjusted leverage to  the high-1x range for an extended period could lead to a negative rating action. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Costco Wholesale Corporation —IDR at ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured notes at ‘A+’; The Rating Outlook is Stable.",11192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-costcos-idr-at-a-outlook-s/rpt-fitch-affirms-costcos-idr-at-a-outlook-stable-idUSFit67712620131119

The bipartisan budget agreement reached late Tuesday would end three years of political confrontations and fiscal instability in Washington that climaxed in October with a partial government shutdown. A vote in the U.S. House of Representatives could come as soon as Thursday. “You’ve got stability on the fiscal side, at least in the immediate future,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. She said a case could be made for the U.S. central bank to wind down stimulus beginning in January or March, but “the market is increasingly fixated on the idea the Fed will pull the trigger this meeting.” The final Fed policy statement of the year is expected on Dec. 18, at the end of a two-day meeting. The Fed’s stimulus has been instrumental in a rally that has put the S&P; 500 on track to close its strongest year in more than a decade. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.60 points or 0.81 percent, to end at 15,843.53. The S&P; 500 slid 20.40 points or 1.13 percent, to close at 1,782.22. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 56.677 points or 1.4 percent, to finish at 4,003.813. It was the largest daily decline for each of the three major U.S. stock indexes since Nov. 7. The 25 percent rally in the S&P; 500 so far this year served as a reason for traders to sell some equities and lock in gains. The benchmark index slid throughout the day. “People are more concerned about locking in profits in positions that have had big gains this year,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “The fact we couldn’t hold 1,800 (in the S&P; 500) put people in ‘hit-the-sell-button mode’ as well,” he said. In one of the few items of market-moving news on Wednesday, Costco’s profit missed Wall Street’s estimates because of higher stock-based compensation expenses and spending on technology. Its shares fell 1.2 percent to close at $118.57. Laboratory Corp shares tumbled 11 percent to $88.25 after the medical testing company cut the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings forecast. The stock of rival Quest Diagnostics dropped 5.8 percent to $55.20. MasterCard announced a 10-for-1 stock split and a new $3.5 billion stock-buyback program, and raised its quarterly dividend by 83 percent. The news drove the stock up 3.5 percent to close at a record $790.57. Earlier, MasterCard hit a  lifetime intraday high at $801.14. Shares of its competitor Visa rose 3.1 percent to close at a record $205.66, helping to limit the Dow’s decline. Visa also reached a record intraday high at $207.90. Mining equipment maker Joy Global Inc forecast 2014 earnings below analysts’ estimates after reporting a quarterly profit that fell short of expectations as miners cut spending. The stock fell 5.5 percent to $53.15. Decliners beat advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of 4 to 1. On the Nasdaq, more than three issues fell for every one that rose.

211,COST,Higher operating expenses pinch Costco profit,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) reported a first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates, hurt by higher stock-based compensation expenses and spending on technology. Shares of the warehouse club operator, which sells everything from carrots to coffins at its cavernous stores, fell as much as 3 percent in morning trading on Wednesday. “While Costco has generally been prudent in controlling costs, Q1 selling, general and administrative (expense) was higher than we expected,” Cowen and Co analyst Faye Landes wrote in a note. Operating expenses rose 5.5 percent, while selling, general and administrative (SG&A;) expenses rose 7.2 percent in the quarter. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said employee stock option expenses rose due to a 24 percent year-over-year increase in the company’s stock price, which spurred vesting by long-term and senior employees. Stock option expenses reduced earnings by 2 cents per share in the quarter, while IT investments increased SG&A; expenses by $12 million, Galanti said on a conference call. Technology spending will remain high through fiscal 2014 ending October and perhaps beyond that, Galanti said. S&P; Capital IQ analyst Ian Gordon said that while operating expenses were higher than he expected, gross margins were strong despite widespread discounting. Janney Montgomery Scott analyst David Strasser said the company’s gross margin of 10.8 percent was better than his estimate of 10.7 percent. The company’s profit rose to $425 million, or 96 cents per share, in the first quarter ended November 24 from $416 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 5 percent to $24.47 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $25.35 billion. The company announced quarterly sales last week. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 percent, including the impact of lower gasoline prices and a stronger dollar. Analysts on average were expecting same-store sales to rise 3.54 percent. Excluding fuel and forex, same-store sales rose 5 percent. Rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reported a third-straight quarterly decline in U.S. same-store sales last month and forecast a lower-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter. Costco, whose members pay up to $110 per year to shop at its big stores and website, operates 648 warehouses, including 461 in the United States and Puerto Rico. It also has stores in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan and other Asian countries.

The bipartisan agreement, reached late Tuesday, would end three years of impasse and fiscal instability in Washington that culminated in October with a partial government shutdown. But while the deal removes a large overhang of uncertainty for markets, it may also increase the possibility that the Fed may soon scale back its $85 billion-a-month stimulus that has fueled a stock market rally of nearly 26 percent this year. In September, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke cited tight fiscal policy as one concern when the central bank surprised market participants by keeping the stimulus intact. A budget showdown in Congress ultimately led to a partial government shutdown in October. The Fed’s final policy statement of the year is expected on Dec. 18, at the end of its two-day meeting, its last in 2013. “There is some profit taking, but also there is always going to be fear about what the Fed is going to do,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer of Warren Financial Service in Exton, Pennsylvania. “The market is always concerned they are going to get the timing and the quantity wrong.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.65 points or 0.55 percent, to 15,884.48. The S&P; 500 slid 13.95 points or 0.77 percent, to 1,788.67. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 40.211 points or 0.99 percent, to 4,020.279.

A bipartisan budget deal announced in the U.S. Congress late Tuesday, though modest in spending cuts, would end three years of impasse and fiscal instability in Washington that culminated in October with a partial government shutdown. While the agreement removed a key uncertainty hanging over markets, some expect it will strengthen a view that the U.S. central bank may soon start to scale back its $85 billion-a-month stimulus program. “The market did not have ample time to properly examine the potential impact (of the budget deal on Fed’s stimulus program). The expectation of tapering is definitely among investors and we will have to see how everything plays out,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.

221,COST,UPDATE 3-Discounts slam U.S. retailers' holiday season profits,"By Phil Wahba NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Many large U.S. retailers slashed their earnings forecasts on Thursday because of steep discounts they offered during the holidays to persuade reluctant consumers. The discounts boosted overall industry sales but hurt profits at many chains, including L Brands Inc, Family Dollar Stores Inc and teen retailer Zumiez Inc. Even retailers that reported big sales gains, like Kay Jewelers parent Signet Jewelers Ltd, were not spared. Fewer store visits and aggressive pricing at the start of the season by big retailers like Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc left many chains with little choice but to offer sweeter deals. Many also had too much holiday merchandise, which was ordered in late spring when retail executives were feeling upbeat. “The discounts needed to be deeper, and they needed to be longer,” said Joel Bines, managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners. The discounts did result in a stronger-than-expected 2.4 percent increase in December sales at nine retailers tracked by the Thomson Reuters Same-Store Sales Index. Still, L Brands cut its holiday-quarter profit forecast on disappointing December sales at its Victoria Secret and La Senza chains. While L Brands’ sales at stores open at least year rose 2 percent last month, Wall Street had been expecting a gain of 3.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s shares fell more than 4 percent. Zumiez reported an unexpected drop in same-store sales. Shares of Signet, which is not part of the same-store sales index, were down more than 6 percent even though it reported a 5 percent increase in U.S. same-store sales for the November-December holiday season. Gap Inc reported a lower-than-expected 1 percent increase in comparable sales, hurt by weak business at its Old Navy chain, but the retailer said it was “comfortable” its full-year profit would come in at the high end of its own forecast range. Shares rose 2 percent in after hours trading. Sears Holdings, which is not in the same-store sales index, reported dismal holiday results at its namesake and KMart stores. Its shares tumbled after hours. Toys R Us, also not in the index, said same-store sales were up 1.8 percent at its U.S. stores. Between Nov. 3 and Jan. 4, eight retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Macy’s Inc , increased the number of circulars published by 6 percent and sent 57 percent more promotional e-mails, according to data prepared for Reuters by MarketTrack. Retailers also had to deal with shoppers who were less willing to go into stores: Data firm ShopperTrak this week said foot traffic had dropped 14.6 percent this holiday season. Walgreen Co, whose comparable sales of general merchandise rose 2.5 percent in December, said fewer shoppers had come to its drugstores. Small clothing chain Cato Corp also slashed its profit forecast after reporting poor December sales. Still, some retailers offering staples at low prices fared well. Warehouse club chain Costco Wholesale Corp  reported a 5 percent gain in U.S. same-store sales for December, while Wall Street was expecting only 1 percent. American Eagle Outfitters Inc said comparable sales for November and December fell 7 percent and that it expected its quarterly profit to come in at the bottom of its earlier forecast range of 26 cents to 30 cents per share. Family Dollar’s same-store sales fell 3 percent last month.

222,COST,Obama promotes retirement savings plan on State of Union road trip,"WEST MIFFLIN, Pennsylvania (Reuters) - President Barack Obama set in motion a plan to help middle-income Americans save for retirement on Wednesday on a road trip to highlight themes from a State of the Union speech devoted to narrowing the gap between the rich and poor. At events at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh and earlier at a Costco retail store in outside Washington, Obama made good on his promise in Tuesday’s speech to focus on reducing income inequality - with or without the cooperation of Congress. Obama signed a presidential order directing Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to establish a government-backed investment option called myRA that permits people with little to no savings to set aside as little as $5 in payroll deductions. “If you worked hard all your life, you deserve a secure retirement,” Obama told about 1,500 plant workers. The program seeks to address the problem that Americans have not made proper plans to set aside money for their old age and have neither pensions nor a 401(k) retirement savings plan. The myRA plan is similar to the tax-advantageous Roth Individual Retirement Account, but with investment holdings backed by the U.S. government like savings bonds. The accounts would be available to households earning no more than $191,000 a year. Some Republicans expressed concerns about the go-it-alone strategy Obama adopted on Tuesday night. Asked at a Wall Street Journal breakfast about the president’s plans to make changes through executive orders when stymied by Congress, Republican Senator Marco Rubio said they were “deeply counterproductive to making progress.” “All presidents get frustrated with the congressional branch. This president seems to have an extra frustration with it and reacts to it through unilateral actions that I think are counterproductive and in my opinion in some instances borderline unconstitutional,” said Rubio, a potential 2016 presidential candidate. At the Costco store in Lanham, Md., flanked by boxes of paper towels and garbage bags, Obama said that in coming weeks he would sign an executive order raising to $10.10 an hour the minimum wage for federal contract workers. But he said Congress must act to raise it for millions of other American workers. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. “If you work hard, you should be able to pay your rent, buy your groceries, look after your kids,” Obama said at the big-box retail store, whose wage practices he had praised. “If you put in a hard day’s work you deserve decent pay for it.” Obama noted that many state governors had already taken steps to raise the minimum wage in their states. “While Congress decides whether it’s going to raise the minimum wage or not, people outside of Washington are not waiting, and I’m not either,” he said. Obama’s travel had a political motive. He is trying to help Democrats win seats in November’s congressional elections by focusing on a popular theme that touches on the economy and income inequality. (For a Reuters graphic on U.S. minimum wage and poverty, see link.reuters.com/nuw46v) Obama’s action on the minimum wage will affect only a relatively small number of workers, but it drew praise from members of his Democratic Party who were discouraged by the flawed roll-out of his signature healthcare reform law last fall. “The increase in the minimum wage is a very powerful message. It resonates across the country,” said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. “I think this will really give some wind to this year’s Obama agenda.” Republicans oppose a broad increase in the minimum wage, saying it could cause employers to cut jobs and harm the economy. The president’s determination to resort more to executive action follows a year in which his policy proposals failed to gain traction in a divided Congress, in which Republicans control the House of Representatives. Vice President Joe Biden, however, said in television interviews on Wednesday that the president did want to work with Congress and was confident of cooperation in some key areas, including reform of immigration policy. House Republicans plan to discuss immigration during a three-day retreat in Maryland starting on Wednesday but conservatives in the party were wary about moving forward on the issue. “We’re ready to work with the Congress,” Biden told NBC’s “Today” program. The low public approval rate for the legislature, many of whose members face elections in November, would help motivate them to action, he said. Democrats are trying to reinforce the image of Obama, whose poll numbers are low, as a hero of the middle class, much as he presented himself during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. “Raising the minimum wage is not just a matter of fairness or a means of combating inequality; it is also needed to jumpstart our economy,” the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington think tank, said in a statement.

223,COST,Analysis: Obama's nod to trade leaves tough work ahead in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama’s nod to trade in his annual State of the Union address reflects a delicate political dance and leaves the hard work still ahead in convincing a skeptical Congress to get behind free trade deals. Business lobbyists had hoped Obama would explicitly urge lawmakers to back a bill giving the White House authority to negotiate free trade pacts and put them before Congress for an up-or-down vote, without amendments. This so-called “fast-track authority” is a litmus test of support for two massive free trade deals currently under negotiation which would create a network of trading nations covering roughly two-thirds of global trade. But in recognition of a tricky political juggling act ahead, Obama stopped short of that mark. He did, however, devote four sentences to the need for trade and trade promotion authority (TPA) to “protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped ‘Made in the USA.’” “There are all kinds of political landmines on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of Congress that have to be overcome,” said National Association of Manufacturers President Jay Timmons on Wednesday. “The speech is important to set the tone but action is what is most critical, and we are going to have to see if the words are backed up by concrete action by the administration - my sense is yes.” Forging stronger trade links with countries on the Pacific Rim is part of the U.S. administration’s move to engage more with Asia, while a tie-up with the European Union seeks to level regulatory differences between the world’s biggest economies. But Obama has to walk a fine line in gauging how much he can publicly lobby for fast-track power without misstepping in Congress which must be persuaded to cede some power in order for the administration to seal the deals. Trade is deeply divisive in a country which, although it is the world’s second-biggest exporter, has the lowest level of exports for the size of its economy of any Group of 20 developed and emerging powers, except Brazil. Opposition to free trade deals, and by extension fast-track power, comes partly from consumer groups, environmentalists and unions, a power base for Obama’s Democrats, many of whom worry about lost jobs and weaker labor and environmental standards. More than 550 lobby groups have written to lawmakers urging them to vote against a TPA bill introduced in the House and Senate and opponents released a poll of 816 voters showing 62 percent were opposed to fast-track power for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). “Trade agreements are no longer just about tariffs and quotas. They are about the food we eat, the air we breathe, the jobs we hold. We cannot abdicate this process to non-elected representatives,” said Larry Cohen, president of the Communications Workers of America, which co-sponsored the poll. But opposition also comes from some Republicans. Conservative Tea Party groups have launched a campaign urging lawmakers to insist on their right to closely scrutinize free trade deals and avoid giving more power to the president. “I don’t trust his decision-making process and the American people should not either,” Republican Paul Broun told reporters on Tuesday. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, are lobbying hard from the other side. An analysis of Twitter hashtags used about the speech by social media analysis firm Crimson Hexagon showed heavy traffic on trade issues, a sign of how some groups have mobilized supporters against expanding trade deals. The numbers game to be played out in Congress is complicated by the likely departure of TPA advocate and Senate Finance Committee chair Max Baucus, nominated as U.S. ambassador to China, as well as looming mid-term elections. Baucus is co-sponsoring the bill in the Senate with Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the panel. Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which also has jurisdiction over trade, is doing the honors single-handedly in the House. The whole 435-member House is up for re-election in November, along with 36 of the 100 Senate seats. Both Democrats, who control the Senate, and Republicans, who have the numbers in the House, want to keep what they already have and make gains into the other party’s territory. Winning support for a politically unpopular bill just ahead of an election is a tough task for the Obama administration. The job is made tougher by the reticence of many Republicans to hand a Democratic president what may look like a political victory. Obama is relying on U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, highly regarded for his White House connections and behind-the-scenes negotiating skills, to do the heavy lifting to push a TPA bill through. Froman is on the Hill nearly every day Congress is in session, meeting with Democrats and Republicans about the TPA and the trade agenda, a USTR spokeswoman said. “The reality is that the White House needs to bring in Democratic votes in both chambers of Congress to pass TPA,” said Eric Shimp, policy adviser at law firm Alston and Bird and a former senior trade official. “Both industry and Congress will now wait to see if the White House legislative affairs shop swings into motion to help USTR Froman make the pitch for TPA. If he’s flying solo in these coming weeks, we’ll have our answer.” Froman and his staff have their work cut out for them. Senate leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, urged policymakers on Wednesday to go slow. “Everyone would be well advised just to not push this right now,” he told reporters. In the House, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means committee, Sander Levin, is mulling an alternative TPA bill, and 151 of the 200-strong House Democratic caucus wrote to Obama in November to say they would oppose TPA. A group of 22 House Republicans made a similar complaint. The New Democrats, a 53-strong body which is more aligned with business and trade than union-backed colleagues from the party’s left, could be a more fertile ground for TPA votes. The group plans to introduce a bill early next week to extend until 2020 a program making it easier for workers displaced by trade to get benefits and retraining. The bill would go hand in hand with the TPA and could help win Democrat support, but at the risk of alienating Republicans. Republican Representative Erik Paulsen said the bipartisan Free Trade Working Group was trying to convince fellow lawmakers of the benefits of trade, especially given 90 new members had joined the House since the last batch of trade deals passed. “It’s imperative now that we go through this education process once again with these new members,” he told a lunch organized by the Economic Club of Minnesota. “We really need to work hard to end the myths surrounding TPA.” As mid-year approaches, U.S. lawmakers will increasingly turn their attention to re-election efforts, meaning the window to pass the TPA is very narrow. If not passed by May or June, the timeline could easily slip into 2015 and further drag on the TPP talks, which involve nations from Japan to New Zealand and Chile. Countries hope to wrap up a deal by April, when Obama plans an Asian trip. “We would welcome the passing of the TPA as soon as possible,” the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, told a forum on Wednesday. “Unless the United States has it, people might be worried about what would happen if there is a negotiation result and lots of proposals and changes take place, nobody would be seriously negotiating to find a landing zone.” ",1292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-analysis/analysis-obamas-nod-to-trade-leaves-tough-work-ahead-in-congress-idUSBREA0S1DM20140129

228,COST,Tax benefit helps boost Q4 profits at Mexico's Comerci,"MEXICO CITY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Mexican retailer Comercial Mexicana on Wednesday reported a sharp jump in fourth-quarter profit, boosted by a tax benefit related to the sale of its 50 percent stake in the local arm of warehouse chain Costco in 2012. The company known commonly as Comerci, which last month said it was considering selling itself, reported a profit of 2.24 billion pesos ($171 million), up from 363 million pesos in the year-earlier quarter. On a before-tax basis, the company’s profit rose 20 percent to 626 million pesos from 519 million pesos in the year-earlier quarter, helped by slightly higher sales as well as lower finance costs. Net revenue rose by 2.9 percent compared with the same quarter a year earlier to 11.92 billion pesos. Family-owned Comerci is Mexico’s No. 4 supermarket chain by revenue. It has fared better than its larger rivals amid a downturn in consumer spending in Mexico. The Mexico City-based company, which went through a prepackaged bankruptcy in 2010, has trimmed its debt load in the last few years, helped by selling the Costco stake. Comerci shares closed down 2.13 percent at 52.03 pesos. ",2272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-comerci/tax-benefit-helps-boost-q4-profits-at-mexicos-comerci-idUSL1N0LV2HI20140227

Bad weather and six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas prompted many U.S. retailers to offer deeper discounts and increase promotions to lure shoppers. Weaker gross margins, particularly during the holiday shopping season, and lower international profit due to a weakening of foreign exchange rates hurt earnings in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a conference call with analysts. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world’s largest retailer, last month blamed sharp cuts in food stamp benefits and higher payroll taxes for a disappointing full-year profit forecast. At Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart’s warehouse chain that competes with Costco, sales at stores open at least a year - a key retail metric called same-store sales - fell 0.1 percent in the quarter ended Jan. 31. In contrast, Costco’s sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 percent in the second quarter ended Feb. 16. The company’s comparable sales rose 2 percent in February, missing the average analyst estimate of an increase of 2.3 percent. Costco said February sales were hurt by club closures prevalent across the United States, Canada and even in Japan due to frequent snow storms. Even so, Nomura analyst Robert Drbul said Costco’s consistent low-mid single digit traffic gains over the last year in spite of the challenging retail environment was “particularly encouraging”. “We continue to believe the fundamentals of the company are intact,” Drbul said. The warehouse club operator, which offers discounted merchandise to members, said membership renewals had improved in the quarter. “Our renewal rates continue at record levels and we continue to see increasing penetration of the executive membership,” CFO Galanti said. Executive members are the company’s highest spending customers and represent about 38 percent of total cardholders. They pay an annual fee of $110 and are eligible for a 2 percent annual reward. New membership sign-ups rose 13 percent in the quarter, mainly driven by new stores in Japan and Australia. “High renewal rates, strong new sign-ups and accelerating square footage growth for the next few years, all point to the secular strength of this story,” Janney Capital analyst David Strasser said. Costco’s sales rose 6 percent to $25.76 billion in the quarter, missing the average analyst estimate of $26.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding fuel and forex, same-store sales rose 5 percent in the 12 week-period. The company’s net profit fell to $463 million, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter from $547 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier.

The Nasdaq 100 was down 0.2 percent, led lower by Staples, which lost 15 percent to $11.39 after the largest U.S. office supplies retailer forecast a decline in sales. Staples also said it would close up to 225 stores in the United States and Canada by 2015. In a boost to riskier assets, the euro hit its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late December after the European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold. But the overall sentiment remained cautious over tensions between Ukraine and Russia, boosting investors’ appetite for hedges against a market decline. Crimea’s parliament voted on Thursday to join Russia and its Moscow-backed government set a referendum for March 16 on the decision, in an escalation of the crisis between Russia and the West over the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula. An index of Moscow stocks lost more than 2 percent after the vote in Crimea, but pared the losses and was down 1 percent. The rouble weakened 0.4 percent versus the U.S. dollar. A U.S.-traded Russian ETF fell 1.3 percent to $23.37. “Nobody wants to go to war, and Russians don’t want to get their market cut in half, so that eventually has to settle down,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. Manley said the call for a referendum can be seen as a cooling of the crisis as politics prevail over a possible armed conflict. In a press conference on Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama called on Congress to support the International Monetary Fund’s capacity to lend to Ukraine. In the options market, put buying in the SPDR S&P; 500 ETF  continued, with the weekly $185 and $187 strikes that expire on Friday garnering the most interest as of Wednesday’s close, according to Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. The ETF was up 0.4 percent at $188.34. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.28 points or 0.41 percent, to 16,427.46. The S&P; 500 gained 3.51 points or 0.19 percent, to 1,877.32. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 7.36 points or 0.17 percent, to 4,350.614. The S&P; 500 climbed to an all-time intraday high of 1,881.94 earlier in the session. The Nasdaq, which had traded higher for most of the day, turned negative in late afternoon trading. Costco Wholesale Corp was down 1.8 percent at $114 after the warehouse retailer reported a bigger-than-expected 15 percent fall in quarterly profit as unusually deep discounting in the holiday shopping season hurt margins. Stocks in the basic materials, financial and industrial sectors, often associated with strong economic fundamentals, ranked among the S&P; 500’s biggest gainers. The S&P; basic materials index was up 0.4 percent, while the S&P; financial index was up 0.8 percent and the S&P; industrials index was up 0.5 percent. Weekly applications for U.S. unemployment insurance fell to 323,000, the lowest in three months, a sign of strength in a labor market that has been hobbled by severe weather. New orders for U.S. factory goods, however, fell more than expected in January and shipments also slipped, adding to signs of a recent slowdown in manufacturing activity.

The company’s profit fell to $463 million, or $1.05 per share, for the 12 weeks ended Feb. 16 from $547 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier.

Sales rose 6 percent to $25.76 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $26.65 billion. Weaker gross margins, particularly during the four-week holiday selling season, and lower international profit due to weakening of foreign exchange rates hurt the results, Richard Galanti, chief financial officer, said.

239,COST,"U.S. wholesale inventories rise, but sales drop sharply","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected in January, as companies built up stocks of autos and machinery, though sales posted their largest decline in nearly five years. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent to $521.2 billion after a revised 0.4 percent gain in December. Economists polled by Reuters expected stocks of unsold goods at wholesalers to rise 0.4 percent in January. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product, and strength in that category added 0.14 percentage point to the economy’s annual growth pace in the fourth quarter. Excluding autos, wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent in January. This component goes into the calculation of GDP. Economists believe the current inventory level is unsustainable and expect the build-up in unsold stocks to eventually reverse. The value of automotive stocks rose 2.2 percent in the first month of the year, while machinery stocks were up 1.3 percent. Sales at wholesalers fell 1.9 percent in January, their biggest drop since March 2009, compared to a revised 0.1 percent increase the prior month. Economists had forecast sales to edge up 0.2 percent. Sales of non-durable equipment such as petroleum and paper products dropped 3.2 percent, the sharpest fall since December 2008. At January’s sales pace it would take 1.2 months to clear shelves, compared to December’s pace of 1.18 months.

240,COST,"Kraft challenged by ""healthier"" macaroni and cheese brands","LOS ANGELES, March 30 (Reuters) - Kraft Macaroni & Cheese has been a favorite meal for generations of American children, but smaller brands made with more natural ingredients are starting to nibble at its market share, part of a trend that is biting into growth at large U.S. food companies. Zenobia Godschalk, an Atlanta mother of two young boys, stopped buying Kraft’s “mac and cheese” after reading its complicated ingredient list. Now she buys Annie’s organic version in bulk at Costco Wholesale Corp. “I’m fully aware that it is not a health food,” said Godschalk, of Annie’s macaroni and cheese product. “But the ability to make it just a little bit better, and the color that I can believe comes somewhat naturally is good.” Sales of macaroni and cheese are growing as busy Americans look for convenient and inexpensive meal options and older consumers indulge in the comfort foods of their youth. Kraft Foods Group Inc still dominates the category, but the battle for the hearts and minds of American mac-and-cheese lovers may become a new front in a running war in the $360 billion U.S. packaged food industry. On one side stand established food companies like Kraft, which seem more focused on slashing costs than taking big risks on emerging trends. The challengers are more nimble upstarts catering to rapidly evolving consumer tastes by offering products in the fast-growing “health and wellness” category. “Even though individual companies by size are quite small, in aggregate they’re more on trend with consumer demand and pose a threat to Big Food over time,” said Consumer Edge Research analyst Robert Dickerson. Nestle SA’s Gerber baby food division and General Mills Inc’s Yoplait yogurt business may each offer a cautionary tale for Kraft. Both led their respective categories, but their market shares tumbled in recent years. In Gerber’s case, it was the growing popularity of small organic baby-food brands. In Yoplait’s, it was the arrival of Chobani Greek yogurt, which has more protein and a thick, creamy texture that struck a chord with consumers. Kraft dominates the U.S. market for packaged macaroni and cheese, but its share fell to 78 percent this month from 82 percent in March 2010, according to Consumer Edge data. A key rival is Annie’s Inc, whose natural and organic foods were once sold only at specialty retailers like Whole Foods Market Inc but are now available at Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Kroger Co and other mass-market grocers. Catering to middle- and low-income consumers can transform brands from niche players to powerhouses. Annie’s macaroni and cheese share grew to 7 percent this month from 5 percent in March 2010, according to Consumer Edge. WhiteWave Foods Co’s Horizon brand, the No. 1 U.S. organic dairy purveyor by sales, also is coming on strong. Its  new macaroni and cheese already is sold by natural and mainstream grocers. Analysts bet the big-box retailers, which stock Horizon’s organic milk and cheeses, will soon follow. Kraft, with net revenue of more than $18 billion last year, has said its macaroni and cheese business generates more than $500 million in annual sales. It also has an organic version, but distribution is limited. Dollar sales for Kraft’s macaroni and cheese last year rose more than 1 percent. But because the category grew at a faster rate than Kraft’s sales growth, the company’s share declined slightly, a spokesman said. Kraft, which also sells Velveeta, Cheez Whiz and Jell-O, is tweaking some items with its more mainstream customers in mind, including adding whole grain and removing artificial colors from some macaroni and cheese products. It also took artificial preservatives out of its Kraft Singles processed cheese. “Consumers (are) seeking more fresh, real foods that are made with simple ingredient lines, and we have to think that this is more than just a premium trend,” Kraft Chief Executive Tony Vernon said at a recent industry conference in Boca Raton, Florida. “We are democratizing health and wellness, we are not marketing to the 1 percent.” Some experts estimate that health and wellness brands account for roughly 10 percent of overall packaged food sales. Organics and Greek yogurt fall into the category, as well as gluten-free products for special dietary needs. A recent survey from consultancy AlixPartners showed that so-called “superusers,” defined as individuals who spend 40 percent or more of their budget in the health and wellness category, are most willing to pay a premium of 10 percent or more for locally-sourced or organic products. Large packaged food companies, under pressure to change from parents and anti-obesity activists including first lady Michelle Obama, have made incremental moves into health and wellness. Like Kraft, they tend to rework existing products to be “better for you” by removing fat or sodium, or by adding fiber or vitamins. They have also bought small but successful health and wellness brands that end up accounting for just a tiny slice of overall revenue. Some food industry observers warn that there could be a limit to how long large companies can resist consumers’ stepped-up demands for changes. “The food industry is at a tipping point,” said Stephen Hughes, chief executive of Boulder Brands Inc, which makes Smart Balance spread. Boulder was a pioneer in removing artery-clogging trans fats from its products and is taking out ingredients with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The industry’s big players won’t start taking more risks until “the cost of not changing exceeds the cost of changing,” Hughes said.

241,COST,Costco March same-store sales beat estimates,"April 10 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp said March same-store sales increased 5 percent, helped by an extra day in the period and a shift in the timing of Easter. Analysts had expected a 3.5 percent rise in Costco’s same-store sales, including fuel sales, for the five weeks ended April 6, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Easter falls on April 20 this year, while it was on March 31 last year. “This calendar shift positively impacted this year’s net and comparable sales by an estimated one to one and one-half percent,” Costco said. March net sales rose 8 percent to $10.43 billion. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and gasoline prices, same-store sales rose 7 percent. International same-store sales for March, excluding fuel, jumped 9 percent. Sales rose in Japan where shoppers bought more before the country hiked its sales tax from April 1, said the company which operates 650 warehouses across the world. Costco, which competes with BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s Sam’s Club, offers everyday items below supermarket prices, hoping customers will buy other goods as well. It usually prices gasoline lower than competing stations.

242,COST,Learn the secret codes to shopping success,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As superstore pricing mysteries go, it’s not the equivalent of “The Da Vinci Code,” but there’s still something deliciously elusive about the so-called “Costco Code” that has set the tongues of shopping mavens wagging for the past several months. At least the plot line is direct enough: If you can interpret what the various sequences of digits and asterisks mean on Costco Wholesale Club price signs, you’re on your way to scoring serious bargains. Here’s how it works, according to Costco shoppers spreading the word online: If a price at Costco ends in .99, you’re paying full price. But if it ends in, say, a .97, it represents a deal with a special price decided by the manager. And if you happen to see an asterisk in the upper right corner of the sign, then the item is on its way out of the store—and probably at the lowest price you’re going to see. ""That asterisk, that's the holy grail,"" says Kyle James, who runs the shopping blog Rather-Be-Shopping.com (www.rather-be-shopping.com/). He has shopped at Costco for 20 years now, and the Redding, California resident has studied the matter of the Costco Code well. By his count, he and his wife have saved at least $300 using the Costco Code over the last seven months. For the record, he doesn’t claim to have discovered it; he says there’s been Internet chatter about Costco and its pricing system going back about five years before he took up the topic on his blog. So is the Costco Code really so much of a pricing potboiler as it seems? No one would know as well as Costco’s Richard Galanti, who’s the company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. Indeed he confirms that the codes do exist, though “It’s more for efficiency, for the employees,” Galanti says. “It’s not any sort of secret agent stuff. But you see it on a blog and people think it’s a secret. It’s just a way of moving some merchandise, to help the fork lift operators and the stocking clerks.” Galanti says that “when a price ends in a ‘7,’ usually it’s a buyer designated markdown.” And as for those asterisks, “That’s what we call a pending delete. Sometimes an item’s not selling well and we want to move it out, or it could be the end of the season. Let’s say we’ve got three TV models and the latest and greatest comes out; we might want to bring the newest one in.” But Galanti cautions against reading too much into the price codes, as Costco’s margins are low enough (in the 10-11 percent range) that a shopper might have more advantage buying a newer item at the “.99” full price. “The question is, do you want something at the end of its season or at the beginning of a new season?” he asks. Retail experts say that such pricing codes and systems are common. At his website, James lists price tag codes that he’s found for retailers under the juicy heading “Retailer’s Big Secret: Crack the Price Tag Code.” Paula Rosenblum, managing partner of RSR Research, a retail technology research and advisory firm says Home Depot indicator is a green tag, while at Office Depot , anything with a price other than 00, 50 or 99 is a markdown. As for why, chalk it up to something not quite as old as the human desire to crack secret codes, though it does predate computers and the digital age. “It all goes back to the retail method of accounting, and it’s a very old story,” Rosenblum says. “Before the days of price scanners, and when there was no technology in the store at all, a seven at the end of a price let associates know where they were with the item. If they couldn’t move it in three weeks, it was gone.” Still, she can’t help throwing in an observation for consumers who choose to make note of the code, and where asterisks are most likely to appear: “Costco’s non-food items don’t always move fast enough, so those might be good items to add to the treasure hunt.” Much of James’ information from comes from chatting up employees (many of whom have requested anonymity). At Target, for example, he says that the discounting system on clearance items, as told to him by a sales associate, goes like this: “They mark something down every 10 to 15 days. And the upper right hand corner of the clearance tag, which is red and white, has the numbers 15, 30, 50, 75 or 90 on it. And that number indicates the percentage off the original price.” Target would not confirm it uses such a mechanism. “It is not possible to determine the final markdown or timing of the price change from the item’s current price,” Target spokesman Evan Lapiska said. But Lewis says his key advice for fellow shoppers on the hunt for price tag secrets is this: “Talk to the employees on the floor. I’ve found they’re pretty open about it.” (Follow us @ReutersMoney or here Editing by Beth Pinsker and Andrew Hay)",4162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-shopping-codes/learn-the-secret-codes-to-shopping-success-idUSBREA3F16L20140416

Merchandise costs in the quarter ended May 11 rose about 7 percent to $22.55 billion while selling, general and administrative expenses rose about 8 percent. Net income for the quarter rose to $473 million, or $1.07 per share, from $459 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Net sales at the largest U.S. warehouse operator rose 7 percent to $25.23 billion.

247,COST,U.S. retailers beat sales expectations in May,"(Reuters) - Average sales growth at 10 U.S. retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Rite Aid Corp, topped expectations in May for a second month in a row as shoppers headed to malls in droves around the Memorial Day weekend, according Thomson Reuters data. Sales at established stores on average rose 4.4 percent in May, higher than the 3.9 percent increase analysts had estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters’ same-store sales index. The May increase followed a growth spurt in April, when same-store sales for the group rose 6.4 percent, buoyed by the release of pent-up demand after a harsh winter that had kept many consumers home. Most of the retail group, which excludes giants such as Walmart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Best Buy Co, exceeded or equaled sales growth in May 2013. “It’s not just warm weather,” said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. “In comparison, temperatures were nearly identical to last year. Presumably [the change] is more fundamental.”  Niemira said he expected sales activity to moderate in June after April and May’s robust growth. The data is more evidence that the U.S. economy is picking up momentum after slowing during the winter, when weather was colder than usual in many parts of the country. Costco (COST.O) reported a 6 percent increase, stronger than the 4.8 percent that analysts had expected, and its shares rose more than 1 percent on Thursday. By contrast, apparel retailers were ahead of May forecasts, but their sales growth slowed after a strong April.    Gap Inc (GPS.N) reported 1 percent growth in comparable sales in May, compared with 7 percent growth in May 2013. L Brands Inc (LB.N), which owns brands such as Victoria’s Secret, managed a 3 percent comparable sales increase after 8 percent growth in April.    Drugstore operators Rite Aid (RAD.N) and Walgreen Co WAG.N posted an average sales increase of 4.1 percent, slightly lower than analysts’ estimates, but higher than the average 2.8 percent growth they had recorded in May 2013.

252,COST,"Oregon man sues Costco, claims store security broke his leg","PORTLAND Ore. (Reuters) - An Oregon man has sued Costco for $670,000, claiming store security detained him and broke his leg after he refused to show his receipt when exiting the building. Timothy Walls says in his Multnomah County Circuit Court lawsuit, which was filed last week, that when he tried to leave a Portland Costco store with $102.66 in purchases in January last year, an employee grabbed his shopping cart and told him to present his receipt for inspection. When Walls refused, another Costco employee used a “martial arts type strike” that fractured his leg in multiple locations, according to his civil complaint. Walls’s attorney said Tuesday that the litigation is about much more than the broken leg. “We have, throughout the country, observed big box stores that have implemented policies to check all receipts at the door,” lawyer Clayton Morrison said. “They can have that policy. But if the person refuses to show their receipt, what is lawful for the store? Can they detain you?” Costco could have prohibited Wells from returning to the store, but forcing him to stay with no reason to suspect him of a crime amounted to “unlawful holding,” Morrison said. Costco’s lawyers have declined to discuss the case with the media, but in court filings they said that Walls attacked first. The members-only warehouse box store in its court filings said that Walls refused to show his receipt, then threw an employee against a wall and struck him in the throat after the worker called for a manager to resolve the dispute. Walls’s injuries were “the sole and direct cause of Plaintiff’s own actions,” Costco said in the court papers. Walls is asking for $500,000 for pain and suffering, $150,000 for medical expenses and $20,000 for lost wages, and has requested a jury trial. A trial date has not yet been set.

253,COST,Costco profit tops estimates for first time in five quarters,"(Reuters) - Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp’s (COST.O) profit topped analysts’ estimates for the first time in five quarters, helped by strong back-to-school sales and higher membership fees. Costco’s shares rose as much as 3 percent to a record high of $128.95 on Wednesday. The company’s strong results are a bright spot in a retail industry that has struggled to attract customers, who have been curbing spending due to stagnant wages and higher taxes. Costco, which caters to relatively higher-income customers than Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), reported a 7 percent increase in same-store sales, excluding fuel, in the quarter ending Aug. 31.  Wealthier U.S. shoppers are likely to drive sales in the holiday season even as retailers slash prices to cope with tighter budgets, analysts have said.  Costco said it was running promotions to boost sales and memberships as it heads into the holiday shopping season. Costco, which has 185,000 employees globally, said it did not plan any changes to its healthcare benefits. “We haven’t and aren’t going to make major changes like cutting a bunch of people out of it,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a conference call with analysts. Wal-Mart, the biggest U.S. private sector employer, said on Tuesday it would end benefits for some part-time staff.  Costco’s same-store sales rose 6 percent in September, edging past the average analyst estimate of a 5.9 percent growth. Same-store sales, excluding the drug retailers, are expected to have risen 4.1 percent in September, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Last year, they rose 1.7 percent. Sales in the month are expected to have been boosted by promotional activities to attract consumers for back-to-school shopping. Also, cooler weather arrived in late September and helped drive demand for fall merchandise. Costco’s net income rose 13 percent to $697 million, or $1.58 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Gross margin expanded 14 basis points to 10.7 percent, according to analysts.

The warehouse club operator said the online store would sell branded products, which would initially comprise food and healthcare goods, and store-branded products under its Kirkland Signature private label.  “This low capital entry will give Costco a good look at the Chinese opportunity with nominal capital investment,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser wrote in a note.

Costco said Tmall Global’s warehouse stores would help it cut logistics costs and delivery time. “Costco sees tremendous growth opportunities in China, especially in light of Chinese consumers’ increasing appetite for imported products,” Executive Vice President Jim Murphy said in a statement on Tuesday. The move is part of Costco’s push to grow its online business. Most U.S. retailers are struggling with falling store traffic as shoppers make more purchases online.

259,COST,Costco seeks China path that avoids Wal-Mart's potholes,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - By selling directly to Chinese consumers on Alibaba’s platform, a move announced Tuesday, Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST.O) aims to employ local knowledge and a low-cost structure to avoid missteps that caused even the world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N), to stumble. Many global retailers opening in China have struggled to find product mixes and store designs favored by local customers. Besides Wal-Mart, Best Buy (BBY.N), eBay (EBAY.O) and others have fallen short of expectations in one of the fastest-growing consumer markets. Costco’s virtual storefront on Alibaba Group Holding’s (BABA.N) Tmall is designed to help the warehouse store operator study consumer shopping habits with no brick-and-mortar costs and fewer risks, signaling a new approach to expanding in China.  “This shows Costco has learned from the mistakes made by companies like Wal-Mart and also those who were forced to exit the market like Home Depot (HD.N),” said Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services at Colliers International. Wal-Mart’s China sales in the second quarter grew 1.1 percent, but same-store sales, a key figure, declined 1.6 percent. David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart’s international division, acknowledged at the company’s investor conference Wednesday that China remains tough even after 17 years. “We are still very much focused on building our foundations,” he said. Early steps at times have been shaky. Wal-Mart stuck with its big-box format even though Chinese consumers prefer neighborhood stores. And its stores in China, including Sam’s Club warehouses, offered few high margin private-label goods until as recently as last year.  Even Wal-Mart’s “Everyday Low Prices” slogan backfired. Chinese consumers equate inexpensive with unsafe and value quality as much as bargain prices, retail consultants said.  Supply-chain problems came to a head in January when Wal-Mart recalled its popular “Five Spice” donkey meat after tests showed traces of fox meat. The recall followed episodes involving tainted milk and recycled “gutter oil” sold as cooking oil in the market. Despite the difficulties, Wal-Mart has become China’s third-largest retailer, behind Sun Art Retail Group Ltd and state-backed China Resources Enterprise Ltd, according to consultant Kantar Retail. Wal-Mart has made adjustments, too. Last December it announced plans to boost private-label sales to a 20 percent share within a decade, and Wal-Mart has built its own distribution centers to manage product quality.  “We’ve done a lot of work on building trust,” Cheesewright said. Costco’s decision to partner with Alibaba is designed to bring local credibility to the Issaquah, Washington-based retailer. China-based iResearch in July forecast sales of 2.76 trillion yuan ($446.6 billion) for the year, up 45.8 percent from 2013.  Virtual storefronts are a growing business on Tmall, one of the world’s fastest-growing business-to-consumer marketplaces, with a 50 percent share in China. Tmall lists more than 100,000 brands, about 2,000 of them foreign-made.   “Digital storefronts are a powerful tool to help shape what a retailer might want to do with a physical store,” said Marcie Merriman, executive director of retail strategy and customer engagement at EY.   Costco is opening in China with its well-regarded and high-margin private-label Kirkland brand, which sells everything from men’s shirts to laundry detergents, aimed at quality-conscious Chinese consumers.  Even so, price competition likely will be fierce with Yihaodian, a website in which Wal-Mart is majority owner. As part of an introductory “Shopping Spree” on Tmall, Costco offered four packs of Sensodyne toothpaste at 145 yuan, or $23.68, compared with 109 yuan on Yihaodian.  Partnering with Alibaba, a symbol of China’s economic maturation, may even provide political benefit, a concern at a time when foreign companies have found themselves jousting with the Chinese government.  “We believe (Costco’s) worry has always been that if they got it right in China, and returns exceeded the cost of capital, they would quickly gain a new partner in the Chinese government,” Janney Capital Markets said in a note. The tie-up with Alibaba is not without risk.  Costco’s plan to rely on Tmall warehouses to reduce logistics costs and shorten delivery times may risk creating logistics problems similar to those Wal-Mart has faced.  “Letting Alibaba handle a lot of their supply chain is a good short-term solution,” said Colliers’ Solanki. “But (product) safety is a big issue with supply chains in China, and that has to be managed well.”  Rob Howard, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based local delivery firm Grand Junction, said the Alibaba partnership could put Costco in a system that often favors local players.  “It’s more of a cobbled-together, relationship-driven infrastructure,” he said. “It’s hard for an external person to tap into that effectively, and Alibaba has that all nailed.” ",10162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-costco-wholesale-china-analysis/costco-seeks-china-path-that-avoids-wal-marts-potholes-idUSKCN0I52TH20141016
260,COST,Food costs eating into consumers' saving at the pump as holidays near,"(Reuters) - Martha Franco says she hadn’t really noticed the sharp drop in gasoline prices, even though the mother of three is always shuttling the kids around in her SUV. She has been paying closer attention to the soaring cost of meat instead. “Meat and grains. Actually it seems like the price of everything is going up,” Franco, 30, said following a visit to a Kmart discount store on the outskirts of Chicago, with her two youngest children and a bag of groceries in the shopping cart. Retailers hoping for a lift to the year-end shopping season see promise in gas prices, which last week fell below $3.00 for the first time since 2010. Those savings, along with the effect of lower heating fuel, could amount to more than $2 billion extra per month for consumers, analysts calculate, enough to buy a lot of holiday gifts. Franco’s attitude is a reality check on those hopes, though: higher food costs are eating into or eclipsing savings from gasoline, and a $2 billion jump in spending could be a much smaller bump after food inflation is taken into account. “People talk about gasoline prices but you can’t look at them in isolation,” said Craig Johnson, head of consultancy Customer Growth Partners (CGP). “We think the psychological effect of record food inflation, because it’s a bigger part of the family budget, is a key behavioral driver here.” Food prices, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts will rise 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year, is one of the main reasons CGP forecasts holiday spending to rise only 3.4 percent. Most other forecasts call for growth above 4 percent. Johnson estimates higher food prices will likely swipe about $10 billion out of consumer wallets in November and December compared with a year earlier, double the $5 billion boost expected from cheaper gasoline.  Food accounts for three times more of household budgets than the amount spent at the pump, and he believes food inflation is currently higher than USDA forecasts, running at a clip of 5 percent. The net impact of lower gas prices versus higher food costs will be felt most by lower income households, which on average  own fewer automobiles, said IHS economist Chris Christopher. Assuming the same amount of gas was bought both years, Christopher estimated consumers saved about $1.6 billion from lower gas prices in October versus the same month last year, while laying out $3.3 billion more on food.  “Remember everyone eats, but not everyone drives a car,” Christopher said. Fortunately for retailers, the fall in gas prices gathered steam and outstripped food inflation in the last month, leaving consumers with net savings of $760 million in October, compared with September, Christopher said.  The caution about food prices is not universal. Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, estimated a penny saved at the pump provides a $1 billion boost to consumers and that lower gas prices would have a broad, positive effect on the economy, even accounting for food prices. With gas trading at about 27 cents per gallon lower than last year, that translates into annualized savings of $27 billion. Still, retailers which offer gas, food as well as other items may be the best positioned, according to the companies themselves and analysts. Same store sales results by apparel and teen apparel retailers, especially Gap Inc, were among the biggest disappointments in October, according to Thomson Reuters data, while Costco Wholesale Corp did better than expected. Wal-Mart told investors last month that lower gas prices should help its business. On Thursday, citing fuel prices, Wells Fargo raised its earnings targets for convenience store chains Casey General Stores, The Pantry Inc and CST Brands, all three of which deal in groceries and sell gasoline. “Consumers only have so much money in their budget and when a commodity like fuel goes down in price, it has historically created ‘space’ for us to compete for a higher spend inside the store,” a CST official told Reuters.  Sears Holdings said that it too could benefit, noting shoppers at its Kmart chain were more sensitive to changes in gasoline and other prices. The fall in gas prices “will hopefully give them added shopping confidence heading into the holiday season,” said Imran Jooma, executive vice president of the holding firm. But standing outside the Chicago area Kmart, shopper Franco did not display such confidence. “Everything is so expensive and my husband’s salary has not increased,” she said.

261,COST,UPDATE 2-William Demant shares drop after forecast cut on Costco displacement,"(Adds CEO comments, background) By Ole Mikkelsen COPENHAGEN, Nov 13 (Reuters) - William Demant, the world’s second-largest hearing aid maker, cut its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday after its products were displaced by rival offerings at one of the biggest U.S. retailers, sending its shares down more than 9 percent. Demant said a deal by global leader Sonova to sell its Phonak-branded devices at hearing aid retail centres run by Costco Wholesale Corp had been won at the expense of its own Bernofon range. The Danish company did not give any third-quarter numbers in its trading update but reduced its guidance for 2014 earning per share growth to between 2 and 7 percent, from 5 to 10 percent. It shares were down 9.1 percent at 418.1 Danish crowns by 1057 GMT, pulling down compatriot GN Store Nord by more than 4 percent amid concerns of increased price competition across the sector. Demant Chief Executive Niels Jacobsen said Sonova’s deal had upset many independent hearing aid retailers, forcing Sonova to cut prices to them as well. “That is what put pressure on the prices,” Jacobsen told Reuters. “Our options are still to gain market share, but we can see we get lower prices for our products than a year or two ago.” Costco’s significance is shown its increasing market share in hearing aids. Analysts at Bernstein Research estimate Costco stores acccount for 10 percent of all devices sold in the U.S. private market. In the third quarter, Demant’s growth in sales of units globally was estimated to have exceeded its assumption of a 2 to 4 percent growth in the market overall, the company said. “Its core business ... is under pressure by competitors like GN Store Nord and Sonova,” said analyst Michael Jorgensen at brokerage Alm. Brand Markets, who has a “buy” rating on the stock. “William Demant just cannot execute at the same level due to price pressure, especially in the United States.” Demant also said it had calculated one-off losses due to “inaccuracies” on its balance sheet related to the acquisition of some 70 to 80 entities in the United States between 2011 and 2013. “Combined with an expected loss on a customer loan in the United States, this leads to a total one-off adjustment of our EBIT in 2014 of around 100 million Danish crowns,” it said. $1 = 5.9739 Danish crown)   (Editing by Sabina Zawadzki and David Holmes)",11132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/william-demant-results/update-2-william-demant-shares-drop-after-forecast-cut-on-costco-displacement-idUSL6N0T31OT20141113
262,COST,UPDATE 2-Hearing aid maker Sonova posts lower profits after bold Costco deal,"* H1 net profit of 173.6 mln Sfr vs 183 mln Sfr in Reuters poll * Maintains full-year sales, EBITA guidance * Shares down 1.3 pct by 1335 GMT   (Adds analyst comment, edits) By Katharina Bart and Ole Mikkelsen ZURICH/COPENHAGEN, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The world’s largest maker of hearing aids Sonova posted disappointing first-half profits and a share buyback half the size of what was expected, worrying investors about its strategy of boosting market share by making deep discounts. The Staefa, Switzerland-based company’s recent deal to sell high-end hearing aids at rock bottom prices via U.S. warehouse club Costco Wholesale Corp stepped up a price war in the fiercely competitive $15 billion market for hearing healthcare. It also alienated independent shops that were Sonova’s traditional outlets and angered its competitors: Danish rival William Demant slashed its full-year targets last week, blaming Sonova’s deal with Costco - which accounts for 10 percent of all devices sold in the U.S. private market according to estimates by Bernstein Research. Now the Swiss company looks as though it may also have damaged itself by the Costco deal: Not only is it having to woo back the independent shops that turned their back on its brands following the U.S. partnership, but analysts believe it will now be hard for Sonova to meet its full-year sales targets. Sonova’s net profit rose 6.1 percent to 173.6 million Swiss francs ($180.63 million) in the first half, lower than expectations for 183 million francs in a Reuters poll of analysts. It said it still expects full-year sales to grow by 7-9 percent and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) to increase by 11 to 15 percent in local currencies. But Bernstein Research analyst Lisa Bedell Clive wrote: “We see no conceivable way that Sonova can hit consensus full-year expectations, and thus we expect earnings downgrades in the coming days.” In a note to investors she rated the stock at underperform with a target of 115 Swiss francs, and also pointed out that Sonova’s plan to buy back 500 million Swiss francs ($522 million) of its own shares in the next three years was only half of what Bernstein had expected. By 1321 GMT, Sonova shares had fallen 1.4 percent to 145 francs - investors disappointed also by its announcement that it would only lift its dividend ratio to roughly 40 percent of its earnings from 37 percent “This has been an eye opener for the whole industry that a leading hearing aid maker decided to sell its premium brand via a low cost retail chain,” said Morten Imsgaard, an analyst with Danish Sydbank. While Siemens, GN Resound, and Demant all sell through CostCo, hearing aid makers have typically reserved their lower-end devices for discounters. Sonova has changed that by selling a premium brand - Phonak - through the discounter, which comes at the expense of independent audiologists and so-called shop in shops, typically found in opticians or pharmacies such as Boots. Sonova, which is also struggling to convince investors it can find success with a new range of hearing aids that connect to mobile phones, said it was debt free and had funds to invest in research and acquisitions. It also said the strong Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar, euro and Canadian dollar shaved 30.2 million francs off first-half sales. It expects this impact to ease in the second half.

273,COST,"No chance of OPEC output cut, even after oil dips below $50: Gulf delegates","DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are showing no sign of considering cutting output to boost oil prices, even though they dipped below $50 a barrel this week. OPEC decided against limiting production at its last meeting on Nov 27, despite misgivings from non-Gulf members, after Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the group needed to defend market share against U.S. shale oil and other competing sources. Those misgivings have grown with a slide in oil prices to below half their level in June, hurting the economies of OPEC’s smaller producers. Benchmark Brent dipped to $49.66 on Wednesday, its lowest since April 2009, before rising to $51 on Thursday. OPEC has forecast an increasing surplus in 2015, citing rising supplies outside the group and lackluster growth in global demand. But the Gulf members, who account for more than half of OPEC output, are not wavering, arguing lower prices will slow competing supplies, spur economic growth and revive demand. One delegate from a Gulf OPEC member said there was “no chance” of a rethink while another referred to the view that non-OPEC producers were to blame for the glut. “Naimi made it clear: OPEC will not cut alone,” the second delegate said. OPEC ministers and delegates have blamed non-OPEC producers such as Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, as well as U.S. shale and tight oil production, for the oversupply in the market. U.S. oil production has surged from around 5 million barrels per day to reach a near 30-year record of more than 9 million bpd over the past six years, propelled by the sudden emergence of shale oil output from North Dakota to Texas. The OPEC delegates - government officials representing their countries who attend OPEC’s meetings - spoke to Reuters after oil’s brief fall below $50 on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Officially, OPEC agreed at its November meeting on keeping its output target of 30 million barrels per day (bpd) - a point the U.A.E oil minister reinforced on Wednesday - although African members, as well as Iran and Venezuela, had wanted a reduction. Iran and Algeria have both since called on OPEC to cut output in the face of the slide in oil prices. A delegate from Libya, one of OPEC’s four African OPEC members, agreed. “Something should be done by OPEC countries to reinstate its role to stabilize the market, ensuring a fair price for both producers and consumers,” Samir Kamal, Libya’s OPEC governor, told Reuters on Thursday, emphasizing he was not speaking on behalf of the Libyan government. “Or there is no need for it any more, especially if only one country is dictating its strategy while hurting other members.” Venezuela campaigned for supply cuts before the OPEC meeting and is still pushing for action. President Nicolas Maduro has embarked on a tour of OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran and Algeria, to lobby for efforts to boost prices. Saudi Arabia is by far the biggest OPEC producer, with output at around 9.6 million bpd. This, and Saudi’s ability to make up for supply shortages elsewhere given its significant spare capacity, also make it in the view of other members the one with the least to lose from cutting output. Venezuela, Algeria and Iran need oil above $100 to balance their budgets, according to estimates from the IMF and other analysts, higher than the Gulf members who can tolerate lower oil revenues for years. The rift in OPEC could deepen if prices keep falling towards $40 or lower and Saudi Arabia maintains its resistance to output cuts, some delegates say, although it is unclear whether it would have any practical impact. One said if it got as far as $30, “others will start telling the Saudis: ‘then you are at war with me?’.” A further drop looks likely, analysts and traders say. BofA Merrill sees a growing risk of Brent falling to $40, not far from the 2008 low of $36.20 reached before OPEC’s last formal output cut prompted a steady revival. The Libyan OPEC governor said he believed oil may fall to $45 in the first 6 months of 2015 but would eventually rise, perhaps averaging $55-$60 in 2015. For now though, there has been no call for an OPEC meeting before the group’s next scheduled gathering in June, another delegate said. Other countries see little to gain from calling for one given Saudi Arabia’s expected resistance. “It would be up to the Saudis. There is no point in having a meeting unless you plan to do something,” the delegate said. “These prices are killing us,” said another non-Gulf OPEC delegate. “But why are you asking me? Go ask the big guys.” ",1082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-oil/no-chance-of-opec-output-cut-even-after-oil-dips-below-50-gulf-delegates-idUSKBN0KH1HA20150108

276,COST,GN Store Nord reassures investors with Costco deal,"COPENHAGEN, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Danish hearing aid company GN Store Nord has extended a supply agreement with U.S. retailer Costco, removing a major risk to its business model and sending its shares four percent higher. It avoids the fate of rival Danish hearing aid maker William Demant which had to cut its 2014 earnings forecast in November after its products were displaced by rivals in Costco stores. It is especially important as Costco sales of hearing aids have outpaced the market average, analysts said. “Losing the contract would have reduced the sale of GN ReSound hearing aids by six percent,” Jyske Markets wrote in a note to clients on Monday, following GN Store Nord’s  announcement. Bernstein analyst Lisa Bedell Clive said Costco now accounts for around 10 percent of all volumes sold in the U.S. private market. Sydbank analysts reckon Costco sales have been growing by 20 percent a year in the last five years. “As we expect this channel to continue growing strongly in the coming years, it is an attractive channel to be involved in for the hearing aid manufacturers,” Bernstein’s Clive wrote in a note.

GN Store Nord made waves in the industry last year when it launched a hearing aid it developed with Apple that streams iPhone content directly to the user’s ear. Chief Executive Niels Jacobsen of William Demant, the largest hearing aid maker in the world after Swiss-based Sonova , emphasised his company was fighting back with its own new products. “We have faith in our pipeline which we count on to deliver a technological lead,” he told daily Berlingske on the weekend.

278,COST,Costco to ditch AmEx cards at U.S. stores next year,"(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) will stop accepting American Express Co’s (AXP.N) credit cards at U.S. stores from next year, threatening nearly 8 percent of the worldwide annual spending on its cards. AmEx said on Thursday the loss of the contract would hurt earnings for the next two years, sending its shares down as much as 7 percent and wiping out about $6 billion of market value. JPMorgan Securities analyst Tien-tsin Huang said the loss of Costco would reduce spending on AmEx cards by about $80 billion a year, including their use at businesses other than Costco’s 468 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. AmEx said it expected earnings per share growth in 2015 to be flat to down modestly from 2014 as the company invests aggressively to prepare for the termination of the contract. The agreement between AmEx and Costco is set to end after 16 years on March 31, 2016. Costco warehouses in the United States currently accept only American Express cards. “We were unable to reach terms that would have made economic sense for our company and shareholders,” American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. Competition in the co-branded card business has intensified in recent years, leading to higher renewal costs, Chenault said on a conference call. Costco declined to comment on the move, which follows its decision to drop AmEx in Canada last year. Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) replaced AmEx as Costco’s card partner in Canada, raising speculation that the companies could also replace AmEx in the United States. Capital One, whose shares were up 2.6 percent in early afternoon trading, did not respond to a request for comment. MasterCard’s shares were up 2.7 percent.

281,COST,Jet raises $140 million in bid to take on Amazon,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Jet, the startup founded by former Amazon.com Inc executive Marc Lore that hopes to change the way consumers shop online, has raised $140 million in its latest funding round, led by Bain Capital Ventures. The company said on Wednesday other investors that participated in the funding round included Google Ventures, Accel Partners, Coatue, General Catalyst, Goldman Sachs and Temasek. Jet has ambitions to build a more flexible buying system that allows customers to save be setting preferences with products, rather than the more direct sales model now employed by dominant e-commerce firms Amazon and eBay Inc. Jet will launch its service this spring. It will be inspired in part by Costco Wholesale Corp, which passes on savings to buyers by selling in bulk. Like the more established brick-and-mortar retailer, Jet hopes to earn mainly membership fees, while helping buyers save in a variety of ways, for instance when they buy several products from the same store or nearby stores, or through lower shipping costs if speedy delivery is not required. “We’ve seen wholesale clubs innovate around price by re-imagining traditional retail economics before. Leveraging a membership model, they found ways to take costs out of the system,” Lore said in a blogpost. “In doing so, they unlocked significant savings for members and transformed how people shop; today over 80 million Americans are wholesale club members.” Jet is now building an online system that it hopes will be able to match a plethora of options from delivery speed to optimal product selection with buyers’ searches in real time - a potentially costly undertaking given the amount of computational power required. Lore said in an interview that Jet has signed on over 350,000 “Insiders” or initial members over 73 days. Jet will begin letting in buyers next month to test a core service or platform that he said is designed to work almost akin to a real-time exchange trading system.

285,COST,Fitch: Loss of Co-Branding Relationship Adds to Near-Term Challenges Facing Amex,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 17 (Fitch) American Express' (AXP, 'A+' Outlook Stable)  decision not to renew its U.S. co-brand relationship with Costco Wholesale  Corporation (Costco, 'A+', Outlook Positive) adds earnings pressure to the  company's existing near-term challenges, according to Fitch Ratings. AXP  currently faces lackluster global economic growth, normalizing credit  performance, elevated regulatory risk, and a strengthening U.S. dollar, among  others.  However, AXP's loss of the Costco relationship does not have an immediate rating  impact given the company's continued strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, strong relative credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization.  Fitch had anticipated the possibility of the termination of the U.S. Costco  relationship, given the termination of AXP's co-branding relationship with  Costco Canada last year and heightened competition for co-brand relationships  more broadly. Longer-term rating implications will be influenced by AXP's  ability to defend its franchise and invest and grow other businesses while  maintaining strong relative operating performance over time. Extending the Costco relationship would have likely required substantial  concessions from AXP. Fitch views AXP's decision not to renew such an important  relationship as an understandable outcome when seeking to balance long-term  economic value and short-term results. Although near-term earnings will be  pressured, Fitch believes AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business model  and leading market position in the payments industry position it well to achieve  its long-term operating performance targets. Last Thursday, AXP announced that its co-brand partnership with Costco U.S.  would not be renewed after it expires on March 31, 2016. The announcement  follows the termination of AXP's co-brand program with Costco Canada and  reflects the company's decision last year to conduct a broader review of its  existing co-brand relationships. As part of its review, the company accelerated  contract renewal discussions with several of its co-brand partners well in  advance of their expiration dates.  Despite the loss of the Costco relationship, AXP has been able to reach new  multi-year agreements with several important co-brand partnerships including  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ('BBB', Outlook Stable), Cathay Pacific  and Delta Airlines ('BB', Outlook Positive), which represented AXP's largest  airline co-brand loan portfolio at year-end 2013. AXP's other notable co-brand  programs include relationships with Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Lowe's  Companies Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. ('B', Outlook Stable). Last Friday, the  Wall Street Journal reported that AXP and JetBlue were not renewing their  co-brand relationship. However, this has yet to be publicly confirmed by AXP or  JetBlue. AXP expects the loss of the Costco U.S. contract to have a negative impact on  earnings and revenue growth in 2015 and 2016. However, the company reiterated  its long-term earnings per share growth target of between 12% and 15% beginning  in 2017. Fitch believes AXP has a number of other investment opportunities  including within consumer and small business payments, prepaid products, global  network services (GNS) bank partnerships, and new co-brand relationships which  could help offset long-term loss of earnings from the Costco relationship. According to AXP, the Costco U.S. co-brand product accounted for approximately  8% of worldwide billed business in 2014 although approximately 70% of total  spending on the card occurred outside of Costco warehouses. AXP believes the  high spend volume outside of Costco warehouses indicates that these cardmembers  have a strong affinity to the AXP brand as well as Costco. AXP expects to slowly  begin offering these customers new products in order to retain a portion of the  high volume of out of store spending.  Furthermore, the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio accounted for roughly 20% of  AXP's worldwide loans and 10% of worldwide cards in force. As it relates to  regulatory capital levels, AXP expects the lost earnings to be offset by the  decline in loans.

286,COST,"Costco ties up with Citigroup, Visa for U.S. co-branded cards","(Reuters) - Warehouse club Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) has chosen Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) to run its co-branded credit card starting next year, replacing American Express Co (AXP.N), which lost the coveted tie-up last month. Citigroup will exclusively issue the Costco branded cards and Visa will provide the payment network in the United States and Puerto Rico from April 1, 2016, Costco said. The deal means that Costco customers will only be able to use Visa credit cards at its stores, as is currently true with American Express cards. While terms were not disclosed, the high profile partnership could be lucrative for both companies given that Costco caters to relatively high-income customers compared with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N). Still, margins on such deals can be thin. American Express said in February that it had been unable to reach a deal with Costco that would have made “economic sense” even though the loss of the contract would hurt its earnings for the next two years. The Costco portfolio of card loans has been a “thin margin” business, but Citigroup - the world’s largest credit card issuer - has the scale, with some $146 billion of card loans, to manage it, analyst Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI wrote in a note.   Visa shares rose 2 percent to a record high of $277.00 in early trading, while Citi shares rose 1.5 percent to $53.22. “Costco is a solid co-brand partner given its affluent, captive member base and represents a solid win for Visa,”  J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a note. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said an investor conference that the bank is attracted to Costco’s “loyal customer base.” Stifel Nicolaus and Co Inc analyst John Davis said it was an “impressive win” for Visa, considering that 90 percent of Citi’s U.S. credit cards are MasterCards. The deal is expected to add $120 million of annual revenue  to Visa or roughly about 10 cents in earnings per share, Davis added. Costco, which sells everything from jewelry to fresh produce at its cavernous members-only stores, had already replaced AmEx with Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) as its card partner in Canada since the start of this  year.

289,COST,Costco's quarterly profit tops estimates on tax benefit,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by a tax benefit related to its special cash dividend last month. Costco, the third-largest U.S. retailer, said net income rose to $598 million, or $1.35 per share, for the second quarter ended Feb. 15, from $463 million, or $1.05 per share a year earlier. Total revenue, which includes membership fees, rose 4.4 percent in the quarter to 27.45 billion. Sales rose 4.3 percent $26.87 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.18 per share on sales of $27.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Initial jobless claims rose to 320,000 in the latest week, above the 295,000 estimate and 313,000 in the prior week. The disappointing claims numbers come after a weaker-than-expected private payrolls report on Wednesday and ahead of Friday’s monthly employment report. A separate report showed new orders for U.S. factory goods unexpectedly fell in January for a sixth month, a sign of weakness in the manufacturing sector. As investors attempt to gauge the timing of the Fed’s impending rate increase, the equity market’s advance has slowed on the heels of the latest record highs for both the Dow and S&P; 500 on March 2, with each index down 0.9 percent. “There is nothing really to drive sentiment one way or the other that is going to change people’s perceptions on anything at the moment so therefore you are just getting this churning back and forth,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “Once we made that new high the other day, the market just backed off and now it is just churning until tomorrow.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.35 points, or 0.12 percent, to 18,118.25, the S&P; 500 gained 0.3 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,098.83 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 8.83 points, or 0.18 percent, to 4,975.97. AbbVie is to buy Pharmacyclics for about $21 billion, giving it access to what is expected to be one of the world’s top-selling cancer drugs and expanding its reach in the profitable oncology field. Pharmacyclics shares jumped 10.5 percent to $254.77 while AbbVie lost 3.1 percent to $58.39. Costco Wholesale rose 2.2 percent to $150.39 after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Retailers will be watched as they post monthly sales results for signs of whether lower gas prices have translated to improved spending elsewhere in the economy. Kroger gained 5 percent to $73.12 after the biggest U.S. supermarket operator reported a 23 percent rise in quarterly profit and forecast full-year earnings above expectations.

294,COST,RPT-INSIGHT-Citigroup's past losses may have helped it win Costco business,"(Repeating story for additional subscribers without changes to text) By David Henry NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc had at least one advantage in its successful bid for the exclusive right to issue credit cards for Costco Wholesale Corp, rivals and tax specialists say: it lost so much money during the financial crisis that it has billions of dollars of tax credits. Citigroup and Costco have not disclosed terms of the deal, and outsiders can only speculate about the reasons Citigroup bid aggressively enough to win the business. But officials at two rival banks said they suspect Citigroup’s tax credits allowed it to offer Costco better terms than competitors could. They declined to be identified because the negotiations were confidential. At the end of last year, Citigroup had $49.5 billion in net tax credits, known as “deferred tax assets.” They are a boon to the bank because they can reduce - or even eliminate - its federal income tax liability. Other banks could pay as much as 35 percent of their U.S. income in federal tax, though many also use tax-reduction strategies that push their rates lower. American Express said last month that it would not renew its deal with Costco because the retailer was demanding terms that were not economic, an indication that the profit margins for anyone taking on the business were likely to be razor thin. “The deferred tax assets would be quite a dramatic advantage,” said Robert Willens, an independent accounting and taxation consultant. Citigroup, he said, may well have won the deal by being able to offer far better terms to Costco than banks that pay more in taxes. Citigroup responded to questions about its tax advantage in the deal with a written statement: “As the world’s largest issuer of consumer credit cards, Citi has unrivaled scale, expertise and capabilities in servicing our partnerships with industry leaders. Costco brings the opportunity for consumer spending growth - when you add Costco’s customer loyalty with increased Visa acceptance, it is a win for all parties.” It declined to comment on whether its tax credits helped in winning the business. In 2014, Citigroup used about $3 billion of deferred tax assets to reduce tax liability. To competitors, the bank’s tax credits are an irritant. A big chunk of the bank’s deferred tax assets stem from the billions of dollars of losses it generated during the financial crisis. Citigroup was rescued three times by the U.S. government between 2008 and 2009, and one of the rescues threatened to wipe out some of the bank’s deferred tax assets. However, the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service - which were concerned about the stability of the banking system - relaxed the rules governing such assets to help Citigroup and other banks during the crisis. The government’s tax rules were relaxed again for Citigroup when the United States looked to sell its roughly one-third stake of the company after the crisis, Willens said. In both cases, the bank came close to triggering a 1986 tax rule designed to prevent healthy corporations from avoiding taxes by buying weak companies with large deferred tax assets. “In an odd kind of way, the U.S. government essentially put Citigroup in a more competitive position” to bid for business like the Costco deal, said Charles Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at Portales Partners, a broker focused on research. The Costco transaction is not without risks for Citigroup, especially in the event of an economic downturn that would cause more cardholders to default on payments. But such deals typically last for five to seven years, so Citigroup will have an out down the road. Citigroup could continue to benefit from its deferred tax assets in bidding for assets in the future, Willens said, and the bank has done so in the past. In 2013, the bank bought a portfolio of about $7 billion of credit card loans to customers of Best Buy Inc. Banks, like all U.S. companies, keep two sets of books, one for financial markets and a second for the Internal Revenue Service. Many of the losses on loans and securities that Citigroup recognized during the financial crisis were reported on the bank’s books for investors, but cannot be reported for tax purposes until the loss actually happens. When the loss happens and the bank has enough taxable income, Citigroup gets a tax credit, but until then, the bank keeps a deferred tax asset on its books, to recognize the future benefit. The bank’s $50 billion of tax credits expire over several decades starting in 2017. Based on how credit card deals are typically negotiated, Citigroup would have factored a number of considerations into its bid for the Costco portfolio: how generous to make rewards programs for the store’s customers, how much of a break it would give the retailer on transaction processing costs and how much revenue it would share with the company from fees for processing transactions when Costco cardholders use their cards outside of the store. Banks have been competing intensely for the right to issue cards with retailers, airlines and hotel companies.  In the next year or so American Airlines  is expected to review its current deal with Citigroup, which issues cards carrying both the bank and the airline’s brand.

298,COST,Costco working to end use of human antibiotics in chicken,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp is working toward eliminating the sale of chicken and meat from other animals raised with antibiotics that are vital to fighting human infections, senior executives at the third-largest U.S. retailer told Reuters on Thursday. The ongoing push by Costco, which sells 80 million rotisserie chickens a year, highlights growing pressure on the supply chain in the wake of this week’s announcement by fast-food giant McDonald’s Corp that it would stop buying chicken raised with so-called “shared-use” antibiotics within two years. “We are working towards, and working with our suppliers and the regulatory agencies... to see how we can get rid of shared-use antibiotics in animals,” Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety at the Issaquah, Washington-based retail giant, said in a phone interview. “I think all of us want to move to a point where we can get the human-use antibiotics out of the system. It’s going to take time.” Wilson and Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said the company did not have a target date for reaching that goal, a reflection of supply constraints. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the rate of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs. Scientists and public health experts say whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and can enable the strongest to survive and multiply. Frequent use of low-dose antibiotics, a practice used by some meat producers, can amplify that effect. The risk is that so-called superbugs might develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics. “I mean, you’ve got to protect human health beyond everything, and so we think eliminating shared-use antibiotics is the right way to go,” Wilson said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. Antibiotics rated medically important by the FDA for growth promotion are scheduled to be phased out by December 2016. Wilson said Costco has been working with the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the goal of eliminating shared-use antibiotics. The Center for Veterinary Medicine is involved in the effort as well, he said. Over the years Costco has grown into one of the largest retailers of food.

Footage collected at a Hillandale Farms facility in April and May by someone “associated with” the Humane Society showed hens laying eggs in cramped cages with deceased birds.

315,COST,Oil slips on Greece concerns as July Brent expires,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell in volatile trading on Monday as the Greek debt crisis raised concerns about demand for petroleum in Europe and as the U.N. started talks to try to bring peace to Yemen, where OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia is involved in a civil war. Expiring front-month July Brent fell $1.26 to settle and go off the board at $62.61 a barrel.  August Brent fell 69 cents to settle at $63.95. The weak July Brent expiration also signalled “a much over-supplied North Sea trade that is seeing the impact of near record OPEC production both directly and indirectly,” Jim Ritterbusch, analyst at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a research note. U.S. July crude fell 44 cents to settle at $59.52, after trading from $58.73 to $59.98. The spread between Brent and U.S. crude shrank to $2.65 a barrel intraday, the narrowest since January. A month ago it was more than $7 a barrel. Brent has fallen from a high above $66 last week and appeared to be settling in a range between $60 and $65, said Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.     Global stock markets fell on Monday after talks between Greece and its creditors collapsed on Sunday. [MKTS/GLOB] The euro recovered from earlier weakness. The dollar’s intraday strength had weighed on oil futures as a strong dollar makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for consumers using other currencies. United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon launched Yemen peace talks in Geneva with a call for a humanitarian truce after warplanes from a Saudi-led Arab coalition pounded the capital Sanaa. U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May, data released on Monday showed, as a strong dollar and energy spending cuts weighed on manufacturing and mining output.  Oil futures felt pressure from concerns about surplus supply with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pumping about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) more than needed, according to most industry estimates. Output is increasing in Libya, where production has been constrained by civil war. Production has risen in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and a deal on Iran’s nuclear program could lead to sanctions being lifted, allowing Tehran to increase exports. “Sentiment this morning gets a bearish touch from negative equities, a dollar to the strong side, Greek concerns and news of some increase in Libya oil production,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets in Oslo.

317,COST,"Brent edges up, U.S. crude off low as Fed weakens dollar","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude edged up and U.S. crude eased on Wednesday in volatile trading as both contracts trimmed losses after the Federal Reserve left the outlook for interest rate increases uncertain, brokers and analysts said. The Fed said the economy was likely strong enough to support an interest rate increase by the end of the year, although it lowered expectations for 2015 economic growth because of a weak start to the year. [MKTS/GLOB] “The Fed again cited international concerns and the lower growth, opening the door for delaying the expected rate hike and keeping liquidity boosted,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. The dollar index weakened, helping dollar-denominated crude recover. Brent August crude rose 17 cents to settle at $63.87, having swung from $62.60 to $65.47 and ending back below its 50-day moving average of $64.16. U.S. July crude dipped 5 cents to settle at $59.92, having traded from $58.85 to $61.38.     Crude and refined products oil futures turned sharply lower after government data showed a surprise gasoline inventory build last week. Concerns about Greece’s debt problems and the potential effect on Europe’s demand for petroleum also provided pressure.     U.S. July RBOB gasoline fell 2.40 cents to settle at $2.1005 a gallon. It fell as low as $2.0726 after soaring to $2.1858, the strongest front-month price since November. Gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly and crude oil stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub rose for the first time since April, while refinery utilization fell, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. [EIA/S]     Crude inventories fell by 2.7 million barrels, the EIA said. While the EIA’s slip was more than the expected draw of 1.7 million barrels, the drop was less than the 2.9-million-barrel slide reported on Tuesday by industry group American Petroleum Institute (API). [API/S] “The drawdown in crude oil inventories was expected, so its effect is muted, and the rise in Cushing, Oklahoma, inventories diminishes the headline number quite a bit,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. The EIA showed gasoline stocks rose by 460,000 barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 314,000 barrel drop and in sharp contrast to the fall of 2.9 million barrels reported by the API.         U.S. ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) futures also turned lower on the EIA data, although the inventory build reported was less than expectations and ULSD managed to settle 2.49 cents higher at $1.9098 a gallon.

The coastal waters of Chile, the world’s second-largest producer of salmon, are awash with a bacteria known as SRS, or Piscirickettsiosis. The bacteria causes lesions and haemorrhaging in infected fish, and swells their kidneys and spleens, eventually killing them. Unable to develop an effective vaccine, Chilean farmers have been forced to increase antibiotic use. In 2014, the industry produced around 895,000 tonnes of fish and used 563,200 kilograms (1.2 million pounds) of antibiotics, according to government and industry data. Antibiotic use had risen 25 percent from 2013.   In contrast, Norway, the world’s largest salmon producer, produced around 1.3 million tonnes of fish and used 972 kilos of antibiotics in 2013. (Figures for last year were not immediately available) Chilean officials say their salmon is safe and the antibiotics have been approved by U.S. food and drug regulators. Still, amid growing concerns in the U.S. food industry that heavy use of antibiotics in animals can spawn drug-resistant superbugs and endanger human health, Costco told Reuters in April that it would reduce imports of Chilean salmon. “The whole industry is starting to shift,” said Jeff Lyons, who oversees fresh foods at Costco, the No. 3 U.S. retailer.  “If I was to ask you your biggest concern on produce, you might say pesticides. When we ask people in protein, generally it’s going to be hormones or antibiotics.” Costco used to buy 90 percent of the 600,000 pounds of salmon fillet it needs per week from Chile, accounting for about 8.5 percent of Chilean salmon exports to the United States. Costco said it intends to buy 60 percent of its salmon from Norway, cutting Chilean imports to 40 percent. A former executive at a Chilean salmon producer said Costco’s move could hurt the local industry’s reputation and spur other retailers to follow suit. In recent years, U.S. grocery chains Whole Foods Market Inc and Trader Joe’s have gradually phased out Chilean farm salmon in favor of antibiotic-free fish caught in the wild. “This is the beginning of a change in seafood,” said Tobias Aguirre, the executive director of FishWise, a seafood consultancy that works with retailers such as Safeway [MRWAY.UL] and Target Corp. Target has also eliminated farmed salmon from its shelves.  “Other retailers will look at their lead and try to better understand why Costco made this move, and I think they will follow,” Aguirre said. To be sure, not every salmon buyer is that worried about antibiotics. Chile exported $4.4 billion (£2.8 billion) worth of salmon in 2014, up 24 percent from the previous year, according to industry group SalmonChile. For some buyers, costs are paramount. Brazil’s biggest retailer, GPA SA, which buys some 3.6 million kilograms of Chilean salmon per year, said demand for antibiotic-free fish in the South American giant is small, and the high cost of importing from Norway is a deterrent. “The greatest demand in the Brazilian market is for fresh salmon, purchased, for now, from Chile mainly due to logistics,” GPA said in an email. Chilean salmon producers said there is no reason for consumers to worry. Farmers do not administer antibiotics for months before harvesting the fish, so any traces of the drugs that remain in the salmon when it reaches consumers are within tolerance levels, they said. “The final product consumers eat has no antibiotics,” said Ricardo Garcia, chief executive of salmon producer Camanchaca, which reported nearly $500 million in sales last year. “This is only something given to sick fish so they don’t die. It’s not something preventive,” he said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that inspections of Chilean salmon have not found unapproved drug residues this fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, and “any article of food that appears to be adulterated or misbranded at importation is refused admission” into the country. In recent months, the U.S. food industry has taken an increasingly tough stance against antibiotics due to concerns that overuse may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, for instance, is pressing meat, seafood, dairy and egg suppliers to reduce their use of antibiotics. Speaking in general terms, the FDA said it has “concerns about the improper use of medically important antibiotics in food products derived from animals, as this practise is one factor that can contribute to antimicrobial resistance in humans.” Antibiotic-resistant strains of the SRS bacteria have emerged in Chile’s salmon farms, according to a November 2014 study on the government’s National Fisheries website. “The bacteria will respond for a few years to the antibiotics treatment but afterward will become stronger and resistant,” said Alex Munoz, vice president for South America at the Oceana environmental group in Chile. Salmon producers in Chile say they are aware they should reduce their dependence on antibiotics, but they do not expect a significant change since efforts to find an SRS vaccine have so far been unsuccessful. In Norway, intensive research has produced vaccines against most bacterial infections found in salmon farms.     “We’re faced with a reality in Chile, unlike Norway, where we haven’t developed vaccines for the Chilean market, leading us to often correct things with the use of antibiotics,” said Gerardo Balbontin, chief executive of Blumar, which exports a tenth of its salmon production to Costco.  The government acknowledges it has a problem on its hands. “The use of antibiotics is an issue for us,” said Eugenio Zamorano, head of Chile’s aquaculture department. “All companies (in Chile) use antibiotics to a lesser or greater extent.” As well as working towards finding a vaccine, Zamorano said “genetic improvements” in salmon could be part of the solution.

323,COST,American Express sued for misleading investors about Costco,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co was accused in a lawsuit on Thursday of blindsiding investors with the loss of a crucial contract with Costco Wholesale Corp after having failed to reveal how significant that business had become. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund sought class action status on behalf shareholders who suffered losses after the credit card company in February announced the end of its co-branding agreement with the warehouse club retailer. AmEx at the time said the loss of the contract, set to expire March 31, 2016, would hurt earnings for the next two years. Over the next two days, AmEx’s stock plummeted, losing $8 per share to close at $77.53, according to the lawsuit. The decline wiped out close to $9 billion of market value. Representatives for American Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Costco, which sells everything from jewelry to fresh produce at its cavernous members-only stores, had an exclusive co-branding arrangement with AmEx since 1999 for the store’s U.S. business. According to the lawsuit, AmEx did not disclose the revenues and loan volume generated through the agreement with Costco until February when the company announced it was ending its arrangement with the retailer. The lawsuit said that by 2014, the Costco business had in fact generated 8 percent of the company’s revenues and 20 percent of its outstanding loans. The lawsuit said that by October, unbeknownst to investors, AmEx and Costco had begun discussing renewing the U.S. agreement. AmEx subsequently on Feb. 12 announced the end of that business. The complaint said that by concealing the value of Costco’s relationship and its financial prospects, AmEx overstated the continuing revenue growth for its U.S. card services segment.

328,COST,"US lawsuit accuses Costco, Thai supplier of selling prawns produced by slaves","NEW YORK/BANGKOK, Aug 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A U.S. lawsuit accusing retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. of knowingly selling frozen prawns linked to a company that uses slave labor was described on Friday as “entirely without merit” by Thai seafood supply company CP Food Products. A lawsuit filed in the federal court in San Francisco in California on Wednesday sought a court order to stop Costco from selling prawns without a label stating that slave labor was involved in the farm raised prawns. The claim, citing federal and state rules on labelling and slavery, alleged Costco was aware the prawns bought from its Southeast Asian producers came from a supply chain dependent on ships involved in human trafficking and labor abuses. The exporter, CP Food Products Inc, and its parent company, Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, were also named in the lawsuit that was filed on behalf of California resident Monica Sud, a member of Costco which is run as a warehouse club. CP Foods on Friday said it had received a copy of a complaint filed in California concerning its shrimp business. “CPF believes that it has complied with all applicable laws and regulations, and that the complaint is entirely without merit,” the company said in a statement. Sud’s lawyers are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, which means if granted it could affect millions of customers in California. Costco, the third largest U.S. retailer, said these allegations over issues in the Thai seafood industry had been well publicized for more than a year. This followed an investigation by Britain’s Guardian newspaper into the prawn supply chain that found large numbers of men were bought and held against their will on fishing boats off Thailand used to farm prawns sold in some of the world’s leading supermarkets. The investigation found Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, the world’s largest prawn farmer, was buying fishmeal to feed to its farmed prawns from some suppliers that owned, operated or bought from fishing boats manned with slaves. In response to the allegations of labor violations, CP Foods said in a statement in March that it had “locked down our supply to 30 by-catch fishmeal suppliers and 380 fishing vessels, for which we have full visibility and traceability on sustainability and social issues”. It said it had also stepped up audits and monitoring of fishmeal suppliers, while the company’s fishmeal traceability and audit system underwent third-party verification by an independent auditing firm. The U.S. State Department’s 2015 Trafficking in Persons Report last month singled out the “enslavement of fishermen in Southeast Asia”. Costco said it has been working with and would continue to work with various stakeholders, including the Thai government, other retailers, and Thai industry, to address the issues that have surfaced. “In the meantime, all of our customers know that if they are dissatisfied with any purchase from Costco Wholesale they can return the item for a full refund,” Costco said in a statement.

329,COST,Sam's Club jumps into auto sales with TrueCar tie-up,"(Reuters) - Sam’s Club, the warehouse division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, has tied up with online car-shopping service TrueCar Inc to make a full-fledged foray into auto sales, a fast-growing business for rival Costco Wholesale Corp. Until now Sam’s Club had allowed a third-party auto-buying service to market cars through its website but had not operated its own program like Costco, which has quietly grown into one of the biggest players in the industry, selling nearly 400,000 vehicles last year. Sam’s Club said on Thursday that its new program would give members access to more than 10,000 TrueCar dealers and guaranteed savings off the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for new cars as well as deals on used cars. The company did not disclose sales or other targets. Seong Ohm, senior vice president of merchandise business service, said the company did not expect to make money on the service but believed it would emerge as a key driver of membership. Sam’s and Costco both make the bulk of their profit through membership fees. “We are not extracting value other than membership,” Ohm said. “We think this is going to be a really great program, but we also recognize it is going to take some time to scale up.” A basic annual membership at Sam’s costs $45. Sam’s has 653 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. Sam’s foray into the market reflects growing interest among consumers in obtaining the best price on a car without haggling. It cited a recent survey by J.D. Power and Associates showing that two-thirds of “millennials” - those born between 1980 and 2000 - view buying a car as one of the most intimidating purchases they can make. Sam’s service will allow shoppers to see what others paid for the same car “so they know if they are getting a deal or not,” Ohm said. The program is among 10 new or relaunched services at Sam’s in the past year. Sam’s comparable sales rose 1.3 percent in the latest quarter minus fuel, but it has recently lagged behind Costco and is looking for ways to ignite growth. Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said the car program would likely do well but that Sam’s needed to improve its merchandise and services to catch up with Costco.    “It may help them close the gap on the car-buying side versus Costco but as far as the issues with the rest of the store, those have yet to be fixed,” Yarbrough said.

331,COST,Costco sold counterfeit Tiffany engagement rings-U.S. judge,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp  willfully infringed Tiffany & Co’s trademarks by selling counterfeit diamond engagement rings bearing the luxury retailer’s name and must face a jury trial to assess damages, a U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan rejected claims by Costco that Tiffany’s trademarks were invalid because they sought to prevent others from using the word “Tiffany” as a generic description of a type of ring setting. Instead, Swain said evidence established that Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club chain, had infringed Tiffany’s trademarks by selling engagement rings and confused consumers by using the word Tiffany in display case signs. “Despite Costco’s arguments to the contrary, the court finds that, based on the record evidence, no rational finder of fact could conclude that Costco acted in good faith in adopting the Tiffany mark,” Swain wrote. Under the ruling, Tiffany may now take Costco before a jury to seek damages, including a recovery of Costco’s profits from the sale of the diamond rings and punitive damages. Swain set a hearing for Oct. 30 and directed Tiffany and Costco to “make good faith efforts to settle the outstanding issues.” In a statement, Tiffany General Counsel Leigh Harlan welcomed the ruling, saying it “further validates the strength and value of the Tiffany mark and reinforces our continuing efforts to protect the brand.” Representatives for Costco did not respond to requests for comment. Tiffany filed the lawsuit on Valentine’s Day in February 2013, saying it believed hundreds, if not thousands, of Costco members bought engagement rings they wrongly believed were authentic Tiffany products. Tiffany said that in 2012, a person shopping at a Costco in Huntington Beach, Calif., complained to Tiffany that she was disappointed to see Costco offering for sale what were promoted on in-store signs as Tiffany diamond engagement rings. Tiffany said a subsequent investigation revealed rings in a display case at the Huntington Beach Costco labeled with the word “Tiffany” and that a salesperson there referred to them as such. Prior to the lawsuit, Tiffany contacted Costco and secured a commitment that it would remove references to Tiffany from its display case signs, according to Tuesday’s ruling. Costco also previously sent a letter to customers who bought the rings offering a full refund if they were unsatisfied, the ruling said. The case is Tiffany & Company and Tiffany (NJ) LLC v.

Tiffany said that in 2012, a person shopping at a Costco in Huntington Beach, Calif., complained to Tiffany that she was disappointed to see Costco offering for sale what were promoted on in-store signs as Tiffany diamond engagement rings. Tiffany said a subsequent investigation revealed rings in a display case at the Huntington Beach Costco labeled with the word “Tiffany” and that a salesperson there referred to them as such. Prior to the lawsuit, Tiffany contacted Costco and secured a commitment that it would remove references to Tiffany from its display case signs, according to Tuesday’s ruling. Costco also previously sent a letter to customers who bought the rings offering a full refund if they were unsatisfied, the ruling said. The case is Tiffany & Company and Tiffany (NJ) LLC v.

338,COST,"Greenpeace takes aim at Thai tuna firm, urges end to alleged abuses","BANGKOK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Environmental activist group Greenpeace on Monday urged the world’s largest manufacturer of canned tuna, Thai Union Group Pcl, to free its supply chains of destructive fishing practices and alleged labour abuses. It warned Thai Union, which makes the U.S. “Chicken of the Sea” brand and counts Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp among buyers, that the fishing methods it and its suppliers employ have serious environmental impacts and carry reputational risks. The Greenpeace action comes as Thailand faces pressure from the European Union to clean up illegal fishing practices or face a trade ban. It could also jeopardize Thai Union’s plan to acquire U.S. rival Bumble Bee, which awaits approval from U.S. antitrust authorities. Greenpeace said it would work to make “every single customer” aware of the alleged abuses, until Thai Union took responsibility and demonstrated real leadership. “We can no longer allow Thai Union Group and its brands around the world, including Chicken of the Sea, to sacrifice the world’s oceans and jeopardize workers at sea,” Greenpeace official Graham Forbes said in a statement. Greenpeace said two fishing methods primarily used by Thai Union result in by-catch, or fish that was not targeted but caught inadvertently, and are often associated with illegal fishing and rights violations. Thai Union, formerly known as Thai Union Frozen Products Pcl, said in a statement it was committed to responsible sourcing and legal compliance to ensure all supply chains were treated with respect and human rights upheld. “We call on Greenpeace to enter into an open and transparent dialogue with Thai Union so that together we can work towards achieving our shared objectives,” it said. Thailand, the world’s third-largest seafood exporter, was given six months by the EU in April to address issues such as ensuring all fishing vessels were registered, had registered equipment and were fitted with a Vessel Monitoring System. Labour abuses in the Thai fishing industry are well-documented. Since 2014, the United States has put Thailand on the bottom-ranked Tier 3 in its annual Trafficking in Persons report. In its 2015 TIP report the U.S. State Department said some Thai and migrant workers were subjected to forced labour on Thai fishing boats with some remaining at sea for several years or paid very little or were threatened and beaten. The commission will decide in December whether Thailand’s seafood exports should be blacklisted. Brussels also warned Taiwan last week that it was not doing enough to tackle illegal fishing.

339,COST,CDC says at least 19 E. coli infections linked to Costco chicken salad,"(Reuters) - At least 19 people in seven states may have been infected by E.  coli after eating rotisserie chicken salad sold at Costco Wholesale Corp’s (COST.O) stores, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday. Five people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported, but two individuals developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, a type of kidney failure that can lead to permanent organ damage. The infections have been reported in Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Missouri, Virginia and Washington, CDC said. The current number of HUS cases is twice what is normally seen with E. coli O157:H7, the pathogen identified in the outbreak, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety attorney who represents people sickened by tainted food. “This tells me that the number of ill is likely going to go up because the HUS cases are easier to track,” Marler said. Fourteen of 16 people bought or ate rotisserie chicken salad from Costco in the week before the illness started, but the ingredient linked to the infection has not been identified, the CDC said. Costco said it stopped selling the chicken salad on Nov. 20, the same day it was notified by federal health officials that it was linked to cases of E. coli, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety at Costco. E. coli O157:H7 can cause serious illness and is perhaps most often associated with a 1993 outbreak that killed four children who ate undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box restaurants.

347,COST,Costco says pipeline tariff would add to cost of cheap gas,"HOUSTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp, which sells some of the cheapest gasoline in the country, says a revised tariff overhaul on the giant Colonial Pipeline would add to its costs of providing gasoline. The warehouse club operator told the Federal Energy Commission in a filing on Tuesday that a new tariff system proposed for the massive artery sending fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Northeast would leave it scrambling for space on the critical but clogged line. Costco is among a group of companies challenging Colonial’s rewrite of tariffs governing how space is allotted to ship barrels of gasoline and distillates on the 5,500-mile (8.851 km) system. Costco, which sells fuel at often steep discounts in order to attract customers to its stores, said Colonial’s proposed lottery system leaves too many shippers out, forcing them to find other ways to move barrels. Colonial has been full for about three years and routinely allocates space based on shipper history, or how many barrels shippers regularly move in 72 cycles each year. Those that meet a certain threshold are “regular” shippers and qualify for consistent space. Those that do not can currently attain that status by swapping their shipper histories back and forth as needed. The new tariff would largely prohibit that practice, leaving them to try to get a fraction of remaining space via a lottery. Colonial says the change would stop shippers from making history transfers that undercut rewarding shipper loyalty. Costco said it would have to win a lottery pick 75 percent of the time - in 54 of the year’s 72 cycles - to meet the threshold to qualify as a regular shipper. Otherwise, Costco would be relegated to buying unused line space from another regular shipper on top of fuel costs and Colonial’s transport fees. Line space is a secondary market that emerged as shippers grappled with the full system. Regular shippers that may not need all the space they are allotted in a cycle sell the excess - in pennies per barrel shipped - to others who need it. That allows regular shippers to maintain a consistent allotment without paying a penalty for failing to use it all - and risk Colonial shrinking it. Costco said in the past year it has bought line space to various refiners and suppliers for every gallon it took from a Colonial destination. That puts Costco at a disadvantage to its competitors that are regular shippers that do not have to buy line space, it said.

350,COST,U.S. FDA still searching for source of E. coli outbreak at Costco,"Dec 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal agency has yet to identify the source of an E. coli outbreak that sickened at least 19 people in seven states who may have been infected after eating rotisserie chicken salad sold at Costco Wholesale Corp. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration laboratory analysis did not confirm the presence of E. coli in a sample of celery and onion mix collected from a Costco store in Montana, the agency said on Tuesday. The incident is the latest occurence of E. coli where the source of the outbreak is unknown. Health officials have still not found the cause of an E. coli outbreak at restaurants owned by Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc in nine states. In the Costco outbreak, the celery and onion mix was made by Taylor Farms for use in the salad. In November, Taylor Farms Pacific Inc voluntarily recalled 71 products sold at retailers such as Safeway and Wal-Mart Stores Inc citing “an abundance of caution” due to the mix testing positive for E. coli in a sample taken by the Montana Department of Health. The state performed a rapid preliminary test and then sent a partial sample of the celery and onion mix to the FDA, which performed a more accurate test that involves growing a colony of the bacteria. Fourteen of 16 people bought or ate rotisserie chicken salad from Costco in the week before the illness started. Costco shares were little changed at $169 in after-hours trading. Chipotle warned that sales at established restaurants could drop 8 percent to 11 percent for the fourth quarter from a year earlier due to the outbreak. The time between ingesting E. coli bacteria and feeling sick is usually three to four days, but may be as short as one day or as long as 10 days, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms often begin slowly with mild belly pain or non-bloody diarrhea that worsens over several days.

Comparable sales, including fuel and foreign currency impacts, fell 1 percent in the first quarter ended Nov 22, 2015. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected growth of 0.3 percent. Costco gets almost 30 percent of revenue from outside the United States. The dollar rose about 13 percent against a basket of currencies in the 12 months through November. Excluding fuel and foreign exchange impact, comparable-store sales rose 6 percent, above the 5.9 percent growth expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. Net income attributable to the company fell to $480 million, or $1.09 per share, from $496 million, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1 percent to $27.22 billion from $26.87 billion a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected earnings of $1.17 per share on revenue of $27.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

354,COST,American Express looks to grow small business loan revenue,"(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) wants to grow small-business lending to make up for revenue it expects to lose after its credit card partnership with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) ends this year.    Last week, American Express said it will pay an undisclosed amount to feature its charge cards on Fundera, an online marketplace. AmEx hopes small-business owners will compare loan terms and rates and choose its cards over traditional loans.    The company is bracing for the end of co-branded cards with Costco that accounted for 8 percent of worldwide annual spending on AmEx cards in 2014, and 20 percent of the company’s outstanding loans.     The planned end of the partnership in March has been delayed a few months because it has taken more time to move customers to a new card, the Seattle Times reported last week.     To make up for that lost revenue, American Express has focused on small-business loans, where it already has a foothold. It views small-business cards as an area with room to grow in the near term, unlike consumer spending.  In 2014, American Express cards for small businesses funded $190 billion in purchases, up from $122 billion in 2010. The company considers cards an untapped form of small-business funding, because small businesses tend to rely more heavily on cash and traditional loans. Only 10 percent of small-business spending takes place on cards.      At AmEx’s investor day last year, management highlighted its small-business loan operation as an area of focus.    “One of the very most important things we’re doing as a company is lending and funding,” David Rabkin, AmEx’s senior vice president of small-business customer acquisition, said in an interview. “Putting our cards on Fundera marketplace is part of that.”    The charge cards American Express offers on Fundera, called Open, are designed for companies that need to fund large spot purchases of inventory or raw materials, and can pay off the balance in full each month. The Open cards do not charge interest, but carry an annual fee. Spending limits adjust with usage and payment history.     There may be pain ahead as American Express works to grow small-business lending. The credit-card business has gotten more competitive because banks and card issuers view the loans and transaction fees as a relatively stable source of revenue. Also, consumer spending has slowed despite cheaper gasoline.     American Express shares have fallen 25 percent so far this year. The company plans to cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017.

359,COST,"Kroger, Costco miss sales targets, consumers seen cautious","(Reuters) - Kroger Co (KR.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) both turned in softer-than-expected sales at established stores on Thursday, stoking worries about deflation and U.S. consumer spending. Kroger, which attributed some of the weakness to unusually mild winter weather, warned that lower inflation would cool same-store sales growth this year, sending shares down 7.9 percent to $37.46 in afternoon trading. The timing of this year’s Super Bowl also hit sales, executives said.   While shoppers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices, “economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending,” Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on a conference call with analysts.    The largest supermarket operator in the United States said sales at established stores, referred to as same-store sales, rose 3.7 percent in the quarter, excluding fuel, missing the 4.5 percent rise analysts expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Kroger, owner of the Ralphs, Smith’s and Food 4 Less stores, forecast same-store sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for the year ending January 2017, down from 5 percent growth for year earlier. Costco said its same-store sales growth was hurt by lower traffic in January and a strong dollar that dented overseas spending on big-ticket items. Shares in Costco were down 2.1 percent at $149.65. Excluding fuel and foreign exchange impact, same-store sales at Costco rose 5 percent, below the 5.4 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. February traffic was up just over 3.5 percent, while the average transaction fell about 3.75 percent, Costco executives said on a call with analysts. Kroger Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman conceded that  volatile prices for staples such as meat, milk and produce are giving certainty-seeking investors heartburn. Still, he warned against concluding that “less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing.” For example, he said, same-store sales in Kroger’s meat department were down 5 percent in the latest quarter. But steep price declines lured back shoppers who had been suffering from sticker shock and the resulting increase in tonnage contributed to Kroger margins.            “The price of meat went down and the volume went a up lot, which is a sign of a solid, normal consumer environment,” said BB&T; Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf.  The average value of the dollar against a basket of currencies was 8.2 percent higher in Costco’s second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. The company gets about 27 percent of its revenue from outside the United States. Sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last month, hurt by a strong dollar, declining prices for grocery products and sluggish apparel demand.

365,COST,Teamsters recommends rejection of Costco contract,"(Reuters) - Teamsters unions representing 16,000 workers of Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) on Tuesday recommended its members reject a contract offer from the retailer due to a long-running disagreement over its pension plan. The main sticking point is Costco’s decision not to bend to a union request that 3,500 members on the East Coast on a 401(k) pension plan be allowed to join the defined benefit pension plan provided to 12,500 members in California, the International Broth3rhood of Teamsters said in a statement. Costco has characterized the proposal as its “last, best and final offer,” the union said. Costco could not immediately be reached for comment. Rome Aloise, a chief negotiator for the union, said the pension issue was also a sticking point three years ago during the last round of contract negotiations when members ultimately accepted Costco’s contract. In addition to giving East Coast members a defined contribution pension, California workers want a higher company contribution to the plan, the union said. Costco has a reputation as a good employer with relatively high wages, standing out in a retail industry that has come under increased criticism from labor activists in recent years for not paying workers enough to make ends meet. “They are overall a very good employer. It is unfortunate that we’ve come to this loggerhead and hopefully we can work something out,” Aloise told Reuters, estimating that Costco union members earned about $17 an hour on average. Members will vote on the contract later this month. The contract will be approved if a majority of votes are cast in favor of it. But if a majority vote against the contract the union will seek to reopen negotiations, Aloise said. Aloise said it is possible there could be a strike if the company refuses to renegotiate but that he considered it unlikely, noting there had not been a strike since the Teamsters started representing Costco workers in the 1970s.  “I’m hopeful that there won’t be,” Aloise said. Costco’s shares were up about 1 percent at $154.07 in afternoon trading on Tuesday.

371,COST,Costco plans chicken plant in Nebraska: local council,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp is considering building a poultry-processing plant in Nebraska, according to a local development council, a move that would give the retailer tighter control over its chicken supplies. The facility, if built in Nebraska’s Dodge County, would create 1,100 jobs, work with local chicken farmers and invest $180 million in the region, the Greater Fremont Development Council said in a release dated April 14. Costco, the third-largest U.S. retailer, could not immediately be reached for comment. The move would offer Costco greater control over its supply chain at a time when food safety rules are becoming tougher, while also allowing it to capture more of the profit margin and respond more quickly to consumer demands, Brett Hundley, an analyst at BB&T; Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. The Nebraska facility, to be run in partnership with Georgia-based Crider Foods, would be the first plant of its kind owned by Costco, Hundley said. The announcement likely contributed to a roughly 1 percent fall in shares of Pilgrims Pride Corp, which produces chicken for Costco in Alabama, he said. A Pilgrims spokesman declined to comment on any relationship with Costco. “The construction of one chicken plant is not going to affect our business,” he said. The plant would be part of a push for increased livestock and poultry production in the U.S. Midwestern crop belt amid ample feed supplies and low prices. Prices for corn and soymeal, chicken’s primary diet, fell to multi-year lows in recent weeks, before rebounding. Costco chose Dodge County, in eastern Nebraska, as a “preferred site” for the plant because of the area’s quality workforce, available land, farmers willing to raise chickens and proximity to suppliers, among other factors, the Greater Fremont Development Council said. Costco plans to buy 300,000 bushels of corn and 3,000 tons of soybean meal per week from local providers, the council said. Costco is one of the largest U.S. grocers and sells more than 80 million rotisserie chickens a year. It was not immediately clear whether Costco’s recent pledges to phase out the sale of meat raised with “shared-use” antibiotics and chickens raised in cramped cages factored into its decision to erect a plant.   Both moves are part of industry-wide trends that are shaking up food supply chains.

It was not immediately clear whether Costco’s recent pledges to phase out the sale of meat raised with “shared-use” antibiotics and chickens raised in cramped cages factored into its decision to erect a plant.   Both moves are part of industry-wide trends that are shaking up food supply chains.

374,COST,"UPDATE 1-Costco changes stance on pension, Teamsters recommends new contract","(Updates with comments from union negotiator, details on the agreement) April 19 (Reuters) - Teamsters unions representing 16,000 workers of Costco Wholesale Corp on Tuesday recommended their members approve a new contract offer from the retailer that they said would secure larger pension contributions throughout an employee’s career. The new offer came after the union members, which represent about 8 percent of the retailer’s global workforce, rejected an earlier proposal that would not have extended coverage in the defined benefit pension plan to non-participating employees. The new agreement allows those employees - about 4,000 on the East Coast on a 401(k) plan - to join the other roughly 12,000 in California in their defined benefit plan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said on Tuesday. The breakthrough comes as a tight U.S. labor market prompts retailers to improve pay and benefits. Reuters reported on Monday that Target Corp was lifting its minimum hourly pay by $1 to $10, its second hike in a year and following a similar bump by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Without disclosing details, the Teamsters said that language and economic changes allowed it to reverse position and recommend the offer. Ratification would conclude a 12-year push to make the pension change, the head negotiator said. The new plan “means more money being contributed especially throughout an employee’s career,” Rome Aloise told Reuters. “The way the Costco plan works is the longer you are there the more you get, which is what they believe in: That you get rewarded for your longevity.” Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Costco has a reputation as a good employer with relatively high wages, standing out in a retail industry that faces criticism from labor activists for not paying workers enough to make ends meet. But Costco had characterized the initial, rejected proposal as its “last, best and final offer,” the union said last month. When asked why Costco changed its mind even though the new agreement could increase costs, Aloise said he believed the company came to understand how important the pension was to the workers. “Costco is a rare company,” he said. West Coast union members will likely vote on the contract in early May and East Coast members in June, Aloise said. In its latest annual report, Costco said it had 205,000 employees globally, all non-union with the exception of those represented by the Teamsters. It said it considered its employee relations to be very good.

378,COST,Costco eyes expanding business with Pilgrim's Pride,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) plans to expand business with chicken supplier Pilgrim’s Pride Corp (PPC.O) even after building its own poultry processing plant in Nebraska, a senior executive at the retailer told Reuters. Shares of Pilgrim’s Pride have fallen more than 5 percent since April 14 when a development council in Nebraska unveiled plans for the Costco plant, reflecting investor concerns that it could eat into the supply from a Pilgrim’s Pride plant in Alabama. Jeff Lyons, a senior vice president at Costco, said the retailer expected to expand business with Pilgrim’s Pride at the Alabama facility. He said Costco’s need for chicken overall should increase markedly in the coming years assuming even a “moderate” annual unit growth rate of 5 to 8 percent. “We’ve got a long-term deal with Pilgrim’s that we will continue to extend because they are helping us achieve our goals,” he said in an interview on Monday. “It will continue and it will expand. We are working on projects with them right now.” The facility, if built in Nebraska’s Dodge County, would create 1,100 jobs and bring $180 million to the region, the Greater Fremont Development Council said in its April 14 release. Lyons said Nebraska was ideal due to the proximity of grain producers, from which it would procure 300,000 bushels of corn and thousands of tons of soybean meal each week. He said the facility, when fully operational in 2019, would produce 1.6 million birds a week, accounting for a third of its fresh chicken needs. Costco currently has three conventional suppliers of chicken and four for organic birds, Lyons said. He described Foster Farms, another conventional supplier, as a “good partner” and said Costco was “working on something with them right now for the future but it’s not done.” He did not name the third supplier. When asked whether Costco could one day drop a supplier, Lyons said it was possible, but that “it just depends how it plays out.” He said in the case one was dropped it could pick up business from Costco in another area. Lyons said Costco was building the plant in part because chicken producers were focusing increasingly on larger birds, and it needed to secure supply for middle-sized birds that provide the right level of tenderness and other qualities for its rotisserie chickens and other products. The plant would also give its buyers industry experience that would help in negotiations, he said.  He said he was also looking at a possible deal for “another species,” but declined to elaborate on whether it was related to beef, pork or something else.  “Another species, a different animal. Not chickens.”  ",4262016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-costco-wholesale-pilgrims-pride/costco-eyes-expanding-business-with-pilgrims-pride-idUSKCN0XN001

381,COST,"UPDATE 1-Sonova falls short of full-year targets, shares plunge","* Competition from Costco own-brand devices a concern * Expects some negative customer reaction to AudioNova deal * Shares down 7 pct   (Adds new CEO quote, analyst comment, share price) ZURICH, May 18 (Reuters) - Swiss hearing aid maker Sonova  missed full-year targets and lowered its sales outlook on Wednesday, suggesting it could take some time to reap benefits from this month’s acquisition of AudioNova, sending its shares sharply lower. Sonova has been hurt by slower than expected growth for its U.S. cochlear implant business and by customer Costco’s  move to sell own-brand hearing aids at cheaper prices than Sonova’s devices on neighbouring shelves. Though Sonova expects the 830 million euro ($953 million) takeover of Netherlands-based retailer AudioNova to pay off over time, Chief Executive Lukas Braunschweiler acknowledged that it could lose some European customers unhappy with its expanded role as both supplier and competitor. “We expect, and you can see that from our guidance in the coming year, a certain negative reaction from isolated customers in Europe,” Braunschweiler said. “The coming year will be one of transformation.” Shares in Sonova were down 7 percent at 1403 GMT, with the day shaping up to be the stock’s worst in 16 months. The company reported sales in the year to March 31 rose 5.8 percent to 2.07 billion Swiss francs ($2.11 billion), compared with a target of 6-8 percent target. Constant currency earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) were up 1.4 percent at 430.6 million francs, against a target of between 3 percent and 7 percent. Braunschweiler’s new guidance for 2016/17 — sales growth of 4-6 percent and EBITA expansion of 3-7 percent — was described as “weak” by Berenberg analysts, who listed customer  disenchantment with Sonova’s retail acquisition strategy, recession-plagued Brazil and problems at Costco among the company’s main woes. “Costco is a concern, as this had been a key growth driver and Sonova appears to be losing ground to the new own-brand,” Berenberg’s Tom Jones wrote in a note. Braunschweiler said that prices for Costco’s Kirkland-branded hearing aids were recently cut by a further $200 to $1,800. Sonova’s Phonak Brio model at Costco can cost hundreds more. Even so, Braunschweiler said that Sonova cannot abandon supplying hearing aids through Costco because margins from those transactions exceed those of Sonova’s other U.S. retail outlets. “We have to be a part of this channel because it is growing,” Braunschweiler said. “But there’s the question of how we position our products, and there are ongoing discussions with Costco about how we’ll do this.” ",5182016,http://www.reuters.com/article/sonova-results/update-1-sonova-falls-short-of-full-year-targets-shares-plunge-idUSL5N18F2BD
382,COST,"Sonova misses targets as Costco, cochlear implants hurt results","ZURICH (Reuters) - Sonova (SOON.S) on Wednesday missed full-year sales and profit targets that the Swiss hearing aid maker had already cut last year as cochlear implant sales remained sluggish and big U.S. retailer Costco slashed prices on its own-brand products. Sales in local currency rose 5.8 percent to 2.07 billion Swiss francs ($2.11 billion) in the company’s fiscal year to March, it said in a statement, behind Sonova’s 6-8 percent target. Constant currency earnings before interest, taxes and amortization rose 1.4 percent to 430.6 million francs, compared to its 3-7 percent goal.  Income after taxes fell to 345 million francs, from 368 million francs in 2014/2015. Sonova fell short as results were dented by a U.S. cochlear implant business that has not shifted from children to adults as quickly as anticipated and by customer Costco’s (COST.O) focus on its own Kirkland-brand hearing aids at prices that Sonova’s devices struggled to compete against. “Costco has changed the strategy with Kirkland, they lowered the end user price by another $200 for two instruments, so they are down now from $2,000 to $1,800 for two fully fitted instruments, and that’s a brutal low price,” said Sonova Chief Executive Officer Lukas Braunschweiler in an interview.  This month, Sonova said it was buying Netherlands’ retailer AudioNova as it seeks to revive momentum and counter threats from rivals such as Signia, William Demant (WDH.CO) and GN Store Nord (GN.CO), which are also buying retailers where they remove competing products from the shelves. For the current year, Sonova expects sales to grow in the range of 4 to 6 percent and EBITA to increase by 3 to 7 percent, both measured in local currencies. Sonova’s shares were seen falling 2.4 percent in Zurich, according to premarket indicators.

383,COST,Costco posts flat comparable U.S. sales for first time in 6 years,"(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) on Wednesday reported no growth in quarterly comparable sales at U.S. stores for the first time in more than six years, hurt by weak sales in April. Sales at stores in the United States open more than a year were flat, falling short of the 1.9 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at U.S stores had last fallen in 2009. Analysts earlier this month said a pullback in spending by high-income consumers, who make up Costco’s core customer base, contributed to lower comparable sales in April, when the company posted flat growth. Unseasonably cold weather in April, transition issues arising from the company switching to Visa Inc (V.N) for its co-branded credit cards from American Express Co (AXP.N) may have also weighed on comparable sales during the third quarter ended May 8. While retailers such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported weak quarterly sales, citing unseasonable weather and lower demand for apparel and electronics, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which largely caters to lower-income customers, reported better-than-expected sales, helped by demand for basic apparel and higher drug prices.  The quarterly results from retailers suggest that lower-income customers are spending while middle and higher-income customers are holding back.  Comparable store sales were flat in the third quarter, lower than the 1 percent rise analysts were expecting. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, sales at comparable stores rose 3 percent, below the average analyst estimate of 4.6 percent growth.

392,COST,"Visa, MasterCard $7.25 billion settlement with retailers is thrown out","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court’s view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. “This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,” wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement. The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers “opted out.” Thursday’s decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards. It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment. The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial. “Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,” said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other opponents of the accord. “The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.” Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06. The S&P; 500 Information Technology Index .SPLRCT, which includes both, rose 1.1 percent. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in December 2013, saying it offered “significant” damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups nevertheless objected. Some said the payout should have been higher. Others said the accord would have made it too hard to sue Visa and MasterCard. Wal-Mart, in a statement, said the settlement would also have “stifled innovation around new payments technologies and left consumers facing continually increasing hidden swipe fees.” Card issuers American Express Co (AXP.N) and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) also objected to the settlement. The National Retail Federation said retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel, told Reuters in an interview that the settlement would have “forever” shielded card networks from a variety of litigation, while giving retailers “at best” three cents on the dollar in damages. Thursday’s decision “will give real incentives to the card networks to rethink their anti-competitive behavior,” he said. Paul Clement, who led the appeal for retailers supporting the accord, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout. Both declined to comment. The settlement had called for retailers that accepted Visa or MasterCard from January 2004 to November 2012 to share in as much as $7.25 billion, with the ability to opt out. Retailers that accepted the cards from then on, meanwhile, were to get injunctive relief in the form of rule changes, expiring in July 2021, and could not opt out. Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said these groups’ divergent interests meant they should not have been represented by the same law firms, which were awarded $544.8 million of fees. While making clear he did not question the firms’ motives, Jacobs said the conflict “sapped” their incentive to zealously represent the retailers obtaining injunctive relief, and led to terms that benefited other retailers at their expense. The case will return to the Brooklyn federal court, where it will be overseen by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie.

The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial. “Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,” said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other opponents of the accord. “The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.” Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06. The S&P; 500 Information Technology Index, which includes both, rose 1.1 percent. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in December 2013, saying it offered “significant” damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups nevertheless objected. Some said the payout should have been higher. Others said the accord would have made it too hard to sue Visa and MasterCard. Wal-Mart, in a statement, said the settlement would also have “stifled innovation around new payments technologies and left consumers facing continually increasing hidden swipe fees.” Card issuers American Express Co and Discover Financial Services also objected to the settlement. The National Retail Federation said retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel, told  Reuters in an interview that the settlement would have “forever” shielded card networks from a variety of litigation, while giving retailers “at best” three cents on the dollar in damages. Thursday’s decision “will give real incentives to the card networks to rethink their anti-competitive behavior,” he said. Paul Clement, who led the appeal for retailers supporting the accord, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout. Both declined to comment. The settlement had called for retailers that accepted Visa or MasterCard from January 2004 to November 2012 to share in as much as $7.25 billion, with the ability to opt out. Retailers that accepted the cards from then on, meanwhile, were to get injunctive relief in the form of rule changes, expiring in July 2021, and could not opt out. Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said these groups’ divergent interests meant they should not have been represented by the same law firms, which were awarded $544.8 million of fees. While making clear he did not question the firms’ motives, Jacobs said the conflict “sapped” their incentive to zealously represent the retailers obtaining injunctive relief, and led to terms that benefited other retailers at their expense. The case will return to the Brooklyn federal court, where it will be overseen by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie.

394,COST,"UPDATE 5-Visa, MasterCard $7.25 bln settlement with retailers is thrown out","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court’s view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. “This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,” wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement.

Tiffany is also entitled to punitive damages, the jury in Manhattan said. Lawyers for both sides were presenting evidence on Friday to help determine the amount of punitive damages. The trial, which began on Sept. 20, was aimed at determining the amount in total damages that Costco is liable for, after U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled last year that Costco had willfully infringed Tiffany’s trademark by selling rings bearing the luxury retailer’s name. Tiffany spokesman Nathan Strauss declined to comment on  Friday. In a statement on its website, Costco said it would not comment because jury deliberations were continuing. The $5.5 million represents the amount of profit Costco made from the sale of the rings that would fairly compensate Tiffany, said the jury, which was made up of five men and two women. The amount far exceeds the $781,000 that Costco had argued at the start of the trial was the maximum it owed. Costco said about 2,500 rings it sold were found by the court to have infringed Tiffany’s trademark. Costco had also argued that Tiffany’s trademarks were invalid because they sought ti prevent others from using the word “Tiffany” as a generic description of a type of ring setting.

414,COST,Costco drug rebate probe in Ontario goes to discipline panel,"(Reuters) - Two executives of Costco Wholesale Corp  may have sought kickbacks from drug makers in violation of Ontario law, an industry regulator in the Canadian province has found as it advances a probe into the retailer’s pharmacy business. The Ontario College of Pharmacists launched an investigation into the executives for alleged misconduct after a former sales consultant for Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals filed a complaint saying the Costco executives sought illegal rebates of up to $1.3 million on drugs supplied to the retailer. Costco has denied the allegations, saying the company and the two executives have complied with all laws. Stuart Shamis, an attorney for the retailer, said there had been no finding of wrongdoing. He declined to comment on specific allegations. The regulator’s investigation into the two men found sufficient evidence to refer the matter to its discipline committee, according to a notice on its website last week. That step is taken when a probe finds a person may have “been dishonest, breached trust” or violated professional principles, its website says. If wrongdoing is found, penalties range from a public reprimand to revocation of an individual’s certificate to practice in the industry for a minimum of a year. The probe into the Costco executives marks the first time an allegation involving rebates has been escalated to the discipline committee since Ontario law was changed in April 2013 to ban all rebates, paid directly or indirectly, to pharmacy operators, a spokesman for the regulator said. Rebates are legal elsewhere in Canada. The complaint, first reported by the Toronto Star newspaper in March, has put a spotlight on Costco’s pharmacy business in Canada, where it has 94 locations, ranking as its second largest market after the United States. In addition to Ranbaxy, which was acquired by India’s Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd last year, the regulator listed in its allegations units of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Pharmascience Inc as other drug makers that may have paid rebates to Costco between April 2013 and Dec. 31, 2015. A Mylan spokeswoman said the company was not a subject of the probe and had cooperated with requests for information. The other drugmakers did not respond to requests for comment. The complaint was submitted by former Ranbaxy representative Tony Gagliese in August, 2015. As evidence, Gagliese submitted a secretly recorded phone conversation in which Joseph Hanna, a director of pharmacy buying at Costco, can be heard telling Gagliese that Ranbaxy would need to provide up to $1.3 million to the retailer to maintain its business in Ontario. While Hanna said the money would be marked for “marketing initiatives” he appeared to calculate the $1.3 million in the context of Ranbaxy giving at least 60 percent of sales across Canada, including Ontario, back to Costco. Reuters reviewed the recording but could not independently verify its contents. Gagliese declined to comment. Hanna and the other Costco executive named in the investigation, Lawrence Varga, did not respond to requests for comment. Shamis, the attorney, said Costco was confident the two men had acted appropriately and in accordance with regulations.

Detroit automakers need a strong year-end sales push. They are sitting on hefty inventories of unsold sedans, compact cars and sports cars as consumers shift to pickup trucks and SUVs. The share prices of General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) are flat to down for the year. This reflects investor concerns that a six-year auto sales boom in the United States is reaching an end and that sustaining sales levels will require more aggressive price cutting.  “We are seeing a tougher pricing environment, higher levels of discounts,” said Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields. He predicted November and December sales would be about the same as a year ago, when the annualized sales pace averaged about 17.9 million vehicles a year. Ford kicked off its Black Friday sales promotions in early November, after reporting an 11.7 percent drop in October sales.  Rivals have since followed suit. GM’s GMC truck brand is promoting “Black Friday All Month Long” with discounts of as much as 20 percent off list prices for pickup trucks. Luxury automakers usually join the fray in December. Toyota Motor Corp’s (7203.T) Lexus brand began touting its annual “December to Remember” deals ahead of Thanksgiving weekend, offering 0.9 percent, five-year loans or $1,000 off on its compact IS 300 sedan in certain markets. GM this week began offering markdowns on the Chevrolet Corvette sports car through retailer Costco Wholesale Corp’s (COST.O) car-buying club, the first time the Corvette has been offered through the discount retailer’s car buying service. At the start of the month, there were 122 days of Corvette inventory, up 51 percent from a year earlier and nearly double the level automakers consider ideal, according to Automotive News data. Like other retailers, automakers use holiday-themed promotions to boost sales during the final two months of the year, and like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), automakers have steadily expanded the Christmas season over the past several years.  The concept of winter holiday sales is going global. Black Friday car deals came to Britain about six years ago. In China, automotive marketers target customers on Singles Day, Nov. 11, led by Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N). Singles Day has become the largest shopping day of the year as Alibaba encourages vendors on its sites to offer heavy discounts on items from cars to clothing. Automakers in the U.S. market will report November sales on Dec. 1, and analysts expect an increase in total U.S. auto sales from a year ago. The annualized sales pace could drop, however, to 17.9 million vehicles, according to J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. A year ago, the annualized selling rate for November was 18.25 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. A factor working in the automakers’ favor is the advanced age, 11.6 years on average, of the U.S. fleet of 264 million vehicles. It is unclear to what extent automakers will offer deeper discounts overall in the coming weeks or repackage existing deals with holiday bows. J.D. Power data on new-vehicle discounts provided to Reuters shows that on average GM discounts grew 1 percent in October from a month earlier, to $4,700 per vehicle, while Ford’s average discount fell 10.6 percent to about $4,400 per vehicle. Fiat Chrysler’s October discounts were flat at $4,920 in October from September, according to J.D. Power. But the company offered $7,800 or more off its top-seller, the Ram 1500 pickup truck. “Incentive levels are near record highs as a percentage of the selling price,” said Jeff Schuster, lead forecaster for LMC Automotive, an automotive consultancy. At the same time, Detroit automakers are cutting production.   Both GM and Ford recently announced production cuts. GM announced indefinite layoffs for 2,000 workers at two U.S. factories that build various car models. Ford ordered temporary layoffs.

419,COST,Costco's profit beats estimates on higher store traffic,"(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by increased store traffic and higher sales of fresh foods. Fresh food was among the company’s strongest selling categories, according to its monthly sales reports for September, October and November. Costco last week reported a 1 percent rise in quarterly sales at U.S. stores open more than a year. Comparable sales, excluding impact of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange, also rose 1 percent.  Comparable sales and traffic in the quarter remained strong in the United States, except in the first two weeks of November due to the U.S. Presidential election, but picked up in the second half of the month, the company had said. Net income attributable to the company rose to $545 million, or $1.24 per share, in the first quarter ended Nov. 20, from $480 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier.   Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Total revenue rose 3.2 percent to $28.10 billion, slightly below estimates of $28.30 billion.

420,COST,Costco to pay $11.75 mln over lax U.S. pharmacy controls,"(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp will pay $11.75 million to resolve claims that some of its pharmacies filled improper or incomplete prescriptions for controlled substances in violation of federal regulations, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. The deal, one of several corporate settlements being unveiled during the last days of President Barack Obama’s administration, came as U.S. authorities grapple with an opioid drug epidemic. “This settlement demonstrates the accountability and responsibility that go along with handling controlled prescription drugs,” U.S. Drug Enforcement Assistant Administrator Louis Milione said in a statement. A Costco spokesman declined to comment. Under the settlement, Costco acknowledged that from 2012 to 2015 some of its pharmacies dispensed drugs without complying with the Controlled Substances Act and related regulations, the Justice Department said. Those violations included filling prescriptions that lacked valid DEA numbers; filling prescriptions outside the scope of a doctor’s DEA registration; and failing to maintain accurate dispensing records, the Justice Department said. “These are not just administrative or paperwork violations - Costco’s failure to have proper controls in place in its pharmacies played a role in prescription drugs reaching the black market,” said U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker in Los Angeles. The Justice Department said Costco had bought a new pharmacy management system and set up a three-tier audit program at its pharmacies to address the issues. Under the settlement, DEA officials will be allowed to conduct unannounced and unrestricted inspections of all DEA-registered Costco pharmacies for the next three years, the Justice Department said.",1192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/costco-wholesale-settlement/costco-to-pay-11-75-mln-over-lax-u-s-pharmacy-controls-idUSL1N1F91VV

424,COST,Retail giant Costco wins dismissal of prawn lawsuit over Thai forced labor,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit claiming that retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. had knowingly sold frozen prawns, the farming of which involved forced labor in Thailand. Judge Jeffrey White ruled that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the world’s second largest retail chain was bound to inform customers that modern-day slavery could be part of its supply chain. The lawsuit, filed in 2015, claimed U.S.-headquartered Costco was aware the prawns it bought from its Southeast Asian producers came from a supply chain dependent on ships involved in human trafficking and labor abuses. “The facts described in the (complaint) are tragic and ‘raise significant ethical concerns’,” White wrote on Tuesday in an order to dismiss the case, held in Oakland, California. But “plaintiffs fail to allege (Costco) had a duty to disclose the information about labor abuses in the supply chain ... on its product packaging,” he added. The case against Costco, which is run as a members’ warehouse, was filed by club member Monica Sud, a California resident, as a proposed class-action lawsuit with Sud arguing it could affect millions of customers in her state. Exporter C.P. Food Products Inc and its parent company, Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Foods, PCL. were also named as defendants in the case. Charoen Pokphand Foods said in a statement emailed through its public relations representatives that it condemned “all aspects of human trafficking and forced labor.” “CP Foods is not – and has never been – an owner or operator of fishing vessels that used forced labor as alleged in the lawsuit,” the company said.  Attorneys representing the plaintiffs and other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.     Sud along with fellow Costco customers alleged that Costco purchased farmed prawns, also known in the industry as shrimp, from the Southeast Asian seafood producers despite knowing they used ships manned by slave laborers. The complaint followed investigations by Britain’s Guardian newspaper and the Associated Press into the shrimp supply chain. The probe found that large numbers of men were brought and held against their will on fishing boats off Thailand that were used to farm prawns sold in some of the world’s leading supermarkets. The Guardian found Charoen Pokphand Foods was buying fishmeal to feed to its farmed prawns from some suppliers that owned, operated or brought from fishing boats staffed by slaves. But in dismissing the lawsuit, the judge said the plaintiffs could not trace the prawns they bought to the suppliers in question. Judge White dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be brought again. The plaintiffs had filed their lawsuit under a California state law that prohibits unfair competition through misleading advertising. Last year, the U.S. State Department’s Trafficking in Persons report removed Thailand from the bottom rung despite what it described as “widespread forced labor” in the country’s vital seafood industry. Globally, nearly 21 million people are victims of forced labor, according to the International Labour Organization.

428,COST,"Costco's same-store sales, profit miss estimates","(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) reported lower-than-expected quarterly comparable-store sales and profit as big grocery chains competed fiercely to attract customers with lower prices. The company’s shares fell about 4 percent to $170.80 in extended trading on Thursday. Price war in the industry has intensified, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reportedly running a new price-comparison test to knock out competition from grocery chains and big-box retailers. The cut-throat competition has already hit supermarket operator Kroger Co (KR.N), which reported its first decline in quarterly comparable sales in 13 years on Thursday. Costco’s total same-store sales rose 3 percent in the second quarter ended Feb. 12, excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange.  Analysts on average were expecting 3.2 percent growth, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Costco said it would raise annual fees by $5 to $60 for Goldstar and business members and by $10 to $120 for executive memberships from June 1. The fee increases will impact around 35 million members, roughly half of them executive members, the company said. Membership fees accounted for about 72 percent of the Costco’s operating income in 2016, according to the company’s latest annual filing. Net income attributable to Costco fell to $515 million, or $1.17 per share, in the latest quarter from $546 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier.

436,COST,UPDATE 2-AmEx profit beats as higher spending blunts partnership losses,"(Reuters) - American Express Co’s (AXP.N) first-quarter profit fell less than expected as its card members spent more and the company expressed more confidence over its full-year results, amid fierce competition in the industry. AmEx’s shares rose 2.5 percent after the bell on Wednesday as the results and guidance indicated the company was starting to mitigate some of the impact of losing key partnerships last year, especially one with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). Some of that impact was also blunted by AmEx spending heavily on marketing as well as on premium rewards to retain existing customers and woo new ones. The company, which has long catered to affluent customers, last month fattened up rewards on its Platinum charge cards to fortify its high-end market against JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N). However, AmEx is curbing costs in other areas to bolster margins and said it was on track to remove $1 billion from its expenses this year and was “very confident” of meeting its full-year profit forecast of $5.60-$5.80 per share. “As we move through 2017, we expect net income and EPS to grow due to the benefits from our cost-reduction initiatives and the seasonality of revenue,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell said on a call with analysts. Campbell has said in mid-January, after AmEx’s fourth-quarter results, that earnings and revenue would be “uneven” in 2017. AmEx said first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders fell 13 percent to $1.21 billion, or $1.34 per share, from a year earlier, which included some now  discontinued partnerships. Analysts on average were expecting $1.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said AmEx did reasonably well, excluding Costco, and noted the company’s growth had accelerated last year and continued in the latest quarter. “The company has had to spend more to generate the types of growth ... and now we see them starting to pull back on the expenses, but still put up accelerated growth and I think that is what is encouraging,” Sakhrani said. AmEx said it also benefited from higher net card fees and loan growth in the quarter. Card member spending increased 8 percent, adjusted for currency fluctuations and the loss of the Costco partnership, while net card fees rose 7 percent. Loans grew 11 percent, with more than half of the growth in U.S. consumer loans coming from existing customers. AmEx added 1.7 million new cards across its U.S. issuing businesses and 2.6 million worldwide in the quarter, slightly higher than the additions in the fourth quarter.

437,COST,Fitch: Costco's 'A+' IDR Unaffected by $3.1B Special Dividend,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 26 (Fitch) Costco Wholesale Corporation's (Costco; NYSE: COST) 'A+' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is unaffected by the $7 per share $3.1 billion debt-financed special dividend declared on April 25, 2017, according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch projects leverage will increase by roughly 0.5x as a result of the action. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Costco had $4.7 billion of cash, $1.2 billion of short-term investments and $5.1 billion of debt at Feb. 12, 2017. The company intends to fund the special dividend primarily through additional borrowings. Fitch anticipates Costco could look to pre-fund $1.1 billion of 1.125% notes maturing December 2017 when accessing the market to finance the special dividend. Costco's ratings reflect its top three market position in North America food retailing with over 700 high-volume warehouses that generate nearly $119 billion in revenue, industry-leading comparable sales (comps), robust cash flow, and low financial leverage. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 1.2x for the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended Feb. 12, 2017. Pro for the $3.1 billion dividend, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 1.8x. Fitch affirmed Costco's ratings on April 7, 2017, contemplating a potential special dividend due to Costco's demonstrated willingness to periodically issue debt to return cash to shareholders. Costco previously paid a $5 per share special dividend in fiscal 2015 and a $7 per share special dividend in fiscal 2013. Fitch projects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will approximate 1.8x in fiscal 2017 (August), 1.5x in fiscal 2018, and be sustained in low to mid 1.0x range thereafter. KEY RATING DRIVERS Growing Membership, High Retention: Fitch expects Costco's growing membership, which currently consists of 48.3 million paid members, and high retention rate to support future sales and operating income growth. Costco's member base has grown at a 6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years. Renewal rates have approximated 90%, providing a stable stream of fee-based revenue. In fiscal 2016, membership fees totalled $2.6 billion, representing a modest 2% of Costco's $118.7 billion of revenue but 72% of its $3.7 billion of reported operating income. Effective June 1, 2017, Costco will raise annual membership fees in North America by 9% for both standard and Executive status or to $60 and $120, respectively. The last fee increase was 10% back in November 2011. Membership renewal and growth has historically shown little sensitivity to fee increases. Fitch believes this is due to Costco's membership base consisting of households with higher incomes than the U.S. average and enhanced rewards and savings that generally follow fee increases and therefore does not expect the pending increase to negatively impact membership growth or renewal rates. Costco continues to upgrade members to the more profitable Executive membership, which offers additional savings and benefits. Executive members represented 39% of paid cardholders at the end of fiscal 2016. Comps Slow But Lead Industry: Costco's comps, excluding the impact of fuel and currency, have slowed from 6% to 7% during fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2015 to 4% in 2016, 3% in the quarter ended Feb. 12, 2017, and 5% in March but continue to lead peers. Guest shopping frequency continues to be a positive contributor to sales but food and merchandise deflation, which reduces average ticket size, and new store cannibalization have negatively impacted comps. Growth in on-line sales has varied between the high single-digit to mid-teens rate over the past several years but is not making a significant contribution to comps because e-commerce only represents about 4% of Costco's net sales. Fitch projects comps (excluding fuel and foreign exchange) will pace near current levels in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 as food deflation moderates and Costco continues to price competitively. Efficient Operations, Continued Investments: Costco offers a wide array of products but limits specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors to enhance its operating efficiency and support its ability to invest in price. Warehouses maintain an average of 3,700 stock keeping units (SKUs) and are highly productive, generating more than $160 million of average annual sales each year. During fiscal 2016, 57% of sales were food-related products, 15% were from ancillary businesses, 16% consisted of hardlines, and 12% were softlines. Costco has increased capex to about 2.2% of sales from 1.8% in fiscal 2014 to support mid-single digit square footage growth and investments in distribution logistics and website functionality to enhance the on-line member experience. Low but Steady Margins: Costco's high volume warehouses and operating efficiency allow the company to operate profitably with low but relatively stable gross margins in the 12% to 13% range and EBIT margins in the 3% range. Profitability should benefit from the company's new co-branded credit card arrangement with Citibank, N.A., which became effective in June 2016; due to lower merchant fees, royalties earned on external spend, and a bounty on new signups through Costco, as well as the pending membership fee increase. However, Fitch projects margins will remain near current levels given that Costco generally passes along savings to members to remain price competitive. Solid Cash Flow, Range-Bound Leverage: Over the past five years, Costco has generated an average of $3.6 billion of cash flow from operations (CFO) and nearly $900 million of free cash flow (FCF; CFO less capex and dividends) allowing the company to invest in its business and return cash to shareholders. During most years, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR has remained range-bound in the low-to-mid 1.0x range. Fitch projects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 1.8x in fiscal 2017 versus 1.3x in fiscal 2016, and 1.5x in fiscal 2018. Fitch's projection reflects the repayment of $1.1 billion of 5.5% senior unsecured notes that matured in March 2017 but assumes Costco issues $3 billion to finance the special dividend and prefunds $1.1 billion of 1.125% notes maturing December 2017. FCF, excluding the special dividend, is expected to approximate $2 billion in fiscal 2017, due to the acceleration of $1.7 billion of vendor payments in fiscal 2016 which resulted in FCF being negative $100 million. FCF is expected to range between $700 million to $900 billion thereafter, reflecting Fitch's assumption of lower comp growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Costco include: --Revenue grows at a mid-single digit rate annually due to 2% to 3% comps growth, excluding fuel and currency, and expansion; --EBITDA grows at a mid- single digit rate rising to above $6 billion by fiscal 2019; --Gross margins and EBIT margin remain near current levels as the negative impact of rising fuel prices on gross margins and information technology spending on SG&A; are offset by benefits of the new co-branded credit card and higher member fees; --FCF approximates $2 billion (excluding the $3.1 billion special dividend) in fiscal 2017 due to timing of vendor payments and at least $600 million thereafter.; --Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 1.8x in fiscal 2017, 1.5x in fiscal 2018, and then in the low to mid 1x range thereafter. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Continued strong operating momentum with comp growth (excluding the impact of fuel and currency changes) in the low- to mid-single digits and stable operating margins with a public commitment to maintain total adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the low-1x range could result in an upgrade in Costco's ratings. Negative Rating Action: Sustained weakness in operating trends, caused by meaningfully lower comps (excluding the impact of fuel and currency changes) and membership declines combined with shareholder-friendly actions that lead to increased debt levels would be viewed negatively. A sustained period of total adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the high-1x range could lead to a downgrade in Costco's ratings. LIQUIDITY Costco's liquidity is supported by the company's significant cash and short-term investments balance. At Feb. 12, 2017, cash totalled $4.7 billion and short-term investments totalled $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the company's cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2016. Costco also had $406 million of availability under uncommitted credit facilities, $333 million of which was at international operations, at Feb. 12, 2017. Fitch currently rates Costco as follows: Costco Wholesale Corporation --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

441,COST,Fitch Rates Costco's $3.8B Planned Issuance 'A+'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to Costco Wholesale Corporation's (Costco) issuance of $1 billion four-year senior unsecured notes due 2021, $800 million 5-year senior unsecured notes due 2022, $1 billion 7-year notes due 2024, and $1 billion 10-year notes due 2027. Proceeds will be used to finance Costco's $7 per share (around $3.1 billion) special dividend. The notes, which are being issued under Costco's First Supplemental Indenture dated March 20, 2002 which supplements the original indenture dated Oct. 26, 2001, rank pari passu with Costco's existing debt, and contain a Change of Control Triggering Event provision. Costco's ratings reflect its top-three market position in North America food retailing with over 700 high-volume warehouses that generate nearly $119 billion in revenue, industry-leading comparable sales (comps), robust cash flow, and low financial leverage. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 1.2x for the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended Feb. 12, 2017. Pro forma for the $3.8 billion debt issuance and subsequent repayment of $1.1 billion of 1.125% notes maturing Dec. 15, 2017, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 1.7x. KEY RATING DRIVERS Growing Membership, High Retention: Fitch expects Costco's growing membership, which currently consists of 48.3 million paid members, and high retention rate to support future sales and operating income growth. Costco's member base has grown at a 6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years. Renewal rates have approximated 90%, providing a stable stream of fee-based revenue. In fiscal 2016 (August), membership fees totalled $2.6 billion, representing a modest 2% of Costco's $118.7 billion of revenue but 72% of its $3.7 billion of reported operating income. Effective June 1, 2017, Costco will raise annual membership fees in North America by 9% for both standard and Executive status or to $60 and $120, respectively. The last fee increase was 10% back in November 2011. Membership renewal and growth has historically shown little sensitivity to fee increases. Fitch believes this is due to Costco's membership base, which consists of households with higher incomes than the U.S. average, and the enhanced rewards and savings that generally follow fee increases, and therefore we do not expect the pending increase to have a negative impact on membership growth or renewal rates.

Guest shopping frequency continues to be a positive contributor to sales, but food and merchandise deflation, which reduces average ticket size, and new store cannibalization have negatively impacted comps. Growth in on-line sales has varied between the high single-digits to the mid-teens over the past several years but is not making a significant contribution to comps because e-commerce represents only about 4% of Costco's net sales.

Costco has increased capex to about 2.2% of sales from 1.8% in fiscal 2014 to support mid-single-digit square footage growth and investments in distribution logistics and website functionality to enhance the on-line member experience. Low but Steady Margins: Costco's high-volume warehouses and operating efficiency allow it to operate profitably with low but relatively stable gross margins in the 12%-13% range and EBIT margins in the 3% range.

Solid Cash Flow, Range-Bound Leverage: Over the past five years, Costco has generated an average of $3.6 billion of cash flow from operations (CFO) and nearly $900 million of free cash flow (FCF; CFO less capex and dividends), allowing the company to invest in its business and return cash to shareholders. During most years, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR has remained range-bound in the low- to mid-1x range. Fitch projects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 1.8x in fiscal 2017 versus 1.3x in fiscal 2016, and 1.5x in fiscal 2018. Fitch's projection reflects the repayment of $1.1 billion of 5.5% senior unsecured notes that matured in March 2017 and refinancing of the $1.1 billion of 1.125% notes maturing December 2017. FCF is expected to be negative in fiscal 2017, due to the $3.1 billion special dividend. FCF is then projected to range between $700 million-$900 billion thereafter, reflecting Fitch's assumption of lower comp growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Costco include: --Revenue grows by mid-single-digits annually due to 2%-3% comps growth, excluding fuel and currency, and expansion; --EBITDA grows at a mid-single-digit rate rising to above $6 billion by fiscal 2019; --Gross margins and EBIT margin remain near current levels as the negative impact of rising fuel prices on gross margins and information technology spending on SG&A; are offset by benefits of the new co-branded credit card and higher member fees; --FCF is negative in 2017 due to the $3.1 billion special dividend and $700 million-$900 million thereafter; --Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 1.8x in fiscal 2017, 1.5x in fiscal 2018, and in the low- to mid-1x range thereafter. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Continued strong operating momentum with comp growth (excluding the impact of fuel and currency changes) in the low- to mid-single digits and stable operating margins with a public commitment to maintain total adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the low-1x range could result in an upgrade in Costco's ratings.

449,COST,UPDATE 1-Citigroup sees slightly lower returns from branded cards business,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) trimmed its outlook on Friday for the profitability of its North American branded credit cards business to a 2.15 percent return on assets from 2.25 percent. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, speaking in a quarterly conference call with fixed income investors, said the revision is a result of changing interest rates and a greater portion of the business coming from its new Costco (COST.O) co-branded card.  The Costco card, he said, is outperforming expectations and will bring in more revenue and income but with a lower return on assets. Gerspach said the Costco card business, which Citigroup won by outbidding American Express (AXP.N), is exceeding the bank’s targets for numbers of accounts, use by customers, revenue and return on assets.    Gerspach’s comments provided a hint of the details that analysts expect to hear from Citigroup on Tuesday when the bank holds its first “investor day” conference since the financial crisis. He also said that Citigroup’s retail services division, which mostly issues store-branded cards in the United States, is still expected to earn a 2.50 return on assets despite a rise in the rate of losses on accounts because of new problems collecting from delinquent borrowers. The two North American credit card businesses provided nearly 20 percent of Citigroup’s income from continuing operations in 2016.

457,COST,Costco owes Tiffany $19.4 million for fake Tiffany rings: U.S. judge," (This Aug. 14 story has been corrected to clarify the judge’s decision.) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday said Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) may recover at least $19.4 million in damages from Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) over the warehouse club chain’s illegal sale of counterfeit diamond engagement rings bearing the “Tiffany” name. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain said Tiffany deserves $11.1 million, plus interest, representing triple the lost profit from Costco’s trademark infringement, plus the $8.25 million in punitive damages awarded by a jury last October. The Manhattan judge also permanently barred Costco from using “Tiffany” standing alone, in the absence of modifiers such as “setting,” “set” or “style,” to sell anything that Tiffany did not make.     Costco said it intends to appeal, calling the decision “a product of multiple errors” by Swain. “This was not a case about counterfeiting in the common understanding of that word — Costco was not selling imitation Tiffany & Co rings,” Costco said. Tiffany had sued Costco on Valentine’s Day in 2013. While the case concerned only about 2,500 rings, Tiffany sued to protect its brand and cachet as one of the world’s best-known luxury retailers. Tiffany last month named industry veteran Alessandro Bogliolo as its new chief executive to help arrest declines in same-store sales as millennials spend elsewhere on accessories. Costco had argued that “Tiffany” had become a generic term, excusing its use on a standalone basis. But the judge found Costco’s defenses “not credible,” given evidence that displays of fine jewelry were a key part of the Issaquah, Washington-based company’s marketing strategy. Salespeople “described such rings as ‘Tiffany’ rings in response to customer inquiries, and were not perturbed when customers who then realized that the rings were not actually manufactured by Tiffany expressed anger or upset,” Swain wrote. Costco’s upper management “displayed at best a cavalier attitude toward Costco’s use of the Tiffany name in conjunction with ring sales and marketing,” the judge added. The jury had awarded Tiffany $5.5 million rather than $3.7 million for lost profit. Swain found the lower sum sufficient. Leigh Harlan, Tiffany’s general counsel, in a statement said the decision “sends a clear and powerful message” to anyone seeking to infringe the New York-based company’s trademark. “We brought this case because we felt a responsibility to protect the value of our customers’ purchases and to ensure that Costco’s customers were not misled,” she said.

In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan rejected claims that American Express improperly downplayed the risk its 16-year relationship with Costco might end, and concealed how the warehouse chain had generated 8 percent of its revenue and 20 percent of its loans. While the proposed class-action complaint alleged that Costco might have viewed American Express as “just another vendor” that could be shunted aside for a “cheaper” rival, the judge said American Express merely viewed such statements as evidence that Costco would “drive a hard bargain,” not walk away. The plaintiffs were led by the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund in Springfield, Illinois. Its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. American Express spokeswoman Marina Norville said the New York-based company was pleased with the decision, which was dated Sept. 30. The judge said the plaintiffs may amend their complaint. The market value of American Express fell by roughly $8 billion in the two days after the company, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), disclosed the loss of the Costco contract, which moved to Visa Inc (V.N). American Express has long traditionally focused on affluent customers who often pay bills on time, but has been encouraging some cardholders to borrow more and earn more rewards.

463,COST,"UPDATE 1-Whole Foods price cuts hit hardest at Trader Joe's, Sprouts -study","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Trader Joe’s and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc have been hit hardest by customer defections since Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) cut prices at Whole Foods, a data analytics firm said on Tuesday. Amazon slashed prices on select items at Whole Foods on Aug. 28, the day the world’s largest online retailer closed its $13.7 billion purchase of the premium grocer, a move widely expected to upend the food retail business.  On that day, Whole Foods’ customer traffic spiked 31 percent from a year earlier, according to a Thasos Group analysis of location data from millions of mobile phone users. Traffic was up 17 percent during the full week after the price reductions and remained up 4 percent for the following week, ended Sept. 16. According to the Thasos data, 10 percent of Trader Joe’s regular customers visited Whole Foods between Aug. 28 and Sept. 3, more than any other competing chain, followed by Sprouts, with 8 percent. Target Corp (TGT.N) saw 3 percent of customers visit Whole Foods while Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Safeway both saw 2 percent. Although Trader Joe’s and Sprouts saw the greatest percentage of their customers visit Whole Foods, the biggest losers in terms of actual shoppers were Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Kroger Co (KR.N), the leading U.S. grocery sellers with millions of customers. Wal-Mart accounted for 24 percent of Whole Foods’ new customers and Kroger 16 percent, from Aug. 28 through Sept. 3. During that period, 15 percent of shoppers came from Costco, 11 percent were from Target and 5 percent were from Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club. The price reductions did not attract customers outside Whole Foods’ traditional upper-income demographic. They also did not convince consumers to drive longer distances to shop at Whole Foods, said Thasos Group Chief Executive Greg Skibiski, who added that the data used for the Whole Foods competitive analysis includes 10 percent of the U.S. population. “Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods has the potential to be a gamechanger in the grocery space,” Skibiski said. Orbital Insight, which monitors business at about 65 percent of Whole Foods locations, reported a 5 percent year-over-year increase in car traffic to Whole Foods stores in the month since the acquisition closed. Foursquare, which analyzed the mobile phone movements of more than 2.5 million Americans, said traffic to Whole Foods was up about 13 percent the first week after the price cuts and remained up 8 percent after the second week. Shares in Amazon fell 0.3 percent on Tuesday. Target and Sprouts were also down slightly. Shares of Wal-Mart, Kroger and Costco were up modestly.

464,COST,"Shrinking margins cloud Costco's profit beat, shares fall","(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp’s (COST.O) quarterly profit scraped past estimates, helped by a hike in membership fees, but a fall in gross margins fueled concerns of an intensifying grocer price war, sending shares down 3.6 percent in after-market trading. Investors are wary that Costco’s business model, which mainly generates revenue through a niche membership club, faces increased competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which has begun to shake up the grocery space with its acquisition of Whole Foods. Gross margins in the fourth quarter were lower year-over-year by 15 basis points, as the retailer spends to drive sales and member loyalty, Costco said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday. “We believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco’s business could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” BMO Capital Markets analysts said in a pre-earnings client note. Costco’s shares have fallen 7.2 percent since the Amazon-Whole Foods deal was announced in June. Costco implemented its annual membership fee increase by $5-$60 for Goldstar and business members, and by $10-$120 for executive memberships in the quarter. Membership fees, which accounted for about 72 percent of Costco’s operating income in 2016, rose 13 percent in the 17-week fourth quarter ended Sept. 3. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, total comp sales rose 5.7 percent, while analysts at research firm Consensus Metrix expected an increase of 5.1 percent. Costco’s U.S. comp sales rose 5.8 percent in the quarter. Net income attributable to Costco rose to $919 million, or $2.08 per share, from $779 million, or $1.77 per share.

465,COST,"UPDATE 2-Shrinking margins cloud Costco's profit beat, shares fall","(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp’s (COST.O) quarterly profit scraped past estimates, helped by a hike in membership fees, but a fall in gross margins fueled concerns of an intensifying grocer price war, sending shares down 3.6 percent in after-market trading. Investors are wary that Costco’s business model, which mainly generates revenue through a niche membership club, faces increased competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which has begun to shake up the grocery space with its acquisition of Whole Foods. Gross margins in the fourth quarter were lower year-over-year by 15 basis points, as the retailer spends to drive sales and member loyalty, Costco said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday. “We believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco’s business could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” BMO Capital Markets analysts said in a pre-earnings client note. Costco’s shares have fallen 7.2 percent since the Amazon-Whole Foods deal was announced in June. Costco implemented its annual membership fee increase by $5-$60 for Goldstar and business members, and by $10-$120 for executive memberships in the quarter. Membership fees, which accounted for about 72 percent of Costco’s operating income in 2016, rose 13 percent in the 17-week fourth quarter ended Sept. 3. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, total comp sales rose 5.7 percent, while analysts at research firm Consensus Metrix expected an increase of 5.1 percent. Costco’s U.S. comp sales rose 5.8 percent in the quarter. Net income attributable to Costco rose to $919 million, or $2.08 per share, from $779 million, or $1.77 per share. Total revenue rose 15.7 percent to $42.30 billion. Analysts on average had estimated earnings of $2.02 per share and revenue of $41.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

468,COST,Costco shares down on fears of grocery delivery eating into margins,"(Reuters) - Shares in Costco (COST.O) fell 6 percent on Friday after the retailer reported a decline in quarterly gross margins and underlined the growing competition in the industry by launching new grocery delivery services.  The membership-based chain on Thursday reported a quarterly profit which scraped past estimates and said it had rolled out two grocery delivery services this week, a new step in its efforts to fight growing competition from Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said in the company’s post-results call that the retailer had started offering two-day delivery of dry groceries as well as a same-day delivery service for groceries including fresh foods. The two-day delivery would be free for online orders over $75 across the United States, while the same-day service - offered through its partner Instacart - is available at 376  U.S. stores.  BMO Capital Markets analyst Kelly Bania said the new offerings were a huge positive for Costco given the perception that it has been slow with its pace of digital transformation.  “(But) we also see risk these initiatives will weigh on margins over time and may be viewed as defensive,” she said. Shares in Walmart and Kroger (KR.N), the leading U.S. grocery retailers, were also down around 1 percent. Groceries, while a low-margin business, bring more customers into stores, and major players including Wal-Mart and Target Corp (TGT.N) have poured millions into the area as they look to boost store traffic as well as online sales. Competition has further tightened since Amazon bought Whole Foods and reduced prices at the upmarket grocer in August, a move which has hit Wal-Mart and Kroger hardest in terms of lost customers. Galanti said Whole Foods’ price cuts had not impacted Costco and that it had not reduced its in-store prices in response to the deal.  “(Costco’s) new online delivery initiatives improve its competitive offering and could drive increased engagement with millennials,” Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a note.  The retailer said it was lowering online prices and adding more high-end and well-known brands such as GE appliances and Spyder skiing apparel to its ecommerce site.  “Costco made e-commerce a core part of its earnings call for the first time in memory,” Susquehanna analyst Bill Dreher said. “We believe this shows a new focus on a key engine of growth.” ",10062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-costco-wholesale-strategy-delivery/costco-shares-down-on-fears-of-grocery-delivery-eating-into-margins-idUSKBN1CB1EV

The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report showed nonfarm payrolls fell by 33,000 in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left displaced workers temporarily unemployed and delayed hiring. However, a bright spot was the better-than-expected rise in average wages, up 0.5 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase estimated by economists polled by Thomson Reuters. The gain was the largest since December 2016, helping lift the dollar to a 12-week high. “I think most people realized going in that the headline numbers would be distorted because of the storms, but the surprise was the average hourly earnings,” said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets currency strategy, Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. At 10:58 a.m. ET (1458 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 35.02 points, or 0.15 percent, at 22,740.37. The S&P; 500 was down 7.54 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,544.53. At these levels, the index will end an eight-day gaining streak. The Nasdaq Composite was down 15.25 points, or 0.23 percent, at 6,570.11 after hitting its sixth-straight record high. The S&P; 500 had marked its sixth straight record closing high on Thursday, in large part due to gains in the technology index. However, on Friday the index fell 0.2 percent, dragged down by losses in Apple and Microsoft. Shares of Costco dropped to their lowest in nearly a month after the warehouse club retailer reported a fall in gross margins. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. Energy declined 0.9 percent as oil prices looked set to end a multi-week bull run amid a bout of profit taking and the return of oversupply worries. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,990 to 793. On the Nasdaq, 1,612 issues fell and 1,070.

488,COST,"Costco's profit, same-store sales miss estimates","(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) on Wednesday missed estimates for quarterly profit and same-store sales, as the retailer faced stiff competition from Walmart (WMT.N) and Amazon in a cut-throat U.S. retail industry. The membership-based retail chain’s heavy spending on bolstering its e-commerce capabilities and matching Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) prices in the last year have taken a toll on its bottom line. Excluding items, Costco earned $1.42 per share, missing analysts’ estimates of $1.47, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, Costco has been one of the few retailers that has held its own since Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods earlier in 2017, a deal that sent jitters among traditional grocery retailers and their investors.

489,COST,"UPDATE 2-Costco's profit, same-store sales miss estimates","(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) on Wednesday missed estimates for quarterly profit and same-store sales, as the retailer faced stiff competition from Walmart (WMT.N) and Amazon in a cut-throat U.S. retail industry. The membership-based retail chain’s heavy spending on bolstering its e-commerce capabilities and matching Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) prices in the last year have taken a toll on its bottom line. Excluding items, Costco earned $1.42 per share, missing analysts’ estimates of $1.47, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, Costco has been one of the few retailers that has held its own since Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods earlier in 2017, a deal that sent jitters among traditional grocery retailers and their investors. The company’s shares have since bounced back, from their initial fall, and hit a record high in January. Net income attributable to the company rose to $701 million, or $1.59 per share, in the second quarter ended Feb. 18, from $515 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.
