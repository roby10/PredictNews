1,AGN,UPDATE 3-Valeant aims to become top player in skincare,"   * To pay $345 mln for Janssen skincare business   * Follows $425 mln deal for Dermik   * Shares up 4 percent in Toronto  (Adds comments from CEO interview, updates shares; in U.S. dollars unless noted)   By S. John Tilak   TORONTO, July 15 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) wants to become the world’s biggest player in the skincare sector in about five years, its top executive told Reuters on Friday.   The company has been signaling its intent with a string of recent mid-sized acquisitions in the highly fragmented but lucrative dermatology sector.   The specialty drugmaker said on Friday it will pay $345 million to buy the skincare unit of Johnson & Johnson-owned (JNJ.N) Janssen Pharmaceuticals.   The news sent the Valeant’s shares up 4 percent.   It was the second such deal for Valeant this week. The other was its planned $425 million acquisition of Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) Dermik skincare business. Both deals were with large pharmaceutical companies eager to offload non-core assets.   Valeant, which has about 5 percent of the $20 billion market, plans to continue making deals in dermatology as it looks to reach the top faster, Chief Executive Michael Pearson said. When the recent deals close, the company will record about $1 billion in revenue from dermatology.   “We’re ambitious in many ways. We just want to be a lot bigger than anyone else,” he said in an interview.   While there is significant competition in the dermatology arena, Valeant will be facing smaller rivals, rather than the pharmaceutical giants, which have been beating a hasty retreat from the sector as they look to narrow their focus.   “It’s like we’re in the lightweight division and we’re fighting other lightweights. We’re not fighting heavyweights,” Pearson said. “It fits us from a scale standpoint.”   Pearson’s philosophy has been to stay clear of the so-called Big Pharma companies, but engage in partnerships with them instead.   Valeant’s main rivals in the industry are Medicis Pharmaceuticals MRX.N, Allergan Inc (AGN.N), as well as Stiefel Laboratories Inc, which is a unit of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L).   Since it dropped a $5.7 billion bid for U.S. drugmaker Cephalon Inc CEPH.O in May, there has been speculation that Valeant would go after other large targets. In the same month, the company said it would buy Lithuanian group Sanitas SAN1L.VL for about 314 million euros ($443 million).   The company is still considering larger takeovers and can pull off a $6 billion deal, Pearson said.   “Europe is probably lower in the list right now” because of the two recent sizable deals there, Pearson said. The company could look at regions such as Latin America and Australia, he added.   Mississauga, Ontario-based Valeant, which focuses on the neurology and dermatology markets, expects Friday’s deal to add to its earnings in 2011.   “They’re out there buying assets for cash flow and building a broad dermatology presence. It seems like a pretty sound strategy to me,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Annabel Samimy said.   “The assets that they’re buying are not necessarily the ones that require a significant amount of promotion or expense behind them,” she added.   Revenue for the Janssen product portfolio, which includes prescription brands Retin-A Micro, Ertaczo and Renova, was about $150 million in 2010.   Valeant’s shares were up 4 percent at C$52.47 in Toronto, and up 4.4 percent at $54.94 in New York.

4,AGN,Overactive bladder next Botox frontier,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Overactive bladders later this year could become the next big frontier for Botox, the anti-wrinkle drug, and significantly boost sales of the $1.5 billion-a-year product, according to Allergan Inc Chief Executive David Pyott.  Allergan earlier on Wednesday reported earnings growth for the second-quarter, fueled largely by sales of Botox to smooth wrinkles and for a growing range of medical uses.  Overactive bladder, caused by uncontrollable contractions of the bladder, causes frequent urination, urgent need to urinate and inability to control urination.  “Current drugs for overactive bladder just don’t work that well,” Pyott said in an interview, “and studies show that after a year 70 percent of patients don’t respond to treatment.”  Standard treatments, pills called anticholinergics, including oxybutynin and GlaxoSmithKline PLC’s Vesicare, are associated with dry mouth and can cause constipation and other side effects.  A single injection of Botox into the bladder can provide significant relief for up to nine months and significantly improve quality of life, Pyott said, particularly for adults who now need to wear diapers.  Pyott said he expects U.S. regulators this year to approve Botox for those whose overactive bladder is caused by multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, which together number about 350,000 patients in the United States.  Several years later, Allergan hopes to win approval to market it to a broader population of patients with overactive bladder.  Pyott declined to forecast sales of Botox for overactive bladder but said Wall Street analysts are projecting annual sales of up to $500 million. “For a company with a revenue base of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, another $500 million franchise is kind of cool,” he said.  Botox, whose active ingredient is a toxin that blocks nerve signals, gets about half its sales from reducing wrinkles. It is also approved to prevent migraine headaches, to treat upper limb spasticity, neck pain from cervical dystonia and certain types of eye muscle problems and spasms of the eyelids.  The product’s second-quarter sales rose 16 percent to $418 million, helped by its recent approval to treat migraines and a somewhat stronger economy, which enabled more patients to pay out of pocket for cosmetic uses.  Allergan said on Wednesday that net income rose to $249 million, or 79 cents per share, from $241 million, or 78 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter.  Excluding special items, the company earned 96 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales rose almost 14 percent to $1.40 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.34 billion. They would have increased 9.6 percent if not for the weaker dollar, which drives up the value of sales in overseas markets.  “Strong top-line trends continue,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note, “and we expect these dynamics to continue throughout 2011.”  Schott said Allergan boosted its 2011 overall sales forecast by $120 million to $170 million. But he noted the company reported higher-than-expected spending in the second quarter on sales, general and administrative expenses.  Sales of prescription eye medicines, by far the company’s biggest business, rose 14 percent to $658 million.  Sales of medical devices rose 12 percent to $245 million, fueled by demand for breast implants and dermal fillers.  But sales of the company’s Lap Band product, to treat obesity, continued to decline, as did sales of the company’s Latisse eyelash-growth product.  Allergan nudged up its full-year profit forecast to between $3.59 and $3.63 per share, excluding special items. It had previously expected $3.56 to $3.62.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Botox can be injected into the bladder to treat those who lose bladder control because of damage to the nervous system, through conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury.   The drug received a similar approval in Europe earlier this month. [ID:nL6E7J808N]   The company will also try to gain approval to market Botox to a broader population of patients with overactive bladder, the company’s CEO David Pyott told Reuters earlier this month. [ID:nN1E7721Y8]   “This approval is positive as it may bode well for the eventual approval of Botox in idiopathic (of unknown cause) overactive bladder,” Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note.   He forecast sales of about $40 million for the current bladder label by 2017, and $210 million in 2017 for the broader label, which he expects Allergan to file for next year.   Overactive bladder, caused by uncontrollable contractions of the bladder, causes frequent urination, urgent need to urinate and inability to control urination.   A single injection of Botox into the bladder can relax it and increase its storage capacity, with the effect lasting for about nine months.   About 60 to 80 percent of patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury experience some form of bladder problems, Allergan said, out of 350,000 such patients in the United States.   “It’s very smart for management to build out these therapeutic indications for Botox because it’s more difficult for competitors to get into these areas as opposed to the cosmetic side, where they’re probably going to see continued market share losses,” said Michael Waterhouse, analyst at Morningstar.   Botox’ active ingredient is a toxin that blocks nerve signals. It gets about half its annual sales of $1.5 billion from reducing wrinkles. It is also approved to prevent migraine headaches and to treat upper limb spasticity, neck pain from cervical dystonia and certain types of eye muscle problems and spasms of the eyelids.   Botox offers a new treatment option for patients who do not respond to standard treatments for bladder control, pills called anticholinergics, which include oxybutynin and Astellas (4503.T) and GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) Vesicare.   Allergan shares closed up 3 percent at $77.90 at the end of regular trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, outperforming a 0.5 percent increase in the Arca Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large U.S. and European drugmakers.

10,AGN,Consumer groups: Stop sale of J&J; silicone breast implants," * FDA meeting on follow-up studies for implants   * Consumer groups say not enough long-term safety data   By Anna Yukhananov   GAITHERSBURG, Md., Aug 30 (Reuters) - Consumer advocates asked U.S. health regulators to take silicone breast implants made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) off the market because the company has not been able to provide enough long-term safety data.   The groups spoke on Tuesday at a two-day U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel meeting to discuss follow-up safety studies for silicone implants that have already been approved for sale. The FDA said the issue of product removal was not under consideration during the meeting.   But groups including the National Organization for Women Foundation and the National Women’s Health Network pressed their case for removing Johnson & Johnson’s product from the market.   The FDA approved silicone gel-filled breast implants sold by Allergan (AGN.N) and Johnson & Johnson’s Mentor unit in 2006, on condition both companies follow 40,000 women for 10 years to look at safety issues, as well as extend smaller pre-approval studies.   Allergan has collected preliminary two-year data for 60 percent of participants, while Mentor has collected three-year data for only 21 percent.   “It’s unacceptable that many patients Mentor and Allergan were supposed to track were lost,” said Jan Erickson, of the National Organization for Women Foundation.   “Mentor’s approval should be rescinded right away. And Allergan should be required to conduct further studies.”   There were almost 400,000 breast enlargement or reconstruction procedures in the United States in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. That includes silicone and saline implants.   In June, the FDA said the risks of breast implants are well understood, after looking at the companies’ results as well as reports of negative events and scientific literature. It said women who get silicone implants are likely to need additional surgery within 10 years. [ID:nN1E75L12N]   The agency had banned silicone implants for most U.S. women in 1992 after some said the devices leaked and made them chronically ill.   During the Tuesday meeting, patients complained of side effects such as rupturing or hardening of the device, and said the companies’ long-term studies could be biased against patients who have problems.   In addressing low response rates, representatives of both companies said the studies had perhaps over-reached by trying to keep track of so many patients, and by requiring each to fill out a 27-page questionnaire each year.   Mentor also said it may have had particularly low response rates because the company made patients participate in the study as a condition of getting an implant, but later changed it to voluntary participation.   “In retrospect, it’s perhaps not surprising that if a patient or surgeon enrolls because they are required to, and then a patient is told because of voluntary consent they’re not ... that might contribute to low follow-up rates,” said Dr. John Canady, medical director at Mentor, when asked if the company’s study had any design flaws.   “That’s something we would go back to change, but obviously can’t in this study.”   Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women’s Health Network criticized the follow-up rate at Mentor.   “I want to urge you to advise the agency that this (the low follow-up rate at Mentor) is unacceptable and that their approval is revoked 12 months from today unless the company does a better job,” Pearson told the panel.   Jean Silver-Isenstadt, executive director of the National Physicians Alliance, said the FDA needed to show its commitment to enforcing post-approval studies.   “We believe that this agency has to walk the walk,” she told Reuters. “Its mission is to protect patients, and when it sets criteria for approval, that should be real.   “When the agency begins to look more like window-dressing (for companies), that will shake the faith of physicians and patients.”   The advisory panel will make its final recommendations on post-approval studies on Wednesday.

Ipsen now expects sales of primary care drugs, which are typically prescribed by general practitioners, to drop between 3 and 5 percent, less than its previous forecast for a decline of 8 to 10 percent.   It kept its sales growth forecast for specialty care drugs unchanged at close to 8 percent. The company also set a forecast for full-year recurring adjusted operating income of 190 million to 200 million euros.   Calling 2011 a “transitional year” for Ipsen, Marc de Garidel, chief executive since November, said in a statement that the improved outlook resulted from dynamic growth in Ipsen’s specialty care products, including cancer treatments.   Total revenue in the first half of the year rose 5.8 percent to 619.4 million euros ($899.5 million). Specialty care sales grew 8 percent and primary care sales were flat at 185.6 million euros as governments across Europe cut healthcare spending.   Recurring adjusted consolidated net profit grew 33 percent to 107.3 million euros.   Ipsen said its partnership with U.S. group Inspiration would be expanded to create a sales force in Europe to promote treatments for blood diseases ahead of their approval and launch.   Inspiration expects to submit experimental drug IB1001, which is designed to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia B, for European marketing approval by the end of the year.   Following Garidel’s arrival, Ipsen has made changes to its executive committee and on Tuesday announced the nomination of Susheel Surpal as chief financial officer.   He was previously European financial director at Sodexo (EXHO.PA), corporate controller at pen maker BIC (BICP.PA) and corporate financial director at cheese maker Bel (FROB.PA).   Ipsen in June unveiled plans to more than double sales and triple operating profit by 2020 as it refocuses its strategy and accelerates growth in the United States and emerging countries.

12,AGN,FDA eyes registry for breast implants problems,"GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said they would consider setting up a registry that tracks safety problems with breast implants, after too many patients dropped out of company-funded studies.  But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasized on Wednesday that silicone implants were safe and would stay on the market, despite calls for their removal by consumer groups.  Expert advisers who held a two-day meeting to discuss post-approval safety studies for silicone implants urged the FDA to establish a registry.  “We believe it’s a good idea to have a conversation about a breast implant registry. ... (But) we believe implants are safe and effective and should remain on the market,” Dr William Maisel, deputy director of the FDA’s devices division, told reporters after the meeting.  In 2006 the FDA approved silicone gel-filled breast implants sold by Allergan and Johnson & Johnson’s Mentor unit on condition both companies follow 40,000 women for 10 years to look at safety issues, as well as extend smaller pre-approval studies.  So far, Allergan has collected preliminary two-year data for 60 percent of participants, while Mentor has collected three-year data for only 21 percent — well below the 65 percent the FDA said would be acceptable.  “It’s very inefficient to enroll 40,000 patients, and only get data on 400 on them (for rare symptoms). So having registries is a much more high-value approach,” said Jason Connor, a biostatistician on the advisory panel.  There were almost 400,000 breast enlargement or reconstruction procedures in the United States in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. That includes silicone and saline implants.  In June, the FDA said the risks of breast implants are well understood, after looking at the companies’ results as well as reports of negative events and scientific literature. It said women who get silicone implants are likely to need additional surgery within 10 years.  The agency had banned silicone implants for most U.S. women in 1992 after some said the devices leaked and made them chronically ill.  The companies and FDA advisers said patients and their doctors may not have enough incentives to stay in the company-funded studies, especially if they have to fill out a 27-page questionnaire every year, or do expensive medical procedures such as MRIs that test if their implant has ruptured.

13,AGN,US FDA eyes registry for breast implants problems," * Advisory panel urges registry to counter study dropouts   * FDA says removing implants from market not considered   GAITHERSBURG, Md., Aug 31 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said they would consider setting up a registry that tracks safety problems with breast implants, after too many patients dropped out of company-funded studies.   But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasized on Wednesday that silicone implants were safe and would stay on the market, despite calls for their removal by consumer groups. [ID:nN1E77U08L]   Expert advisers who held a two-day meeting to discuss post-approval safety studies for silicone implants urged the FDA to establish a registry.   “We believe it’s a good idea to have a conversation about a breast implant registry. ... (But) we believe implants are safe and effective and should remain on the market,” Dr William Maisel, deputy director of the FDA’s devices division, told reporters after the meeting.   In 2006 the FDA approved silicone gel-filled breast implants sold by Allergan (AGN.N) and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Mentor unit on condition both companies follow 40,000 women for 10 years to look at safety issues, as well as extend smaller pre-approval studies.   So far, Allergan has collected preliminary two-year data for 60 percent of participants, while Mentor has collected three-year data for only 21 percent — well below the 65 percent the FDA said would be acceptable.   “It’s very inefficient to enroll 40,000 patients, and only get data on 400 on them (for rare symptoms). So having registries is a much more high-value approach,” said Jason     Connor, a biostatistician on the advisory panel.   There were almost 400,000 breast enlargement or reconstruction procedures in the United States in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. That includes silicone and saline implants.   In June, the FDA said the risks of breast implants are well understood, after looking at the companies’ results as well as reports of negative events and scientific literature. It said women who get silicone implants are likely to need additional surgery within 10 years. [ID:nN1E75L12N]   The agency had banned silicone implants for most U.S. women in 1992 after some said the devices leaked and made them chronically ill.   The companies and FDA advisers said patients and their doctors may not have enough incentives to stay in the company-funded studies, especially if they have to fill out a 27-page questionnaire every year, or do expensive medical procedures such as MRIs that test if their implant has ruptured.   A registry, which would track any patient who has had a breast implant, can provide broader data, making it easier to identify any complications, such as rupturing of the device.

14,AGN,RPT-Consumer groups: Stop sale of J&J; silicone breast implants," (Repeats story originally published late on Tuesday)   * FDA meeting on follow-up studies for implants   * Consumer groups say not enough long-term safety data   By Anna Yukhananov   GAITHERSBURG, Md., Aug 30 (Reuters) - Consumer advocates asked U.S. health regulators to take silicone breast implants made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) off the market because the company has not been able to provide enough long-term safety data.   The groups spoke on Tuesday at a two-day U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel meeting to discuss follow-up safety studies for silicone implants that have already been approved for sale. The FDA said the issue of product removal was not under consideration during the meeting.   But groups including the National Organization for Women Foundation and the National Women’s Health Network pressed their case for removing Johnson & Johnson’s product from the market.

Allergan has collected preliminary two-year data for 60 percent of participants, while Mentor has collected three-year data for only 21 percent.   “It’s unacceptable that many patients Mentor and Allergan were supposed to track were lost,” said Jan Erickson, of the National Organization for Women Foundation.   “Mentor’s approval should be rescinded right away. And Allergan should be required to conduct further studies.”   There were almost 400,000 breast enlargement or reconstruction procedures in the United States in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

During the Tuesday meeting, patients complained of side effects such as rupturing or hardening of the device, and said the companies’ long-term studies could be biased against patients who have problems.   In addressing low response rates, representatives of both companies said the studies had perhaps over-reached by trying to keep track of so many patients, and by requiring each to fill out a 27-page questionnaire each year.   Mentor also said it may have had particularly low response rates because the company made patients participate in the study as a condition of getting an implant, but later changed it to voluntary participation.   “In retrospect, it’s perhaps not surprising that if a patient or surgeon enrolls because they are required to, and then a patient is told because of voluntary consent they’re not ... that might contribute to low follow-up rates,” said Dr. John Canady, medical director at Mentor, when asked if the company’s study had any design flaws.   “That’s something we would go back to change, but obviously can’t in this study.”   Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women’s Health Network criticized the follow-up rate at Mentor.   “I want to urge you to advise the agency that this (the low follow-up rate at Mentor) is unacceptable and that their approval is revoked 12 months from today unless the company does a better job,” Pearson told the panel.   Jean Silver-Isenstadt, executive director of the National Physicians Alliance, said the FDA needed to show its commitment to enforcing post-approval studies.   “We believe that this agency has to walk the walk,” she told Reuters. “Its mission is to protect patients, and when it sets criteria for approval, that should be real.   “When the agency begins to look more like window-dressing (for companies), that will shake the faith of physicians and patients.”   The advisory panel will make its final recommendations on post-approval studies on Wednesday.

16,AGN,Hospira sees mid-single digit growth through 2014,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Hospira Inc’s HSP.N sales will remain lackluster through 2014, growing in the mid single digits before accelerating into the low teens, executives said on Wednesday.  Speaking at Hospira’s investor meeting at its headquarters in suburban Chicago, executives told analysts that it will take 18 to 24 months to fix manufacturing problems at its plants in North Carolina.  The company has been grappling with quality issues for about a year after receiving a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The issues related to emulsion products that were used in some drugs that did not meet the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices.  Chief Financial Officer Tom Werner backed an analyst’s estimate that Hospira will spend some $65 million over three years on remediation, which translates to roughly 8 to 10 cents in earnings per share next year alone.  He declined to provide a detailed financial forecast.  Chief Executive F. Michael Ball, who was named CEO in March, said his priority was to fix problems at Hospira’s manufacturing plants in 2011 and 2012 and then focus on biosimilars, generic versions of biotech medicines.  Ball, an executive at Allergan Inc (AGN.N) for 16 years, said he joined Hospira to drive growth.  “I didn’t come here to change the strategy of this company. I came here to take it to the next level,” Ball said. “If you look at my record, my specialty is growth.”  Ball said he is seeking acquisitions that will help the company penetrate emerging markets such as Brazil and China.  “We’re going to have to do M&A (mergers and acquisitions) in emerging markets ... to get us going in certain countries,” he said.  Hospira, which was spun off from Abbott Labs in 2004, makes specialty generic injectable drugs, premixed intravenous solutions and IV pumps.  Ball said he expects to launch biosimilars in the United States by 2013 to 2015 and to be one of the top three leaders in global biosimilars.  He also said he expects Hospira to be the No. 1 provider of generic injectable drugs in every major market it serves.  Separately, Ball said he expects to add a modest number of jobs over the near term. Hospira employees roughly 14,000 people worldwide.

Lumigan has annual global sales of about $650 million, making it one of Allergan’s biggest prescription eye medicines.   Barr Laboratories Inc, a unit of Teva, and Novartis NOVN.VX (NVS.N) unit Sandoz filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) in 2009 to make a generic version of the drug. Allergan sued, claiming patent infringement.   Delaware District Court judge Sue Robinson ruled on Thursday that the generic drugmakers failed to prove Allergan’s patents protecting Lumigan were invalid and found the generic forms infringed those patents.

19,AGN,Banking on Botox no concern for Allergan CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) is not worried about over-reliance on sales of its flagship Botox drug, the company’s chief said, citing extensive safety data and supply reserves of the injectable medicine.  The wrinkle-smoothing treatment recently won U.S. approval to treat migraine headaches and overactive bladders, positioning it for an even bigger chunk of Allergan’s sales than the 30 percent it commands now.  Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott told Reuters he expects Botox sales to exceed $1 billion apiece for cosmetic and therapeutic use. Allergan forecasts nearly $1.6 billion in Botox sales this year.  “It’s just a question of when do we cruise past the $2 billion mark,” Pyott said in an interview in New York on Monday. “In theory, it could even grow beyond that (30 percent of sales).”  The company has about nine months worth of stock of Botox around the world should it encounter some type of supply constraint.  “Running out of Botox would be a very bad idea,” Pyott said.  Pyott also brushed aside safety concerns for the product, pointing to 20 years of data that “is not only great for us but for regulators. They feel, even in relatively high doses, there’s a lot known about this compound.”  Allergan’s reliance on Botox is a risk, said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse, especially if competitors make inroads. While smaller companies have struggled with their Botox-like drugs, Waterhouse cites a looming threat from a Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) product named PurTox that could reach the market by 2013.  Waterhouse said Allergan stock, which has outperformed most large drugmaker shares this year, is fairly valued.  “Because we do see more competitors emerging, companies like Johnson & Johnson that have the wherewithal to go toe-to-toe with someone like Allergan, I do think they’ll need to continue to diversify the business,” Waterhouse said.  Pyott is aware of that need and wants to add to Allergan’s product portfolio across its six therapeutic areas that involve medicines prescribed by specialists. They include neurology, where Botox has helped establish the company’s presence.  Allergan has licensed from MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc MAPP.O rights to Levadex, an experimental migraine treatment that the company expects to be approved next year.  With many migraine treatments being sold as generics, Pyott expects Allergan to be one of the only companies actively promoting the drugs to doctors, giving it an advantage.  “We like quiet places, because if you’re the only guy, you’re appreciated,” he said.  Pyott is also interested in other neurology areas, such as drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.  “We keep looking externally to see if there are things that fit into the category where the bulk of prescriptions are generated by the neurologist.”  Beyond licensing products, Pyott said the company could easily do an acquisition of more than $1 billion, and pointed to its $3.3 billion purchase in 2006 of Inamed, a maker of breast implants and the Lap-Band gastric banding device.  Pyott said the largest deal he ever considered exceeded $10 billion, without naming the company. But he would be cautious about such a sizable deal for Allergan, which has a market value of about $24 billion.  Allergan's specialty focus, which also includes a large eye-drug franchise, has won favor on Wall Street. The stock is up 12 percent this year, against a 3 percent decline of the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index .DRG of large drugmakers and a 9 percent decline for the broader S&P 500 .SPX.  Pyott said he was hopeful the company would achieve mid-teens percentage earnings per share growth for the next four or five years.  Botox is fueling sales, Pyott said, as are 2010 approvals of new versions of its Lumigan glaucoma drug and Juvederm dermal filler.

21,AGN,"Allergan 4th-quarter profit, eye drug sales rise","(Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) said on Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings rose 6.4 percent, as higher sales of its eye drugs, Lumigan and Restasis, offset lower-than-expected sales of wrinkle treatment Botox. The company’s forecast for 2012 was lower than anticipated, sending its shares down as much as 2.8 percent, although some analysts consider the outlook conservative. Net income rose to $279.8 million, or 90 cents a share, from $263 million, or 85 cents a share, a year ago. Product sales rose 7.2 percent to $1.38 billion. Revenue rose to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion a year ago. Austerity measures in Europe dampened demand and governments in the region forced the company to hold down prices, chief executive David Pyott said on a conference call with investors. He said the company absorbed about $130 million in costs associated with U.S. healthcare reform and cost reductions overseas. “We live in an industry that is under more price pressure than it’s ever been before,” he said. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.00 a share, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. They expected revenue of $1.4 billion. Sales of Botox, which is also approved to treat migraine headaches, upper limb spasticity, neck pain from cervical dystonia and certain types of eye muscle problems, rose to $415.3 million from $386.2 million a year ago. That was slightly less than Wall Street expectations of $429 million, said Larry Biegelsen, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, in a research note. In 2011, about 50 percent of Botox sales came from cosmetic uses and about 50 percent came from therapeutic uses such as migraine. In August, it was approved to treat a certain type of overactive bladder. Pyott expects therapeutic sales to start to outpace cosmetic sales in 2012 as more physicians begin using Botox for non-cosmetic purposes and as cosmetic sales feel the heat from a fragile economy and increased competition. The company expects total product sales in 2012 of between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion. It expects earnings, excluding one-time items, of between $4.13 and $4.19 a share. Analysts, on average, expect 2012 earnings excluding items of $4.21 a share and sales of $5.89 billion. Sales of the company’s eye care drugs, including eyelash-lengthening treatment Latisse, rose to $659.1 million from $603.4 million a year ago. Breast implant sales rose to $86.4 million from $84.7 million. The company also sells dermal filler Juvederm and the Vivite line of skin revitalizing products. Sales of facial products rose to $90.9 million from $80.9 million, somewhat lower than analysts expected. Obesity products, which include its Lap-Band gastric banding system, fell to $46.9 million from $60.9 million. The company’s shares were down 2.7 percent, or $2.33, at $84.96 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, they fell as low as $84.78.

22,AGN,"Allergan to rely less on U.S. for sales, Asia key","(Reuters) - Allergan Inc, maker of wrinkle treatment Botox, eye drops and obesity treatments, said it will rely less on the United States for revenue in coming years as its products gain wider acceptance in Asia, particularly China. The company on Thursday announced 6.4 percent earnings growth for the fourth-quarter of last year, but forecast lower-than-anticipated sales for 2012 as austerity measures in Europe keep a lid on demand and force the company to hold down prices. Ian Bell, corporate vice-president and president for Asia-Pacific, was upbeat on growth prospects across Asia, with China appearing to be the main driver. Bell told Reuters in an interview that cosmetic clinics were popping up in big hospitals in major Chinese cities, presenting an opportunities for Allergan’s aesthetics products. He said sales of Botox for aesthetic use in China in 2011 were encouraging and Allergan was trialling its skin filler Juvederm, hoping to make it available in China in 2-3 years. “China is going to grow very quickly over the next decade. We are starting somewhat late; Botox was only approved over a year ago and therefore levels of penetration are low,” he said. “We have a big part of our portfolio that is privately paid, where healthcare reform is irrelevant,” said Bell, referring to China’s healthcare restructuring targeted at making more cheap drugs widely available. “DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH” Sales in Asia-Pacific grew 27 percent year on year in the third quarter of 2011, with “double-digit growth in Q4,” said an Allergan spokeswoman in Singapore. “(Sales are) 60 percent the U.S. and 40 percent the rest of the world. The rest of the world is growing quicker than the U.S. right now and within those markets, Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing for us,” said Bell. “We see the trend continuing ... and as for those percentages and our reliance on the U.S., we believe that over time it is going to diminish.” Allergan obtained approvals in Asia in 2011 to use Botox to treat chronic migraines in Australia, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam. “The biggest market is Australia and we are now in negotiations with the authorities there to get it reimbursed. We hope to achieve that this year, so by end of 2012 we expect to be in a strong position to drive sales,” Bell said.

We believe that EBITDA margins will be stable or improve 	 modestly as product mix, operating leverage, and retail pharmaceutical price 	 increases, slightly outweigh global health care cost containment measures and 	 competitive pressures on aesthetic, cash pay products. Performance has been 	 resilient post recession, particularly given the discretionary nature of 	 aesthetics products. Furthermore, the company has weathered generic 	 pharmaceutical threats with successful next generation products, such as 	 Lumigan 0.01%, Alphagan P 0.1% and Combigan. We believe the company will 	 continue its conservative financial policies and maintain a minimal risk 	 financial profile. Allergan has solid product and geographic diversity. Allergan has a broad 	 product portfolio; it focuses on pharmaceutical treatments for the ophthalmic, 	 neurological, medical aesthetics, medical dermatology, breast aesthetics, 	 obesity intervention, urological, and other specialty areas. A robust new 	 product pipeline of product enhancements and expanded indications should 	 enable the company to continue this trend. The company is geographically 	 diverse, with revenues split 60/40 between the U.S. and international markets. 	 Its payor mix is also varied, with about 60% of its products covered by 	 insurance, and about 40% cash pay. Allergan holds leading market positions in 	 all of its product lines. It is one of the largest players in the niche 	 eye-care pharmaceuticals market, and its focus on the category enables it to 	 successfully compete against much larger players, such as such as Alcon 	 Laboratories Inc./Novartis AG, Abbott Laboratories, and Bausch & Lomb Inc. 	 Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, part of specialty pharmaceuticals, accounted for 	 47% of total sales in 2011. Allergan has successfully implemented product 	 lifecycle management strategies as key drugs lost patent protection and faced 	 generic competition. Botox, Allergan’s largest single product, is a purified neurotoxin complex 	 that controls muscle spasms; sales of Botox are split 51% for therapeutic use 	 and 49% for cosmetic indications. We expect steady growth in Botox’ 	 therapeutic markets spurred by regulatory approvals in new geographies and 	 expanded indications, such as the FDA approval for the treatment of chronic 	 migraines in October 2010, and for treatment of neurogenic overactive bladder 	 in August 2011. This first-in-class product holds a dominant share of the U.S. 	 market and a global market share of over 80%. Competitors include Medicis 	 Pharmaceutical Corp. (Dysport for cosmetic use in the U.S.) and Ipsen (Dysport 	 for therapeutic use in the U.S.). Allergan is one of only two U.S. manufacturers of breast implants, holding a 	 worldwide market share of over 40%. Only the company’s urologics and obesity 	 intervention business segments, which accounted for 5% of 2011 sales, are 	 continuing to experience weakness; sales of Lap-Band, for obesity treatment, 	 continue to sharply decline as a result of high insurance copayments. 	 Allergan’s strategy is to focus its sales and marketing efforts on physician 	 specialists as opposed to general practitioners. It has been very successful 	 with direct-to-consumer campaigns, and also, had great flexibility to cut back 	 advertising (and preserve EBITDA margins) as a countermeasure to the 	 recession. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 35% for 2011 is at the high end of 	 medical device companies, and compares favorably with pharmaceutical 	 companies. At 1x, adjust debt leverage is already minimal. Allergan’s large cash balance 	 of $2.4 billion (half held in the U.S.), provides some cushion to ongoing 	 legal challenges and government investigations. In 2010, Allergan made a $594 	 million payment to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the government 	 investigation regarding off-label use of Botox for certain therapeutic 	 indications over the 2000-2005 period. Liquidity Our short-term rating on Allergan is ‘A-1’. We believe Allergan has 	 “exceptional” liquidity to meet its needs over the next two to three years. 	 Our view of the company’s liquidity profile incorporates the following 	 expectations: — We expect liquidity sources (consisting primarily of cash, revolver 	 availability, and discretionary cash flow) to exceed uses by 2x over the next 	 two to three years. — We expect liquidity sources to continue to exceed uses, even if EBITDA 	 were to decline by 50%. — We believe the company could absorb a high-impact, low-probability 	 event. — We believe Allergan would not breach its debt leverage covenants in 	 the event of a 50% revenue decline. — In our assessment, the company has well-established bank relationships 	 and, generally, a high standing in credit markets. The company has a $600 million commercial paper program backed by an $800 	 million revolving credit facility maturing in October 2016; EBITDA covenant 	 cushion is ample. On Dec. 31, 2011, it had no commercial paper outstanding, 	 full availability on the revolver, and $25 million of borrowings under its 	 medium-term note program, which matures April 2012). Cash from operations was 	 $1.1 billion in 2011 relative to only $130 million of capital expenditures and 	 additions to capitalized software. We expect tuck-in acquisitions to be of 	 modest size and funded with internally generated cash. Outlook Our rating outlook on Allergan is stable. The company has expanded and 	 diversified its product portfolio through a combination of organic growth and 	 acquisitions while maintaining a historically conservative balance sheet. 	 Although we do not anticipate significant shifts in market share, we view 	 Botox as representing modest product concentration. We do not believe that 	 revenues or margins would decline sufficiently to precipitate a downgrade. 	 Rather, a change in financial policy that would cause adjusted debt leverage 	 to increase to 1.5x on a sustained basis would be a more likely trigger. We 	 expect any collaborations and acquisitions to be midsized and financed with 	 internally generated cash. An unexpected, material debt-financed acquisition 	 or share repurchase program could result in a downgrade. Alternatively, 	 increasing scale and product diversification, allowing the company to improve 	 to the upper end of the strong business risk profile category or to reach an 	 “excellent” business risk profile, could result in an upgrade.

27,AGN,Allergan Botox works in overactive bladder studies,"* Says Botox significantly decreased incontinence vs placebo * Says filed for U.S., Europe supplementary approvals March 28 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc said its Botox met the primary goals of a pair of late stage clinical trials for overactive bladder by significantly reducing episodes of urinary incontinence, creating another potentially lucrative revenue source for the wrinkle treatment. Based on the trial results, Allergan said it filed  applications with U.S. and European health regulators seeking the additional approval to treat adults suffering from overactive bladder who have not responded well to, or are intolerant of, anticholinergic drugs, such as Pfizer Inc’s  Detrol. In both studies, Botox led to a highly statistically significant decrease in the number of daily incontinence episodes compared with patients who received a placebo, the company said. The study involved patients whose condition was not caused by a neurological disorder. The study results were announced in conjunction with Allergan’s Research and Development Technology review on Wednesday. Botox, which is administered by injection, had sales of $1.6 billion in 2011, primarily as a treatment for facial wrinkles. But it is also approved for several other uses, including migraine headaches, eye muscle disorders, upper limb spasticity and as a treatment for urinary incontinence caused by neurological disorders, such as spinal injuries and multiple sclerosis. An estimated 3.2 million Americans with overactive bladder are taking oral medications from the class called anticholinergics, Allergan said. It is believed that more than half of patients discontinue their medication due to inadequate response or intolerance to the drugs, creating a market for Botox. Treatment with Botox in the studies was well tolerated, with urinary tract infection among the most common side effects at a rate of 15 to 20 percent of patients, Allergan said. Symptoms of overactive bladder include uncontrolled urge to urinate, frequent urination and uncontrolled urinary leakage.",3282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan/allergan-botox-works-in-overactive-bladder-studies-idUSL2E8ESGJL20120328
28,AGN,"Botox maker Allergan cuts outlook, shares fall","(Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N), the maker of Botox and breast implants, reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts and provided a weaker-than-expected outlook for the second quarter, sending its shares lower. “Not a pretty quarter,” Bernstein Research analyst Aaron Gal wrote in a research report. But he noted that the company has managed expectations lower in the first quarter for the past couple of years. In an interview, Chief Executive David Pyott said Wall Street is looking for problems where they do not exist. “Our SG&A; ratio always starts higher earlier in the year. We tend to expand our sales forces and front-end load DTC (direct-to-consumer ads) ... It’s cyclical. It’s the classic Wall Street thing. They’re determined to find a problem somewhere. I predicted this would happen last night,” Pyott said of Wall Street’s reaction to the company’s financial report. First-quarter earnings rose to $230.3 million, or 74 cents per share, from $158.8 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 86 cents per share. On that basis, Wall Street analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly revenue rose to $1.37 billion from $1.25 billion. Sales of Botox, eye and skin care products and breast implants rose, while sales of LapBand, its gastric band to surgically treat obesity, fell again. Pyott said investors should not expect a material improvement in LapBand sales until 2013, when he hopes insurance coverage will improve. Allergan forecast second-quarter earnings, excluding items, of $1.04 to $1.06 per share, which is below the consensus of $1.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company expects second-quarter revenue to be between $1.45 billion and $1.50 billion, also below the consensus of $1.51 billion. However, Allergan said the financial forecast for the full year it provided on February 2 remains unchanged. During a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Edwards characterized the outlook as conservative. “We expect to do better than that,” Edwards told analysts. The company’s shares were down 3.9 percent at $92.62 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange, off the day’s worst level at $90.68.

33,AGN,L'Oreal loses EU trademark battle to Allergan's Botox,"BRUSSELS, May 10 (Reuters) - France’s L’Oreal has lost its bid to keep a cosmetics trademark on Thursday, with Europe’s highest court ruling it could not use the Botocyl mark as it would be riding on the coattails of U.S. healthcare group Allergan’s well-known Botox brand name. The Luxembourg-based European Union Court of Justice (ECJ) also rejected on the same grounds arguments by L’Oreal’s Helena Rubinstein brand to keep its Botolist trademark. EU trademarks agency OHIM had approved both Botolist and L’Oreal’s Botocyl trademarks in 2003 but reversed its decisions five years later following a request by Allergan. Allergan made $1.6 billion in sales from Botox last year, mainly as a treatment for facial wrinkles. L’Oreal and Helena Rubinstein subsequently took their fight to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest. Judges backed the OHIM in a December 2010 verdict and the companies then appealed to the ECJ, the top court. “The Court confirms the annulment of the community trademarks ‘BOTOLIST’ and ‘BOTOCYL’ because of the existence of the ‘BOTOX’ trademarks,” the ECJ said in a statement. “The use of the marks at issue would take unfair advantage of the reputation of the ‘BOTOX’ trademarks.” Botox can also be used for migraine headaches, eye muscle disorders and upper limb spasticity.",5102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/court-loreal-copyright/loreal-loses-eu-trademark-battle-to-allergans-botox-idUSL5E8GA4OJ20120510

35,AGN,Allergan wins new trial in big Botox damages case,"June 1 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc has been granted a new trial in a case brought by a man who won a $212 million jury verdict last year after claiming he was disabled by taking Botox injections. Douglas Ray Jr’s jury award had already been slashed to less than $13 million total under Virginia state law, and now, after a federal judge’s ruling on Friday, he will have to make his case all over again. Ray accused Allergan of failing to warn doctors of the risk that Botox injections could cause autoimmune reactions that lead to brain damage. Ray alleged that he suffered a severe reaction that left him completely disabled after receiving Botox injections to treat a movement disorder in his right hand — an off-label-use for the wrinkle-smoothing drug. In April of last year, jurors in U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia, awarded Ray $12 million in compensatory damages, along with $200 million in punitive damages that were later reduced to $350,000 due to a cap under Virginia law. But Judge Robert Payne ruled Friday that Allergan deserved a new trial because it should have been made clear to the jury that the company could not add a so-called “black-box” warning to Botox packing inserts on health dangers without prior approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “This was prejudice on a core issue respecting Allergan’s liability, and the only remedy for it is a new trial,” Payne wrote. Ray’s lawsuit, filed in 2010, was one of at least four that have gone to trial as Botox users sued Allergan for personal injuries, or in one case, a wrongful death. Several of the lawsuits focus on off-label uses of the drug. Allergan agreed in September 2010 to plead guilty and pay  $600 million to resolve a federal investigation into its off-label promotion of Botox. The Justice Department accused Allergan of illegally promoting the drug to treat headaches, pain, spasticity and juvenile cerebral palsy — uses that had not been approved by the FDA. Ray Chester, a lawyer for Ray, said he was “disappointed in the decision, obviously.” “We thought it was a good verdict and should have stood,” said Chester, of the law firm McGinnis Lochridge & Kilgore. Cathy Taylor, a spokeswoman for Allergan, said that while the company “is sympathetic to Douglas Ray and his family, we are pleased that the U.S. District Court in Virginia granted Allergan’s motion for a new trial and we look forward to re-trying the case.” A hearing in the case was expected for June 9. The judge also ordered the parties to schedule a settlement conference. Allergan has had mixed results in the cases that have gone to trial. A state court jury in Santa Ana, California, ruled for Allergan in March 2010 in a lawsuit seeking $60 million in damages for the alleged wrongful death of a 7-year-old, Kristen Spears. In February, another Santa Ana jury hung in a case seeking $60.5 million for Thomas McGee of Missouri, who sued the company after taking Botox and developing Guillain-Barre Syndrome. The case settled earlier this month on confidential terms. Allergan separately is awaiting an appellate decision in Oklahoma on a $15 million jury verdict in May 2010 in favor of Sharla Helton, who claimed to have suffered pain and lost her job after using Botox. Chester, who has represented the plaintiffs in all of the trials, said he has eight Botox cases pending. He said he expected to go to trial in November in a case pending in Oklahoma state court. Allergan shares were down $2.08, or 2.3 percent, at $88.17 in late afternoon trading.",6012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-botox-trial/allergan-wins-new-trial-in-big-botox-damages-case-idUSL1E8H1B1F20120601
36,AGN,"Allergan suit proceeds, to impact derivative cases","* Allergan directors must defend lawsuit * Judge weighs in on “fast-filed” lawsuits * Judge criticizes rush to file lawsuits By Tom Hals June 11 (Reuters) - Directors of Allergan Inc must face a lawsuit over $600 million in fines the company paid for misbranding its Botox treatment to smooth out wrinkles, a Delaware judge ruled, in a decision that could affect securities litigation in that state. The opinion by Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster could make it easier for shareholders to bring lawsuits on behalf of companies in Delaware, a state traditionally seen as friendly for corporate defendants. Allergan declined to comment. The lawsuit stems from a $600 million settlement Allergan reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010, which followed a three-year investigation by several government agencies of the marketing of Botox for unapproved uses. Following the settlement, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System and U.F.C.W. Local 1776 pension funds brought derivative lawsuits in Delaware’s Court of Chancery and several similar lawsuits were filed in California federal court. Derivative lawsuits allow shareholders essentially to step into the shoes of the company and sue directors for harm. Any recovery from individual directors or their insurers would go to the company, rather than to shareholders. The California lawsuit was dismissed earlier this year and the directors argued that this meant the Delaware case should also be dismissed. But Laster found that just because the California federal case was weak does not mean it should preclude the Delaware state case from going forward. Laster dedicated much of his 84-page opinion to what he called the problem of “fast-filing” - the rush to the courthouse by lawyers with inadequate lawsuits to try to seize control of litigation before other lawyers file better lawsuits. “Put simply, fast-filing generates dismissals,” wrote Laster, who joined the Delaware court, one of the nation’s busiest for shareholder litigation, in 2009. Saying he would focus on the strength of lawsuits, he rejected an earlier Delaware Chancery Court decision that he said could preclude new lawsuits where the original plaintiff “lacked authority to sue on behalf of the corporation.” Laster has been an outspoken critic of plaintiffs’ attorneys whom he believes have done a poor job litigating potentially strong cases and even replaced plaintiffs’ attorneys in a case involving Revlon Inc. “It’s very significant,” said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, Delaware, said of the opinion. “The ruling in the case is, as I see it, an effort to discourage both plaintiffs and defendants from using ‘fast filing’ in a way that squelches more effective derivative litigation.” The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System et al v David Pyott et al, Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 5794.",6112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-lawsuit/allergan-suit-proceeds-to-impact-derivative-cases-idUSL1E8HBCGJ20120611

The specialty drugmaker, which tends to provide conservative sales and profit forecasts and then outperform, jolted some investors and industry analysts in May with a narrow earnings miss and a disappointing outlook for the second quarter. But shares of Allergan rose 6.2 percent to $87.19 on Wednesday as the company posted strong second-quarter results and lifted the lower end of its 2012 profit view, despite a strong dollar that bit hard into its overseas sales. Even so, it provided a cautious third-quarter earnings forecast. “Allergan reported solid second quarter results given the continued difficult currency environment,” Cowen and Co analyst Ken Cacciatore said in a research note, saying the Botox trends appear “exceedingly strong.” Allergan predicted Botox sales of up to $1.8 billion this year, representing almost one third of projected total company sales. Company shares trade at almost 20 times Allergan’s expected 2012 per share earnings, a hefty premium to most drugmakers and medical device makers. But Cacciatore said the lofty valuation is warranted because of Allergan’s consistent cash flows and an underrated pipeline of experimental products “that could be massively value creating.” One is a hair loss treatment that uses the active ingredient of Latisse — a company product used to extend length of eyelashes. Another, also in mid-stage trials, is being tested to treat macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness. The specialty drugmaker said second-quarter net earnings had risen to $296 million, or 96 cents per share, from $249 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.

Skin care products rose 9.3 percent to $71 million, while breast implant sales increased 6 percent to $101 million.

45,AGN,Allergan says exploring sale of obesity business,"Oct 30 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc said it was exploring a sale of its obesity business on falling sales of the only product in the unit. Sales of Lap-Band fell 21 percent to $122.7 million, while sales of most of Allergan’s products increased during the third quarter. The unit accounted for about 4 percent of Allergan’s total revenue in 2011. The company expects sales of $160 million from its obesity intervention products unit for the full year. It sees total product net sales of between $5.69 billion and $5.77 billion. U.S. health regulators recently approved two weight loss drugs, after a gap of 13 years, underlining the mounting pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve treatments for obesity as about two-thirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese. Lap-Band, which was first approved by the FDA in 2001, has an inflatable band placed around the stomach through a minimally invasive surgery, creating a pouch that limits or reduces food consumption. The company posted a profit of $249.4 million, or 82 cents per share, in the third quarter compared with $249.8 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for charges that include restructuring, research and development, and amortization of acquired intangible assets,  the company earned $1.06 per share. Revenue rose 6 percent to $1.4 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.04 per share, excluding special items, on revenue of $1.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

50,AGN,Allergan aims to widen migraine treatment with MAP Pharma buy,"(Reuters) - U.S. specialty drugmaker Allergan Inc said late on Tuesday that it would buy MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $958 million in cash, an acquisition intended to widen its presence in the treatment of adult migraines. MAP Pharmaceuticals is developing Levadex, an orally inhaled drug for the acute treatment of migraines in adults. Levadex is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is set to make a decision about the drug around April 15. Under the deal, Allergan will acquire 100 percent of the shares of MAP Pharmaceuticals at $25 per share, a 60 percent premium over MAP’s closing stock price on the Nasdaq of $15.58 on Tuesday. “We plan to capitalize on depth of expertise in neurology as we continue the global development of Levadex as a potential acute treatment for migraine,” Allergen Chief Executive David Pyott said in a statement. In the last few years, Allergan has received regulatory approvals in 56 countries for its drug Botox for use in the treatment of chronic migraine. Allergen now aims to position Levadex as a potential treatment for migraine that is complementary to Botox. Botox, a popular wrinkle treatment, had also previously been approved for other non-cosmetic uses such severe underarm sweating and loss of bladder control due to nerve damage. Allergan expects the MAP deal to dilute 2013 earnings by about 7 cents a share and add to its earnings by the second half of 2014. The company expects to fund the deal with a combination of cash on hand, cash equivalents and short-term borrowings under its commercial paper program. The transaction is not subject to any financing contingency.

52,AGN,"Allergan profit rises, helped by Botox migraine use","(Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N), maker of the Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter earnings rose, helped by growing sales of Botox for the recently approved use of treating migraine headaches and demand for the company’s eye-care drugs. The company said it earned $324 million, or $1.06 per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $280 million, or 90 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Allergan said it earned $1.15 per share in the quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.18 per share. The company said fourth-quarter earnings excluded a 2012 research and development tax credit of 6 cents per share, which it will book instead in the first quarter of this year. Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said the earnings were three cents per share below Wall Street forecasts due to delayed recognition of the R&D; tax credit. If not for the delay in the tax credit, he said the results would have topped expectations by 3 cents per share. Global company sales rose 7.4 percent to $1.48 billion, in line with Wall Street’s expectations. For 2013, Allergan said it expects earnings of $4.75 per share to $4.83 per share, excluding special items and the R&D; tax credit. Biegelsen said the midpoint of that forecast was above the average analyst estimate of $4.74 per share. Sales of Botox rose 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter to $475 million.

57,AGN,Fitch Affirms Allergan's IDR at'A+'; Rates New Debt,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Allergan Inc.'s (Allergan)  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'. A complete list of ratings affirmed is  provided at the end of this release. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  The ratings apply to approximately $1.52 billion  of outstanding debt. In addition, Fitch has assigned an 'A+' rating to Allergan's proposed issuance  of $600 million in senior unsecured debt due 2018 and 2023. Proceeds of the new  debt are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including funding  for the recent acquisition of MAP Pharmaceuticals. KEY RATING DRIVERS Allergan sustained a trend of solid revenue growth for the third consecutive  year with a sales increase of 7.1% in 2012 despite pressures from U.S. health  care reform and growing European austerity measures. Fitch forecasts  continuation of the positive trend with average sales growth of greater than 5%  in 2013 through 2015 accounting for the discontinuation of the obesity  intervention business in 2013 and the potential introduction of generic Restasis  products in 2014.  Last year, the company's cash-pay businesses, representing around 40% of total  revenues, performed well with global sales of Botox Cosmetic, facial fillers,  and breast augmentation products increasing 8.4%, 6.9%, and 8%, respectively.  The company's glaucoma franchises Alphagan and Lumigan generated sales growth of  8.1% and 1.6% while competing with generic versions of Xalatan throughout the  year. Moreover, franchise sales were dampened by Allergan's decision to halt  U.S. distribution of the first-generation Lumigan 0.03% by the end of 2012.  Allergan continues to drive productivity from its research program that has  already launched over 20 novel eye-care treatments, line extensions, and new  medical devices since 2010. Most recently, the FDA granted approval for the  company's long-delayed next generation breast implant, Natrelle Style 410, as  well as an idiopathic overactive bladder indication for Botox. In Fitch's view,  the company will continue to devote significant resources to the internal R&D;  program, supplemented by business development activities including in-licensing  new treatment projects.  Fitch sees continued benefits from commercialization of the R&D; pipeline helping  offset the negative affect of patent losses, primarily the potential U.S.  expiration of the Restasis formulation patent in May 2014. Patent expiration  exposure is manageable as revenues from Restasis represented 13.6% of total  sales in 2012. Allergan has also proactively minimized the risk from the looming  U.S. patent expiration of Lumigan 0.03% in 2014 with the discontinuation of U.S.  distribution of the eye care drug in 2012.   Margins expanded in 2012 despite increased expenses for a deeper research  pipeline. Allergan is seeing the benefits of leveraging its sales and marketing  spending to promote complementary products and indications launched since 2010.  As such, EBITDA margin was 34.6% in 2012 compared to 32% in 2011 as SG&A; was  relatively consistent on a dollar basis with the prior year while revenues  increased 7.1%. Fitch believes that efforts to extract efficiencies from sales  and marketing expenses will offset downward pressure from incremental investment  into the R&D; program leading to EBITDA margins greater than 33% in 2013-2015. Fitch believes that Allergan can maintain solid liquidity driven by steady free  cash flow of greater than $1 billion annually in 2013 to 2015 despite rising  capital spending in the intermediate term. The company reached a peak in free  cash flow generation at $1.38 billion (representing a margin of 23.8%) in 2012.  Additional liquidity is provided by full availability under an $800 million  credit facility maturing in October 2016, serving to back up an $800 million  commercial paper program, and cash and short-term investments of $2.96 billion  at the end of 2012.  Debt leverage has been maintained below 1.0 times (x) since 2011 and was 0.8x in  2012 due to a combination of EBITDA growth and debt reduction. Debt leverage is  expected to remain consistent with the current rating category below 1.1x at the  end of 2013 and beyond despite incremental debt to be used for funding the MAP  Pharmaceutical acquisition. Allergan has no refinancing risk given the next  significant debt maturity of $800 million in 5.75% senior notes in April 2016. Fitch anticipates Allergan to remain prudent with returning value to equity  shareholder. The company has historically prioritized investment to support  growth strategies over satisfying shareholder interests, which comprises a small  dividend and share repurchases to offset stock option dilution. After a  temporary increase in share repurchasing to 10 million shares (from 6 million)  in 2012, Fitch expects no significant changes to Allergan's annual dividends of  $.20 per share or the company's 'evergreen' share repurchase program. In 2012,  Allergan paid $60.4 million in dividends and repurchased a net of $662.6 million  in common equity.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive momentum to the rating would be supported by continued strong  operational performance and total debt leverage sustained at 1.0x or below  through the intermediate term. Incremental debt used for the recent purchase of  MAP Pharmaceuticals makes the leverage goal difficult to maintain over the  ratings horizon. In addition, Fitch would like to see a meaningful increase in  scale such that EBITDAR approaches $2.5 billion.          Fitch does not anticipate negative rating action given Allergan's proven ability  to leverage its operating cost base in light of reimbursement and demand  pressures stemming from macroeconomic headwinds, U.S. healthcare reform efforts,  and European austerity measures. However, negative pressure would result from a  leveraging transaction such that gross debt leverage rises and stays around 1.5x  through the intermediate term.

58,AGN,Analysis: J&J;'s answer to Botox may escalate war on wrinkles,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson may soon cause frown lines at Allergan Inc, maker of Botox. J&J; expects to seek U.S. approval next year for an anti-wrinkle drug that could break Botox’s near monopoly, an 85 percent market share. The J&J; product could be available in the United States in 2015 and overseas a few years later, the company said. Two smaller drugmakers with similar products haven’t made substantial inroads into the almost $900 million a year market. But dermatologists and analysts say J&J; could be a real threat to Botox, an iconic brand since it was introduced more than a decade ago. Allergan declined to comment on the potential rival. “J&J; is probably the only company that can go head to head directly with Allergan,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse. “They have a big marketing budget and sales force, and an attractive cosmetic portfolio” of other products to offer dermatologists. Still, J&J;’s quest won’t be easy. Analysts and dermatologists said its product likely would need to work faster, last longer or be significantly cheaper than Botox in order to wrest market share from the original injectable wrinkle fighter. “J&J; is a company I’d take seriously; they have great research and try to be industry leaders in every category,” said Dr. Kenneth Beer, a dermatologist in West Palm Beach, Florida who has been a consultant for Allergan and J&J.; But he said patients aren’t quick to switch from something with which they are familiar. “Allergan has built such a strong brand. People ask for Botox by name. This will be an uphill struggle” for Johnson & Johnson. J&J; has not yet unveiled the data from completed late-stage trials for the still unnamed drug. But David Wilson, president of J&J;’s Mentor division, told Reuters he was pleased with the results. “What we hope to offer is a product of certainly comparable quality to Botox...to basically be on par with them” in terms of effectiveness and safety, Wilson said. “We’ve worked to make sure our data are exactly what the FDA is expecting to see,” he added. Morningstar’s Waterhouse said the J&J; product likely would generate annual sales of $500 million within five years as a cosmetic product. Sales could hit $1 billion within a decade if it also is tested and approved for medical conditions such as migraine headaches, he said. Botox, approved in 2002 in the United States to temporarily smooth severe lines between the eyebrows, has become a $1.8 billion-a-year brand, used worldwide by celebrities, movie stars, the wealthy and increasingly, the middle class in both developed and emerging markets. Botox procedures in the United States can cost as much as $1,500 for full treatment on three areas of the face. The cosmetic treatment is not covered by health insurance. The drug, a form of botulinum toxin that works by temporarily paralyzing muscles, has also been approved for lucrative medical uses such as preventing underarm sweating, migraine headaches and overactive bladder. But about $850 million, or 48 percent of Botox sales, comes from original cosmetic uses - the market J&J; is going after, Wilson said. Despite Botox’s lock on the market, many patients are on the quest for a better Fountain of Youth and will give J&J;’s product a chance, said New York dermatologist Howard Sobel. “Some people are going to want bigger and better even if it’s not bigger and better,” Sobel said. “These are the patients that tell me, ‘Doctor, you used to make me look much better.’ They don’t realize ‘used to’ was 10 years ago and I can only bring them back to a certain point.” Other companies have tried and failed to knock Botox from its pedestal. Two similar anti-wrinkle fighters are approved in the United States: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s Dysport, and Xeomin from privately held Merz Pharma Group, which was launched in January after a prolonged U.S. court battle with Allergan. Together, they have a 15 percent share of the cosmetic toxin market. Valeant and Merz did not comment on the potential J&J; threat. J&J;, one of the world’s biggest healthcare companies with annual sales of almost $70 billion, aims to leapfrog Dsyport and Xeomin and become a solid No. 2 in the market, Wilson said. Now-completed trials of the product will be the basis of a marketing application in the first half of 2014 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Wilson said. “We’ll make all the appropriate investments to support our program,” he said. “Professional education and training will be a significant pillar of our success.” Wilson noted, however, that the J&J; drug has not been tested head to head against Botox or other wrinkle fighters. Wilson’s unit, which J&J; acquired through its purchase of Mentor Corp in 2009, is the world’s top seller of breast implants and also markets dermal fillers and liposuction equipment. The addition of a wrinkle treatment would give Mentor greater sway with dermatologists and plastic surgeons, Wilson said. “The more we can offer doctors, the better. Our customers are using a lot of toxin and it will strengthen our position to provide it to them.” In the long term, Jeff Jonas, a healthcare analyst for Gabelli & Co, said J&J; can be expected to study and seek approvals of its product for the same lucrative medical uses as Botox. “Given the size of J&J; and their expertise in clinical trials, I think they’ll want to go after the whole market, not just half of it,” Jonas said. Sobel, who has many Botox patients, said J&J;’s product would be a hit if it were able to last five or six months, rather than the three or four months typical of Botox, Dysport and Xeomin. “That would be a breakthrough,” the dermatologist said, and allow patients to make fewer doctor visits for re-injections of the drug. “Or, if it’s not truly different in its activity, they can distinguish it by making it cheaper,” Sobel said, speculating it could capture 20 to 25 percent of the market within three years if the price is right. The fiercest competition between the products will likely occur in emerging markets such as China and South America, where Botox is not firmly entrenched, Morningstar’s Waterhouse said. “There’s a lot more opportunity for growth there because you can grow from new customers who want premium luxury-type products,” he said. “Botox kind of aligns with luxury cars.” ",3222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jj-botox/analysis-jjs-answer-to-botox-may-escalate-war-on-wrinkles-idUSBRE92L0CU20130322

The company, whose injectible wrinkle-filler Botox was approved for headaches in October 2010, said the main issues cited in the complete response letter were already identified by the regulator in prior discussions with Allergan. Allergan estimates the next regulatory action on the migraine drug, Levadex, to occur by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013.

62,AGN,Fraudulent versions of Allergan's Botox found in U.S.,"(Reuters) - Fraudulent versions of the wrinkle treatment Botox, which is made by Allergan Inc and also used to treat headaches, underarm sweating and overactive bladder, are being sold in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration said on Friday. The FDA said in an alert posted on its website that the outer carton of the fraudulent Botox is counterfeit, and the vial inside is foreign and not approved for sale in the United States. “FDA cannot confirm that the manufacture, quality, storage, and handling of these products follow U.S. standards,” the agency said. The agency said the products could be counterfeit, contaminated, improperly stored and transported, ineffective and unsafe. Allergan said that in addition to violating federal law, products that are illegally imported may either be counterfeit or the quality may have been compromised. Authentic Botox is stored and transported by Allergan according to rigorous specifications, the company said. Botox is a sterile, purified version of the same toxin that causes botulism, which can cause potentially deadly swallowing and breathing difficulties, and when injected, acts to temporarily smooth certain frown lines. It generated sales in 2012 of $1.77 billion, of which roughly half came from cosmetic use. The FDA said the fraudulent Botox is being sold under the names “Online Botox Pharmacy,” “Onlinebotox.com” and “Onlinebotox.” The FDA said it did not appear that the fraudulent product was being sold over the Internet, but that sales had been solicited via fax, by offering prices below those of FDA-approved products. In 2004, four people were hospitalized with poisoning after being injected with unapproved botulinum toxin, which a doctor had passed off as Botox. The case prompted a wide-scale investigation of more than 200 clinics throughout the United States and resulted in dozens of convictions of people who injected patients with unapproved, cheaper substitutes for Botox. As recently as last December, the FDA alerted more than 350 medical practices that they may have received unapproved medications, including Botox, from a foreign supplier. The FDA’s alert comes as lawmakers are seeking to create a national set of standards for tracking prescription drugs through the distribution chain to help prevent counterfeit or contaminated products from reaching the public. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate each released draft drug-tracking bills this week. The House draft would require drugs to be traced, but only in lots, that can contain thousands of individual packages. The Senate bill would require each individual drug unit to be traceable.

65,AGN,FDA staff says Allergan's new dermal filler effective,"April 30 (Reuters) - Reviewers for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Allergan Inc’s dermal filler, Juvéderm Voluma XC, was effective in correcting volume deficit in the middle of the face at six months of treatment. The reviewers said that if the filler was approved, the company should be required to do a post-approval study to test the safety of a repeat treatment. () The FDA staff also said that a scale — used to measure the overall volume change in patients’ mid face — has not been used before for an approval, and the two reviewers often did not agree on the rating of a given patient using the score. An independent advisory panel will be voting on the filler’s safety, efficacy and risk-benefit profile on May 2, and the panel will be asked to comment on the reliability of the scale and the meaningfulness of a one point change on the scale. “Based on Allergan’s solid product approval track record, the established safety/efficacy profile of Juvederm and the briefing material, we expect a generally positive panel and see likely FDA clearance later this year,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen wrote in a note. Allergan’s popular injectable gel filler Juvéderm was approved in 2006 to correct moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds. Juvéderm Voluma XC is being developed to be used as a dermal filler in the midface, a significant new indication. The company also sells several other fillers as part of the Juvéderm line of products.

66,AGN,Allergan delays drug that would rival Regeneron's Eylea,"(Reuters) - Allergan Inc said approval of its Darpin eye drug could be delayed up to two years, providing a new boost to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc whose successful treatment, Eylea, stands to gain from a lack of new competition. Shares of Allergan, which makes wrinkle treatment Botox, fell 13.1 percent after the company said mid-stage trial results of Darpin did not warrant an immediate move into far larger late-stage trials. Regeneron shares closed up 10.3 percent. If eventually approved, Darpin would also compete with Roche Holding AG’s, Lucentis, to treat age-related macular degeneration - the most common form of blindness in the elderly. Adnan Butt, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said Darpin’s delay was “great news” for Regeneron. He noted that Wall Street had feared the Allergan drug might have a superior clinical profile to Eylea. “This gives Eylea even more time to become entrenched as the drug to beat,” Butt said. He estimates that each year of Darpin delay will translate into an upside of about $15 to $20 for Regeneron shares, now trading at about $240. Eylea, which was approved in November 2011, had sales last year of $838 million. Regeneron expects 2013 Eylea sales of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Company officials would not comment on the setback for Allergan’s drug. Regeneron is expected to report first quarter results on Friday and could update its sales projections. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott said on a conference call that a mid-stage trial of Darpin showed some product differentiation over Lucentis, but did not support directly moving to late-stage development. The company now plans to perform additional mid-stage trials to assess Darpin, which will delay its potential approval by one to two years. “There was a rush to ascribe a lot of value to Darpin and our view is that this is still very much an unproven asset with limited data,” Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said. “The earliest it could get to market now is likely 2019,” Amsellem said. “If you couple that with the setback of the hair loss product, the late-stage pipeline for Allergan right now is really quite thin.” A mid-stage trial of Allergan’s hair loss treatment Bimatoprost Scalp also failed to provide sufficient efficacy to proceed to a late-stage study, further weighing on company shares. Regeneron in the past two years has vaulted seemingly out of nowhere to become one of the world’s biggest biotechnology companies, thanks largely to Eylea. The company has repeatedly raised its sales forecasts for the drug, which is injected into the eye, as it steadily steals market share from Lucentis. Some specialty pharmacies also use Roche’s Avastin cancer drug, which works the same way as Lucentis, but is far less expensive, when divided into smaller portions for treating macular degeneration. Roche has said that dividing Avastin through a procedure not closely monitored by health regulators, called compounding, could compromise its sterility. Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in a recent interview that sales of Eylea could jump sharply if potential rivals stumble, or if U.S. regulators clamp down on the compounding of Avastin for eye use. Moreover, he said some analysts believe Eylea sales could swell if it is approved for a new indication called diabetic macular edema now in late-stage trials. Lucentis is already approved for the condition. “So Eylea is a growth story unto itself, with lots of room to still grow,” Schleifer said. Allergan on Wednesday also posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by strong sales of Botox. Net income for the first quarter fell to $12.5 million, or 4 cents per share, due to a loss of $259 million from discontinued operations. Profit was $229.8 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Allergan earned 98 cents per share. Analysts were expecting 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global company sales rose 8 percent to $1.46 billion, above Wall Street’s average estimate of $1.44 billion. Sales of Botox, which is also approved for treating migraine headaches, overactive bladder and underarm sweating, rose 15 percent to $457.9 million. Allergan said it now expects 2013 adjusted earnings of $4.70 to $4.76 per share, compared with its prior outlook of $4.75 to $4.83 a share. The company forecast a second-quarter profit of $1.18 to $1.20 per share, below analysts’ average estimate of $1.22 a share. The new forecasts reflect the impact of its MAP Pharmaceuticals acquisition earlier this year.

68,AGN,"Allergan delays eye drug, shares fall","(Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N), maker of the Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, said it will delay late-stage trials of its highly anticipated eye drug Darpin, sending its shares down 14 percent. Shares in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) rose 14 percent on news that the potential rival to its Eylea drug, used to treat the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, would take longer than expected to reach market. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott said on a conference call that a mid-stage trial of Darpin showed some product differentiation over Roche Holding AG’s ROG.VX rival Lucentis eye treatment, but did not support directly moving to late-stage development. The company now plans to perform additional mid-stage development work to assess the drug’s safety and efficacy. It now expects the drug’s approval to be delayed by one to two years. “If the Darpin program is not going to move forward - or is delayed significantly - we could envision significantly more (stock) weakness than already experienced this morning,” Cowen and Co analyst Ken Cacciatore said in a note. Both Darpin and Eylea are intended to treat age-related macular degeneration of the eye, or damage to the macula - the central region of the retina. A mid-stage trial of Allergan’s hair loss treatment Bimatoprost Scalp also failed to provide sufficient efficacy to proceed to a late-stage study, and the company said it will be extending the mid-stage development program.

74,AGN,DEALTALK: Game may not be over for Royalty' Pharma's bid for Elan,"* Mylan, Allergan, Endo, Forest considering bids-sources * Partnership with Royalty is possible, but complex By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - The game may not yet be over for U.S investment firm Royalty Pharma in its months-long pursuit of Elan Corp. The Irish drugmaker earlier this month rejected a hostile bid by Royalty worth up to $8 billion. Instead, it put itself up for sale and is in early discussions with several mid-size drugmakers to find a rival buyer.. Mylan Inc, Allergan Inc, Endo Health Solutions Inc and Forest Laboratories Inc are among pharmaceutical companies that have shown preliminary interest in bidding for Elan, according to several people familiar with the matter who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. While all the companies are primarily interested in Elan  for the tax savings that come from being domiciled in Ireland, Elan’s lack of drug pipeline and high price tag make it a long shot that any bid will materialize, the sources cautioned. If no rival offer emerges, Elan’s stock could fall back to where it was before Royalty made its first offer in February. Elan’s shares in New York, which traded slightly above $10 per share right before Royalty’s offer, have risen to around $14 a share on expectations of a takeover. Royalty, which is not currently participating in the sale process but is nevertheless watching the situation closely, could then get a second shot at buying the company. Representatives from Allergan, Mylan, Forest and Endo declined to comment. Royalty and Elan declined to comment. When Elan announced on June 14 it was putting itself up for sale, it invited Royalty to participate in the bidding. Under Irish takeover laws, Royalty is not allowed to submit another hostile bid for Elan for the next 12 months. The only way it can buy Elan is by entering the sales process or if another bidder approaches it about a partnership. So far Royalty Pharma has not agreed to enter the bidding, two sources familiar with Royalty said. Some Elan shareholders have raised the possibility that a partnership between Royalty Pharma and another bidder could be a good option, albeit a complicated one. They suggest that one of the industry buyers could acquire Elan and sell a portion of the royalties on the drugmaker’s multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri to Royalty Pharma. With such a deal, Royalty would get what it has wanted all along - the Tysabri royalties. The industry buyer would get a lower tax rate, and Elan would get a better price for the company. No such discussions have taken place, although Royalty Pharma would be open to a partnership, the sources familiar with the firm said. “The story is how is Royalty going to play its poker hand,” said one industry banker who is not involved in the situation and wished to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak to the media. “Do they wait till the very end and put all their chips on the table? Or do they do it earlier?” Structuring a partnership whereby Royalty would receive a portion of the Tysabri royalties and a separate bidder would get the tax break would be tough to do. First, under the terms of the sales process, Elan is precluding any bidders from partnering up, meaning that a  bidder that wanted to team up with Royalty Pharma would need to renegotiate that restriction with Elan, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the matter. Regulators have also set up rules to prevent companies from making acquisitions just to lower their tax rates. For the acquirer to take advantage of the 12.5 percent corporate tax rate in Ireland, the newly combined company would to have sufficient business activities in Ireland and the original Elan shareholders would have to own at least 20 percent of shares of the merged company. “If regulators get the sense that a company is buying Elan just for the tax break, they will scrap the deal,” said one of the sources. Royalty Pharma may still win the day if no rival bids emerge. Elan shareholders then could press Elan to go back to Royalty, or Royalty could enter the bidding at the last minute. “I think at the end of the day there is a high likelihood this goes to Royalty Pharma,” the industry banker said.",6272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/dealtalk-royaltypharma/dealtalk-game-may-not-be-over-for-royalty-pharmas-bid-for-elan-idUSL2N0F21IP20130627

80,AGN,"Court upholds Allergan Lumigan patents, shares rise 6 percent","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A Texas judge has upheld U.S. patents covering Allergan Inc’s Lumigan glaucoma drug through 2027, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, helping to send its shares up 6 percent. Separately on Tuesday, Allergan, which also makes wrinkle-fixing Botox, said it had been issued a new U.S. patent, expiring in 2024, covering its Restasis eye drops. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled in favor of Allergan in a patent infringement case filed against several drugmakers seeking to market generic versions of the 0.1 percent formulation of Lumigan. That formulation of the drug was introduced in 2010 to replace a stronger 0.3 percent solution that caused some patients to temporarily experience red eyes. “We believe with these two developments, the two biggest overhangs to the Allergan story will be removed,” BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said in a research note. Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott, in comments e at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, said the Texas court decision upholds Allergan’s five Lumigan patents through 2027, but “of course this will get appealed.” He added that Allergan can maintain exclusivity of the drug as long as one of the patents is ultimately upheld. Pyott said Allergan is unaware of whether any generic drugmakers have sought U.S. regulatory approval to sell copies of Restasis. Sales of Allergan’s eye care pharmaceuticals totaled $2.12 billion in the first nine months of last year. Pyott said Allergan, which last year spent $1 billion to acquire MAP Pharmaceuticals and its Levadex experimental migraine drug, remains interested in acquiring new companies or products, particularly in areas like neurology and urologics, where it is not already a dominant player. “In opthalmics and medical aesthetics, everyone already comes to us,” he said. Allergan is not interested in adding slow-growth segments to its product mix, he said, adding that any deal “would have to have the potential for double-digit growth.” Shares of Allergan, based in Irvine, California, rose $6.80, or 6 percent, to close at $121.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.

85,AGN,Ackman working with Valeant to press for Allergan takeover,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman has acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in wrinkle-treatment maker Allergan Inc and is working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to buy the company, sources said on Monday. Ackman’s Pershing Square, a $13 billion hedge fund, spent roughly $4 billion on acquiring the stake, its biggest-ever investment which comes less than a year after the hedge fund took a stake in Air Products & Chemicals. Pershing Square began buying stakes in Allergan in February, according to a regulatory filing, with money it had freed up by trimming its stake in Beam and getting out of General Growth Properties, one of its biggest winners ever. Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company known for skin care products and generic drugs, has been on a buying spree and most recently acquired Bausch & Lomb Holdings. It has been eager to make a bid for Irvine, California-based Allergan for over a year but has been turned away, a source familiar with the matter said. In the regulatory filing, Ackman said Valeant will pay with a combination of stock and cash and expects the cash component to total around $15 billion. Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada have said they are ready to help with financing. A Valeant spokesperson said that a merger with Allergan would create an “unrivaled platform for growth and value creation,” and said that the company would soon finalize its proposal and then announce it. The potential deal also seems to be finding favor with analysts. “The deal also looks attractive because of a “massive amount” of potential operating synergies from the two companies’ overlap and Valeant’s lower tax rate in Canada, Morningstar analyst David Krempa said. A spokeswoman for Pershing Square declined to comment. Traditionally, activist investors like Ackman take a stake in a company and then wait for a catalyst like a takeover to push the share price higher. In this case, Pershing Square is working together with Valeant as a group, according to a regulatory filing, so that Valeant can then push ahead on a takeover. Hedge fund ValueAct, also known for pursuing activist strategies, sits on the Valeant board but has historically shied away from getting involved in hostile takeovers. Pershing Square does not shy away from controversy, having waged a very public battle against nutrition and weight loss company Herbalife with a $1 billion short bet unveiled in December 2012. This year, Pershing Square is delivering some of the hedge fund industry’s best returns with a gain of roughly 10 percent through the middle of April, a Pershing Square investor said, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 index is largely flat. If the companies were to unite, the deal would bring together two mid-sized pharmaceutical companies with expertise in skin care and eye care products. Allergan, which also has a lucrative portfolio of ophthalmic drugs to treat conditions such as glaucoma and dry eye, reported $6.3 billion in revenue last year and forecast 2014 revenue of $6.65 billion to $6.95 billion. Valeant, reported $5.8 billion in revenue last year. There may be some push back from Allergan’s board however, Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said, noting that Valeant’s reputation of slashing research and development might make some uneasy. Also Waterhouse said one big downside of a takeover, might be the loss of Allergan’s longtime CEO David Pyott, an avid dealmaker who built Botox into a blockbuster by continuously testing it for new uses. Investors liked the news and sent shares up on Monday, with Allergan rising 6 percent to close at $142 per share. Valeant climbed 3.24 percent to close trading at $126.01. But one Valeant shareholder thought the deal might be too pricey. Allergan shares closed on Monday up 28 percent so far in 2014, trading at all-time highs. “It’s almost impossible to turn it into a high return investment if you pay that kind of price,” said Glenn Greenberg, managing director of Brave Warrior Advisors, a Valeant shareholder.

90,AGN,Activist investors see Ackman-Valeant deal as a model to follow,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - William Ackman’s $47 billion joint bid with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc may become a model for future deals, rival fund managers said. The unsolicited bid, the plans for which were revealed late on Monday, was unusual for a so-called activist investor such as Ackman. Usually, large acquisitions are the realm of private equity investors and corporations, not activist shareholders. Ackman, who runs the $13 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund, typically first buys a stake in a company and then agitates for change, sometimes leading to a sale. By having a bidder lined up in Valeant, Ackman essentially skipped that step, speeding the deal up and making his returns more likely. He already has a massive paper profit on his 9.7 percent stake in Allergan, built over February and March. Allergan’s shares rose more than 15 percent on Tuesday. At the Active-Passive Investor Summit, an industry conference in New York on Tuesday, fund managers and investors said they expected more activists and companies to explore this route, and it could help speed up the pace of merger and acquisition activity in the process. “This is absolutely something we will see more of,” said James Mitarotonda, founder of activist hedge fund Barington Capital, speaking on the sidelines of the conference. Investors in Pershing Square funds said it also comes with built-in protections that would not be there in a normal activist investment. A deal could boost Allergan and Valeant shares. And even if it did not happen but Allergan convinced shareholders it can grow more effectively alone, Pershing Square would still see its investment grow. Although other activists have done such deals in the past, the Valeant-Ackman pairing was getting more attention because of its size and because of Ackman’s involvement, fund managers said. Ackman is known for aggressive moves, a reputation cemented by a win against railroad Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, where it added seven new members to the board in 2012 and almost tripled its investment. One lawyer who works for a rival hedge fund said previous deals with similar structures have been of smaller, ranging from $1 billion to $3 billion. To be sure, some fund managers and investors also said that in spite of the attention, it’s not easy to pull off too many such deals. It requires an investor with plenty of available cash - the kind of money Ackman has - and it may not be a friction-free endeavor in the long run. The deal may also not always be beneficial to the acquirer, who would see the price rise as news of the potential deal gets out in the market. “You need the right conditions for an investor and a corporate culture to take risks and identify value,” said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive officer at proxy solicitor Okapi Partners. Goldfarb said a good activist-company matchup might be hard to find. Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, said the unusual partnership could also face challenges in the long run if their bid succeeds. “Valeant will push for strategies and capital allocations that create operating synergies and Ackman will push for financial moves that quickly increase the value of the company,” Gordon said. “The different pushes are likely to lead to conflicts.” The joint bid came together after Valeant tried over the past year to talk with Allergan about a deal that would have would brought together the two mid-sized companies with expertise in skin-care and eye-care products, but was spurned, according to Jeffrey Ubben, chief executive of activist fund ValueAct Capital, which has a seat on Valeant’s board. Ackman was introduced to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson by a mutual acquaintance. In February, the two met and agreed to make a joint bid for Allergan. Under the terms, Ackman started buying up Allergan shares and options through a special fund that Valeant and Pershing jointly set up. He has also committed to hold Valeant shares for a certain period if they succeed. The position and their intention to make a joint bid for Allergan were disclosed in a regulatory filing late on Monday. The deal offers Ackman a new opportunity to use a cash stockpile that has grown since he trimmed the fund’s stakes in bourbon-maker Beam Inc and exited General Growth Properties Inc earlier this year. It “is a potentially seminal moment for activism and reflects the continued reduction of the stigma attached in some quarters to activism,” said Chris Young, a managing director at Credit Suisse.

Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, said the unusual partnership could also face challenges in the long run if their bid succeeds. “Valeant will push for strategies and capital allocations that create operating synergies and Ackman will push for financial moves that quickly increase the value of the company,” Gordon said. “The different pushes are likely to lead to conflicts.” The joint bid came together after Valeant tried over the past year to talk with Allergan about a deal that would have would brought together the two mid-sized companies with expertise in skin-care and eye-care products, but was spurned, according to Jeffrey Ubben, chief executive of activist fund ValueAct Capital, which has a seat on Valeant’s board. Ackman was introduced to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson by a mutual acquaintance. In February, the two met and agreed to make a joint bid for Allergan. Under the terms, Ackman started buying up Allergan shares and options through a special fund that Valeant and Pershing jointly set up. He has also committed to hold Valeant shares for a certain period if they succeed. The position and their intention to make a joint bid for Allergan were disclosed in a regulatory filing late on Monday. The deal offers Ackman a new opportunity to use a cash stockpile that has grown since he trimmed the fund’s stakes in bourbon-maker Beam Inc and exited General Growth Properties Inc earlier this year. It “is a potentially seminal moment for activism and reflects the continued reduction of the stigma attached in some quarters to activism,” said Chris Young, a managing director at Credit Suisse.

Netflix Inc surged 7 percent to $372.90 a day after reporting strong subscriber growth, a sign the trading favorite still had room to grow despite recent valuation concerns. With the day’s gain, the stock moved to the plus side for the year after a 21 percent drop in March. The S&P; healthcare index, up 1 percent, was the best performer of the 10 major S&P; sectors. Allergan Inc  jumped 15.2 percent to $163.65 a day after activist investor William Ackman teamed up with Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  to bid for the company. U.S.-listed Valeant shares gained 7.5 percent to $135.41. A deal between Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline , in which the two traded over $20 billion worth of assets in an effort to cope with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, also bolstered the healthcare sector. U.S.-listed shares of Novartis gained 1.3 percent to $86.56, while Glaxo rose 4.1 percent to $55.30. Better-than-expected earnings have lifted stocks recently, though companies have largely been exceeding reduced forecasts. Profits are seen rising 1.1 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year. “What was baked into the market, in spite of a market near an all-time high, was a sloppy earnings season,” said Mike Serio, regional chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank in Denver. “We’ve had some really good beats at this point, we’ve had a couple of good announcements today, you throw on the M&A; activity in the drug sector, at least in the short term, everybody looks pretty excited about this market.” Dow components Travelers Cos Inc and United Technologies Corp both beat expectations, and United Tech raised the low end of its full-year profit outlook. Shares of Travelers rose 0.6 percent to $86.89 while United Tech added 0.8 percent to end at $119.19. McDonald’s Corp reported earnings that fell alongside a drop in U.S. same-store sales, and its stock slipped 0.4 percent to $99.32. With 20 percent of the S&P; 500 having reported results through Tuesday morning, 63 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, matching the long-term average. On the revenue side, 51 percent have exceeded forecasts, below the 61 percent long-term average. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 65.12 points or 0.40 percent, to end at 16,514.37. The S&P; 500 gained 7.66 points or 0.41 percent, to 1,879.55. The Nasdaq Composite  added 39.912 points or 0.97 percent, to 4,161.458. After the close, Gilead Sciences Inc advanced 1.1 percent to $73.65 after the drugmaker said its new $1,000 hepatitis C pill generated quarterly sales of $2.27 billion, helping the company’s quarterly net profit nearly triple. In another positive sign for equities, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, up 0.6 percent, closed at its first record high since April 2. The index got a boost from airlines such as United Continental Holdings, up 4.6 percent, and Alaska Air Group Inc, up 1.3 percent, which rose on a 2 percent drop in oil prices. Facebook Inc shares rose 2.9 percent to $63.03, helping to lift the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P; 500. Credit Suisse upgraded the social networking company’s stock to “outperform” on higher expectations for its long-term average revenue per user. Volume was light, with about 5.88 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,227 to 811, while on the Nasdaq, advancers beat decliners 1,900 to 727.

94,AGN,"Valeant, Ackman offer to buy Botox maker Allergan for $47 billion","(Reuters) - Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc said on Tuesday it and activist investor Bill Ackman made an unsolicited $47 billion bid to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc as it seeks to become one of the world’s five biggest drug companies. The offer, if successful, would bring together two mid-sized pharmaceutical companies with expertise in skin care and eye care products, and is highly unusual as activist investors typically buy stakes and then agitate for strategic change. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake, disclosed in a filing on Monday it is supporting the bid. Allergan said in a statement that it has received the offer, and will carefully consider the proposal and “pursue the course of action that it believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders.” Valeant offered to pay $48.30 a share in cash and 0.83 of its common share for each Allergan share, valuing Allergan at $152.88 a share, a premium of over 7 percent to the company’s closing price on Monday. The offer is 31 percent higher than Allergan’s stock price on April 10, the day before Pershing Square’s ownership reached 5 percent. Shares of Allergan jumped 15.2 percent to $163.65 in New York, signaling investors expect a sweetened bid to emerge. Valeant stock rose 7.5 percent to $135.41. Valeant has been on a buying spree since 2010 and last year acquired contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings. Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in January the drugmaker wants to become one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions. “The big valuation driver is Botox,” Pearson said, speaking about the Allergan bid to about 200 shareholders and analysts in New York. Pearson said Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and the company’s board had been unwilling to discuss a merger with Valeant. In a letter to Allergan, Valeant said it would have preferred to negotiate a deal in private. Pearson said Valeant would definitely not turn its bid into an all-cash offer, and suggested the company could still walk away if Allergan’s price gets too high. “We don’t view this as we’re going to pay whatever it takes to get Allergan, because we won’t,” he said. “If someone wants to come in and pay some ridiculous cash price, that’s their choice.” Ackman, who also addressed shareholders, called the deal the most synergistic he has seen, and said he is already talking with Valeant about their next deal. The Laval, Quebec-based company, whose products include antidepressant drug Wellbutrin and over-the-counter remedy Cold-FX, favors targets where it can aggressively cut costs. Valeant said it expects to realize at least $2.7 billion in annual cost synergies from a combination with Allergan. A large-scale cost-cutting approach may not work at Allergan without damaging the business, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said in a note. But J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the potential for savings from operating expenses and Valeant’s low tax rate is compelling. Allergan, which also has a lucrative portfolio of ophthalmic drugs to treat conditions such as glaucoma and dry eye, is larger by revenue, reporting $6.3 billion in sales last year. Valeant reported $5.8 billion in revenue last year. Pearson said he doesn’t expect the offer to raise antitrust concerns. The Federal Trade Commission, which shares the work of antitrust enforcement with the U.S. Justice Department, will likely review this proposed transaction, according to an antitrust attorney, who declined to be named for business reasons. “It’s like any of these big drug deals, if there’s overlap in certain products then, like prior deals in this space, they can divest one of the products to get the deal through,” the antitrust expert said. Valeant is already in talks with potential buyers of products the new company would divest, Pearson said, naming Valeant’s Botox competitor, Dysport, as well as its Restylane and Perlane product lines. Combined sales of those lines could reach about $250 million, Schott said.

104,AGN,"UPDATE 5-Valeant, Ackman offer to buy Botox maker Allergan for $47 bln","(Adds Allergan adopting shareholder rights plan in paragraph 5) By Rod Nickel and Bill Berkrot April 22 (Reuters) - Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc said on Tuesday it and activist investor Bill Ackman made an unsolicited $47 billion bid to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc as it seeks to become one of the world’s five biggest drug companies. The offer, if successful, would bring together two mid-sized pharmaceutical companies with expertise in skin care and eye care products, and is highly unusual as activist investors typically buy stakes and then agitate for strategic change. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake, disclosed in a filing on Monday it is supporting the bid. Allergan said in a statement that it has received the offer, and will carefully consider the proposal and “pursue the course of action that it believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders.” Late on Tuesday, Allergan said it adopted a shareholder rights plan effective April 22 that will trigger if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of its shares. Valeant offered to pay $48.30 a share in cash and 0.83 of its common share for each Allergan share, valuing Allergan at $152.88 a share, a premium of over 7 percent to the company’s closing price on Monday. The offer is 31 percent higher than Allergan’s stock price on April 10, the day before Pershing Square’s ownership reached 5 percent. Shares of Allergan jumped 15.2 percent to $163.65 in New York, signaling investors expect a sweetened bid to emerge. Valeant stock rose 7.5 percent to $135.41. Valeant has been on a buying spree since 2010 and last year acquired contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings. Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in January the drugmaker wants to become one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions. “The big valuation driver is Botox,” Pearson said, speaking about the Allergan bid to about 200 shareholders and analysts in New York. Pearson said Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and the company’s board had been unwilling to discuss a merger with Valeant. In a letter to Allergan, Valeant said it would have preferred to negotiate a deal in private. Pearson said Valeant would definitely not turn its bid into an all-cash offer, and suggested the company could still walk away if Allergan’s price gets too high. “We don’t view this as we’re going to pay whatever it takes to get Allergan, because we won’t,” he said. “If someone wants to come in and pay some ridiculous cash price, that’s their choice.” Ackman, who also addressed shareholders, called the deal the most synergistic he has seen, and said he is already talking with Valeant about their next deal. The Laval, Quebec-based company, whose products include antidepressant drug Wellbutrin and over-the-counter remedy Cold-FX, favors targets where it can aggressively cut costs. Valeant said it expects to realize at least $2.7 billion in annual cost synergies from a combination with Allergan. A large-scale cost-cutting approach may not work at Allergan without damaging the business, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said in a note. But J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the potential for savings from operating expenses and Valeant’s low tax rate is compelling.

106,AGN,Exclusive: Allergan approached Shire about takeover but rebuffed -sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Inc approached Shire Plc in recent months about a possible takeover but was rebuffed, according to people familiar with the matter, in the latest example of a U.S. drugmaker seeking to buy an overseas rival to lower its tax rate. The preliminary approach for Shire, which is based in Ireland and has a market value of $33 billion, did not progress to serious discussions between the two companies, the sources said. Since then Allergan has received an unsolicited $47 billion takeover offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management. Analysts have suggested one way for the Botox maker to defend against the unsolicited bid would be to acquire foreign drugmakers such as Shire, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc or Alkermes Plc. One of the sources said it was unclear if Allergan would try to revive talks with Shire, or pursue another target as a means to remain independent. Representatives for Allergan and Shire declined to comment. In a process known as inversion, U.S. drugmakers are looking to relocate their headquarters to other countries with lower tax rates. These companies are eying potential targets that are based in Ireland in particular because of a low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, compared to 35 percent in the United States. Recent deals that have been driven by tax advantages include generic drugmaker Actavis Plc’s $8.5 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Warner Chilcott and Perrigo Company Plc’s $8.6 billion acquisition of Elan. Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc is also looking at acquisition targets that are based outside of the United States because of competitive pressures from rivals with a less burdensome tax structure, people familiar with the matter said. Valeant’s offer for Allergan comes amid a flurry of healthcare deals this week including medical device company Zimmer Holdings Inc’s $13.4 billion acquisition of rival Biomet; a $20 billion asset swap between Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals PLC; and Eli Lilly and Co’s acquisition of Novartis’ animal health business for $5.4 billion. Those deals have driven healthcare M&A; volumes to $153.3 billion so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters has started tracking data. Pharmaceutical deals have accounted for 71 percent of overall healthcare deals. Valeant has been on a buying spree since 2010 and last year acquired contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings.

108,AGN,Exclusive: Allergan eyes new takeover bid for Shire - sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N), facing an unsolicited bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRTX.O), is preparing to approach Shire Plc (SHP.L) again about a potential takeover after being rebuffed in recent months, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Allergan, the maker of Botox with a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion, is trying to stay independent. It held talks in recent months with Shire about a potential takeover that did not pan out, Reuters reported last week. The U.S. dermatology drugmaker, which has since received a $47 billion takeover offer from Valeant teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman, is still interested in a tie-up with Shire and planning a fresh approach to the $32 billion Irish drugmaker, said the people familiar with the matter. Allergan could come back for a bid as soon as in the next few days, one person added. The plan has yet to be finalized and could change, cautioned the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. A representative of Allergan declined to comment, while Shire could not be immediately reached for comment. A combination of Allergan and Shire would create a pharmaceutical giant with a combined market value of nearly $72 billion and annual sales of more than $11 billion. Buying Shire would also help Allergan in its defense against Valeant, and Allergan could use Dublin-based Shire as a vehicle for a tax inversion deal that would lower its tax rate. Shire had rebuffed Allergan’s deal overture earlier this year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week, and it is not clear if the drugmaker would be open to entering into merger discussions.

109,AGN,Pharma event risk hits investors,"(This story originally appeared on IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication) By Danielle Robinson NEW YORK, April 28 (IFR) - The heightened level of event risk in the pharmaceutical sector was demonstrated when Allergan, the pharma giant behind Botox, saw its bonds plunge some 10 price points on news that activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International are spearheading an attempted hostile takeover of the company. Moody’s and Fitch both moved Allergan’s rating outlook to negative, warning that a successful takeover by the Canadian “serial acquirer” and Single B rated Valeant would crush Allergan’s A3/A+ investment-grade credit rating. Allergan’s 2.8% March 2023s plummeted on Tuesday to 84.58 in the secondary market on the news, where they were quoted at 225bp bid/175bp offer over Treasuries - sharply off from 94.53 and 80bp/70bp bid/ask the day before. Although Allergan quickly adopted a “poison pill” defence in an attempt to prevent a takeover, its spreads failed to return to their former levels, with the 2023s at 200bp on Thursday. Like many bonds of the best-rated pharmas, Allergan’s US$2bn of outstanding debt does not have change-of-control covenants, leaving them open to being subordinated to secured debt of an acquirer like Valeant and a rapid tumble into junk-bond status. Even if the acquisition is not successful, the name has now been tainted by the agitating presence of Ackman. “Negative ratings pressure would stem from significant shareholder-friendly actions if Allergan stays independent, including leveraged share repurchases or special dividends,” said Fitch pharma analyst Michael Zbinovec. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, which currently holds 9.7% of Allergan, has teamed up with Valeant to mount the takeover bid, currently valued at US$45.6bn. Valeant is aiming to become one of the world’s top five pharma companies by the end of 2016 and is just one of a swarm of companies in the sector on the hunt for acquisitions. “We expect the next few years to be particularly active from an M&A; perspective and pivotal in the reshaping of the industry,” wrote Shubhomoy Mukherjee, a senior pharma credit analyst at Barclays, in an April 3 report, issued before the Valeant bid. Valeant is proposing to swap each Allergan share for US$48.3 in cash and 0.83 Valeant shares. It says it has committed financing from Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada for about US$15.5bn, which would be broken into “secured bonds, unsecured bonds and bank debt [at an] expected interest rate of around 5.5% on new debt,” Valeant said in a filing. That compares with Allergan 2023s yielding around 4.6% after news broke of the hostile takeover attempt. Big pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck & Co and Sanofi, are seeking “strategic options for non-core assets”, according to Barclays’ Mukherjee, while generic drug companies suffering from slowing growth in that business are looking to build portfolios of branded drugs via acquisition. In the past week it was revealed that Pfizer, which has plans to split into three parts, had made an unsuccessful US$101bn run at AstraZeneca. Novartis also announced a flurry of purchases and divestments involving GlaxoSmithKline and Eli Lilly, which will see both Novartis and Lilly tap the bond markets for funds. Meanwhile, Teva has stated it is open to acquisitions and Mylan, which has just had its bid for Meda rejected, is looking to do a substantial transaction this year. “The opportunity is in the fact that the many participants grow so scared of M&A; that credit spreads tend to overreact”. US companies seeking to lower their tax rates by re-domiciling to lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland are also spurring acquisitions. The shareholder activist hook-up with a lower-rated firm to buy a higher-rated one is one of the more disturbing trends for bond investors. “Historically we have seen highly rated pharma companies taking over lower-rated ones,” said Michael Levesque, pharma ratings analyst at Moody’s. “In today’s landscape the shape of M&A; is up in the air - and as the Valeant/Allergan situation demonstrates, it could mean a lower-rated company successfully taking over a higher-rated one and saddling it with much higher leverage levels,” he said. Many total return investors benchmarked to an index are avoiding the sector because of the event risk. “The Valeant/Allergan deal has certainly raised red flags for us,” said a senior portfolio manager of a total return fund with more than US$10bn in assets under management. But not all M&A; is bad for investors, and with spreads at all-time tights, getting on the winning side of an M&A; trade can generate significant alpha. “Frankly, in the bond market, the opportunity is in the fact that many participants grow so scared of M&A; that credit spreads tend to overreact,” said Scott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida & Habacht, part of the BMO Global Asset Management stable. “Yields spiking beyond those justified by the transaction leave companies that look fundamentally solid trading cheap.”   (Reporting by Danielle Robinson; Editing by Philip Wright)",4282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-uscorpbonds/pharma-event-risk-hits-investors-idUSL2N0NK0JN20140428
110,AGN,Exclusive: Allergan eyes new takeover bid for Shire - sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N), facing an unsolicited bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRTX.O), is preparing to approach Shire Plc (SHP.L) about a potential takeover, even though the Irish drugmaker rebuffed a previous overture, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. A bid by Allergan for Shire, which has a market value of $32 billion, would underscore how keen the U.S. dermatology drugmaker is to stay independent. Valeant teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman earlier this month to make an unsolicited $47 billion offer for Allergan. Valeant has expanded through a series of acquisitions over the past few years. But Allergan has been reluctant to sell to it in part because of Valeant’s reputation for cutting costs and spending little on research and development. Allergan had held talks in recent months with Shire about a potential takeover, but those did not pan out, Reuters reported last week.  The sources said Allergan is still interested in a deal with Shire and is planning a fresh approach, with the Valeant bid now also in the background. Allergan could come back for a bid as soon as the next few days, one person added. The plan has yet to be finalized and could change, cautioned the sources, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. It is not clear if Shire would be open to entering into merger discussions. A representative of Allergan declined to comment, while Shire could not be immediately reached for comment. Valeant and Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square declined to comment. Allergan’s shares closed down 1.3 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Shire’s shares closed up 2.4 percent in London before the news of Allergan’s renewed interest. A combination of Allergan and Shire would create a pharmaceutical giant with a combined market value of nearly $72 billion and annual sales of more than $11 billion. Analysts have suggested one way for the Botox maker to defend against the unsolicited bid would be to acquire foreign drugmakers such as Shire, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ.O) or Alkermes Plc (ALKS.O). A combination with Shire would help Allergan gain its top selling ADHD drug Vyvanse. It would also gain drugs for rare diseases like Elaprase for Hunter syndrome and Replagal for Fabry disease. Pharmaceutical companies are interested in developing or buying orphan drugs which affect a small patient population because there are fewer hurdles to regulatory approval, have lower marketing costs and can command high prices. Still, the Valeant bid could also complicate attempts by Allergan to find a white knight or buy someone else. As part of their strategy, Ackman bought a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan, becoming its largest shareholder. A transaction would add to a frenzy of deal-making currently going on in the healthcare sector, as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics. Deals totaling more than $153 billion have been struck so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters began tracking data. Pharmaceutical deals have accounted for 71 percent of overall healthcare deals. Buying Shire, which is based in Dublin, would also play to an increasingly popular trend that is driving M&A; in healthcare and some other sectors these days: It could help lower Allergan’s tax rate. In a process known as inversion, U.S. drugmakers seek to relocate their headquarters to other countries with lower tax rates. These companies are eying potential targets that are based in Ireland in particular because of a low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, compared to 35 percent in the United States. Bankers say the tax benefits of inversion are driving several other deals in healthcare and beyond. On Monday, for example, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said it had approached Britain’s AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) (AZN.N) to reignite a potential $100 billion takeover, in what would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. <ID: nL6N0NK194> That deal, if it were to happen, would also come with tax advantages. Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country. Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc (MYL.O) is also looking at acquisition targets that are based outside of the United States because of competitive pressures from rivals with a less burdensome tax structure, and it has made an unsuccessful bid for Swedish drugmaker Meda MEDAa.ST.

111,AGN,"Britain's FTSE hits 7-week high, led by Shire","* FTSE 100 index rises 0.6 percent * Shire advances on report of new takeover bid * BP up; raises dividend, promises more share buybacks * St. James’s Place gains on positive update By Tricia Wright LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Britain’s top shares hit a seven-week high on Tuesday, bolstered by more deal news in the pharmaceuticals sector alongside upbeat corporate earnings reports from BP and wealth manager St. James’s Place. Shire climbed 4 percent, the top percentage gainer on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, after Reuters reported that Botox-maker Allergan Inc was preparing a fresh takeover approach. The UK drugmaker, which on Tuesday tested record highs hit in March, has advanced about 20 percent over the last two weeks, fuelled by speculation it been rebuffing approaches from U.S. rivals such as Allergan. An upbeat results statement lifted BP 0.7 percent and, along with Shire, the oil major was one of the biggest points contributors to the UK benchmark as it raised its quarterly dividend for the second time in six months and said more share buy-backs were on the cards. British wealth manager St. James’s Place, which said it got off to a strong start in 2014, and hotel and coffee shop operator Whitbread, which beat full-year profit forecasts, both gained 1 percent. “Investors are waiting to see the start of some positive earnings momentum, which has been missing in recent years. Any sign of a positive momentum is likely to support share prices,” James Butterfill, global equity strategist at Coutts, said. “We are also witnessing the biggest indicative M&A; activities since the credit crisis, highlighting that corporate confidence is improving,” he added. The FTSE index was up 42.28 points, or 0.6 percent, at 6,742.44 points, after hitting an intra-day peak of 6,751.06 points, its highest level since early March. Barclays Capital analyst Lynnden Branigan said that a close above the high seen on April 4, at 6,706, could pave the way for the index to rise to the high seen on March 4, at 6,827.

113,AGN,Pershing Square sits on hefty gains in Allergan bet,"BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management is already sitting on a $1.2 billion gain above his trading costs on his bet on Botox-maker Allergan Inc, according to a filing made on Friday. Allergan shares are now trading about 34 percent above Pershing Square’s average trading costs per share, according to U.S. regulatory filings. Ackman, one of the hedge fund industry’s most widely watched investors, has acquired 28.9 million shares of Allergan, mostly through call option exercises and forward purchase contracts. The gain cements a dramatic comeback for Ackman and his $13.6 billion fund after a bruising 2013 where losses on J.C. Penney and Herbalife weighed on returns. Late last month, Ackman disclosed that the trade amount on most of that stock was $3.2 billion, or $126.54 per share. That reflects more than $1 billion gain on Allergan shares, which traded at $169.45 on Friday. Ackman is working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to buy the Botox maker. Two weeks ago, Pershing Square first said it held a nearly 10 percent stake. On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission gave Pershing Square clearance to finalize the transactions. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act requires that investors notify the FTC and the Justice Department’s antitrust division before making acquisitions of voting securities. Usually there is a 30-day waiting period before the transactions can be finalized. In this case the hedge fund received permission to proceed within two weeks of making its original filing on April 21. Allergan reacted to Valeant’s unwanted $47 billion takeover bid by adopting a so-called poison pill that essentially prevents Pershing Square from acquiring more than the 9.7 percent stake it already has. If the fund were to cross the 10 percent threshold, other investors would be allowed to buy discounted shares. By announcing that Pershing Square was working with Valeant as a group, the activist fund essentially jump-started the process of waiting for a catalyst to push the stock price higher, making it a model that other hedge fund managers said might be tried again. Other hedge funds, including Citadel, Viking Global Investors and Highfields Capital, have also been recent buyers of Allergan stock, according to ThomsonReuters data. The gain was reflected in Pershing Square’s strong performance returns when the fund told investors that its flagship fund was up roughly 19 percent this year.

119,AGN,"Allergan profit, sales top estimates; says weighing Valeant offer","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit on strong sales of Botox and other products and said it was reviewing an unsolicited $47 billion takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO). In reporting its quarterly results on Wednesday, Allergan noted it has in place a one-year stockholder rights plan, commonly called a poison pill, meant to give the company more time to weigh the offer. Excluding special items, Allergan earned $1.18 per share, well above the average analysts’ forecast of $1.13 per share compiled by to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also raised its full year profit forecast, excluding special items, to between $5.64 and $5.73 per share. In February, it had predicted $5.36 to $5.48 per share. “Allergan reported a solid start to 2014,” Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note. But he said Wall Street’s focus will remain on Valeant’s hostile bid. Allergan earned $257 million, or 85 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $12.5 million, or 4 cents, in the year-earlier period, when it took a big charge for discontinued operations. David Maris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said Allergan’s strong performance shows the company is well suited to remain independent. “With Allergan hitting on all cylinders and topping expectations, we think that it is obvious that tinkering with Allergan’s formula will only prove to be a distraction and, in our opinion, damage a business that is already performing well,” Maris said. Global company sales rose 13 percent to $1.62 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $1.60 billion. Botox sales rose 9.6 percent to $502 million in the quarter, while prescription eye care drugs rose 9.2 percent to $730 million. Company shares slipped 1.3 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange amid sharp declines for the drug sector. Valeant teamed up with activist investor William Ackman on April 21 to make the offer for Allergan. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management had accumulated 9.7 percent of Allergan’s common stock, making it the company’s largest shareholder. Valeant, which is based in Canada and therefore has a far lower corporate tax rate than the United States, has been on a buying spree since 2010 and last year acquired contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings.

The preliminary approach for Shire, which is based in Ireland, did not progress to serious discussions between the two companies, the sources said.

122,AGN,"Valeant, Ackman's Pershing eye shakeup to Allergan board","(Reuters) - Deal-making drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N), together with activist investor Pershing Square, plan to push for changes on the board of Allergan Inc (AGN.N), which Valeant hopes to acquire. Billionaire Bill Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square - which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan - and Valeant will pursue “at the appropriate time” a special shareholder meeting to remove some or all directors on Allergan’s board, Valeant Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller said Thursday on a conference call about the company’s quarterly results. In the meantime, Valeant has been meeting with shareholders of Allergan, some of whom overlap with Valeant’s investors. Valeant said that it, together with Pershing, would seek a referendum of Allergan shareholders on support for its board to hold talks with Valeant. “It’s clear that they really see the compelling nature of the transaction and we have strong, strong support to get this deal done,” said Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson. “Their shareholders are speaking, and our shareholders are speaking, that they want us to focus on this and get it done and that’s what we intend to do.” An Allergan spokesman declined to comment. According to Allergan’s bylaws, the company will call a special meeting upon the written request of investors holding at least 25 percent of Allergan’s outstanding shares of common stock. A series of agreed or proposed drug company deals may herald a new era of acquisitions not seen in the sector since last decade. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) has bid for Britain’s AstraZeneca (AZN.L), in what would potentially be the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British firm. Valeant reported a 35 percent jump in adjusted profit on Thursday, helped by robust drug sales in the United States and in its Bausch & Lomb eyecare business. Shares of Valeant edged up 0.3 percent to $133.80 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Allergan stock was up 0.1 percent at $166.11. The Laval, Quebec-based company teamed up with Pershing Square in April to make a cash-and-stock offer worth $47 billion for Allergan, the maker of Botox. Allergan has said it was reviewing the unsolicited bid. Allergan is likely worth more and a higher bid is likely, said Brian Acker, chief executive of Acker Finley Inc, a small investor in Valeant and Allergan. If Valeant lands Allergan, it can then aim at even bigger targets, Acker said. “If I were the other elephants out there, I’d be really worried,” he said. “If they do get Allergan, I think there’s bigger game out there to go after.” Pearson said in January that Valeant was looking to become one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies in terms of market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions. It is currently among the 15 biggest. Valeant was ready to negotiate and expected to hear from Allergan’s board or management within the next few weeks, Schiller said. Even as it pursues its largest transaction, Valeant has been making smaller deals. Pearson said the company expects to sign or complete more than 20 deals worth about $900 million in total during the first half, including 10 transactions for about $200 million in the current quarter. Valeant is targeting deals in the Middle East, Indonesia and South Africa, Pearson said. Adjusted profit, which Valeant calls cash earnings, rose in the first quarter to $600 million, or $1.76 per share, excluding a $135 million charge related to the Bausch & Lomb acquisition last year for $8.7 billion and other one-time items. Revenue jumped 77 percent to $1.89 billion. Analysts had expected cash earnings of $1.72 per share on revenue of $1.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Valeant’s net loss narrowed to $20.3 million, or 7 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $27.5 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said the surge in revenue was driven by 82 percent growth in the developed markets, which make up the bulk of Valeant’s business.

129,AGN,Allergan rejects Valeant Pharma's 'cut and slash' takeover,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) on Monday rejected Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s (VRX.TO)(VRX.N) $47 billion takeover offer, saying its proposed cost cuts were too steep. Allergan, which makes the popular anti-wrinkle treatment Botox, said it believed Valeant’s business model was unsustainable and that the offer was too risky because of uncertainty about the company’s long-term growth. “Valeant’s model of cutting and slashing really doesn’t work for more than a very short period of time,” Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said during a conference call with investors to explain the rejection. He said Valeant’s plan for billions of dollars in cost cuts would prevent Allergan from delivering growth that it could produce on its own, and he set a target of a 20 percent to 25 percent increase in earnings per share in 2015. Valeant and activist investor Bill Ackman, who has a stake of almost 10 percent in Allergan, made an unsolicited cash and stock offer for the company in April. The next step in the Allergan-Valeant battle for control is for Valeant to raise its cash and stock offer and to present the offer to shareholders, analysts said on Monday. “They’re going to have to take this directly to shareholders and frankly this looks like a big media battle,” said David Amsellem, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers both companies. “I think that Valeant really, really needs Allergan.” Allergan and Valeant have both said that they are currently meeting with large shareholders. In April, Valeant said that excluding Ackman’s stake, about 56 percent of Allergan shareholders were also Valeant shareholders. Valeant said last week that it is planning to organize Allergan shareholders to call a special meeting to push out Allergan’s board of directors. It also said it may call a referendum to see if shareholders support Allergan-Valeant negotiations. It is unclear how that would work. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management said that it has requested a complete list of holders of record in Allergan to be able to “communicate with fellow stockholders of the company.” The Vanguard Group, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock rank among Allergan’s 10 largest investors, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said the company was disappointed that Allergan had rejected the offer and that it remained committed to the transaction. Allergan had said it was considering the offer, but within days, it adopted a so-called poison pill provision to slow a takeover. If Ackman’s Pershing Capital raises its stake beyond the 10 percent threshold, other investors could buy discounted shares. Allergan has also been seeking other buyers such as Shire Plc (SHP.L), according to sources familiar with the matter. Pyott said during the call that external moves were options, “but it would be totally premature to discuss them.” He also said he was watching the national debate about companies that move their tax bases outside the United States and that he expected changes to U.S. tax rules. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant has acquired roughly a half-dozen companies in the last two years and has set its sights on becoming one of the world’s five biggest drug companies. Valeant bought contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings Inc for $8.7 billion last year, shortly after acquiring Medicis Pharmaceuticals Corp for $2.6 billion in 2012. Valeant has grown by cutting spending and buying companies or proven products that will boost earnings. The company also domiciles assets in overseas tax havens. Valeant said in announcing its April 22 bid for Allergan that it expected at least $2.7 billion in annual cost cuts. Valeant said last week that Allergan spent too much on research and development and that its selling, general and administrative expenses were excessive. Allergan said on Monday that it expects double-digit sales increases and annual compound growth in earnings per share of 20 percent over the next five years, helped by recent and expected drug approvals. Valeant shares have risen 4 percent since announcing the offer, while Allergan shares have gained nearly 14 percent. In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, Allergan fell 1 percent to $159.55, while Valeant was off 1.3 percent at $129.42.

140,AGN,"UPDATE 3-Valeant to sweeten Allergan bid, Ackman turns up heat","(Recasts with Pershing Square calling non-binding shareholder vote) By Rod Nickel and Caroline Humer May 13 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  said on Tuesday it will sweeten its unsolicited $47 billion offer for drugmaker Allergan Inc, and activist shareholder Pershing Square Capital Management said it would ask for a non-binding vote to pressure Allergan to the negotiating table. The moves by Valeant and Allergan’s biggest shareholder, Pershing, which is led by Bill Ackman, come a day after California-based Allergan rejected Valeant’s current offer and criticized its business model, which is based on a steady pace of acquisitions. Canada’s Valeant said it would change its cash and stock offer during a May 28 webcast in which it will discuss details of its plans for Allergan’s business. Valeant said it remained committed to getting the deal done, but would remain “financially disciplined.” “We will not stop our pursuit of this combination until we hear directly from Allergan shareholders that you prefer Allergan’s ‘stay the course plan’ to a combination with Valeant,” Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said on Tuesday in a letter to shareholders. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Pershing Square, which owns a nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan, said it would ask shareholders to attend a meeting and vote on compelling the board to engage in discussions with Valeant. The vote on an undisclosed date would be non-binding, and the meeting is not called according to Allergan’s bylaws. Allergan, which makes the popular anti-wrinkle treatment Botox, slammed the move as “a self-serving exercise by Pershing Square to further Valeant’s attempt to acquire Allergan” at an undervalued price. “It’s pretty creative (but) I suspect it will have no effect,” said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business of Pershing’s move. “What makes the change is when the big holders say (to the board or management), ‘hey why don’t you at least come and talk to this guy?’ This is like takeover theater.” Allergan said on Monday that Valeant’s business model was unsustainable and the offer was too risky because of uncertainty about the company’s long-term growth. Valeant’s signal of an improved offer near the end of the month sets up an intense two-week period for the two sides to sway shareholders, some of whom own stock in each company. Allergan shares were up 1.1 percent to $161.46 in New York by mid-afternoon, while Valeant stock crept up 0.1 percent to $142.17. Valeant, backed by Pershing, offered on April 22 to pay $48.30 a share in cash and 0.83 of its common share for each Allergan share. Valeant can improve the cash component of the offer by 41 percent to $68 per share, which, combined with the original stock component, would value Allergan at $54 billion or $176 per share, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a note. An offer with more cash might reduce perceptions of risk associated with Valeant’s fast-moving stock. But Valeant is also mindful of how leveraged it is after years of brisk buying. It has set a goal of reducing this year its ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to below four times. The ratio was around 4.5 times in January, and acquiring Allergan under the existing terms would reduce it to about three times, Valeant has said. Valeant’s pursuit of Allergan is part of its strategy to become one of the five-biggest drug companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016. The pharmaceutical industry might see the busiest pace of acquisitions since last decade, led by Pfizer Inc’s $106 billion offer for AstraZeneca . Following Valeant’s offer last month, Allergan put in a so-called “poison pill” to slow Ackman from increasing his nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan. Valeant said at that time it planned to cut costs at Allergan by about $2.7 billion, including in research and development.

146,AGN,"Valeant says plans to ""improve"" offer for Allergan","(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX.TO said on Tuesday it will “improve” its $47 billion takeover offer for drugmaker Allergan Inc AGN.N, a day after the U.S. company rejected the bid. Allergan shares rose 2 percent to $162.75 in pre-market trading. Canada’s Valeant said it would make the change to its cash and stock offer at a May 28 webcast in which it will discuss details of its plans for Allergan’s business. Valeant said it remained committed to getting the deal done but would remain “financially disciplined.”  Allergan, which makes the popular anti-wrinkle treatment Botox, said on Monday that Valeant’s business model was unsustainable and the offer was too risky because of uncertainty about the company’s long-term growth.  Valeant, fresh off its purchase of Bausch & Lomb Inc last year, and investor William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management made an offer for Allergan on April 22. Allergan put in a so-called “poison pill” within days to slow Ackman from increasing his nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan. Valeant said at that time it planned to cut costs at Allergan by about $2.7 billion, including in research and development. “We will not stop our pursuit of this combination until we hear directly from Allergan shareholders that you prefer Allergan’s “stay the course plan” to a combination with Valeant,” Valeant CEO, J. Michael Pearson said on Tuesday in a letter to shareholders. ",5132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-offer/valeant-says-plans-to-improve-offer-for-allergan-idUSKBN0DT0YI20140513
147,AGN,COLUMN-No downside in Allergan 'meeting': Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) By Alison Frankel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its hostile takeover partner William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital have a phalanx of lawyers working on their $47 billion bid for Allergan - Kirkland & Ellis for Ackman; Sullivan & Cromwell and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom for Valeant- so I don’t know who deserves credit for the tactic they announced yesterday. But whoever came up with the idea of holding an unofficial meeting and proxy vote to give Allergan shareholders an opportunity to urge the board to enter discussions with Valeant is quite a strategist. The Ackman/Valeant proxy is apparently the first time a hostile bidder has called for a non-binding straw poll of shareholders but I bet it won’t be the last. This is a win-win proposition for Ackman and Valeant, and here’s why. To start, the unofficial meeting and proxy vote permit Allergan’s bidders to avoid two different sorts of obstacles: the company’s board-friendly corporate framework and its recently-adopted poison pill. Matt Levine at Bloomberg View did a great job Tuesday of explaining why Ackman — who holds about 9.7 percent of Allergan’s stock through Pershing — can’t talk directly to other shareholders for fear of crossing the 10 percent “beneficial ownership” threshold and triggering the poison pill. But the pill, Levine explained, has an exception for proxy solicitations like the one Ackman just launched. So the unofficial proxy vote permits Ackman and Valeant to show Allergan what major investors think without actually talking to shareholders. Plus, Ackman and Valeant don’t have to worry about satisfying requirements in Allergan’s corporate charter and bylaws for shareholder meetings. To convene a special meeting of shareholders - which they would have to do, since Allergan’s regular annual meeting took place on May 6 - they’d have to obtain written consent from 25 percent of the shareholders. (Ronald Barusch of The Wall Street Journal’s Dealpolitik detailed the special meeting process last week, after Valeant mentioned that it might go that route in a conference call with analysts.) Shareholders can bind the corporation through votes at special meetings, though there’s a chance Allergan would claim that a newly-adopted bylaw amendment bars shareholders from replacing directors through a meeting convened by written consent. (It’s complicated, but one pension fund shareholder explained why in a complaint filed last week against Allergan’s board in Delaware Chancery Court.) None of that matters under Ackman’s unofficial meeting strategy. The shareholder vote Ackman has launched doesn’t seek to bind Allergan’s board. It’s just an advisory vote. “SELF-SERVING EXERCISE” So what does the vote accomplish? After all, even if a majority of Allergan shareholders vote yes on the Ackman resolution and request that the board enter discussions with Valeant - a high hurdle, considering that shareholders just elected nine board members by wide margins - the board is not bound by the vote. Allergan’s official statement on the Ackman proxy hints that the company won’t be influenced by the outcome of what it called “a self-serving exercise” that ignores “the mechanism approved by the Allergan shareholders to call a special meeting.” But if Ackman and Valeant persuade even a sizable minority of Allergan shareholders that the board ought to talk to them, they’ll have both a public relations victory and an argument that the board isn’t living up to its fiduciary duties to shareholders. You can already envision Ackman’s future Delaware Chancery Court class, asserting that Allergan board members disregarded a shareholder directive to explore Valeant’s offer. I’m not saying Ackman would win the case based just on an advisory vote, but I’m sure Allergan’s directors and their lawyers at Latham & Watkins will be thinking about the prospect of litigation when they decide how to respond to the proxy vote. That’s the considerable upside for Valeant and Ackman if the vote goes their way: forcing talks through P.R. and the board’s fear of litigation and liability. But what if Ackman’s resolution gets only weak support from Allergan’s shareholders? Here’s the real beauty of Ackman’s proxy play: Valeant probably wouldn’t even have to report a bad outcome to the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to former SEC lawyer Seth Taube of Baker Botts. Obviously, the Allergan bid is material to Valeant, a public company. But an unfavorable result in a non-binding, unofficial shareholder vote, Taube said, is probably not material. “I would think it’s not a disclosable risk,” Taube said. He also pointed out that the shareholders who vote on Ackman’s resolution are likely to be those who support it. So there ought to be ways for Ackman and Valeant to spin the outcome even if they obtain support from a relatively small number of shareholders, by presenting yes votes as a percentage of the total votes rather than the total float. You really can’t ask for a smarter strategy than one that lets Ackman and Valeant reach out to other shareholders without triggering the pill and positions them for a litigation challenge while costing them nothing more than the expense of a proxy contest. No wonder Matt Levine at Bloomberg has called the Allergan takeover battle “a weird textbook for The Future of Mergers & Acquisitions.”    (Reporting by Alison Frankel; Editing by Amy Stevens)",5142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/column-frankel/column-no-downside-in-allergan-meeting-frankel-idUSL1N0O02CM20140514

150,AGN,Valeant to consider breakup after mega deals -investors,"NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc would consider splitting up if it became too large from its aggressive acquisition strategy, according to a few top 20 Allergan Inc shareholders who were briefed by Valeant management. Canada’s Valeant, which alongside Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman is pursuing an unsolicited $47 billion takeover of U.S. drug maker Allergan, told the shareholders that down the line it could break up into smaller discrete businesses that would then pursue roll up strategies of their own. Some analysts have said that an acquisition of Allergan would make Valeant so large that it would become difficult to find meaningful takeover targets that would allow Valeant to continue to grow. Valeant, which makes a number of products including over-the-counter drugs and medical devices, has a market value of $42 billion, compared to $47 billion for Allergan, which makes products in the aesthetics field like Botox. Valeant’s business model, which relies heavily on buying companies to grow revenues rather than through research and development, has been criticized by Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott as “not sustainable.” Valeant said in a letter to Allergan shareholders that it would respond to concerns regarding its operating model during a May 28 webcast. “Traditionalists have questioned our operating model since we began our journey more than six years ago,” the letter said. Valeant CEO Mike Pearson has said he wants Valeant to become a top five drugmaker by 2016. The company has spent $19 billion on 35 acquisitions since 2008 including its $8.7 billion purchase of eyecare company Bausch & Lomb last year, which is its biggest completed deal to date. Valeant’s market cap has grown from $1 billion in 2008 to more than $40 billion as a result of the company’s dealmaking. The shareholders declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Valeant and Allergan declined to comment. Valeant said it would improve its current bid for Allergan, which was rejected earlier this week. The sweetened offer could come during the May webcast. Over the last several weeks, the two sides have been speaking to top shareholders. Following Valeant’s offer last month, Allergan put in a so-called “poison pill” to prevent Ackman from increasing his nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan. Valeant said at that time it planned to cut costs at Allergan by about $2.7 billion, including in research and development.

151,AGN,Ackman: Allergan CEO has conflict of interest on takeover offer,"(Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman said on Monday that Allergan Inc’s (AGN.N) chief executive has a “disabling” conflict of interest because a takeover of his company by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) would likely mean the loss of his job. Ackman and Montreal-based Valeant launched a $47 billion takeover of the company on April 22, but Allergan rejected the offer on May 12 and has not budged since. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott is urging shareholders to let the company stand alone. Valeant, however, said last week it intended to sweeten its offer and would discuss the matter in a May 28 webcast. Ackman, who controls a nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan as the head of Pershing Square Capital Management, criticized Allergan’s position in a May 19 letter to its lead director, Michael Gallagher. The activist investor said Allergan’s board of directors needed to create a subcommittee to communicate directly with shareholders, and he complained that his attempts to speak to the company’s top director without management present were rejected. “The board’s apparent unwillingness to speak or meet with us and your unwillingness to speak with the company’s largest shareholder without Mr. Pyott present are both material failures of Allergan’s corporate governance at a critical time for Allergan and its shareholders,” he said in the letter. “CEO David Pyott has a disabling conflict of interest that arises from the fact that he will lose his leadership role at the company and likely his job as a result of the transaction,” Ackman said in the letter. Gallagher, in a letter of response to Ackman, took exception to his “statements and tactics, including your blatant attempt to isolate David Pyott, who has created enormous value for the Allergan stockholders and who is keenly focused on the best interests of all stockholders.” Gallagher’s letter, which appeared in a regulatory filing, went on to say: “The entire board of directors, including David Pyott, is open to all options that will significantly enhance the long-term value of Allergan for all stockholders.” Allergan, earlier on Monday reiterated that the takeover offer was too risky for shareholders and it defended its communications with shareholders. “Allergan maintains an open line of communication with stockholders and welcomes their feedback. However, as a co-bidder with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, we believe that Mr. Ackman’s views and interests are not aligned with those of other Allergan stockholders,” Allergan spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs said in a statement. Ackman’s letter is his latest effort to try to gain shareholder support for the deal. He said last week he would call an unofficial Allergan shareholder meeting and a vote on support for the deal. “To me the letter is a very old school public pressure type of approach,” BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said of Ackman’s approach. “Why would Allergan agree to any further discussions when Valeant has already said they are going to come out with a new bid on the 28th?” Ackman’s letter was disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Valeant shares closed up 0.5 percent at $127.21 on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Allergan closed down 0.2 percent at $159.79, also on the NYSE.

155,AGN,Valeant says improved bid for Allergan won't be all-cash,"LAVAL, QUEBEC (Reuters) - Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO) said on Tuesday it will not make an all-cash bid for drugmaker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) as many had expected last week when the company said it would improve its cash and stock offer for the Botox maker. Michael Pearson, chief executive officer of the Canadian drugmaker, said Allergan shareholders favored Valeant’s bid and preferred Valeant equity over more cash. “We think their shareholders are convinced this is a good transaction and we have met with many, if not most of their shareholders privately and they have all told us they want this deal to be done,” Pearson said on the sidelines of Valeant’s annual meeting in Laval, Quebec. “In terms of the currency, most of their shareholders would prefer to get more equity and less cash. They believe that the combination will not only create short term value in terms of the premium, but that longer term, it will continue to perform.” Valeant on April 22 offered $48.30 in cash and 0.83 of one Valeant share for each Allergan share in a massive $47 billion unsolicited bid with the support of activist investor William Ackman. Allergan rejected the offer on May 12, citing the high stock component and steep cost-cut proposals. It said the offer was too risky due to uncertainty over long-term growth at Valeant, whose business model was unsustainable. Valeant will announce its improved offer May 28 when it holds a meeting for shareholders of both companies to respond to Allergan’s assertions. “We want to make clear that the improved offer will not be an all-cash deal,” Valeant said in a statement Tuesday. Pearson said Valeant could not outline its new proposal earlier, but said a revised bid was best presented May 28 when addressing both sets of shareholders. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant aims to become one of the world’s top five drugmakers and has acquired about half a dozen companies in the last two years.

163,AGN,Valeant injects cash into bid for Botox maker Allergan,"(Reuters) - Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) raised the cash component of its unsolicited offer for Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) on Wednesday, but the increased bid fell short of expectations and both stocks dropped. Valeant’s sweetened offer values Allergan at about $49.9 billion, based on 303.5 million shares outstanding. It also includes the possibility of additional payments worth up to $7.6 billion related to the future sales of an experimental eye drug. “I was actually surprised (Valeant) didn’t go higher,” said David Amsellem, analyst at Piper Jaffray. “Clearly they are going to continue to be aggressive, making a full-court press to get this done.” Valeant’s New York-listed shares dropped 1.7 percent in midafternoon to $127.61, while Allergan stock lost 4.5 percent to $157.67. Valeant raised its cash component to $58.30 per Allergan share, compared with its previous offer of $48.30. The stock component remains at 0.83 of a Valeant share for each Allergan share. The new offer valued Allergan at $164.22 per share as of midday Wednesday, about 7 percent higher than the previous bid of $153 as of April 22, when Valeant first made its offer.  Valeant made the initial offer, worth $47 billion, together with activist investor Bill Ackman. Allergan spurned their advance, saying the Canadian company had overstated possible savings. Allergan is best known for its lucrative Botox medicine, which is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles and used to treat various other ailments. Valeant’s offer on Wednesday was lower than the $180-$200 per share that investors were looking for, according to an investor survey last week.  It includes a so-called contingent value right, or a right to receive additional benefit, worth up to $25 per share. The possible payments would reflect sales of Darpin, Allergan’s experimental eye drug, a potential competitor to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s (REGN.O) successful Eylea, used to treat the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.  “Allergan shareholders want this deal to occur, but they want a higher price and the optionality on Darpin,” Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in a meeting in New York with several hundred shareholders. “We think the offer we made this morning addresses both of those concerns.” Allergan said it would review and consider the revised proposal. Even as news of the revised offer settled in, Pearson fielded questions about the company’s next moves. Valeant expects to win approval shortly from the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold a non-binding vote of Allergan shareholders by early July, Pearson said, a move aimed at pressuring Allergan to negotiate. He also said the company was willing to take its offer directly to Allergan shareholders and force a special meeting. That would require Allergan’s board to waive the poison pill it passed to stop Ackman from raising his stake. “We are open to any and all approaches to try to get this deal consummated,” he said. “It would be a real shame if we can’t engage the board and management to get this done sooner rather than later.” The company is open to a split if it becomes too large, Pearson said, adding that Valeant’s “objective in life is not just to become large.” Pearson said in January that the company would look to become one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016.

164,AGN,UPDATE 4-Valeant injects cash into bid for Botox maker Allergan,"(Updates deal value) By Rod Nickel and Caroline Humer May 28 (Reuters) - Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  raised the cash component of its unsolicited offer for Botox maker Allergan Inc on Wednesday, but the increased bid fell short of expectations and both stocks dropped. Valeant’s sweetened offer values Allergan at about $49.9 billion, based on 303.5 million shares outstanding. It also includes the possibility of additional payments worth up to $7.6 billion related to the future sales of an experimental eye drug. “I was actually surprised (Valeant) didn’t go higher,” said David Amsellem, analyst at Piper Jaffray. “Clearly they are going to continue to be aggressive, making a full-court press to get this done.” Valeant’s New York-listed shares dropped 1.7 percent in midafternoon to $127.61, while Allergan stock lost 4.5 percent to $157.67. Valeant raised its cash component to $58.30 per Allergan share, compared with its previous offer of $48.30. The stock component remains at 0.83 of a Valeant share for each Allergan share. The new offer valued Allergan at $164.22 per share as of midday Wednesday, about 7 percent higher than the previous bid of $153 as of April 22, when Valeant first made its offer. Valeant made the initial offer, worth $47 billion, together with activist investor Bill Ackman. Allergan spurned their advance, saying the Canadian company had overstated possible savings. Allergan is best known for its lucrative Botox medicine, which is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles and used to treat various other ailments. Valeant’s offer on Wednesday was lower than the $180-$200 per share that investors were looking for, according to an investor survey last week. It includes a so-called contingent value right, or a right to receive additional benefit, worth up to $25 per share. The possible payments would reflect sales of Darpin, Allergan’s experimental eye drug, a potential competitor to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s successful Eylea, used to treat the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. “Allergan shareholders want this deal to occur, but they want a higher price and the optionality on Darpin,” Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in a meeting in New York with several hundred shareholders. “We think the offer we made this morning addresses both of those concerns.” Allergan said it would review and consider the revised proposal. Even as news of the revised offer settled in, Pearson fielded questions about the company’s next moves. Valeant expects to win approval shortly from the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold a non-binding vote of Allergan shareholders by early July, Pearson said, a move aimed at pressuring Allergan to negotiate. He also said the company was willing to take its offer directly to Allergan shareholders and force a special meeting. That would require Allergan’s board to waive the poison pill it passed to stop Ackman from raising his stake. “We are open to any and all approaches to try to get this deal consummated,” he said. “It would be a real shame if we can’t engage the board and management to get this done sooner rather than later.” The company is open to a split if it becomes too large, Pearson said, adding that Valeant’s “objective in life is not just to become large.” Pearson said in January that the company would look to become one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016. Valeant’s 3-1/2-hour meeting with investors was intended to blunt Allergan’s criticisms about its organic revenue growth, management experience and its aggressive approach to acquisitions. Separately, Valeant said on Wednesday it would sell some of its skincare treatments business, including facial fillers for treating wrinkles, to Nestle SA for $1.4 billion in cash.

The S&P; 500 has gained for four straight sessions as investors’ appetite for equities has been buoyed by supportive U.S. economic data recently and expectations of monetary easing by the European Central Bank, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury note’s yield slipped below 2.44 percent, its lowest level since July. “We made a pretty decisive move above 1,900” on the S&P; 500, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. “Economic momentum is clearly to the upside at the moment, the surprise index is up, and that’s pretty powerful for stocks,” he said, referring to Citi’s Economic Surprise Index, which measures how well data performs relative to forecasts. “We’ve had a constant stream of better-than-expected data, and the bond market has remained supportive.” The drop in fixed-income yields could lift the prices of dividend-paying stocks. The S&P; utilities index is up 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation Average extended its run into record territory, hitting a lifetime intraday high of 8,096.09 after closing on Tuesday above 8,000 for the first time. When the transports sector does well, the trend signals an improved outlook for the U.S. economy and the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.19 points or 0.11 percent, to 16,657.31. The S&P; 500 gained 1.06 points or 0.06 percent, to 1,912.97. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 3.63 points or 0.09 percent, to 4,233.44. If the S&P; 500 advances for a fifth straight day, this would be its second-longest run this year. The index hit 1,914.46, a fresh intraday record high, and remains in the 1,910 area seen as technical resistance. Support kicks in at 1,900 and then at the 14-day moving average, now near 1,889. U.S.-traded shares of Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals fell 1.6 percent to $127.78 after the company raised the cash component of its offer for Botox maker Allergan, valuing the U.S. company at $49.44 billion. Allergan fell 4.5 percent to $157.66. Shares of Toll Brothers, the largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, rose 2 percent to $36.36 after the company reported that its quarterly profit more than doubled as it sold more homes at higher prices. Among retailers, Michael Kors Holdings Ltd climbed 1 percent to $96.67 following the company’s quarterly earnings  as sales of its handbags and watches surged in North America. But the company - founded by fashion designer Michael Kors - cautioned that it expected the cost of opening new stores in Europe to depress gross margins in the next few quarters. In contrast, footwear retailer DSW lost more than a fourth of its market value after the company missed estimates on its results and outlooks. The stock sank 27.6 percent to $23.54.

172,AGN,Valeant boosts $53.8 billion Allergan bid as Ackman opts for stock,"(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) said on Friday it would boost its takeover bid for Botox-maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) for the second time this week, contingent on the two sides negotiating. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant said it would pay $72 in cash - up from $58.30 on Wednesday - and 0.83 share of Valeant stock for each Allergan share. The revised, unsolicited offer was triggered by Pershing Square, the hedge fund controlled by Bill Ackman that is Allergan’s biggest shareholder, agreeing to take only stock in Valeant for its Allergan shares.  The offer is worth $53.8 billion, up from Wednesday’s $49.9 billion bid. Allergan shares closed 5.7 percent higher at $167.46 while Valeant shares ended 1.5 percent higher at $131.21.  BMO analyst David Maris said the revised offer will fall short, adding it seemed “odd and erratic” that Valeant would raise the bid two days after its chief executive, Mike Pearson,  promised not to negotiate against himself.   “Like with marriages in olden days, when a dowry rises rapidly and without reason, you should take a closer look at the bride,” Maris said. But analyst Ronny Gal of Bernstein Research said the offer increases pressure on Allergan to take action to raise the company’s value and also to negotiate with Valeant.  “The offer now appears credible,” he said. “We do not think this is a ‘done deal’ by a long shot, but obviously the likelihood of success is higher now.” Allergan said in a statement that it plans to consider Valeant’s latest proposal once it receives it. It is best known for its Botox medicine, which is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles.        Ackman said he called Pearson on Friday morning and offered to take stock for his Allergan shares if Pearson increased the cash offer to other shareholders.     “We believe that our gesture to the other Allergan owners makes an extraordinarily strong statement about our belief in the long-term value of this highly strategic business combination,” Ackman said in a statement. The deal value is based on Allergan’s 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2014, and Ackman’s holding of 28,878,638 shares. Along with cash and shares, it also includes the possibility of additional payments worth up to $7.6 billion related to future sales of an experimental eye drug. Valeant on Wednesday raised the cash component of its bid for Allergan, but the offer disappointed and both stocks dropped. Buying Allergan would push Valeant closer to its goal of becoming a top-five pharmaceutical company by market cap before the end of 2016, although Pearson also mused on Wednesday about potentially breaking up the company.

The deal value is based on Allergan’s 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2014, and Ackman’s holding of 28,878,638 shares. Along with cash and shares, it also includes the possibility of additional payments worth up to $7.6 billion related to future sales of an experimental eye drug. Valeant on Wednesday raised the cash component of its bid for Allergan, but the offer disappointed and both stocks dropped. Buying Allergan would push Valeant closer to its goal of becoming a top-five pharmaceutical company by market cap before the end of 2016, although Pearson also mused on Wednesday about potentially breaking up the company. Allergan has criticized the sustainability of Valeant’s rapid growth through acquisitions, which included contact lens maker Bausch + Lomb last year.

179,AGN,"Valeant, Pershing prepare to go hostile in Allergan bid","(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) on Monday prepared to take its $53.8 billion takeover bid for Allergan Inc (AGN.N) directly to the Botox maker’s shareholders in a battle that could last late into the year. The fight escalated when Valeant ally Pershing Square, a hedge fund that owns 9.7 percent of Allergan, called for a meeting to replace the company’s board. Pershing Square Chief Executive Officer Bill Ackman, in a conference call with Valeant CEO Mike Pearson, told investors he had requested a special meeting that could take place as early as Aug. 7. Allergan could also delay the meeting, where Pershing intends to replace a majority or more of the company’s directors, to as late as November, Ackman said. Pearson said Valeant expected in two to three weeks to file an exchange offer, a means of taking the bid to Allergan shareholders, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also urged Allergan to negotiate with Valeant. “We will be patient,” Pearson said. “We will get this deal done.” Allergan, whose Botox medicine is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles, said it would consider Valeant’s latest offer. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant said on Friday that it would pay $72 in cash and 0.83 share of its stock for each Allergan share, increasing its offer for the second time last week.  Valeant is also offering possible additional payments related to future sales of an experimental eye drug that Allergan owns.     In a statement, Allergan urged shareholders not to act on the bid until its board makes a recommendation. The drawn-out process to a special meeting would benefit Valeant since an increase in its share price during that time would boost the value of its offer and make a merger more likely, said Sterne Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra. Malhotra said he doubted Allergan would let the situation escalate to a proxy battle at the special meeting but was more likely to develop its own plan or negotiate better terms with Valeant. BMO analyst David Maris said Allergan had options such as a share buyback, a dividend increase or combination with other companies. Ackman said he had met last week with six major Allergan shareholders with a combined 19 percent stake, and they said they believed the merger makes sense. He said he was scrapping plans for a non-binding referendum as a means of pressuring the company to negotiate, based on shareholder feedback. Analysts peg the value of Valeant’s bid, prior to Monday’s trading, at roughly $180 to $184 per Allergan share.  Shares of Allergan were up 2.6 percent at $171.80 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. Valeant gained 2.2 percent to C$145.50 in Toronto and rose 1.6 percent to $133.36 in New York.

188,AGN,UPDATE 1-Ackman says Allergan holders back takeover at $180/shr-CNBC,"(Adds background, more details from interview) June 9 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc shareholders have told activist investor William Ackman, who along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals is trying to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc that they would support a deal at $180 per share, Ackman said Monday. Valeant and Ackman, who owns almost 10 percent of Allergan through Pershing Square Capital Management, are in the midst of a hostile takeover battle for Allergan that began with a joint bid on April 22. Allergan rejected that first offer and Valeant responded by raising its offer on May 28 to about $163 per share. Investors did not think that offer was high enough and shares in both companies fell over doubts about the deal. Ackman, speaking on CNBC in his first public appearance regarding the takeover attempt since it was announced, said that he met with Allergan shareholders on May 29 and was told they would support the deal at $180 per share. “We are going to take over Allergan,” Ackman said. The days after Ackman met with investors, May 30, Valeant raised its offer to include $72 in cash for a per share value of about $177 and a total value of more than $53 billion. In that offer, Ackman agreed to take only Valeant stock, freeing up Valeant to offer more cash to other shareholders. Ackman filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold a special shareholder meeting to vote in new members of the Allergan board of directors. The current board has adopted a “poison pill” measure that will dilute shares if Ackman increases his Allergan stake. During the CNBC interview, Ackman defended Valeant’s business model, which has been criticized for its serial acquisitions, and his own purchase of Allergan shares. Ackman’s stake has increased by more than $1 billion since he purchased it before making the joint bid with Valeant, regulatory documents show. Allergan shares closed on Friday at $165 and Valeant shares closed at $127.46, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

194,AGN,Allergan rejects Valeant and Ackman's raised takeover offer,"(Reuters) - The battle for botox maker Allergan Inc heated up on Tuesday as the company officially rejected a sweetened $53 billion takeover offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and activist investor William Ackman. Since Canadian drugmaker Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management made a joint bid for the company on April 22, Allergan has stood firm against entreaties to sit down at the table and negotiate a deal. Ackman, who has almost a 10 percent stake in Allergan, and Valeant raised their joint offer on May 28 and when investors were displeased and sold shares, added even more cash to it on May 30. He also said that he would call shareholders to a vote. On Tuesday, Allergan once again declined the bid, saying that the offer undervalues the company and is too risky for shareholders. Allergan also reissued criticisms of Valeant’s business model, saying that its reporting of financial information was opaque.  “We do not believe your latest proposal offers sufficient or certain value to warrant discussions between Allergan and Valeant,” Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said in a letter to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson. A Valeant spokeswoman said that given Allergan’s rejection, the company would move forward with its plan to take the deal to shareholders for a vote. The first step in that battle would be to elect a Valeant-Ackman backed board of directors at Allergan. A shareholder meeting to do that could be held in November. “Valeant’s offer to combine with Allergan will create substantial value for both companies’ shareholders, and we look forward to giving Allergan shareholders the opportunity to speak for themselves,” Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in a statement. Pyott said in an interview with Reuters that he was in for a long slog.  “I’m an endurance player; I climbed Kilimanjaro last year,” Pyott said. He said shareholders wanted the company to use the $14 billion in cash flow it would generate over the next five years for acquisitions.     Allergan can pursue other options, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said.    “We continue to believe that Allergan has many options, including a buyback, dividend, combination with others - or even some combination of these,” Maris said in a research note. The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 Valeant shares, is currently worth about $177 per share, or $53 billion. The deal value is calculated based on 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2014 and Ackman’s holding of 28,878,638 shares. Ackman was not immediately available for comment. Allergan shares were down 0.6 percent at $163.17 and Valeant shares fell 1.8 percent to $124.41 by around 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT). Allergan shares are far off the $177 per share price implicit in the Valeant offer. “It suggests that the market is still not going to go for it at the current price,” Morningstar Research analyst Michael Waterhouse said.

He also said that he would call shareholders to a vote. On Tuesday, Allergan once again declined the bid, saying that the offer undervalues the company and is too risky for shareholders. Allergan also reissued criticisms of Valeant’s business model, saying that its reporting of financial information was opaque. “We do not believe your latest proposal offers sufficient or certain value to warrant discussions between Allergan and Valeant,” Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said in a letter to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson. A Valeant spokeswoman said that given Allergan’s rejection, the company would move forward with its plan to take the deal to shareholders for a vote. The first step in that battle would be to elect a Valeant-Ackman backed board of directors at Allergan. A shareholder meeting to do that could be held in November. “Valeant’s offer to combine with Allergan will create substantial value for both companies’ shareholders, and we look forward to giving Allergan shareholders the opportunity to speak for themselves,” Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in a statement. Pyott said in an interview with Reuters that he was in for a long slog. “I’m an endurance player; I climbed Kilimanjaro last year,” Pyott said. He said shareholders wanted the company to use the $14 billion in cash flow it would generate over the next five years for acquisitions. Allergan can pursue other options, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said. “We continue to believe that Allergan has many options, including a buyback, dividend, combination with others - or even some combination of these,” Maris said in a research note. The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 Valeant shares, is currently worth about $177 per share, or $53 billion. The deal value is calculated based on 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2014 and Ackman’s holding of 28,878,638 shares. Ackman was not immediately available for comment. Allergan shares were down 0.6 percent at $163.17 and Valeant shares fell 1.8 percent to $124.41 by around 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT). Allergan shares are far off the $177 per share price implicit in the Valeant offer. “It suggests that the market is still not going to go for it at the current price,” Morningstar Research analyst Michael Waterhouse said.

202,AGN,Ackman sues Allergan over questions about poison pill,"(Reuters) - William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management on Friday it filed a lawsuit against Allergan Inc (AGN.N) seeking confirmation that its request to hold a special meeting of Allergan shareholders would not trigger poison pill takeover defense. Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) are pursuing in a hostile takeover of Allergan. Ackman, who owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, has called for a shareholder meeting to elect new directors to the company’s board. The suit seeks to confirm that Ackman is not about to trigger Allergan’s poison pill takeover defense as it seeks shareholder support for the meeting.  Allergan, which makes Botox for wrinkles and other uses, has rejected a $53 billion joint offer from Ackman and Valeant. Ackman last week filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission that would start a proxy battle. Allergan and Valeant both declined to comment on the suit. Allergan adopted a one-year shareholder rights plan, often called a poison pill, on April 22, the day Valeant and Ackman made their offer. The company said it needed time to consider takeover proposals. Allergan’s pill will be triggered if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of its shares. A poison pill aims to dilute a stock’s value by flooding the market with more shares; this makes it pricier for a shareholder to get a controlling stake. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery said it followed a request to Allergan from Pershing Square on June 6 seeking confirmation that Allergan would not use its poison pill to impede Ackman’s request for a special meeting. Allergan’s bylaws require that a group calling a special meeting collectively represents 25 percent of shares outstanding. In the suit, Ackman says he is concerned that by calling the meeting, it will trigger the pill. A response from Allergan’s counsel dated June 11 did not provide confirmation that it would not, the document said. Allergan said in the letter to Pershing Square that its solicitation and receipt of proxies from other Allergan stockholders for the purpose of requesting a special meeting would not, in and of itself, trigger the pill. Allergan declined to answer more specific questions about the details of Pershing Square’s plan for soliciting those proxies in the absence of all the facts, according to a copy of the letter included in the lawsuit. Allergan rejected a sweetened offer from Valeant and the activist investor on Tuesday.  Valeant shares traded in New York fell 0.3 percent to $120.40 while Allergan shares rose 0.6 percent to $162.97.

206,AGN,Valeant senior official leaves amid Allergan takeover battle,"(Reuters) - An executive vice-president of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) will leave the company, even as the Canadian drugmaker fends off criticism about management turnover from its takeover target Allergan Inc (AGN.N). Executive vice-president and company group chairman Ryan Weldon will leave, Valeant confirmed late on Friday after inquiries by Reuters. Like Chief Executive Mike Pearson, Weldon previously worked for management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Valeant said Weldon’s departure was planned, and takes effect after it completes a $1.4 billion sale of several injectable treatments to Nestle SA NESN.VX. The sale was made to allay potential anti-trust concerns about Valeant’s takeover bid for Allergan. “Although his leadership will be missed, the company has created and developed a strong management team and I am confident Ryan will assist us successfully through this transition period,” Pearson said in a statement.  Weldon called his six years at Valeant “extraordinary” and said it was a privilege to work with Pearson and the rest of the company. Weldon exits as Allergan has criticized Valeant’s “significant management turnover” and accused the Laval, Quebec-based company of lacking the experience to manage complex global businesses. In a May 27 investor presentation, Allergan said that of the current management team, only Pearson and general counsel Robert Chai-Onn were in executive officer positions three years ago. Pearson answered that criticism and others the next day, in a 3-1/2 hour meeting with investors and analysts in New York. “We make those changes through people that we bring in through our acquisitions, we go outside for key talent and we continue to look to upgrade the talent,” Pearson said. “We think this is a strength, not a weakness in terms of our business model.” Valeant and its ally Pershing Square Capital Management - Allergan’s biggest shareholder - have offered to buy the Botox maker for $53 billion in cash and shares. Allergan has rejected the offer and refused to negotiate, leading Pershing to move toward replacing most of Allergan’s board at a special meeting. Valeant’s Toronto-listed stock has fallen nine consecutive sessions, losing 12 percent since touching a three-week high on May 30, when it made its most recent revised offer for Allergan. Talk circulated last week that ValueAct Capital Management, one of Valeant’s biggest shareholders, was selling its stock, but ValueAct was quoted by Bloomberg on Friday saying this was not true.

The Botox maker released email exchanges with Morgan Stanley bankers on Monday, which reveal the bankers were pitching for a defense assignment from Allergan, offering advice as to how the company could successfully defend the unwanted suitor.  ""Executives from Morgan Stanley, the investment bank understood to have recently been retained by Valeant, have sent emails directly to Allergan’s management team that suggest they share the concerns of Allergan...,"" the company said in a statement. (Allergan statement: r.reuters.com/jep22w) Allergan said that in a May 13 email to Chief Executive Officer David Pyott and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards, Morgan Stanley’s global head of M&A; Robert Kindler said the company could be more aggressive in going after Valeant’s business model and the value of its stock. David Horn, a managing director at Morgan Stanley’s healthcare group, followed up with an email to Edwards on May 18. “Part of what Rob (Kindler) is suggesting (to Allergan) is to allow him to use his significant relationships with media and analysts to provide a clear and detailed articulation of why Valeant is a house of cards and your investors should not want to take their stock,” Horn said in one of the email exchanges shown by Allergan. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Allergan declined to comment. “Kindler is one of the best M&A; bankers out there. While we will have some fun with him later, he’s still very much on our team,” Valeant CEO Mike Pearson said in a statement. “It’s clear that Allergan’s release is a sign of desperation, and we look forward to proving the naysayers wrong.”  In addition to the email exchanges with Morgan Stanley, the drugmaker in its statement also released third-party views from analysts, investors and media that question Valeant’s business model. Morgan Stanley, like other investment banks, pitched for business from both Allergan and Valeant as the bidding war  escalated. Banks have different teams that work with different clients, which sometimes have divergent interests. In its Allergan pitch, Morgan Stanley argued that Allergan’s financial adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), is not outspoken enough in attacking Valeant’s stock value because the bank is historically close to the Canadian drugmaker and has done a lot of business with the company, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman advised Valeant in its Bausch & Lomb purchase last year and provided committed financing for the transaction. Valeant’s chief financial officer, Howard Schiller, was a long-time Goldman executive. Allergan chose not to add Morgan Stanley to its team of financial advisers, partly because the bank has a potential conflict having an overweight rating on Valeant’s stock, people familiar with the matter said. Valeant and its ally Pershing Square Capital Management - Allergan’s biggest shareholder - have offered to buy Allergan  for $53 billion in cash and shares. Allergan has rejected the offer and refused to negotiate, leading Pershing to move toward replacing most of Allergan’s board at a special meeting.  However, Valeant’s Toronto-listed stock has fallen in recent weeks, with Allergan stepping up its attack on the rival’s business model. Shares of Valeant have fallen nearly 7 percent in the last five days, while the S&P; 500 has remained flat.  Allergan has argued that Valeant shuns research and development and relies solely on acquisitions to drive growth, a model which it calls unsustainable. Allergan has compared Valeant to Tyco, the scandal-plagued company which built itself up through acquisitions and then collapsed.  Valeant has defended itself, with Ackman arguing that the company’s business model is more similar to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) than to Tyco.  Allergan is working with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and legal advisers Latham & Watkins, Richards, Layton & Finger and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Valeant, which has been working with Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and RBC Capital Markets (RY.TO) for the past few months, has recently added Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser, people familiar with the matter said. Valeant decided to bring in Morgan Stanley for its expertise in advising on hostile deals. While the company initially believed Allergan would eventually come to the negotiating table, the target’s repeated rejections made it clear the effort was headed for all-out hostile bidding. Companies often choose to hire additional advisers in protracted, complicated takeover battles.

210,AGN,Morgan Stanley called Valeant 'house of cards' in Allergan pitch,"NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley, an adviser to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc in its $53 billion hostile bid for Allergan Inc, initially tried to get hired by Allergan and in its pitch called the unsolicited bidder a “house of cards”, according to Allergan. The Botox maker released email exchanges with Morgan Stanley bankers on Monday, which reveal the bankers were pitching for a defense assignment from Allergan, offering advice as to how the company could successfully defend the unwanted suitor. “Executives from Morgan Stanley, the investment bank understood to have recently been retained by Valeant, have sent emails directly to Allergan’s management team that suggest they share the concerns of Allergan...,” the company said in a statement. In a May 13 email to Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards, Morgan Stanley’s global head of M&A; Robert Kindler said the company could be more aggressive in going after Valeant’s business model and the value of its stock. David Horn, a managing director at Morgan Stanley’s healthcare group, followed up with an email to Edwards on May 18. “Part of what Rob (Kindler) is suggesting (to Allergan) is to allow him to use his significant relationships with media and analysts to provide a clear and detailed articulation of why Valeant is a house of cards and your investors should not want to take their stock,” Horn said. Representatives of Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Allergan declined to comment. Valeant could not be immediately reached for comment. Valeant and its ally Pershing Square Capital Management - Allergan’s biggest shareholder - have offered to buy Allergan  for $53 billion in cash and shares. Allergan has rejected the offer and refused to negotiate, leading Pershing to move toward replacing most of Allergan’s board at a special meeting. However, Valeant’s Toronto-listed stock has fallen in recent weeks, with Allergan stepping up its attack on the rival’s business model. Shares of Valeant have fallen nearly 7 percent in the last five days, while the S&P; 500 has remained flat. Allergan has argued that Valeant shuns research and development and relies solely on acquisitions to drive growth, a model which it calls unsustainable. Allergan has compared Valeant to Tyco, the scandal-plagued company which built itself up through acquisitions and then collapsed. Valeant has defended itself, with Ackman arguing that the company’s business model is more similar to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc than to Tyco. Allergan is working with Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and legal advisers Latham & Watkins, Richards, Layton & Finger and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Valeant, which has been working with Barclays Plc  and RBC Capital Markets for the past few months, has recently added Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser, people familiar with the matter said.

211,AGN,"Valeant goes hostile, to launch Allergan exchange offer this week","(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) said on Tuesday it will launch an exchange offer for Allergan Inc (AGN.N) this week, allowing it to eventually take the unsolicited bid directly to shareholders.  Botox-maker Allergan has rejected Valeant’s offer of cash and shares, but Valeant Chief Executive Officer Mike Pearson said he sees no reason to adjust the bid a third time. Valeant shares have lost ground for 10 straight sessions through Monday, reducing the value of its Allergan bid to about $50.8 billion from $53.8 billion on May 30. “Hostile is not our preferred approach,” Pearson said. “But this deal was so strategic and financially compelling that it really makes sense.” Valeant’s stock is “artificially depressed,” Pearson said, after weeks of criticism by Allergan and some analysts. Shares of Valeant rose 0.2 percent at $118 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading. Allergan stock was up 0.5 percent at $160.12.  Valeant held a webcast to rebut Allergan’s latest criticism and clarify steps toward a hostile takeover, which could drag into 2015. Allergan’s biggest shareholder, Pershing Square Capital Management, intends to mail proxy materials as early as this month to seek a special meeting later this year to change most of Allergan’s board, Valeant said.  At the same time, Pershing is suing Allergan to confirm its special meeting would not trigger the company’s poison pill takeover defense. To trigger a special meeting, Pershing needs to gain additional support of shareholders representing 15.3 percent of Allergan’s ownership, topping up its own 9.7 percent stake for a total of 25 percent.  Valeant Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller said the company is confident enough Allergan shareholders will support calling the meeting, noting that more than half of Allergan’s shares have traded since word of Valeant’s initial offer leaked on April 21. Hedge funds and arbitrageurs who are interested in a deal now own a large percentage of Allergan, Schiller said. In a statement, Allergan spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs said;”We are confident Allergan can create significantly more value for stockholders than Valeant’s proposal, which substantially undervalues the company, creates significant risks and uncertainties for Allergan’s stockholders and is not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.”  Assuming Allergan shareholders remove most of the board at the meeting by the end of 2014, Valeant said holders of at least 10 percent of Allergan shares can then apply to court for another meeting to elect replacement directors, a process that could take another two months. The new Allergan board could then negotiate a deal with Valeant and close its exchange offer. The battle of words and presentation slides between the two companies has ranged from Valeant’s acquisition-focused business model and accounting methods to Allergan’s research and development costs.

216,AGN,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Drug-maker Valeant begins exchange offer for Allergan,"(Corrects spelling of analyst’s name, paragraph 5) By Rod Nickel June 18 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc  said on Wednesday it began an exchange offer for Botox maker Allergan Inc, taking its hostile $50.8 billion bid directly to shareholders. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant, which said on Tuesday it would launch the offer this week, said Allergan shareholders can choose to trade each share for $72 in cash and 0.83 Valeant share, or all cash or all stock. California-based Allergan said its board would review the exchange offer from Valeant. It previously rejected on June 10 Valeant’s bid, which contained the same major terms. Valeant is backed by Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, which is Allergan’s biggest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake. Taking a step toward resolving the battle is positive for Valeant, given the toll it has taken on the company’s shares and its potential missed opportunities while focused on Allergan, said BMO analyst Alex Arfaei, in a note. But analyst John Boris of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said Allergan’s best defense against the hostile bid may be a good offense. In a note, Boris said he believes Allergan will make an “imminent” bid for Ireland’s Shire PLC, a deal that he said would be more attractive than Valeant’s proposal. Such an acquisition would give Allergan shareholders sales diversification, sustainable organic growth and other benefits  and spare them the risk of holding Valeant shares, he said. Allergan shares rose 1.1 percent in afternoon trading in New York to $162.26, while Valeant fell 0.6 percent to $118.20. Valeant stock has closed lower in 10 of the previous 11 sessions. Shire stock gained 3.4 percent in London. Valeant’s offer will expire on Aug. 15, unless extended.

220,AGN,Shire flags new drugs in AstraZeneca-style defence to AbbVie,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shire (SHP.L) flagged the promise of existing and new drugs on Monday as evidence that AbbVie’s (ABBV.N) $46 billion offer undervalued the company, the latest British firm to be targeted by a U.S. group seeking lower taxes. Shire is taking a leaf out of AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) playbook by disclosing long-range internal forecasts - a tactic used successfully by its larger London-listed rival in fending off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer (PFE.N).  Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline. Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details. Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions. “M&A; will clearly add growth to the profile,” he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. “If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.” Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further “large” deals were possible. As with AstraZeneca’s earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire’s $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020. Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week.  Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie’s most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds.  Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds. Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller. Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become “more and more a rare disease company”. The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. Shire’s strategy copies AstraZeneca’s in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie’s plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns.  Such so-called “inversions” by U.S. companies have moved centre-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes. Whether Shire, long viewed as a likely takeover target, escapes the clutches of a larger predator is uncertain and the company is widely seen as more vulnerable to a takeover by AbbVie - or another company - than AstraZeneca.  That reflects both its smaller size, which makes it a more manageable target for a wider range of players, and the lack of attendant political issues in Britain, where the company has a relatively small workforce. Although established in Britain in 1986 and listed in London, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been resident in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. Other companies that industry sources say have looked at Shire in the past include Allergan AGN.L, itself the target of a takeover approach by Valeant (VRX.TO). Banking sources suggest Shire could also appeal to groups such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O).  Ornskov declined to comment on whether Shire had received approaches from companies other than AbbVie. One senior banker described Shire as a “valued inversion target” but he stressed that potential bidders still needed to demonstrate a tie-up also made strategic sense.  For AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, Shire fits the bill in one important respect: it offers a way to reduce his firm’s over-reliance on rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which accounted for 58 percent of the company’s sales in the first quarter but which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016.  AbbVie itself raised in 2014 profit forecast on Monday, citing strong recent business performance.

222,AGN,Allergan advises shareholders against Valeant tender offer,"(Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) on Monday advised investors not to sell their shares to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) which launched a hostile takeover offer for the California-based Botox maker last week, saying it was “grossly inadequate.” Allergan said its advisors Goldman Sachs & Co. and BofA Merrill Lynch told the board on June 21 the offer was inadequate from a financial point of view. The recommendation was consistent with Allergan’s previous rejections of Valeant’s $52 billion cash and stock offer. The Canadian company and activist investor William Ackman, who owns nearly a 10 percent stake in Allergan, made a joint bid to acquire the company in April. Allergan said in a statement that because of Valeant’s declining share price, the offer is now worth about $173.20 per share, down from the $179.25 per share it reached on May 30. It said that the offer undervalues its “industry-leading position, financial performance, strong balance sheet, exceptional management and growth prospects.” Allergan reiterated its goal to increase adjusted earnings by 20 to 25 cents per share and generate $14 billion in free cash flow in the next five years. Valeant on Monday posted on its website an eight-page rebuttal to earlier criticism by Allergan, defending its acquisition strategy, organic growth and performance of its key products. “Allergan’s rejection of Valeant’s proposal is based on beliefs and assumptions about our business that are not supported by the facts,” Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in a separate statement. “We are moving forward with our exchange offer and remain committed to this value-creating transaction.” Valeant and Allergan shares dipped in New York by 0.6 percent and 0.3 percent respectively, in early trading.

225,AGN,Exclusive: Paulson & Co amasses large stake in Allergan: sources,"New York (Reuters) - Hedge fund Paulson & Co has amassed a large stake in Allergan Inc (AGN.N) of more than 6 million shares and supports a deal between the Botox maker and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The position is expected to make the prominent U.S. hedge fund, led by John Paulson, one of the top 10 to 15 holders of Allergan, according to Thomson Reuters shareholder data as of March 31.  Paulson’s new position in Allergan could give Valeant a boost, as the company tries to drum up support from at least 25 percent of Allergan shareholders so that it can call a special meeting.  Valeant and its ally, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, are seeking to call a meeting to elect new directors to Allergan’s board, which could pave the way for a takeover of the company. Allergan shares closed up 2.3 percent on Wednesday at $169.07, while Valeant shares closed up 4.5 percent at $125.94, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Valeant has taken its offer directly to Allergan shareholders after Allergan rejected its latest $53 billion takeover bid, comprised of $72 in cash and 0.83 share of Valeant stock per Allergan share. Valeant last week began an exchange offer for the Irvine, California-based company. Allergan advised investors on Monday not to accept Valeant’s offer, which it characterized as “grossly inadequate.” Valeant, Allergan and Paulson declined to comment. Other large Allergan shareholders - including T.Rowe Price, ranked as the ninth largest holder as of March 31 - are pushing for a deal with Valeant, people familiar with the matter said. T.Rowe Price has a larger position in Valeant, and ranks as the company’s fourth largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data as of March 31.  A spokesperson for T. Rowe could not immediately be reached for comment.      But some Allergan shareholders believe the company should remain stand-alone, based on the value of the current Valeant offer, said Dan Davidowitz, a portfolio manager at Polen Capital Management LLC in Boca Raton, Florida, which is a top 20 Allergan holder. Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said he believes he has support from the majority of Allergan shareholders for the deal.  “We are confident that shareholders will strongly support our deal in a vote,” he said during an interview with Reuters on Tuesday. Ackman has been trying to encourage Allergan shareholders to consider a deal with Valeant. He has gauged interest from some large holders about whether they would consider accepting a larger proportion of Valeant stock in a show of support for the company’s Allergan bid, people said this week.      The move, if successful, would free up more cash for other shareholders who have expressed some concern about accepting Valeant stock for their Allergan shares. It would also demonstrate that bigger investors are committed to doing a deal, despite Allergan’s steady criticism of Valeant’s acquisition-based business model.     Pershing Square, Allergan’s biggest shareholder, agreed last month to take only Valeant stock in exchange for its Allergan shares.

230,AGN,Shire flags new drugs in AstraZeneca-style defense to AbbVie,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shire (SHP.L) flagged the promise of existing and new drugs on Monday as evidence that AbbVie’s (ABBV.N) $46 billion offer undervalued the company, the latest British firm to be targeted by a U.S. group seeking lower taxes. Shire is taking a leaf out of AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) playbook by disclosing long-range internal forecasts - a tactic used successfully by its larger London-listed rival in fending off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer (PFE.N).  Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline. Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details. Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions. “M&A; will clearly add growth to the profile,” he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. “If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.” Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further “large” deals were possible. As with AstraZeneca’s earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire’s $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020. Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week.  Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie’s most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds.  Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds. Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller. Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become “more and more a rare disease company”. The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. Shire’s strategy copies AstraZeneca’s in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie’s plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns.  Such so-called “inversions” by U.S. companies have moved center-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes. Whether Shire, long viewed as a likely takeover target, escapes the clutches of a larger predator is uncertain and the company is widely seen as more vulnerable to a takeover by AbbVie - or another company - than AstraZeneca.  That reflects both its smaller size, which makes it a more manageable target for a wider range of players, and the lack of attendant political issues in Britain, where the company has a relatively small workforce. Although established in Britain in 1986 and listed in London, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been resident in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. Other companies that industry sources say have looked at Shire in the past include Allergan AGN.L, itself the target of a takeover approach by Valeant (VRX.TO). Banking sources suggest Shire could also appeal to groups such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O).  Ornskov declined to comment on whether Shire had received approaches from companies other than AbbVie. One senior banker described Shire as a “valued inversion target” but he stressed that potential bidders still needed to demonstrate a tie-up also made strategic sense.  For AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, Shire fits the bill in one important respect: it offers a way to reduce his firm’s over-reliance on rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which accounted for 58 percent of the company’s sales in the first quarter but which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016.  AbbVie itself raised in 2014 profit forecast on Monday, citing strong recent business performance.

The company is also considering making acquisitions of its own and more spending cuts to increase shareholder value, Chief Executive David Pyott said in an interview, outlining steps to build support for Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle injections, to remain a standalone company.  But Allergan, which is expected to unveil the plan when it releases second-quarter results sometime in July, faces an uphill battle.  Valeant says it already has enough shareholders on its side to call a special meeting to replace Allergan board members with nominees who support its takeover proposal. To call a meeting, the acquisitive Canadian company needs support of the holders of at least 25 percent of the shares. It is possible that Allergan can turn the tide, but it won’t be easy, said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.  “When I run my numbers, a buyback alone doesn’t quite cut it,” Gal said. “A buyback plus another round of costs cuts, or the acceleration of the discussed cost savings, does.” An Allergan acquisition could help as well if it increases the company’s profits, Gal said. In order to get near-term investors on its side, Allergan needs to deliver another $10 per share of value in 2015 or $11 per share in 2016, he said.  “The question is, how big of a buyback and how big are the cost cuts?” he said. Allergan announced an initial round of spending cuts in May when it first rejected Valeant’s offer. When it rejected Valeant’s offer again on June 10, it said that it would unveil more cuts and capital measures when it releases its second-quarter results.  In the interview,  Allergan CEO Pyott was more specific.  Pyott has met with investors to talk about the company’s defense, which he said could include issuing new debt to buy back shares. He said Allergan could borrow up to $10 billion without affecting its investment-grade rating, but he did not say how much the company might spend on the buybacks.  “Our goal now is to give them most of what they want,” Pyott said, referring to Allergan shareholders. A leveraged buyback would increase the amount of Allergan’s debt, making its balance sheet less attractive to a would-be acquirer. Allergan currently has little debt, one of the company features that appeals to debt-laden Valeant. A buyback would also reduce the number of shares outstanding, which would raise its earnings per share and increase shareholder value. An acquisition by Allergan could also increase earnings, he said. Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in an interview last week that he believes Valeant and Ackman, who owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan through Pershing Square Capital Management, have the backing of enough Allergan shareholders to support the deal. According to sources, Valeant and Ackman have won over a prominent hedge fund, Paulson & Co., which has bought more than 6 million Allergan shares.  The company has said it will cut about $2.7 billion in spending at Allergan and that it would rely less on internal research and development in the future. Allergan says that such cuts would limit the company’s growth potential. Valeant also might pay more to get a deal done, Pearson said. Valeant has already raised its offer twice but has held firm now for about a month.  “We have a walk away price for Allergan. I can’t tell you what our walk-away price is, but right now we don’t have any reason to raise because we would be bidding against ourselves,” Pearson said.  The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 of a Valeant share, is currently worth about $177 per share, or $53 billion. The deal value is calculated based on 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, and Ackman’s holding of 28,878,638 shares.

244,AGN,Investor Ackman hires Credit Suisse for Allergan bid: source,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman has hired Credit Suisse MLPN.P in his fight to have Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) acquire Botox maker Allergan Inc. (AGN.N), a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.7 percent of Allergan and has been working with Canada’s Valeant for months on an acquisition of Allergan in what would be, based on current value, the biggest deal of the year. “Pershing Square has hired Credit Suisse for advice,” said the source, who was not permitted to discuss the move publicly. The move is the latest twist in a heated battle between the two pharmaceutical companies and Ackman, one of the hedge fund industry’s most closely watched investors. Allergan has steadfastly rebuffed Valeant’s overtures, refusing to sell itself for $53 billion, while Ackman is working to call a special meeting of Allergan shareholders in order to elect new directors to the company’s board. Credit Suisse traditionally has helped defend companies against activist investors like Ackman who often acquire a big stake in a company and then agitate for change. The corporate battle has already been playing out in unusual ways.  Pershing Square and Valeant received a boost last week when influential hedge fund manager John Paulson’s Paulson & Co bought more than 6 million shares of Allergan and threw its weight behind the proposed takeover.

248,AGN,TIMELINE-Ackman and Valeant maneuver for Allergan,"July 1(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc   has teamed up with Pershing Square Capital Management, led by activist investor William Ackman, to make a run at Botox maker Allergan Inc. Here are the details of some of the most interesting steps along the way.

April 22 - Valeant and Ackman propose buying the company in an unsolicited cash and stock bid worth about $47 billion, or about $152.88 per share.

May 13 - Valeant says it will sweeten its offer on May 28. Pershing Square files documents to call a non-binding vote of shareholders on the deal. May 19 - Ackman sends a letter to Allergan’s top director saying that Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott has a “disabling conflict of interest” because he stands to lose his job if the deal goes through. May 23 - A JPMorgan investor survey shows that Valeant must up its bid to $180 to $200 per share to win shareholder support. May 28 - Valeant ups its offer with $10 more per share in cash to about $163 per share and says that it will pay out $25 per share if an experimental drug makes it onto the market. CEO Michael Pearson says he is ready to go hostile. Valeant and Allergan shares fall. Separately, Valeant agrees to sell some of its skincare treatments business, including facial fillers for treating wrinkles, to Nestle SA NESN.VX for $1.4 billion in cash. May 30 - Valeant boosts its bid to around $53 billion and increases the cash. Allergan shares rise, but remain below the about $177 per share Valeant offer.

Canada’s Valeant has said it already has enough shareholders on its side to call the meeting. It would need the support of holders of at least 25 percent of the shares. Allergan, based in Irvine, California, said its current board includes people with significantly more industry experience than Pershing Square’s nominees. “We believe today’s announcement is a further attempt by co-bidders Pershing Square and Valeant to acquire Allergan at a grossly inadequate price that substantially undervalues the Company and creates significant risks and uncertainties for Allergan stockholders,” an Allergan spokesperson said. Allergan is expected to unveil details of its plan to remain a stand-alone company when it releases second-quarter results sometime in July. The company has said it is considering acquisitions of its own, additional spending cuts or taking on debt to buy back shares.

253,AGN,Hedge fund manager Paulson calls Valeant a 'serious acquirer',"NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor John Paulson on Wednesday called Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc a “very serious acquirer” and predicted that Allergan Inc cannot rebuff the drug maker on its own. Paulson, whose hedge fund Paulson & Co holds a roughly $1 billion stake, or 6 million shares, in Allergan, threw his weight behind Valeant’s bid to buy the Botox maker on Wednesday at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference. Allergan traded at $165.50 on Wednesday, having climbed 49 percent this year alone with most of the gains coming after Valeant’s bid was announced. Paulson said Allergan’s share price could rise to $222 a share based on the kind of savings Valeant’s chief executive officer might make. Paulson called Mike Pearson, Valeant’s CEO, a very cost-conscious executive who has added significant value for shareholders in the last years. “He is a proven success,” Paulson said. Valeant, working with activist investor William Ackman, has offered to pay $53 billion for the Botox maker but Allergan has steadfastly rejected any discussions with Valeant. The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 Valeant shares, is worth about $177 per share. Ackman is mounting a proxy battle to try and force Allergan’s board to discuss the Valeant bid and on Wednesday accused Allergan of violating its fiduciary duty for not negotiating with Valeant. Paulson said he would listen to a call on Thursday, hosted by Ackman, which will focus on Allergan’s corporate governance and other aspects of its business. The call is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) and will allow listeners to ask questions. Paulson said that Allergan could defend against Valeant’s bid but would need to make an acquisition of its own to do so. “Standing still does not seem to be a plan of action,” he said. Paulson, whose trades have been widely followed ever since he earned billions by betting against the overheated housing market in 2007, often bets on companies that may become acquisition targets.

Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund, Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake, is attempting to gain support of shareholders owning 25 percent of Allergan to call a special meeting, during which it would seek to remove six directors.  Allergan can delay the meeting until as late as November. “We, on behalf of Allergan’s other shareholders, ask that you do not delay the inevitable any further,” Ackman wrote in a letter to Allergan’s board, released on Wednesday. “What legitimate board of directors attempts to silence or otherwise delay hearing what its own shareholders have to say?” Ackman described Allergan’s criticism of Valeant as a “scorched earth response” and said spreading false information to drive down Valeant’s stock would be market manipulation. Allergan, known for its Botox anti-wrinkle injections, said that Ackman’s economic interests were aligned with Valeant’s and he was trying to distract Allergan shareholders from the fact that Valeant’s offer is too low. “Pershing Square’s letter to the Allergan Board is not based on facts, and is rooted purely in self-interest and innuendo,” said an Allergan spokesperson.

Pershing Square Capital Management, which is led by Bill Ackman, is attempting to muster at least 25 percent support of Allergan shares to hold a special meeting that could replace most of the Botox anti-wrinkle injection maker’s board, which has refused to negotiate with Valeant.  In a webcast for investors, Ackman said Allergan’s rules for special meetings were designed to stop them from occurring.  The company limits special meetings to a small window during a given year and requires a high percentage of stockholders to call one, Ackman said. Shareholders must hold their stock through the date of the special meeting for them to count, he added. The rules are “the most onerous special meeting provisions of any public company in the United States,” Ackman said. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant made an unsolicited cash-and-stock bid in April for Allergan and has since raised its offer, which is currently worth about $51 billion. Allergan has rejected the offer. An Allergan spokesperson dismissed criticism by Pershing, which supports the takeover bid. “Today’s presentation by Mr. Ackman is more of the same – baseless accusations and mischaracterizations designed to distract stockholders so Valeant can acquire Allergan at the lowest possible price.” Allergan is “stockholder-friendly” and focused on delivering value to investors, the spokesperson said. Ackman said Pershing hoped to gather enough shareholder support by mid-August to call a special meeting, but probably needed as much as 40 percent for a “big cushion” to offset possible stock sales before the meeting occurs. He said the hedge fund met on Wednesday with shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, which could make a recommendation on Valeant’s offer in early August. Ackman estimated that a merged Valeant and Allergan would trade at $223 per share, slightly higher than the view of fellow activist investor John Paulson, who estimated $222 on Wednesday.

Ackman used much of the nearly three-hour webcast to criticize Allergan’s corporate governance and its business, including the approaching expiry of patents on some products and the return on its research and development spending. He also said the longer Allergan delays negotiating with Valeant, the greater the risk that a potential deal will fall apart due to a sudden change in equity or debt markets.  “I would say the financing markets cannot get better than where they are,” Ackman said. “You can’t ask for a better market than this, but that can change overnight.” ",7172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-valeant-ackman/ackman-allergan-rules-on-shareholder-meetings-onerous-idUSKBN0FM1S820140717

263,AGN,Drugmaker Valeant touts Bausch + Lomb growth to Allergan investors,"(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc moved on Friday to blunt a key criticism by takeover target Allergan Inc of its Bausch + Lomb business by releasing data showing strong sales growth. Allergan, which is trying to fend off a $51 billion hostile bid from Valeant, has warned its investors about the sustainability of the Laval, Quebec-based company’s acquisition-based business model.  Allergan, which makes Botox anti-wrinkle injections, has said much of Valeant’s organic growth, a measure of existing operations’ performance, stemmed from unsustainable price increases, not sales volume. Allergan also said Bausch, Valeant’s biggest acquisition, appeared to be losing market share. In a presentation that Valeant said it would take to Allergan investors, the company said Bausch + Lomb, which is known for its contact lenses, had recorded organic revenue growth of 12 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.  More than 90 percent of that increase was due to a rise in sales volume, it said. “Bausch + Lomb continues to benefit from Valeant’s decentralized operating model,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Pearson said in a statement. “The results at Bausch + Lomb further validate our business model, which Allergan has no credibility in attacking.”   Valeant bought Bausch last year for $8.7 billion. But an Allergan spokesperson said Valeant was trying to “cherry-pick” data without providing enough information to fully evaluate Bausch + Lomb’s performance. “We believe that if Valeant really wants to provide the financial community with a more accurate picture of Bausch + Lomb’s performance, Valeant will disclose more data points to the market than just organic growth that has once again been redefined and broadened,” the spokesperson said, adding that Allergan was concerned that Valeant might take extreme steps to show growth at any cost. The Bausch results are in line with what Valeant said it expected to produce, but investors were skeptical of that forecast, said Morningstar analyst David Krempa. “So it was positive to see (Valeant) deliver,” he said. Valeant’s presentation also urges Allergan shareholders to support holding a special meeting to oust most of the company’s directors, who have refused to negotiate a takeover. Shares of Valeant, which will report the rest of its second-quarter results on July 31, were up 0.2 percent at C$130.98 in Toronto during afternoon trading.

266,AGN,Allergan to cut 13 percent of jobs in fight against Valeant,"(Reuters) - Allergan Inc, which is fighting a hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, said on Monday it would cut 13 percent of its workforce as part of a restructuring meant to boost profits over the next six years. The maker of anti-wrinkle drug Botox said the cost reductions, part of its efforts to convince investors that it is a better value as a stand-alone company, would help increase annual earnings more than 20 percent per year between 2014 and 2019. Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management made a $52 billion hostile offer for the company in April, but Allergan says the deal would hurt its growth and is not in the best interest of shareholders.  The 1,500 job cuts were more than the 5 percent to 10 percent that JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott expected, and he said Allergan therefore deserves a higher valuation.     The restructuring, which would create savings of $475 million in 2015, would also eliminate about 250 vacant positions. It would ensure earnings in 2016 of about $10 per share, excluding special items, well above Wall Street expectations of  $8.14 per share. “Valeant has been saying they’ll cut costs when they take over Allergan, and Allergan is now essentially saying, ‘We can reduce our own costs,’” said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse.     Allergan is weighing strategic options to counter Valeant, including stock buybacks and acquisitions. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott, in a conference call with investors on Monday, said it would be difficult for Allergan to buy companies with the types of products it now sells - which include dermal fillers, breast implants and prescription eye drugs - because Allergan is already a dominant player in those markets. Allergan is interested, however, in buying one or more different types of businesses which would become “new pillars” of the company, Pyott said.  But activist shareholder Bill Ackman, who heads Pershing Capital, said on CNBC that such acquisitions by Allergan would be “desperate” moves and that Pershing Square would sue Allergan if such attempts were made.    Shares of Allergan rose 2.6 percent, while shares of Valeant rose 3.5 percent. David Maris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said some investors may have bought Valiant shares to cover short positions.  Allergan, which emphasizes research spending, said the restructuring would not reduce projects now in human trials. Valeant typically slashes research spending at companies it acquires, and it has vowed to do the same at Allergan. Separately on Monday, Valeant said it had complained to financial market regulators in Quebec and the United States about “false and misleading statements” that Allergan has made about its business.  The two sides are fighting for shareholders’ votes even as those investors are buying and selling stakes. Hedge fund Paulson & Co bought more than 6 million shares of Allergan, sources told Reuters last month. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Capital Research and Management had sold off almost all of a stake that once exceeded 6 percent. Allergan expects earnings of $5.74 to $5.80 in 2014 and $8.20 to $8.40 in 2015. It had previously forecast a 2014 profit of $5.64 to $5.73 per share, with earnings growth of 20 percent to 25 percent in 2015. The company reported second-quarter earnings of $418 million, or $1.40 per share, compared with $361 million, or $1.22 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Allergan earned $1.51 per share. Analysts on average expected $1.44, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Israeli jets, tanks and artillery pounded Gaza again as the death toll from a two-week conflict topped 500 amid growing international calls for a ceasefire. Fighters from Hamas, which controls Gaza, have repeatedly tried to infiltrate Israel over the past week through hidden tunnels. Fighting flared in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk as investigators began to inspect the bodies of victims of a Malaysia Airlines jet shot down last week. The United States and its allies have pointed the finger at pro-Russian rebels and at Moscow itself over the downing of the plane with 298 people aboard. Russia has denied involvement and blamed the Ukrainian military. The United States and the EU last week announced further economic sanctions against Russian interests before the jet was shot down, and sanctions could become even more stringent. However, the effect on the U.S. or the global economy continues to be seen as limited. The situations in Gaza and Ukraine “are both quite serious, but at this point unlikely to derail the U.S. economy,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “Earnings have been good and there’s the Fed’s continued support. Investors are trying to balance out the support for the U.S. market with the risks the geopolitical tension brings.” U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday that Russia and President Vladimir Putin have direct responsibility to compel separatists to cooperate with an investigation into the plane crash. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.91 points or 0.44 percent, to 17,024.27, the S&P; 500 lost 8.75 points or 0.44 percent, to 1,969.47 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 19.54 points or 0.44 percent, to 4,412.60. The S&P; had sold of Thursday after news the Malaysian jet was shot down, falling 1 percent for the first time since April 10. On Friday, the index then rose more than 1 percent for the first time since April 16. On Thursday, the CBOE Volatility Index had jumped 32 percent before retreating 17 percent on Friday. On Monday, it rose 10 percent but at 13.3 remains well below its historical average of 20. “When you have interest rates as low as they are it really dampens stock market volatility tremendously,” Meckler said. “It takes very significant, serious international activity to change that volatility level.” EMC Corp rose 3.8 percent to $28 after Elliott Management Corp acquired a $1 billion stake. The activist investor plans to push the data storage equipment maker to spin off its majority-owned VMware Inc unit, the Wall Street Journal reported. VMWare shares fell 0.8 percent to $94.56. McDonald’s and Yum Brands fell 1 percent and 3.7 percent respectively as they face a new food safety scare in China, denting efforts to shore up reputations hurt by a 2012 safety scandal. Allergan rose 1.3 percent to $169.56. It announced 1,500 jobs cuts included in a $475 million restructuring to boost profits over six years - part of a plan to fight off a hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

272,AGN,RPT-Republican lawmaker to grill U.S. SEC over Ackman tactics,"(Repeats with no changes) By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON, July 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker will pressure the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to consider a raft of reforms, after William Ackman’s aggressive efforts to take over Allergan Inc raised concerns about loose rules governing disclosure and shareholder voting. Republican Representative Edward Royce of California plans to grill SEC Corporation Finance Director Keith Higgins at a House Financial Services hearing. Among his top concerns is a rule that lets investors such as Ackman delay publicly reporting when they have amassed a large stake in a company for days. “I am especially interested in the SEC’s process when looking at novel or creative deals like the announced joint-bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Pershing Square for Allergan,” Royce said in a statement. “Mr. Higgins’ appearance before the committee is an opportunity to make sure that the Commission is making robust reviews of these sorts of deals to ensure strong investor protections and market transparency.” Saat Alety, Royce’s spokesman, said that Royce is prepared to take legislative action if the SEC fails to fix the problem on its own. In recent months, Royce has been writing letters to the SEC to express concerns about some unusual maneuvers that Ackman’s company Pershing Square Capital Management has used in its joint effort with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  to win a $53 billion hostile takeover of Allergan, which is headquartered near Royce’s California district. In one May letter, Royce said he was concerned about early efforts by Ackman to call a non-binding shareholder vote outside of Allergan’s typical election procedures as a way to pressure Allergan to negotiate a deal. Royce said he feared this “shadow” election would make it tough for shareholders to “truly understand what is going on.” Pershing Square dropped plans for a shareholder referendum in May and has since pursued a more traditional proxy battle. In a July 2 letter to Royce, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said that the Corporation Finance division will “continue to consider issues raised by the filing related to the abandoned shareholder referendum” and “issues raised by any future filings of a similar nature.” Ackman’s tactics have raised a number of regulatory questions, both about his actions and about hostile takeover bids generally. It has renewed calls to fix a SEC rule that affords large investors a 10-day delay before they must report when they have amassed more than a 5 percent stake in a company. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law authorized the SEC to shorten the reporting period, but so far the SEC has not taken up the measure. Higgins’ division is in charge of reviewing financial statements of public companies and corporate governance matters. In that role, his division would oversee a rule-writing on the reporting period and also review proxy filings and related regulatory matters. Royce’s questions on Thursday will touch on just one of what is expected to be a wide-ranging list of topics at the hearing. Lawmakers also plan to ask Higgins about other matters, from rulemakings required by the Dodd Frank and JOBS Act laws, to how the SEC oversees proxy advisory firms.   (Reporting by Sarah N.

276,AGN,CORRECTED-Allergan gets EU recommendation on new use of eye drug,"(Corrects patient group in third paragraph to remove reference to cataract surgery) July 25 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc, known best for its Botox wrinkle treatment, said on Friday that European Union regulators had recommended use of its eye drug Ozurdex be extended to treat patients with diabetic macular edema. The European Medicines Agency’s recommendation for approval of the extension of the drug’s use comes one month after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted this broader use. The extension involves allowing Allergan’s sustained-release biodegradable steroid implant to be used to treat diabetic macular edema in adult patients who have an artificial lens implant or are unresponsive or unsuitable for non-corticosteroid therapy. The drug is approved to treat macular edema and non-infectious ocular inflammation. A final decision from the European Commission on the use is expected within a few months, the company said.

277,AGN,"UPDATE 3-Valeant shares fall on lowered 2014, 2015 forecasts","(Adds CEO, analyst comments, sales of Bausch & Lomb brands) By Ransdell Pierson July 31 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, embroiled in a bitter battle to take over Botox-maker Allergan Inc, reported disappointing quarterly earnings and cut its 2014 and 2015 profit forecasts on Thursday, sending its shares down 7.2 percent. “People were disappointed in Valeant’s outlook for the remainder of 2014, and especially its 2015 earnings guidance, which is about $1 per share below expectations,” said Raghuram Selvaraju, an analyst with Aegis Capital. The Laval, Quebec-based company teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman on April 21 to make a cash and stock offer for Allergan now worth about $50 billion. Allergan says the deal would hurt its growth and compromise shareholders. Even as it lowered its profit forecasts, Valeant argued that second quarter results should bolster its attractiveness to Allergan shareholders. Valeant, which paid $8.7 billion for eye care company Bausch & Lomb last year, said sales of those products rose 12 percent to $891 million in the quarter. “They’ll use that to argue that the Allergan business won’t go to pot if acquired by Valeant,” Selvaraju said. Allergan has questioned Valeant’s marketing ability and said it believed the Bausch & Lomb products were stagnating. Valeant, which has grown swiftly through acquisitions, now expects 2014 profit, excluding special items, of $7.90-$8.10 per share, on revenue of $8 billion to $8.3 billion. That is down from its forecast in April of $8.55 to $8.80 per share on revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.7 billion. Valeant said it lowered its 2014 forecasts to reflect its recent sale of rights to several skin care products. For next year, it forecast earnings of about $9.65 per share, well below the Thomson Reuters forecast of $10.42. It expects revenue of about $9.3 billion next year, rising to $11.4 billion in 2016. For 2016, it expects earnings of $12.30 per share. The outlooks assume acquisitions of about $5 billion in 2015 and $10 billion in 2016, Valeant executives said in a conference call with investors. The forecasts represent “conservative assumptions,” including stable research spending and the negative impact of patent expirations, said Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller. Valeant said it remains intent on acquiring Allergan and that Allergan shareholders, should the merger go through, would get twice the earnings per share in 2016 than they would receive if Allergan remained independent. Chief Executive Michael Pearson said Valeant is also interested in other acquisitions, including innovative contact lenses. He said the company could not be content to remain the No. 4 global player in the field. Valeant said it earned $126 million, or 37 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $10.8 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Valeant earned $1.91 per share, below the Thomson Reuters forecast of $1.96. Total revenue rose 86 percent to $2.04 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations.

281,AGN,"UPDATE 4-Allergan sues Valeant, Ackman for alleged insider trading","(Adds lawyer on tender offer) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Caroline Humer Aug 1 (Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Inc on Friday accused rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and billionaire investor William Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared a takeover bid for the drug company. In a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in California, Allergan said Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant “hatched” an “improper and illicit insider-trading scheme” that allowed the hedge fund to buy Allergan shares, knowing about Valeant’s planned $51 billion takeover bid. Valeant and Pershing Square said the complaint was intended to prevent them from calling a special meeting of Allergan shareholders to vote on their board nominees. “This is a shameless attempt by Allergan to delay the shareholders’ fundamental right to call a special meeting,” Ackman said in a statement. “Allergan’s determination to waste money on a baseless lawsuit against its largest shareholder further demonstrates why this board of directors should be removed.” Without a shareholder meeting, Pershing Square and Valeant may not have the support they need to remove Allergan’s “poison pill” measure or to ensure the success of a tender offer. The lawsuit marks the latest twist in an increasingly hostile battle between the two drugmakers and one of the world’s most prominent activist investors. Allergan has been fighting the takeover bid since it was announced on April 22. From the beginning, outside lawyers said the structure of the Ackman partnership with Valeant was novel but not illegal. Now some experts say the suit could allow Allergan to seek fresh evidence to press its case and make life tougher for the $15 billion hedge fund. The timing for Ackman’s Pershing Square is also inopportune as it works to list one of its funds on an exchange in Europe. “This lawsuit brings a set of plausible but difficult complaints that Ackman’s lawyers will likely not be able to get dismissed right away,” said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan. “Defending against this suit is going to cost money and time and be unpleasant for Ackman,” he said. “It may give Allergan discovery rights to dig in and see if there is more evidence.” The value of Pershing Square’s 9.7 percent stake in Allergan, built up between February and April, jumped $1.2 billion once the takeover bid became public. Allergan said the hedge fund improperly enriched itself at the expense of shareholders. Insider trading cases typically turn on whether a breach of duty or trust to the source of information has occurred. In this case, the insider trading allegations focus on Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regulations surrounding the dissemination of information related to tender offers. “There is a technical SEC rule, Rule 14e-3, that prohibits the use of material tender offer information, unless you are the offering person,” Alan Palmiter, a law professor at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina said. “There could be a plausible argument that Ackman may have violated this rule even if he bought Allergan shares with Valeant’s permission, because the rule does not require a breach of a duty of trust or confidence.” Allergan’s gains helped Pershing Square produce some of the hedge fund industry’s strongest performance numbers so far this year, investors said. Allergan asked the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to rescind Pershing Square’s purchase of the Allergan shares, arguing they were illegally acquired. The lawsuit said heavily indebted Valeant lacked the resources to buy Allergan, so it sought financing from Ackman and Pershing Square. By the time they reached a financing agreement, Valeant had already taken concrete steps toward a tender offer for Allergan, it added. For Ackman, who invests for institutional investors including state pension funds as well as wealthy individuals, the lawsuit comes at a critical time as he presses forward with an activist campaign against Herbalife and works to attract investors to the new Pershing Square fund planned for Europe. Privately investors have said they are sticking with Ackman for now, but industry analysts said this lawsuit could eventually make investments with his fund tougher. “Any credible allegations of insider trading is not something you want when you are mounting a road show,” Gordon said. “In this case Bill Ackman is the road show and he’s put on quite a show already.”   (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston Ransdell Pierson, Jonathan Stempel and Caroline Humer in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum, Bernard Orr, Tom Brown and Andre Grenon)",8012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-valeant/update-4-allergan-sues-valeant-ackman-for-alleged-insider-trading-idUSL2N0Q71NN20140801

285,AGN,UPDATE 1-Glass Lewis sides with Ackman on Allergan meeting request,"(Adds details from letter, background to request) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss Aug 4 (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Monday suggested that Allergan Inc shareholders join hedge fund manager William Ackman in calling for a special shareholder meeting. In a report issued to clients, the firm said that shareholders should fill out the paperwork required by Botox maker Allergan for anyone who would like to call for a special shareholder meeting. “We are inclined to suggest shareholders would be best served setting aside the aforementioned risks in favor of the Pershing Square Written Request effort,” Glass Lewis said. Ackman, working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc, has tried for months to broker a deal where Valeant would buy Allergan for $51 billion, but so far Allergan has steadfastly refused. As a next step, Ackman whose $15 billion Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.7 percent of Allergan, has laid the groundwork to call for a special meeting where he hopes to replace the majority of the board with new directors who will be more receptive to the takeover bid. The report could be seen as a win for Ackman in the increasingly bitter battle for Botox maker Allergan’s future. Allergan requires a shareholder to have the support of 25 percent of all shares in order to call a special meeting and its bylaws require the shareholders who want to make such a request to do it in writing. Glass Lewis took care to note that shareholders would not explicitly throw their weight behind a takeover by participating in the process to let a special meeting be called. “We note the current process - as presently framed - does not represent a vote on the merits of any prospective combination transaction or any change to the sitting board; rather investors would only be participating in a process intended to afford them the opportunity to directly express their opinions - positive or negative - on those issues,” Glass Lewis wrote in its nine-page report seen by Reuters. “Thus, viewed collectively, we believe the foregoing factors serve as adequate cause for shareholders to participate in Pershing Square’s Written Request solicitation,” the report said. Proxy advisory firms’ opinions often help shape shareholder views on certain actions. Large investors, including mutual funds, are looking for guidance on how to act in this bitter corporate fight. Institutional Shareholder Services, another proxy advisory firm, is expected to issue its report in the next few days. The opinion comes only a few days after Allergan sued Ackman and Valeant accusing them of have broken insider trading regulations by having worked out the possible details for a takeover bid as the $15 billion hedge fund was building its stake in Allergan.

286,AGN,Shareholder adviser ISS backs Ackman call for Allergan meeting,"(Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is backing activist investor Bill Ackman’s call for a special meeting of Allergan Inc (AGN.N) investors that could topple the company’s board and increase the chances of a takeover by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO). ISS’ recommendation on Wednesday follows a similar view from shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis on Monday, giving Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management momentum as the hedge fund tries to muster support for the meeting. ISS is the largest proxy adviser for institutional investors. Pershing, Allergan’s biggest investor with a 9.7 percent stake, needs to garner shareholder support representing 25 percent of the California company, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle injections. Pershing wants to replace most of Allergan’s board, which has refused to negotiate with Valeant, which is based in Laval, Quebec.  In a report, ISS said “there appear to be significant governance issues which could be addressed” in a special meeting. Ackman and Valeant said they are pleased with the ISS and Glass Lewis reports. “The ISS Report should cause Allergan shareholders to question the credibility of a Board that is pursuing frivolous litigation tactics and baseless attacks to delay or stop the right for shareholders to fix anti-shareholder bylaws, elect shareholder-friendly directors and to voice their concerns about Allergan’s poor corporate governance,” Ackman said in a statement. Allergan said the advisory firms were merely stating that shareholders should have the right to call a special meeting. “These recommendations do not change the fact that Valeant`s offer is grossly inadequate, substantially undervalues Allergan, creates significant risks and uncertainties for Allergan stockholders and is not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders,” Allergan said in a statement. Allergan has been fighting the takeover bid since it was announced on April 22.

288,AGN,Top Fidelity fund managers frowned on Valeant amid Botox bid,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Two of Fidelity Investments’ top stockpickers unloaded most of their holdings in Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc after the drugmaker in April unveiled its bid for Botox maker Allergan Inc in what is one of 2014’s most contentious takeovers. William Danoff, who runs the $106 billion Fidelity Contrafund, a staple in U.S. 401(k) plans, slashed his Valeant position by 83 percent to about 462,000 shares during a two-month period that ended June 30, fund disclosures show. Steven Wymer, who runs the $40 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund, cut his position in Valeant by 58 percent to about 1.2 million shares in the one-month period that ended June 30, fund disclosures show. So far, it looks like a good move, with Valeant shares down 17 percent since the end of April. Still, Valeant has been a darling with U.S. fund managers because its stock has surged 723 percent over the past five years amid its growth-via-acquisition strategy. Valeant did not rank as a top holding for either fund. But the cuts by some of the country’s most successful mutual fund managers reflect concern over Valeant’s prospects, fueled most recently when it cut its earnings outlook for 2014 and 2015. Working with activist hedge fund manager William Ackman, Valeant made an unsolicited $47 billion bid for Allergan on April 22 and sweetened the bid several times since. Allergan steadfastly rebuffed the planned deal now valued at $51 billion. A spokeswoman for Fidelity declined to comment, citing the privately held company’s policy not to discuss individual holdings. Danoff’s Contrafund has one of the best long-term track records among U.S. large-cap equity funds, but its year-to-date total return of 2.9 percent is lagging the 5.1 percent advance of the benchmark S&P; 500 Index, according to Morningstar Inc data. Wymer’s fund, which is closed to new investors, is also a star in the industry, outperforming 92 percent of peers over the past 15 years, according to Morningstar.  Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Lipper Americas Research, said Wymer “also manages to get near the top without subjecting investors to a wild ride as his fund’s price volatility is only slightly more than the average equity fund.”  Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan’s biggest investor, is trying to call for a special shareholder meeting to replace Allergan board members with new directors who might be more amenable to Valeant’s bid.

Allergan, fighting a hostile takeover by Valeant and Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund, filed the lawsuit on Aug. 1.

293,AGN,Exclusive: ValueAct CEO says Valeant does not need to buy Allergan,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - ValueAct Capital, a top shareholder in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N), supports the company’s independent business plan and does not believe the Canadian drugmaker has to buy Allergan Inc (AGN.N), the investor told Reuters on Monday. ValueAct likes a potential combination between Valeant and its takeover target Allergan, but said a drawn-out bidding war for the Botox maker might be too distracting. “A year on the sidelines waiting for (Allergan) to do a scorched-earth sort of defense is a huge cost to Valeant,” ValueAct Chief Executive Jeff Ubben told Reuters in an interview. ValueAct has a stake of roughly 5.7 percent in Valeant, making it the company’s third-largest investor, according to Thomson Reuters data as of early May. “Mike has other targets and other things to do with his low tax rate,” Ubben said, referring to Valeant Chief Executive Mike Pearson. In an emailed statement to Reuters on Monday, a Valeant spokesman said: “We agree that Valeant has very attractive stand-alone prospects.” Although Valeant still believes an Allergan combination would “create extraordinary value for both sets of shareholders,” the spokesman said, Valeant also “has a rich pipeline of other business development opportunities.”  Allergan is fighting a hostile $52 billion bid from Valeant teamed up with billionaire investor William Ackman. The company has accused Valeant and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared a takeover bid for the drugmaker.  “We really believe in the stand-alone plan. We do not need to do the Allergan deal,” Ubben said, adding that he saw Valeant stock rising to $130 to $140 within a year’s time. Shares of Valeant were down 1.5 percent at $107.51 on Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares ended New York trading at around $126 on April 21, just before the takeover bid for Allergan was unveiled. Representatives Allergan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

295,AGN,Ackman says he remains committed to Valeant's bid for Allergan,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman is digging in on getting a hostile takeover bid for Botox maker Allergan Inc. done. As the company’s biggest investor, the hedge fund manager told clients on Wednesday that his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, “will continue to focus on getting a transaction completed and maximizing the value of our investment.” In his most extensive comments in weeks on Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ $48.7 billion hostile bid for Allergan, Ackman suggested he and other Allergan shareholders will be successful in forcing the company to call a special meeting. He hopes to replace the bulk of directors with new board members who will be willing to accept Valeant’s bid, first made April 22. Last week two prominent proxy advisory firms suggested that Allergan shareholders side with Ackman in calling for a special meeting. “Their support is a good leading indicator of the probability of success of our efforts,” Ackman wrote. One quarter of Allergan’s shareholders must call for the meeting and while Pershing Square has been mum on how many others have signed up, people familiar with other shareholders’ thinking suggest more than 25 percent are siding with Ackman. “Based on their scorched-earth attempts to stop or delay the meeting, Allergan’s management and board appear to already know that their shareholders do not support them,” Ackman wrote to clients, including state pension funds and wealthy individuals. His comments follow two days after activist hedge fund manager Jeffrey Ubben, a top Valeant shareholder, told Reuters that a drawn out bidding war for Allergan might be too distracting and the company does not have to buy the Botox maker. That sparked speculation that some Valeant shareholders appear to be urging the company to walk away. Ackman’s committed tone in his letter suggests that he is nowhere near ready to give up on a proposed deal that has already earned his investors a big return after Allergan’s share price jumped in the wake of the announced bid. His largest portfolio has gained 25 percent in 2014, ranking Pershing Square as one of this year’s best performing hedge fund firms. Ackman also addressed insider trading charges that Allergan has leveled at him and Valeant in an August 1 lawsuit, assuring investors “we have been meticulously careful in how we have constructed and implemented this investment and transaction.” Noting that investors sometimes ask for their money back especially when funds are performing very well, Ackman said the firm is pushing ahead with its quest to access more permanent capital by seeking to list its Pershing Square Holdings Ltd fund on an exchange later this year. The firm, which has been making headlines with many of its investments including Herbalife, has also hired its first ever Director of Corporate Communications, Ackman said.

299,AGN,"UPDATE 1-SEC reviewing Valeant, Ackman's hostile Allergan bid","(Adds Pershing Square comments, Allergan no comment) Aug 14 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are looking at the hostile takeover bid made by billionaire investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals for Botox maker Allergan Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regularly reviews planned takeover deals, is asking Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, questions about the deal and the hedge fund is answering them, the person said. Pershing Square, which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, worked with Valeant to put together the takeover deal, which was  first unveiled in April. Allergan is fighting the hostile bid. Valeant has since launched a tender offer for the company’s shares. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Thursday that the SEC was looking into whether the hostile offer by Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws. Pershing Square said in a statement that it had done nothing wrong when it acquired shares of Allergan, made an offer on April 22 that was rejected and then launched a tender offer on June 18. “There is nothing illegal, unethical or improper in taking a toehold position before a merger is proposed, even if it is not wanted by the target’s management. We welcome the SEC’s review of the facts,” Pershing Square said. Earlier this month, Allergan accused Valeant and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared their takeover bid. A Valeant spokeswoman said the company was confident that the trading was completely lawful. The SEC and Allergan declined to comment. Allergan’s insider trading suit is scheduled for a hearing on Aug. 20, at which point the judge in the case could decide on whether to grant an expedited schedule. At the same time, Pershing is in the midst of gathering Allergan shareholder support for a special meeting at which it will seek to replace board members. It needs more than 25 percent of shareholders to do that and has said that it plans to present Allergan with its request for the meeting in mid-August.

301,AGN,RPT-Top hedge funds flocked to Allergan amid bid backed by Ackman,"(Repeats story first published Thursday with no changes) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss BOSTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who often says he is flattered when others follow him into a stock he likes, was joined by several prominent hedge funds that made new bets on takeover target Allergan Inc  during the second quarter. Regulatory filings released on Thursday give the first comprehensive look at Allergan’s redrawn shareholder map since Ackman and deal partner Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc  made public their pursuit of the Botox maker in late April. And while the data, released in so-called 13-F filings, is backward looking and could have changed in the 45 days since the end of the quarter, investors say that it gives at least a strong flavor for what savvy investors are thinking. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan at the time. By the end of June, John Paulson’s Paulson & Co, Jamie Dinan’s York Capital Management and Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global Investors had also bought in, according to the documents released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filings show that several large mutual fund firms that already owned Allergan made even bigger bets during the quarter. T. Rowe Price, for example, more than doubled its position, although it did not say exactly which funds owned the shares. Paulson’s moves have been tracked closely by investors since his winning bet against the overheated U.S. housing market. He has publicly supported Valeant’s bid for Allergan, now worth about $49 billion. But many other shareholders have been silent and it was not clear who else had gotten in or gotten out. In the last weeks, the fight for Allergan has become even more bitter. Proxy advisory firms are urging its shareholders to support Ackman’s call for a special meeting to consider a deal. Yet one of Valeant’s top shareholders, hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management, suggested that Valeant may not be able to afford a drawn-out, damaging fight. Allergan charged in a lawsuit filed earlier this month in California that Pershing Square broke insider trading laws when setting up its partnership with Valeant. Now U.S. securities regulators are asking questions about the planned takeover, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Thursday’s filings show that York Capital Management bought 2.4 million shares of Allergan during the quarter. York also bought put options on Allergan. Eric Mindich’s Eton Park Capital Management said it owned 901,000 shares while Viking Global Investors reported owning 803,369 shares. Viking also raised its bet on Valeant by buying an additional 2.5 million shares. Other new owners include Farallon Capital Management, founded by Tom Steyer and now run by Andrew Spokes, which said it owned 612,500 shares. Hoplite Capital Management also opened a new position and owned 625,850 shares. Sachem Head Capital, run by Scott Ferguson who left Ackman’s firm in 2012 to open his own shop, also bought in, opening a new position with 490,000 shares. Ferguson also opened a new position in Valeant with 419,500 shares. Investors who exited or cut their positions include Capital Research Global Investors, which ranked as Allergan’s second-largest shareholder at the end of the first quarter but sold out its holdings during the second quarter. Hedge fund Jennison Associates cuts its position by more than half, selling 6.2 million shares while Montag & Caldwell sold 1.3 million shares, cutting its stake by 36 percent. The decision to buy in at that time paid off big as Allergan’s stock price surged 38 percent in the second quarter. Since then the share price has come under some pressure. The spread on the deal - or the difference between the value of the two companies’ shares and the ratio implied by the deal’s terms - has widened slightly to about 5.2 percent from less than 3 percent earlier this week after a key Valeant shareholder questioned the deal’s logic. Some investors have said that Allergan’s share price suggests the deal may have less of a chance of getting done now.

303,AGN,Allergan names company veteran Hindman CFO,"Aug 18 (Reuters) - Botox-maker Allergan Inc, which is trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc , said its chief financial officer, Jeff Edwards, was stepping down for family reasons and would be replaced immediately by 30-year company veteran Jim Hindman. Allergan on Monday said Edwards, who has been CFO for nine of his 21 years with the company, had informed it in February of his interest in giving up his post later in 2014 in order to commit more time to his family. He will remain with Allergan in a nonexecutive capacity, as Hindman transitions into the job. Since 2002, Hindman has served as senior vice president of Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations, after serving as controller and in other financial roles with the Irvine, California-based company. Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said in a news release that Hindman had played an especially important leadership role in recent months. But Pyott did not mention Valeant, which on April 22 teamed up with billionaire investor William Ackman to make an unsolicited $47 billion bid for Allergan. After twice boosting their bid, and adjusting for the declining value in recent months of Valeant shares, the bid is now valued at $48 billion.

307,AGN,"DEALTALK-RPT-As hunt for Allergan drags on, some Valeant owners have doubts","(Repeats for wider distribution (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on ) By Caroline Humer and Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK/BOSTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - A few months ago, an innovative partnership between Valeant Pharmaceuticals  and billionaire investor William Ackman to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc looked like a blueprint for success. Now some Valeant shareholders who backed the deal at its start are questioning whether it will become reality. A robust defense from California-based Allergan and Valeant’s own weak second quarter financial performance have pressured Valeant stock, which is down 6 percent this year after doubling in 2013. Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, is digging in and told his own investors he is focused on getting a deal done. Valeant also remains committed. Allergan’s resistance — the company has rejected Valeant’s overtures and instead been looking for a partner while also trying to cut costs — is an unexpected twist for Valeant, whose steady stream of drug industry acquisitions under Chief Executive Michael Pearson drew frequent investor praise. Valeant’s novel strategy to team up with Ackman and his hedge fund, also was lauded. One of Valeant’s top shareholders, ValueAct Capital, called Valeant and Allergan a “perfect match” when the plan was announced in late April. Now the value of Valeant’s cash and stock-based offer has fallen $5 billion to $48 billion. ValueAct is the first large shareholder to have expressed concerns about the deal publicly, telling Reuters last week that Canada-based Valeant doesn’t need to buy Allergan and that it may do better by considering other acquisition targets if the battle drags out. In Reuters interviews since then, five other large Valeant shareholders, most of whom support the deal, said that there were mounting doubts, ranging from concern a transaction wouldn’t happen to worries that the pursuit of Allergan would drag out so long as to undermine the benefits. “The dive in the stock price does make it difficult to pursue Allergan and others,” said Valeant investor Gautam Dhingra, CEO of High Pointe Capital Management, which owned 18,600 shares as of June 30. Dhingra said he still believes in Valeant’s business model of acquiring companies and cutting research & development costs, although people are starting to challenge it. “Until now there has been no flaw in the model, nobody has questioned it,” he said. Another investor at a Canadian investment fund said that six months or a year of pursuing Allergan would not be too long, but that by early next year, he would like the deal to be moving forward. “If the opportunity cost is too much over time, we think there are other things that Valeant can do.” During the second quarter 57 fund firms exited Valeant stock completely and 148 funds cut their positions, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments cut its Valeant holdings by 38 percent while a number of hedge funds including Robert Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management and Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC as well as Adage Capital Management, sold out completely, according to the filings. “The share price had gone up a lot and when things started to look a little more difficult, many investors were not ready to stick around and wait for that little extra percent they might make if and when the deal is consummated,” one shareholder at a New York hedge fund said. Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, said that in April he saw a “transformational deal” between an activist investor and a company that wanted to buy another company. “Now with all of these complications cropping up, I’m not sure anymore,” he said. Still, 81 funds opened new positions and 191 added to their Valeant holdings in the quarter. Steven A. Cohen’s family office Point72 Asset Management, the successor to hedge fund titan SAC Capital Advisors, added a new position as did Eminence Capital and Senator Investment Group, the filings show. Ackman and Valeant both stressed their commitment to completing a deal. The partners are working to gather the support of owners of 25 percent of Allergan stock, the level needed to call a special meeting. Ackman holds 9.7 percent. Proxy advisory firms have suggested investors vote for the meeting, at which Ackman and Valeant want to replace the bulk of Allergan’s directors. They also want Allergan shareholders to vote for opening discussions on a deal. There is no vote on a deal yet, making it premature for proxy firms to issue any opinions. Allergan has been fighting hard to keep Valeant at bay, from suing its pursuer to looking for its own potential acquisitions, which would complicate a Valeant deal. Ackman and Valeant began working together in February. Ackman used a corporate entity, funded by the hedge fund and Valeant, to amass an Allergan stake. Pershing Square in turn booked about $1 billion in profit as Allergan shares shot up on the deal announcement. Allergan said the arrangement between Ackman and Valeant violated insider trading rules and sued. Valeant and Ackman deny those claims, with Ackman calling the lawsuit a tactic to delay a special shareholder meeting. The Securities and Exchange Commission is asking questions about the proposed deal, a source familiar with the matter said last week, and Valeant disclosed earlier this month a new Internal Revenue Service audit of the its U.S. consolidated group for its 2011 and 2012 tax years. A Valeant spokeswoman said that the company remains committed to both the deal and its promises of growth, and that it was confident in the legality of its actions with Ackman. “Valeant also has a rich pipeline of other business development opportunities, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong results and grow in the high single digits,” Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in an emailed statement.

319,AGN,U.S. court denies Allergan bid to speed insider trading suit,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in California on Thursday denied a request by Allergan Inc to expedite its civil suit claiming that Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Pershing Square Capital Management engaged in insider trading ahead of their bid to buy Allergan. Judge David Carter said the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California “would be reluctant to create a precedent that allows corporations to demand at will the immediate attention and input of the federal courts in order to resolve intra-corporate disputes that might be better left to the dynamic free market or to the state court.” Valeant and Pershing Square made an offer for Botox maker Allergan in April, which the company has rejected. Valeant and Pershing Square have since proceeded to a hostile tender offer and are seeking to call a special shareholders meeting. Allergan has fought the takeover attempt and on Aug. 1 filed a civil insider trading lawsuit against the companies, saying that the unusual partnership between them violated securities regulations.  William Ackman, the activist investor who runs Pershing Square, began acquiring a stake in Allergan in February in partnership with Valeant after the two had begun discussing making a bid for the company. He disclosed the nearly 10 percent stake the day before they made the offer. Ackman and Valeant have denied that they broke insider trading laws and have said the suit itself is an attempt to delay the meeting of shareholders. Ackman and Valeant must gather the support of at least 25 percent of shareholders in order to call the meeting for investors to vote on new board members and on Allergan opening merger discussions.  “We are pleased that this attempt by Allergan in the California litigation to delay the special meeting was not successful,” Valeant said in statement on Thursday. Allergan, in a separate statement, said it intends to proceed along the path outlined by the court for a quick resolution once Pershing Square delivers requests for the special meeting.

320,AGN,"Ackman, other shareholders ask Allergan to call special meeting","BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors owning 31 percent of shares of Allergan Inc have asked the company to call a special shareholder meeting, activist shareholder William Ackman said on Friday, giving the hedge fund manager a victory in his fight to acquire the Botox maker. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan’s largest shareholder, said 35 shareholders including some of Allergan’s “longest-standing” and “largest” investors handed in paperwork on Friday to compel Allergan to call the meeting. Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceutical International Inc made a $52 billion hostile offer for Allergan in April. Since then Allergan has been fighting for investor support for its own stand-alone plan that includes cost cuts and making an acquisition of its own. Meanwhile, Ackman has been working to sign up enough shareholders and said that Allergan, under its bylaws, is required now to call the meeting no later than Dec. 20. Pershing Square also said on Friday that it filed a lawsuit in Delaware to require Allergan to schedule the meeting, anticipating that the company would likely fight doing so. Ackman and Valeant’s cash and stock offer is now worth $49 billion.  Allergan said in a press release that it would review the requests from shareholders in connection with Pershing Square’s meeting request and expects to report the results promptly after its review. Allergan also said that Ackman and Valeant’s offer undervalues the company  At the meeting, Ackman hopes to replace the bulk of Allergan board members with his own slate of directors who might agree to the takeover deal and to force Allergan to open discussions. Ackman’s lawsuit is the latest legal tussle for the companies and follows Allergan’s insider trading suit against Valeant and Ackman filed in federal court in California on Aug. 1.  Friday’s move, in which Valeant and Ackman delivered the shareholder paperwork to Allergan’s headquarters in Irvine, California, satisfies Allergan’s bylaws that at least one quarter of its shareholders request the meeting, Ackman said. The hedge fund manager, who called the task of filling out the paperwork “burdensome,” said one shareholder, whose paperwork totals 174 pages, had to deliver 85 signatures. T. Rowe Price Associates, The Vanguard Group, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Institutional Trust Company are the next largest shareholders after Pershing Square.  While some Allergan shareholders have sold holdings since the deal was announced, Ackman said many of the shareholders who back the meeting have owned Allergan stock since before he and Valeant Pharmaceuticals unveiled their takeover deal on April 22. More investors may still fill out the paperwork, he said.  Analysts had expected Ackman to gather more than 25 percent of the votes after two large proxy advisory firms urged investors to join Ackman in calling for the meeting.

323,AGN,"UPDATE 3-Valeant, Ackman get Oct. 6 trial over Allergan special meeting","(Adds Allergan statement) By Tom Hals WILMINGTON, Del., Aug 27 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  and activist investor William Ackman won their request for an expedited trial on Wednesday over the timing of a special meeting of Allergan Inc  shareholders, a key to their $50 billion hostile takeover fight. Delaware Court of Chancery Chancellor Andre Bouchard ordered a three-day trial to begin on Oct. 6. That start date is in line with their request for the court to order Allergan - after the trial ends - to call a special meeting by mid-November. That is about a month earlier than the Dec. 18 date Allergan has said it will hold the meeting at which Ackman and Valeant hope to elect new board members and open discussions on a deal. The court order comes after Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund and Canada’s Valeant sued the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatment on Friday, saying the company did not intend to call a meeting at all. Allergan subsequently set the meeting date. In the lawsuit, Pershing Square, Allergan’s biggest shareholder, alleged that Allergan was trying to avoid a special meeting to give it time to find an alternative deal. In setting the expedited trial date, Bouchard said it was pretty apparent to him that “Allergan may not want a special meeting at all.” Since Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22, Allergan has consistently rejected the offer, saying it undervalues the company. It has also announced a series of cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions as it seeks to persuade shareholders they are better off if it stands alone. Allergan’s lawyer told Bouchard on Wednesday that it needed time to avoid a “bum rush” by Pershing Square and to determine if Pershing Square had violated federal securities laws in obtaining its 9.7 percent stake. Allergan said in a statement that it believes Pershing Square and Valeant are trying to hastily schedule the meeting to facilitate Valeant’s “grossly” inadequate offer and to mask its operating performance. Ackman began accumulating his stake in February when he and Valeant started talking about buying Allergan together. He disclosed his stake on April 21, and the companies announced the offer on April 22, which instantly pushed Allergan shares higher and created $1 billion in paper gains for Ackman. Allergan has sued both Ackman and Valeant for insider trading in federal court in California, saying that aspects of their unusual arrangement violated securities regulations. Valeant shares fell $1.03, or less than 1 percent, to $116.07 and Allergan was down $1.92, or 1.2 percent, at $162.06.

328,AGN,U.S. court revives Botox-linked shareholder suit against Allergan,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a 2010 shareholder lawsuit against Allergan Inc over allegations the company improperly marketed and labeled the cosmetic drug Botox. The ruling, from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, said plaintiff shareholders had alleged enough specific facts to proceed.  Allergan, which paid a $375 million criminal fine after being accused of marketing Botox for off-label uses, said the allegations in the shareholder derivative lawsuit have not been proved and the company is confident it will be vindicated. The lawsuit, filed in 2010, alleged that Allergan’s board authorized plans to promote Botox for off-label conditions like headaches and migraines despite knowing the limits of federal drug marketing rules.   A lower court judge in Santa Ana, California dismissed it, saying the shareholders had not followed proper procedure by first requesting that Allergan’s board file legal claims in the company’s own name. The 9th Circuit on Tuesday disagreed, saying the shareholders alleged enough specifics to raise doubts as to whether the board faces liability, and as a result do not have to approach the board before heading to court. The case in the 9th Circuit is Rosenbloom vs. Pyott, 12-55516.

In a letter sent to Allergan’s nine directors, Ackman said “your actions have wasted corporate resources, delayed enormous potential value creation for shareholders, and are professionally and personally embarrassing for you.” “The smell of strong brew is in the air, now is the time to wake up,” he wrote in the letter which was released in a regulatory filing. It has been five months since Ackman, whose $15 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund is Allergan’s largest investor, announced he is working with rival drug maker Valeant which wants to buy Allergan. Despite sweetened terms from Valeant, Allergan has steadfastly refused to sell itself to its rival, sued the company and Ackman, and has tried to line up another potential partner.

336,AGN,Allergan investors owning 35 percent to demand special meeting: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire William Ackman has signed up Allergan (AGN.N) investors who combined own at least 35 percent of the company to call a special shareholder meeting, according to people familiar with the matter, giving the hedge fund manager a victory in his fight to acquire the Botox maker. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake, has teamed up with Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) to pursue a hostile takeover bid for Allergan. Ackman and other Allergan shareholders who own a combined 31 percent already asked the company last month to call a special meeting, at which he and Valeant hope to elect new board members and open discussions on a deal.  But crossing the 35 percent mark would mark an important step because Allergan is trying to prevent Ackman from voting his nearly 10 percent stake, alleging that the investor improperly built up his holding as he prepared to make a bid with Valeant. Even in the unlikely event Ackman’s votes are not counted, having 35 percent of investor consent would satisfy Allergan’s by-laws that at least one quarter of its shareholders request a special meeting. Pershing Square expects to deliver requests from additional shareholders for a special meeting as soon as Thursday, putting the number at 35 percent, one of the people added. All the people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Pershing Square declined to comment and Valeant could not be immediately reached for comment. Since Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22, Allergan has consistently rejected the offer, saying it undervalues the company. It has also announced a series of cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions as it seeks to persuade shareholders they are better off if it stands alone. Allergan set a Dec. 18 date for a special meeting following shareholder requests but Ackman wants to expedite it to mid-November, saying that Allergan is trying to give itself time to find an alternative deal. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott has said that he is looking at the potential of making a big acquisition, making the company a subject of frenzied merger speculation in recent weeks involving several companies including Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ.O). But Allergan has also said that it would give shareholders a fair chance to weigh Valeant and Pershing’s takeover proposal.  “While Allergan does not believe that Valeant’s offer provides compelling value relative to the alternatives available to the company, the board fully supports the right of stockholders to vote on the value proposition offered by Valeant at the appropriate time,” Allergan said on Aug. 22. Ackman began accumulating his stake in February when he and Valeant started talking about buying Allergan together. He disclosed his stake on April 21, and the companies announced the offer on April 22, which instantly pushed Allergan shares higher and created $1 billion in paper gains for Ackman. Allergan has sued both Ackman and Valeant for insider trading in federal court in California, saying that aspects of their unusual arrangement violated securities regulations. The two deny the allegations. As part of the insider trading suit, Allergan is seeking a preliminary injunction to disqualify Ackman’s stake from counting toward the 25 percent needed to call a special meeting of shareholders, as well as the 50 percent needed to replace the board at the special meeting. Ackman is seeking to oust the majority of Allergan’s board and change the company’s by-laws in order to pave the way for a takeover by Valeant and Pershing Square. A judge declined to expedite Allergan’s insider trading case against Valeant, which may have delayed the special meeting.

339,AGN,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Allergan investors owning 35 pct to demand special meeting,"(Corrects first paragraph to show that investors owning more than 35 pct of shares, not more than 35 percent of investors, called for meeting) By Soyoung Kim, Olivia Oran and Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Investors owning more than 35 percent of Allergan shares have asked the company to call a special meeting, handing a victory to billionaire investor William Ackman who is trying to broker a sale of the Botox maker to Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Ackman’s $15 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management on Thursday delivered requests from shareholders owning 1.5 percent of the stock to the company, the company said in a statement. Reuters reported earlier that Pershing Square, Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake, had secured enough additional support from shareholders to pass the critical 35 percent mark and that the requests would be delivered to Allergan’s headquarters in Irvine, California on Thursday. “Allergan will review these requests in addition to the requests from stockholders owning 2.8 percent of Allergan’s shares that were delivered on September 3, 2014,” the company said in a statement. The first batch of requests totaling 31 percent of the shareholders were handed over on August 22 and Allergan last month set December 18 as the special meeting date. Pershing Square has been working with Canada’s Valeant to pursue a hostile takeover bid for Allergan, but the Botox maker has refused and has instead tried to line up another partner. To force the company to the table, Ackman has been pushing for a special meeting where he hopes to replace most company directors with his own nominees who he expects will be more receptive to Valeant’s bid.. Allergan on Thursday brushed aside the development and said while Valeant and Pershing Square are trying to “change the subject,” it is trying to deliver a compounded annual growth rate of more than 20 percent EPS growth. Crossing the 35 percent mark however signals an important step because Allergan is suing to prevent Pershing Square from voting its nearly 10 percent stake, alleging that the firm improperly built the holding as Ackman was hammering out a takeover bid with Valeant. Even in the unlikely event Ackman’s votes are not counted, having 35 percent of investor consent would satisfy Allergan’s by-laws that at least one quarter of its shareholders request a special meeting. “The delivery of additional requests for the Special Meeting by Pershing Square is not a meaningful development” because the meeting date is already set, Allergan said in the statement. Pershing Square could not be reached for comment and Valeant was also not immediately available to comment. Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22 but Allergan has said the offer undervalues the company. Since then Allergan announced cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions as it seeks to persuade shareholders they are better off if it stands alone. Ackman wants to move the meeting date to mid-November, saying that Allergan is trying to give itself time to find an alternative deal.

But Allergan has also said that it would give shareholders a fair chance to weigh Valeant and Pershing’s takeover proposal. Since Valeant announced its plans, Allergan’s share price has climbed, creating $1 billion in paper gains for Pershing Square, one of this year’s best performing hedge funds.

340,AGN,Allergan reaches truce with suitors on special shareholder meeting,"(Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) has agreed not to throw up any roadblocks to a special shareholder meeting on Dec. 18, giving Pershing Square Capital Management a chance to attempt its threatened replacement of Allergan board members. The battling parties late on Monday settled their pending litigation before the Delaware Court of Chancery and agreed to a special shareholder meeting on the originally scheduled date.  Billionaire William Ackman’s Pershing Square and Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl (VRX.TO), which are attempting a $52 billion takeover of Allergan, sued the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatment last month, alleging that Allergan was trying to avoid a special meeting to give it time to find an alternative deal. Although Allergan subsequently set the meeting for Dec. 18, Ackman and Valeant had been concerned that Allergan’s strict corporate rules might be invoked in the meantime to stall the meeting.  Allergan will not try to invalidate any special meeting requests or postpone or cancel the meeting, Pershing Square said early Tuesday.  The settlement, by easing Allergan’s corporate rules, means the meeting is now certain. Even so, Stifel, Nicolaus analyst Annabel Samimy said the dynamics of the ongoing takeover battle have not appreciably changed. “Allergan was always going to allow the meeting, and they scheduled it,” Samimy said. Allergan’s overriding challenge now is to convince its shareholders in coming months that it offers greater value to them as a stand-alone company, she said. Allergan’s biggest potential weapon, she said, would be to make a sizable acquisition that would boost its earnings potential and make the company less affordable to Ackman and Valeant. “The heat is on for them do a deal.” Pershing Square, Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.72 percent stake, and Valeant made a hostile offer for Allergan in April. Since then, Allergan has been fighting for investor support for its own stand-alone plan that includes cost cuts and making an acquisition of its own.  To force the company to the table, Ackman has been pushing for a special meeting where he hopes to replace most board members with his own nominees, who he expects will be more receptive to Valeant’s bid. Allergan said late Monday it continues to believe that Valeant’s unsolicited exchange offer is “grossly inadequate” and urged shareholders to reject the offer.  Allergan’s shareholders of record Oct. 30 will be entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Dec. 18 meeting. Allergan is continuing to pursue separate litigation in California, however, aimed at preventing Ackman from voting his Allergan shares at the special meeting. In August, Allergan filed a civil lawsuit in California, accusing Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared a takeover bid for the drug company.  “Valeant and Pershing Square believe that Allergan’s claims and request for relief in the California litigation are entirely without merit and will ultimately be rejected,” Pershing Square said in a statement.

The exact status of the discussions between the two drugmakers could not be immediately established. Spokesmen for Allergan and Salix declined to comment.  Botox maker Allergan is trying to seal a deal with Salix in order to fend off a $53 billion hostile offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO). Salix said in July it would merge with an Irish subsidiary of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA (COPN.S) in a so-called tax inversion.  Top Salix shareholders do not like the deal with Cosmo and are likely to vote it down, Reuters reported last week, putting pressure on the company to consider a takeover offer instead.  A deal with Raleigh, North Carolina-based Salix, which makes drugs for gastrointestinal disorders, could also complicate Valeant’s bid for Allergan. Allergan agreed last week to reach a settlement with Pershing Square Capital Management, in which the company would hold a special meeting on Dec. 18. Pershing Square and Valeant might try to remove Allergan board members during the meeting.  Pershing Square, Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.72 percent stake, and Valeant made a hostile offer for Allergan in April.

346,AGN,COLUMN-Allergan ordered to show 'business strategy' docs: Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) By Alison Frankel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan’s attempt to ward off a precedent-setting joint bid by the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant and the hedge fund Pershing Square continues to remake the rulebook for hostile takeovers. On Monday, U.S. District Judge David Carter of Santa Ana, Calif., ordered Allergan to turn over to lawyers for Valeant and Pershing the complete records of recent board meetings and other strategic documents despite Allergan’s arguments that the documents would expose its plans for fending off the hostile bidders. The ruling came in Allergan’s suit accusing Pershing of acquiring its shares based on insider information about Valeant’s plan to acquire Allergan. Allergan is seeking to enjoin Pershing from voting its nearly 10 percent stake at a special meeting of Allergan shareholders scheduled to take place on Dec. 18. The company’s lawyers at Latham & Watkins had argued that Allergan is entitled to shield sensitive information under a “business strategy privilege” that dates back to takeover defense litigation from the 1980s and 1990s. “This case is about one question: whether defendants violated federal insider trading and disclosure laws in connection with Valeant’s proposed hostile attempt to take over Allergan,” Allergan wrote in a brief. “Defendants nevertheless seek to compel Allergan to produce some of the most competitively sensitive information in its possession - information that has nothing to do with those claims and that if disclosed to defendants (one of whom is Allergan’s direct competitor), would substantially harm Allergan and its stockholders by impairing Allergan’s ability to attract strategic transaction partners and negotiate effectively with them.” Pershing and Valeant (represented by Kirkland & Ellis and Sullivan & Cromwell) said Allergan had concocted the supposed “privilege” by misreading Delaware Chancery and federal court precedent. At most, the bidders said, targets of unsolicited bids are entitled to request a limited protective order to shield information related to their takeover defense. Allergan’s large-scale redactions, according to Valeant and Pershing, far exceeded what’s permissible. “It also appears that Allergan has redacted references to its plan to contact its large shareholders and attack defendants as improperly trading in Allergan’s stock and engaging in improper activity,” they said in a brief filed Saturday. “Allergan’s disclosures to its own shareholders of the exact information it claims defendants should disclose would directly undercut Allergan’s claim that it should be provided an injunction to remedy the supposed lack of disclosure to these shareholders.” Judge Carter agreed with Pershing and Valeant that shielding business strategy documents is not a privilege like the attorney client and work product privileges, but a qualified right. Takeover targets have to show they’re only redacting evidence that would “reveal strategies for retaining or obtaining corporate control during a live corporate takeover situation.” In this case, he said, Allergan hadn’t shown that its redaction of dozens of pages of documents, without any explanation of what the redactions cloak, is justified under the qualified business strategy doctrine. He ordered Allergan to turn over unredacted versions of all of the documents to Valeant and Pershing, subject to a previously approved confidentiality agreement that protects their public release. Lawyers for both sides declined to provide a statement to me, but Allergan will probably try to stay the order. It has already said that the redactions aren’t relevant to its insider trading allegations against Pershing, but it’s a good bet that when Judge Carter holds a hearing on Allergan’s motion for a preliminary injunction on Oct. 28, Pershing and Valeant will have something to say about Allergan’s own tactics.

350,AGN,Ackman threatens to sue Allergan again over potential Salix deal,"(Reuters) - Billionaire William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management said on Tuesday that it would sue botox-maker Allergan Inc if the company went ahead with a deal to buy drugmaker Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Allergan is trying to seal a deal with Salix in order to stay independent and fend off a $53 billion hostile offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc. Valeant’s offer is backed by Pershing Square — Allergan’s largest shareholder with a 9.72 percent stake. In a letter to Allergan’s board on Tuesday, Ackman said Pershing Square would sue the company for breach of fiduciary duty if it resumed attempts to buy Salix without a shareholder vote. The activist-investor has also called Allergan’s attempts at acquisitions “desperate”.  Allergan said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that its board still believes that Valeant’s bid is “grossly inadequate and substantially undervalues” the company. Reuters reported on Monday that Allergan had resumed talks to buy Salix.  Allergan’s shares were up 2.5 percent at $170.20 in early trade on the Nasdaq, while Salix’s shares were up about 5 percent at $167.45. Valeant’s U.S.-listed shares were down 0.3 percent at $116.68. Pershing Square sued Allergan in August, alleging that the drugmaker was delaying a special meeting of shareholders to discuss the Valeant offer in order to buy time to find a target of its own. The two sides settled that lawsuit last week and agreed to a special shareholder meeting on Dec. 18.  Pershing Square and Valeant might try to remove Allergan board members during the meeting. Salix is itself in the process of merging with an Irish unit of Switzerland-based Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA in a tax-inversion deal. The company’s top shareholders, however, are threatening to vote against the deal with Cosmo, putting pressure on Salix to consider selling itself instead, Reuters reported last week.  Salix’s potential deal with Cosmo could be further complicated by the Obama administration’s announcement on Monday of new rules to curb “inversion” deals that allow companies to escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad.

354,AGN,"US STOCKS-Wall St to open down after U.S. strikes in Syria, inversion moves","* Futures off: Dow 52 pts, S&P; 5.25 pts, Nasdaq 10 pts By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set for a lower open on Tuesday, putting the S&P; on pace for a third straight fall, as conflict in the Middle East intensified and after the U.S. Treasury moved to curb “tax inversion” deals. The United States and Arab allies bombed Syria for the first time on Tuesday, killing dozens of Islamic State fighters and members of a separate al Qaeda-linked group, pursuing a campaign against militants into a war at the heart of the Middle East. Shares of AbbVie were down 4.9 percent at $55.85 in premarket trading after the Obama administration took several actions late Monday that will reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have done inversion deals, while also making new inversions more difficult and potentially less rewarding. AbbVie has agreed to a deal to acquire Shire, which fell 4 percent $246.05. “The market has been looking for an incontrovertible reason to sell-off, to reset before earnings season and we are getting plenty of that,” said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist of Clearpool Group in New York. “In and of themselves, each one of the themes that is driving fear into the market is manageable, combined and as a collective they force the market to move lower.” S&P; 500 e-mini futures were falling 5.25 points and fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, indicated a lower open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures fell 52 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures lost 10 points. Data due on Tuesday includes the flash September reading on manufacturing from financial data firm Markit at 9:45 a.m. (1345 GMT). Expectations call for a reading in the main purchasing managers’ index of 58 versus the final 57.9 in August. Salix Pharmaceuticals was trading up 7 percent at $171.06 in the premarket after a person familiar with the matter said on Monday that Allergan Inc had revived discussions to buy the company. Norway’s Yara and Chicago-based CF Industries  are in talks about a merger of equals that could create a $27 billion global fertilizer producer, rivaling Canada’s Potash Corp in size in a fragmented and oversupplied market. Shares in CF Industries were trading up 5 percent to $268.50 in premarket.

356,AGN,Valeant CEO expects quarterly profit to exceed forecast,"(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO)(VRX.N) expects third-quarter revenue to beat analyst expectations and adjusted earnings per share to surpass the company’s forecast, its CEO said on Wednesday, seeking to bolster a hostile takeover bid for Allergan Inc (AGN.N). Valeant will also beat guidance for third-quarter organic growth, restructuring charges and adjusted cash flow from operations, Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson wrote in a letter to Allergan CEO David Pyott and lead independent director Michael Gallagher. Shares of both companies jumped. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant has offered $51 billion in stock and cash for Allergan, the California-based maker of Botox anti-wrinkle injections. Valeant’s third-quarter results, due Oct. 20, are seen as pivotal to its efforts with activist investor Bill Ackman to remove most Allergan directors in a special shareholder meeting scheduled for Dec. 18. Some have criticized Valeant for modest organic growth, a metric that excludes acquisitions. But Pearson said he expects to show double-digit growth across most of Valeant’s businesses and gains in market share. The improved guidance reflects, in part, new product launches such as Jublia, a treatment for a nail infection, said Tim Chiang, analyst at CRT Capital Group. “I actually thing Valeant’s business is going to improve in the second half of the year, and they’re highlighting that,” Chiang said. “I think Valeant has a shot at acquiring Allergan. A lot of it is going to come down to the special meeting.” Pearson did not offer further details on expected third-quarter revenue and adjusted profit, which Valeant calls cash earnings per share.  Valeant had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.90 to $2.00 per share for the third quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.97 per share and revenue of $2.045 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Pearson said he was disappointed that Allergan continued to attack Valeant’s business “without any basis” in correspondence between the companies on Monday after he requested a meeting.  On Monday, Pyott and Gallagher responded that Allergan is concerned about the sustainability of Valeant’s business model, which is built mostly around acquisitions, and that its financial disclosures are “opaque.”  Valeant’s third-quarter results are expected to make the company’s performance clearer, since there is unlikely to be the usual number of restructuring and other one-time charges connected with acquisitions to obscure the bottom line. Valeant has slowed its pace of acquisitions while it pursues Allergan. Valeant stock jumped nearly 5 percent in Toronto and New York in morning trading. Allergan’s U.S.-listed shares rose 2.5 percent. ",9242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-valeant-pharms-outlook/valeant-ceo-expects-quarterly-profit-to-exceed-forecast-idUSKCN0HJ1HE20140924

Valeant shares rose more than 3 percent.

368,AGN,"UPDATE 2-ValueAct returns to Valeant board, plans to raise stake","(Adds Breakingviews link) By Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot Sept 25 (Reuters) - Hedge fund ValueAct Capital said on Thursday it would return to the board of directors of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which is pursuing a hostile takeover offer for Allergan Inc, and that it planned to increase its stake in the company. Valeant shares rose more than 3 percent. ValueAct Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Ubben said in a statement that once he is on the board, he would work with Valeant on its $53 billion acquisition of Allergan, a deal whose certainty he has previously questioned. Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, made a bid in April for the Botox maker. Allergan has consistently rejected the offer and questioned the company’s business methods, saying it relies too much on acquisitions for growth and cuts research and development too deeply. ValueAct, which owned 5.7 percent of Valeant as of June 30, had a seat on the company’s board until May, when its representative, Mason Morfit, stepped down to devote time to the fund’s largest holding, Microsoft Corp. “They’re basically saying: ‘We’re back on the board and looking to increase our position,’” said analyst Umer Raffat of investment research firm ISI Group. “I think both those things are going to be perceived very positively by people who have questioned Valeant’s business model.” Ubben in August expressed some concerns about the hostile bid for Allergan, telling Reuters that while he still liked the it, a drawn-out battle to control the company would come at too high of a cost for Valeant if it lost other opportunities. Other investors had also said that they wanted to see more signs that the legal battles Allergan had mounted would not delay the deal well into 2015. Since then, Allergan and Valeant settled one of the lawsuits, although another insider trading case in federal court in California has continued. Allergan also agreed to set a Dec. 18 date for a shareholders meeting. Pershing Square, led by activist investor William Ackman, has asked for the meeting as part of a group of investors representing 35 percent of the company’s shares and is seeking to name new board members at Allergan. Shares of Valeant, which is ValueAct’s second largest-holding, were up 3.2 percent at $127.93 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. Allergan dipped 0.4 percent to $175.61.

369,AGN,Shareholder T. Rowe Price urges Allergan to hold off on deals,"(Reuters) - T. Rowe Price, the second largest shareholder in Allergan Inc (AGN.N), said on Friday that it wants the company to hold off on making major moves before a Dec. 18 special shareholder meeting, and criticized the board on its corporate governance. The Baltimore-based investment firm is the second Allergan shareholder in two days to criticize the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle injections, which is trying to fend off a hostile, $53.7-billion takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO).  The special meeting was requested by shareholders led by activist Bill Ackman for a vote on replacing most of California-based Allergan’s directors. A revamped board might then hold talks with Valeant about its stock and cash offer, which has been championed by Ackman. Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan’s largest shareholder. T. Rowe Price has for several months watched the Allergan board’s corporate governance practices with “growing concern,” said spokesman Bill Benintende in a statement. “The issues to be voted on at the special meeting of shareholders on Dec. 18 are of such importance that they impose a special duty on the board to refrain from approving any significant, irreversible commitments by the company between now and then unless shareholders are offered the opportunity to vote on them,” Benintende said. “We believe this should apply even in the event of all-cash acquisitions that do not ordinarily require a shareholder vote.” Allergan recently revived discussions to buy Salix   Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O in order to fend off Valeant.  An Allergan spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement the company appreciated the perspectives of its shareholders and the board had a long track record of acting in the best interests of its investors. “We recognize that what matters is value, and Allergan’s board remains confident in the company’s ability to deliver significantly more value than Valeant’s grossly inadequate offer,” the statement said. T. Rowe Price owned a 5.4 percent stake in Allergan and 4.6 percent of Laval, Quebec-based Valeant as of June 30. On Thursday, Pentwater Capital Management criticized Allergan for refusing to talk with Valeant or Actavis PLC ACT.N, another company that has approached Allergan.

372,AGN,UPDATE 1-Salix's constipation drug gets approval for expanded use,"(Adds detail, analyst comment, shares) By Natalie Grover Sept 29 (Reuters) - Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an expanded use of its constipation treatment. The injection, Relistor, has now been approved for use in patients on opioids for chronic pain unrelated to cancer, the company said on Monday. Relistor was first approved in 2008 to treat opioid-induced constipation in severely ill patients who did not respond to laxatives. It will compete with Nektar Therapeutics and AstraZeneca Plc’s  oral drug Movantik, approved by the FDA earlier this month for the same patient population. Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc, which licensed the worldwide rights to Relistor to Salix in 2011, stands to earn $40 million following the approval. An expanded use for Relistor raises the addressable patient population to 11 million from 1 million, with potential peak sales rising to more than $300 million from about $137 million, Salix Chief Executive Carolyn Logan said on the company’s latest post-earnings conference call in August. The subcutaneous injection generated about $9 million in sales in the second quarter and will likely face tough competition from oral formulations. With the additional indication, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Irina Koffler modeled $86.4 million in 2020 sales for Relistor. “We are more conservative than management because we assume fewer patients may utilize injectables, especially if oral Relistor launches during this time,” Koffler said. Salix, which said it will merge with Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA’s Irish subsidiary, is in talks with Allergan Inc  and Actavis Plc about a potential sale, sources have told Reuters in recent weeks. Relistor belongs to a class of drugs that fight the effects of opioid painkillers on the gut without reducing centrally mediated pain relief. These drugs, called peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORA), have been linked with cardiovascular risk in the past. The FDA in 2012 had sought additional cardiovascular outcome trial data when it rejected Salix’s initial attempt to expand Relistor’s label. However, an FDA panel recommendation that large cardiovascular safety trials were not needed prior to the approval of PAMORA drugs brightened the prospects of both Relistor and Movantik. Salix and Progenics are working to chart a path to approval for an oral version of the drug. Once approved, the oral formulation could expand the sales potential of Relistor to about $1.3 billion, CEO Logan had said. Koffler said an oral version of Relistor would eventually win approval but expects just $344 million in peak sales in 2023. Salix shares were largely unchanged after closing at $155.78 on the Nasdaq on Monday. Progenics’ stock rose 2.4 percent in extended trading after closing at $5.25.

376,AGN,"Exclusive: ISS urges Allergan to give investors vote, questions credibility","BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent investor shareholder advisory firm ISS called on Allergan Inc to give its shareholders a chance to vote on any large, buyout-blocking acquisitions and said the company’s board faced a credibility problem, according to a report seen by Reuters. The ISS report comes as Allergan’s largest shareholder, hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, is urging the Botox maker to sell itself to rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. ISS’ pronouncements are watched by institutional investors including prominent mutual funds. This report could turn up the heat in the bitter fight over Allergan’s future, industry analysts and investors said. Allergan has repeatedly rebuffed Valeant’s buyout proposals. Instead, Allergan is seeking to buy Salix Pharmaceuticals for cash, a deal would not require a shareholder vote, people familiar with the matter have said. A cash acquisition of Salix, which has a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion, would make Allergan too big and expensive for Valeant or another buyer, effectively defending the company from an unwanted takeover. “To point out that the board has authority to approve an all-cash acquisition without shareholder approval is to point out the irrelevant: the question is not what the board can do, but what the board should do,” ISS said in a report sent to clients on Wednesday. ISS said it is unusual for large shareholders to express concerns about a board’s stewardship so publicly. Industry analysts and investors said the ISS report itself, which does not make any specific recommendation, is also unusual. “The board’s public response to this highly unusual airing of concern from its major shareholders has been only to reiterate generically its ‘focus’ on ‘enhancing stockholder value’ with nary a word addressing the more crucial question raised by each of those major shareholders,” ISS said. Investors owning more than 35 percent of Allergan shares have asked the company to call a special meeting, hoping to replace most of its directors with people receptive to Valeant’s bid. Allergan set a special meeting for Dec. 18. “When more than a third of outstanding shares consent to call a special meeting ... there’s credible reason to believe that the board should give shareholders a real and binding choice between the buyout offer and the new strategic plan assembled in response,” ISS said. On Friday, No. 2 shareholder T.Rowe Price urged Allergan to hold off on major acquisitions before the Dec. 18 meeting. T.Rowe also criticized the board, adding its voice to other Allergan shareholders including Pershing Square, Jackson Square Partners and Pentwater Capital Management, who combined own nearly a fifth of outstanding shares. They say hastily striking a large acquisition would thwart takeover offers for Allergan. These investors make a “credible argument that the board should give shareholders a deciding vote on any large, buyout-blocking acquisitions,” ISS said, adding that the board should not take unilateral action that would drive away potential bidders. Billionaire investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square has been working with Valeant for months on a plan to buy Allergan.

378,AGN,COLUMN-Allergan's latest tactic to fend off Pershing: Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) By Alison Frankel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is there any Allergan shareholder who isn’t aware that William Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital, and the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant slipped through a loophole in the securities laws when they teamed up on a hostile bid for the Botox maker? Or that Allergan believes the loophole is actually a violation of the law and Pershing is engaged in insider trading? If so, I’d like to know the name of the remote Pacific atoll where you’ve apparently been luxuriating without the Internet, newspapers and television for the past few months. This cleverly lawyered deal has been chronicled (including by me) with the sort of play-by-play analysis that’s usually reserved for NFL playoff games or middle-school romances. Yet according to Allergan’s new bid for a preliminary injunction, filed Monday night in federal court in Santa Ana, California, Allergan shareholders have been operating at a critical disadvantage: They haven’t fully understood the risk that Pershing and Valeant were breaking the law. Allergan’s lawyers at Latham & Watkins and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz argue not only that Pershing shouldn’t be permitted to vote its nearly 10 percent stake when Allergan shareholders convene on Dec. 18 to consider the ouster of six Allergan board members, but also that Pershing should also be enjoined from voting the proxies it collects in the formal proxy fight the hedge fund launched on Sept. 29. Shareholders, according to Allergan, can’t make a well-reasoned decision about replacing directors until Pershing discloses its supposed insider trading. “A preliminary injunction against voting proxies until supplemental disclosures have been made is the only means of avoiding an uninformed shareholder vote,” Allergan said in the brief filed Monday. This is an interesting new tactic by Allergan. Some of the company’s large shareholders have emerged publicly in the past couple of weeks to question the board’s response to the Valeant takeover threat. Those statements doesn’t necessarily mean that they or any other shareholders have tendered (or plan to tender) proxies to Pershing, although it’s also worth pointing out that more than 30 percent of Allergan’s shareholders joined Pershing’s demand that the Allergan board convene a special meeting to vote on replacing directors. With this new injunction motion, Allergan is trying to neutralize whatever outside support Pershing has already amassed. ‘NO SUCH THING AS CO-BIDDERS’ U.S. District Judge David Carter is holding a hearing on the Allergan injunction at the end of October. If Allergan obtains the injunction it’s asking for, Pershing will have only six or seven weeks to relaunch its proxy campaign - with “corrective disclosures” about its alleged insider trading - in advance of the special shareholder meeting. And meanwhile, Allergan’s own proxy statement went out Tuesday. Will Allergan win the preliminary injunctions it wants? You probably wouldn’t change your bet on the answer to that question based on the public version of the company’s new brief. The fact section of the brief is heavily redacted, so it’s impossible to know whether Allergan has uncovered new evidence to back its contention that Pershing is an inside trader, not a joint bidder. The unredacted facts, Allergan alleges, aren’t anything anyone hasn’t already heard. The company has refined its legal arguments, though. You’ll recall that Allergan’s accusations of insider trading stem from the Williams Act, which prohibits anyone except an acquirer from trading on material non-public knowledge that the acquirer has taken “a substantial step” toward launching a tender offer. Pershing and Valeant said they’d worked around both prongs of the prohibition by making a joint offer for Allergan and by acquiring shares of Allergan before beginning to plan a tender offer. Allergan’s new brief argues that for the purposes of insider trading, there is no such thing as co-bidders. The only reference to co-bidders in the securities laws, according to Allergan, is in disclosure provisions intended to prevent two or more buyers from secretly working together to amass a stake in a public company. The insider trading provisions, by contrast, hold that only an “offering person” - in the singular - is permitted to buy shares in advance of a tender offer. According to Allergan, there’s no room in the statutory language or the legislative history of the insider trading provision for more than one acquirer. Pershing, it says, is more like the financier of Valeant’s bid than a co-bidder - and bankers aren’t permitted to trade based on inside information. “If one of the banks that is financing Valeant’s hostile bid had, at Valeant’s urging, purchased a substantial block of Allergan’s shares in the weeks before the bid was announced and agreed to accept the inevitable post-announcement stock price appreciation in lieu of standard financing fees,” Allergan said, “there would be no question that Valeant and the bank had engaged in insider trading. This case is no different.” Allergan also argues that as soon as Valeant began plotting a hostile bid for Allergan, hiring lawyers and consultants and discussing financing with Pershing, it was taking “substantial steps” toward about a tender offer. Enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Allergan said, have established a quick trigger for the ban on trading in advance of a tender offer. According to Allergan, the prohibition was activated before Pershing bought a single share of the company. FOREVER CHANGE OWNERSHIP? Mostly, Allergan is arguing that if Judge Carter doesn’t stop Valeant and Pershing, the loophole they exploited will expand until it swallows the law that’s supposed to prevent insiders from trading in advance of a hostile tender offer. “Valeant and Pershing Square have invented a hostile takeover plan that, if found lawful, would forever change the way public companies are owned and acquired in the United States, at the expense of ordinary stockholders,” the brief says. Interestingly, Allergan also says that its own ordinary stockholders have fled in droves since the Valeant takeover fight began. Allergan loyalists who don’t want to get stuck with Valeant shares - Valeant’s offer for Allergan is part cash, part stock - have, according to Allergan’s brief, sold off their shares to speculators betting that Allergan’s stock price will be driven up by Valeant’s offer. The injunction Allergan is seeking would protect these Allergan-described arbitrageurs from tendering their shares without knowing enough about Pershing’s allegedly illegal trades. Now you might think that opportunists sufficiently savvy to buy Allergan shares in order to capitalize on Valeant’s Pershing-backed bid would be just the kind of investors who would already have factored in the risk that Pershing has violated insider trading laws, considering that Allergan first made those accusations two months ago. But Allergan seems to think that even arbitrageurs need its help. I guess the idea is that there’s a difference between its accusations and a judge’s findings. And, of course, there are those Pacific atoll shareholders to think about. Pershing and Valeant, represented by Kirkland & Ellis and Sullivan & Cromell, respectively, will respond to Allergan’s brief next week. The preliminary injunction hearing is set for Oct. 28.

379,AGN,Exclusive: Actavis plans new merger approach for Allergan - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Actavis Plc ACT.N plans to approach Allergan Inc (AGN.N) again about a potential merger, as the Botox maker warms up to the possibility of a sale, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Allergan, which has repeatedly rejected offers from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), would consider a takeover proposal that values the company at above $200 per share, some of these people said. Actavis, which held informal conversations with Allergan in recent months about a possible combination, would like to take a hard look at buying the company and could reach out to its management team as soon as this week to reiterate its interest, one of the sources said. There has been no formal engagement between the two companies yet, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Separately, Valeant and its partner William Ackman are planning to boost their offer for Valeant by $15 per share to about $191 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter. Allergan, while fighting off Valeant’s advances, did not reach out to other alternative buyers and instead focused on identifying opportunities for revenue growth and cost cuts internally. But it is aware of competing interest from other drugmakers, particularly from Actavis, the sources said. The emergence of Actavis as a serious rival suitor adds another twist to the months-long takeover battle between Valeant and Allergan. The Canadian drugmaker’s bid already has attracted controversy because it is backed by activist investor Ackman, leading to a legal challenge from Allergan which has accused the two parties of insider trading. Shares of Allergan ended 1.7 percent higher at $186.20 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising more than 3 percent on the news, valuing the company at more than $55 billion. Actavis closed at $243.39 for a market capitalization of roughly $64 billion. Shares of Valeant fell 2.5 percent, putting the value of its existing cash and stock offer for Allergan at $175.94 per share, or $52.8 billion based on shares outstanding. Analysts have an average price target of around $200 per share for Allergan, with the price ranging from $174 to $240 per share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll of 16 analysts. Representatives for Allergan and Actavis declined to comment. Actavis’ continued pursuit of Allergan comes as the takeover target faces a Dec. 18 special shareholder meeting, at which top Allergan investor Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management hopes to replace a majority of the company’s board. Pershing Square has teamed up with Valeant to pursue a takeover of Allergan, and is hoping to install new board members who could be more receptive to a takeover by the Canadian drugmaker. Actavis, which regularly reviews potential acquisitions, considers Allergan as the best opportunity currently and is hoping to engage in friendly discussions, the sources said. Industry executives have said Actavis would be a better cultural fit for Allergan because the companies’ respective chief executives, Brent Saunders and David Pyott, believe in focusing on research and development, while Valeant CEO Mike Pearson is known for cost cutting. A large part of Allergan’s business is ophthalmology, an area that Saunders is familiar with after serving as CEO of Bausch & Lomb. Valeant acquired Bausch & Lomb last year. Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22 but Allergan has said the offer undervalued the company. Since then Allergan has announced cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions while trying to persuade shareholders they were better off remaining independent. But the possibility of Allergan making a potentially large acquisition has faced significant opposition from shareholders who feared such a deal would make the company too big and expensive for Valeant.  Allergan had held on and off discussions with Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O about buying the drugmaker for more than $10 billion in cash, people familiar with the matter said previously. A cash takeover would not have required a shareholder vote and could have put Allergan out of Valeant’s reach. Those discussions stalled in part because Allergan considered Salix’s valuation as high, and while the company continues to look at other deal opportunities, the likelihood of it striking a big acquisition before the Dec. 18 shareholder meeting is low, the sources said.

Industry experts say the move would further break down the distinctions between generics, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology players. “Biotech is becoming even more complex, while big pharma is now where biotech was 10 years ago in terms of what they’re looking for with cancer and orphan drug indications,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal, referring to expensive medications for rare diseases. “And the generics are pushing in to where pharma used to be.” As the U.S. generics business becomes saturated, with more than 80 percent of prescriptions already being written for cheap generic drugs, manufacturers have increasingly turned their attention to higher-profit branded medicines. “They all always had a little bit of branded activity. The next logical step is to get back into the U.S. market more on the branded side,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Corey Davis. Rival Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which has the world’s largest portfolio of generic offerings, makes most of its profit from its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and added to its branded specialty drug holdings in 2011 with the $6.8 billion acquisition of Cephalon. Mylan Inc   sells EpiPen for severe allergic reactions and branded respiratory drugs. Actavis had already beefed up its specialty pharmaceuticals business with the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories  this year and its $8.5 billion acquisition of Warner-Chilcott in 2013. With Allergan it would own Botox, which derives much of its annual $2.2 billion in sales from the anti-wrinkle business, and reap the benefits of the compound’s growing medical uses, including for migraines, overactive bladder and upper limb spasticity, as well as a lucrative stable of ophthalmology drugs. Botox is also a very complex molecule that is extremely difficult to replicate, and so is in no imminent danger of facing generic competition of its own. “You walk away from the treadmill of having to reinvent yourself every 10 years,” Gal said of the patent expiration cycle of traditional pharmaceuticals. New Actavis chief executive Brent Saunders has the right skill set to run the combined company, analysts said. Saunders was an executive at drugmaker Schering-Plough, before taking over as CEO of eye care company Bausch&Lomb; and later specialty pharma company Forest Labs. “Probably the next logical step in his career is to run something on the scale that an Actavis/Allergan merger would create. I think he’s got aspirations of turning Actavis into a much bigger company than it is now,” Davis said. Saunders is almost surely going to be more palatable to Allergan management than Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson, who has a reputation of slashing research and development at companies he acquires. “He understands the opthalmology business and he’s a pharma guy,” Stern, Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra said of Saunders. “Both companies realize that this is one way that Allergan can sell the company, but be assured that they’re selling to someone who would run the business like Allergan would run the business.”   (Reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; editing by Michele Gershberg and Matthew Lewis)",10082014,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-ma-actavis-branded/actavis-deal-for-allergan-would-be-huge-bet-on-branded-drugs-idUSL2N0S32SW20141008
382,AGN,DEALTALK-Actavis may reap benefits of Valeant's hard work on Allergan,"(For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on ) By Soyoung Kim and Nadia Damouni NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Earlier this week, Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc appeared to have its plan to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc all mapped out. The next phase in Valeant’s months-long campaign to acquire Allergan for about $53 billion in cash and stock was to  announce “blow-out” earnings on Oct. 20, which would have led to a jump in its share price and, therefore, the value of its bid, according to people familiar with the situation. Valeant would have sweetened its offer even further, potentially bringing it somewhere between $195 per share and $200 per share from $175.94 per share as of Tuesday’s closing price, these people said. The bump would have put further pressure on Allergan ahead of its Dec. 18 shareholders meeting at which some of its board members might be voted off, under a campaign led by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Valeant’s partner in the attempted takeover. Valeant, Ackman and many investors had expected Allergan to lose the vote. However, Valeant’s well-laid plans appeared to run into trouble this week, when rival drugmaker Actavis Plc came back into the picture as a possible white knight for Allergan. After months of insisting that it was better off staying independent or being the acquirer, Allergan, led by Chief Executive David Pyott, was warming up to the idea of considering an offer that values the Botox maker at above $200 per share or more than $60 billion - only not from Valeant, people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a separate person said Actavis, which in recent months held informal conversations about a potential combination, would now like to take a hard look at buying Allergan and could reach out to the company as soon as this week to reiterate interest. Until recently, Allergan had indicated to Actavis that it wanted to stay independent, the source said. Allergan, Actavis and Valeant declined to comment. Representatives for Ackman could not be reached for comment. There is no assurance that Actavis will come up with a proposal high enough for Allergan to find attractive. Allergan will not consider a bid unless it sufficiently exceeds $200 per share, the sources said. Still, the latest developments throw the question of Allergan’s future wide open, just when Valeant was beginning to gain some traction on its bid, originally made in April. Last month, Valeant CEO Michael Pearson boosted his case for a deal by saying the Canadian drugmaker expects third-quarter revenue to beat analyst expectations and adjusted earnings per share to surpass the company’s forecast. Some Allergan shareholders had also begun to express concerns that the Botox maker may go out and buy a large company without seeking shareholder approval in order to make it too expensive for Valeant to buy it. Allergan held on-and-off discussions with Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd about buying the drugmaker for more than $10 billion in cash, a deal that would not have required a shareholder vote, Reuters previously reported. Earlier this month, influential proxy advisory firm ISS called on Allergan to give its shareholders a chance to vote on any large, buyout-blocking acquisitions and said the company’s board faced a credibility problem. The latest twist in the saga also highlights the risks companies take when they enter into no-holds-barred, hostile takeover battles. One of the sources likened the situation to Comcast Corp’s $45.2 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc earlier this year. In that case, a months-long pursuit by the initial instigator, Charter Communications Inc , had the effect of putting Time Warner Cable in play and creating the perfect opportunity for Comcast to swoop in. People familiar with the matter said that Valeant was worried about exactly such a situation. While it does not expect large pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson or Sanofi SA to jump in to the fray, the Canadian drugmaker has considered Actavis as a dark horse, these people said. Valeant, which along with Ackman has spent nearly six months and millions of dollars in advisory fees on the pursuit, saw its shares fall 2.5 percent on Tuesday, after news of Actavis’ continued interest broke. To be sure, sources on all sides of the battle said the field is still wide open. The bidding war is pushing up Allergan’s shares to ever-lofty valuations. Valeant’s math shows that at $200 per share, the deal will be dilutive for Actavis in the first year and could add a huge debt burden on the company, one source said. But some analysts said a deal could still work. At $210 per share, JPMorgan Chase analysts expect the deal would lead to a modest, mid-single-digit earnings per share accretion initially. Furthermore, it will expand Actavis’ trading multiple “significantly” because it currently trades at 13 times 2016 forecast earnings, a discount to 19 times for Allergan. “We see significant upside for the stock at current levels,” JPMorgan’s Chris Schott said in a research note on Tuesday. Actavis thinks at $200 per share, Allergan gets expensive, but not prohibitively so, one source said. To make it work, Actavis would need to look for more synergies, something that it can do only once it is given access to Allergan’s books, the source said. Actavis, which regularly reviews potential acquisitions, considers Allergan the best merger partner currently and is hoping to engage in friendly discussions, the sources said. For Allergan investors, meanwhile, a bidding war is proving to be good news. Allergan’s shares closed 2.3 percent higher at $190.50 on Wednesday, after hitting a new high. “The decision by Allergan to oppose the Valeant offer looks increasingly like the right choice,” BernsteinResearch analysts said in a research note on Wednesday. “Allergan has created sufficient value to drive up the price of the offer from Valeant; it may have attracted an additional bidder - Actavis - into the mix.”    (Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Matthew Lewis)",10082014,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-ma/dealtalk-actavis-may-reap-benefits-of-valeants-hard-work-on-allergan-idUSL2N0S31W020141008
383,AGN,Exclusive: Actavis plans new merger approach for Allergan - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Actavis Plc ACT.N plans to approach Allergan Inc (AGN.N) again about a potential merger, as the Botox maker warms up to the possibility of a sale, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Allergan, which has repeatedly rejected offers from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), would consider a takeover proposal that values the company at above $200 per share, some of these people said. Actavis, which held informal conversations with Allergan in recent months about a possible combination, would like to take a hard look at buying the company and could reach out to its management team as soon as this week to reiterate its interest, one of the sources said. There has been no formal engagement between the two companies yet, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Actavis’ new overture would come as Valeant and its partner William Ackman plan to boost their offer by about $15 per share, valuing Allergan at more than $190 per share, according to a separate person familiar with the matter. Valeant had initially intended to announce a higher bid after reporting what it expects to be blow-out earnings on Oct. 20, the person said, adding that the timing and amount of the bump could still change. Allergan, while fighting off Valeant’s advances, did not reach out to other alternative buyers and instead focused on identifying opportunities for revenue growth and cost cuts internally. But it is aware of competing interest from other drugmakers, particularly from Actavis, the sources said. The emergence of Actavis as a serious rival suitor adds another twist to the months-long takeover battle between Valeant and Allergan. The Canadian drugmaker’s bid already has attracted controversy because it is backed by activist investor Ackman, leading to a legal challenge from Allergan which has accused the two parties of insider trading. Shares of Allergan ended 1.7 percent higher at $186.20 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising more than 3 percent on the news, valuing the company at more than $55 billion. Actavis closed at $243.39 for a market capitalization of roughly $64 billion. Shares of Valeant fell 2.5 percent, putting the value of its existing cash and stock offer for Allergan at $175.94 per share, or $52.8 billion based on shares outstanding. Valeant expects its shares to rise substantially when it announces earnings in the coming weeks, potentially making its newly increased offer worth well above $195 per share and close to $200, one person familiar with the matter said. Analysts have an average price target of around $200 per share for Allergan, with the price ranging from $174 to $240 per share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll of 16 analysts. Representatives for Allergan and Actavis declined to comment. Actavis’ continued pursuit of Allergan comes as the takeover target faces a Dec. 18 special shareholder meeting, at which top Allergan investor Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management hopes to replace a majority of the company’s board. Pershing Square has teamed up with Valeant to pursue a takeover of Allergan, and is hoping to install new board members who could be more receptive to a takeover by the Canadian drugmaker. Actavis, which regularly reviews potential acquisitions, considers Allergan as the best opportunity currently and is hoping to engage in friendly discussions, the sources said. Industry executives have said Actavis would be a better cultural fit for Allergan because the companies’ respective chief executives, Brent Saunders and David Pyott, believe in focusing on research and development, while Valeant CEO Mike Pearson is known for cost cutting. A large part of Allergan’s business is ophthalmology, an area that Saunders is familiar with after serving as CEO of Bausch & Lomb. Valeant acquired Bausch & Lomb last year. Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22 but Allergan has said the offer undervalued the company. Since then Allergan has announced cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions while trying to persuade shareholders they were better off remaining independent. But the possibility of Allergan making a potentially large acquisition has faced significant opposition from shareholders who feared such a deal would make the company too big and expensive for Valeant.  Allergan had held on and off discussions with Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O about buying the drugmaker for more than $10 billion in cash, people familiar with the matter said previously. A cash takeover would not have required a shareholder vote and could have put Allergan out of Valeant’s reach. Those discussions stalled in part because Allergan considered Salix’s valuation as high, and while the company continues to look at other deal opportunities, the likelihood of it striking a big acquisition before the Dec. 18 shareholder meeting is low, the sources said.

387,AGN,Allergan says third quarter and 2014 profit to beat expectations,"(Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) said on Thursday it expects to report third-quarter profit that is more than 20 percent higher than it previously anticipated, which it said bolsters its contention that an unsolicited takeover offer by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) undervalues the company. Allergan shares were up 0.3 percent at $191.09 on Thursday morning, building slightly on gains made this week after Reuters reported that the company is also a target of Actavis Plc ACT.N.  Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management were also preparing to raise their bid this week, Reuters and other news organizations reported, which has also boosted shares.  Allergan stock has gained about 15 percent since Sept. 22 when Reuters and others cited unnamed sources saying the company was considering a possible acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals SLXP.O. Those merger discussions have since dropped off, sources have said.  Pursuing acquisitions is part of Allergan’s strategy to fend off the $53 billion hostile takeover by Valeant. Allergan has criticized the company’s model of growing through acquisitions and said drastic cuts in research and development would minimize Allergan’s potential. “Today’s announced expectations for the third quarter and updated future outlook further demonstrate that there is a vast value gap between Valeant’s offer and the intrinsic value of Allergan,” Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott said in a statement.  Allergan estimated adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 to $1.78 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than its previous forecast of $1.44 to $1.47, helped by an increase in market share and product approvals. It said that its restructuring, which includes job cuts, will help earnings starting in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. Analysts on average were expecting a third-quarter profit of $1.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Allergan also forecast full-year adjusted earnings of $6.20 to $6.25 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $5.81. For 2015, the company forecast earnings of $8.60 per share and for 2016, it put earnings at $10.25 per share. The company said it also expects a 14-15 percent increase in product net sales for the year and 17 percent in the quarter. One Wall Street analyst pointed to Allergan’s dermal fillers, injectible treatments that are marketed under names including Juvederm and Juvederm Voluma, as the source of the unexpectedly large sales increase. “We believe Allergan’s fillers business (and the Voluma launch) could again represent a significant driver of this upside,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a research note.

Industry experts say the move would further break down the distinctions between generics, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology players. “Biotech is becoming even more complex, while big pharma is now where biotech was 10 years ago in terms of what they’re looking for with cancer and orphan drug indications,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal, referring to expensive medications for rare diseases. “And the generics are pushing in to where pharma used to be.” As the U.S. generics business becomes saturated, with more than 80 percent of prescriptions already being written for cheap generic drugs, manufacturers have increasingly turned their attention to higher-profit branded medicines. “They all always had a little bit of branded activity. The next logical step is to get back into the U.S. market more on the branded side,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Corey Davis. Rival Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which has the world’s largest portfolio of generic offerings, makes most of its profit from its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and added to its branded specialty drug holdings in 2011 with the $6.8 billion acquisition of Cephalon. Mylan Inc   sells EpiPen for severe allergic reactions and branded respiratory drugs. Actavis had already beefed up its specialty pharmaceuticals business with the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories  this year and its $8.5 billion acquisition of Warner-Chilcott in 2013. With Allergan it would own Botox, which derives much of its annual $2.2 billion in sales from the anti-wrinkle business, and reap the benefits of the compound’s growing medical uses, including for migraines, overactive bladder and upper limb spasticity, as well as a lucrative stable of ophthalmology drugs. Botox is also a very complex molecule that is extremely difficult to replicate, and so is in no imminent danger of facing generic competition of its own. “You walk away from the treadmill of having to reinvent yourself every 10 years,” Gal said of the patent expiration cycle of traditional pharmaceuticals. New Actavis chief executive Brent Saunders has the right skill set to run the combined company, analysts said. Saunders was an executive at drugmaker Schering-Plough, before taking over as CEO of eye care company Bausch&Lomb; and later specialty pharma company Forest Labs. “Probably the next logical step in his career is to run something on the scale that an Actavis/Allergan merger would create. I think he’s got aspirations of turning Actavis into a much bigger company than it is now,” Davis said. Saunders is almost surely going to be more palatable to Allergan management than Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson, who has a reputation of slashing research and development at companies he acquires. “He understands the opthalmology business and he’s a pharma guy,” Stern, Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra said of Saunders. “Both companies realize that this is one way that Allergan can sell the company, but be assured that they’re selling to someone who would run the business like Allergan would run the business.”   (Reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; editing by Michele Gershberg and Matthew Lewis)",10092014,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-ma-actavis-branded/rpt-actavis-deal-for-allergan-would-be-huge-bet-on-branded-drugs-idUSL2N0S330L20141009
392,AGN,"Exclusive: Top Actavis holder, Fidelity, adds Allergan holdings- sources","NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments, the largest shareholder in Actavis Plc ACT.N, has increased its holdings in takeover-target Allergan (AGN.N) in recent months and would be supportive of a potential merger between the two drugmakers, according to people familiar with the matter. The Boston-based investment firm, which collectively owned 3.88 million Allergan shares through several of its funds as of end-June, had added roughly 2 million shares by the end of August, according to Thomson Reuters data based on Fidelity’s monthly filings. The additions would likely make Fidelity the No.8 shareholder in Allergan, according to Thomson Reuters data, assuming there was no significant changing of hands in the company’s top-10 shareholder base. Fidelity is currently Actavis’ top shareholder with a 6.3 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. Fidelity would be open to taking Actavis’ shares if the drugmaker comes up with a rival bid using its own stock as currency, the sources said, asking not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The fund managers also like Allergan’s standalone business plan, the sources added. Revelations of Fidelity’s increased holdings in Allergan come days after Reuters reported that Actavis was planning to make a new approach to the Botox maker about a merger, potentially challenging Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc’s (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) unsolicited bid for Allergan.  Boosting its Allergan ownership also contrasts with Fidelity’s recently reduced bets in Valeant. Two of Fidelity’s top stock pickers unloaded most of their holdings in Valeant after the Canadian drugmaker in April unveiled its bid for Allergan, which has marked one of 2014’s most contentious takeover battles.  Some Fidelity fund managers are reluctant to support Valeant’s cash and stock proposal in part because they have questions about the value of Valeant’s stock, according to the people familiar with the matter. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott has regularly cast doubts on the value and sustainability of Valeant stock, saying the rival’s share performance has been driven by financial engineering and “unsustainable” price increases. Allergan declined to comment. Representatives for Fidelity also declined to comment.  Several analysts said in research notes this week that Allergan shareholders would prefer a competitive offer from Actavis over Valeant’s bid. “Based on our discussions with investors, we believe fundamental investors who own Allergan... are inherently more comfortable with the Actavis business model than the Valeant model,” BernsteinResearch analysts said in a Wednesday note. “Exchanging Allergan shares for Actavis shares would not force many of them to sell, as they might with Valeant position.” Industry executives say Actavis would be a better cultural fit for Allergan because the companies’ respective chief executives, Brent Saunders and David Pyott, believe in focusing on research and development, while Valeant CEO Mike Pearson is known for cost cutting. To be sure, Valeant still has a powerful ally. Hedge fund manager William Ackman has amassed a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan to make him the company’s largest shareholder, and has teamed up with Valeant to pursue a joint bid. T.Rowe Price, the second-largest shareholder in Allergan with a stake of near 5.4 percent, is also Valeant’s No.3 investor with a 4.9 percent stake, and would likely benefit from a combination between the two companies. Ackman has secured investors who collectively own more than 35 percent of Allergan shares, including his position, to call for a special shareholder meeting on Dec. 18, at which he hopes to replace majority of the company’s board. The prospect of a bidding war, as well as Allergan’s own improving performance, has driven its shares to all-time highs this week, with the stock trading at $187.55 on the New York Stock Exchange, well above Valeant’s offer. On Thursday, Allergan lifted its third-quarter profit estimate and said the updated forecast showed that Valeant’s takeover offer undervalued the company.  Shares of Valeant have come under pressure, however, as doubts increase about whether its bid will succeed. The stock fell 2.8 percent to $122.35 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, valuing its Allergan bid at $173.55 per share, or just below $52 billion.

394,AGN,UPDATE 2-Ackman: Lawyers have documents purported to show Allergan misled on Valeant,"(Adds Allergan declining comment, share activity) By Alastair Sharp and Allison Martell TORONTO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman turned up the heat on Allergan Inc. on Thursday when he accused the Botox maker’s board of misleading investors to fend off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals . Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan’s biggest shareholder, told reporters that his lawyers had seen documents that show Allergan’s board knowingly released misleading statements about Valeant. “We’ve actually found evidence that will come out in the next few days of attempts at manipulating Valeant’s stock price down,” Ackman said, noting that he has not seen that evidence because it has been marked as “highly confidential.” Valeant’s New York-listed shares climbed 3.6 percent in afternoon trading. They have lost about 6 percent in often volatile dealings since Valeant bid for Allergan in late April. Allergan’s shares edged up 0.7 percent. Allergan declined to comment and Reuters could not independently verify Ackman’s claim. Allergan executives have previously said the concerns they expressed about Valeant were based on their knowledge of the Canadian company and the industry. In an unusual alliance, even by hedge fund industry standards, Ackman has been working with Valeant for months to push the Botox maker into selling itself to Valeant. Allergan has steadfastly refused, calling Valeant’s offer too low and looking for other partners to avoid a deal with Valeant. “We believe they put those statements out, that they knew that they were false at the time they made them, and we have found evidence to that effect, that this was a conscious takeover defense strategy to malign Valeant and the company,” Ackman said after speaking at a conference. Pershing Square is expected to file court documents early next week related to Allergan’s lawsuit, which accuses the hedge fund and Valeant of breaking insider trading rules, said a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly. It is not clear if those court documents will include the material that Ackman says exists about the Allergan board’s alleged misleading of investors. “I think it will come to light in the context of litigation,” Ackman said, giving only a vague hint of when the material will be made public. Sources familiar with Valeant and Pershing Square have hinted that the company might be willing to raise its bid for Allergan, possibly as soon as next week when Valeant is  expected to release earnings which the company has signaled will be strong. Ackman has lined up a list of other big investors who have called on Allergan to call a special meeting in December where the hedge fund manager is expected to try and replace Allergan board members with his own directors who might be more receptive to Valeant’s overtures. As the battle for Allergan drags on each side has ratcheted up the rhetoric. In a letter to the Allergan board in September, Ackman accused them of having libeled Valeant and said he had complained to U.S. and Canadian regulators. Separately, last month Valeant Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson wrote to Allergan alleging that it was making “baseless attacks” about his company. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and lead independent director Michael Gallagher said at the time that the company relied on its knowledge of Valeant and of the industry to express concerns about Valeant’s business model. Valeant did not comment on Ackman’s remarks. Known for making big bets on companies including Canadian Pacific and General Growth Properties, Ackman has also relied on the media to press his points.

396,AGN,Top Allergan holder Paulson urges deal with Shire: sources,"(Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) shareholder Paulson & Co is urging the Botox maker to merge with specialty pharmaceutical company Shire Plc (SHP.L) as an alternative to a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), according to two people familiar with the matter. The hedge fund, which earlier supported a deal with Valeant, told Allergan CEO David Pyott that it would now support a deal with Shire, the sources said. It was not immediately clear whether Allergan would pursue such a deal.  Paulson had a 1.9 percent stake in Allergan, making it one of the company’s top 10 shareholders, according to Thomson Reuters data as of June 30. Paulson was also Shire’s third-largest shareholder, according to the data.  Allergan and Paulson declined to comment. Shire, which makes drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases, was not immediately available for comment.  Paulson’s move, which adds a new twist in the battle for Allergan, comes after Shire’s $54 billion “tax inversion” deal to sell itself to AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) fell apart after the U.S. government proposed new rules to make such transactions less attractive.  Last week, AbbVie’s board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal. The U-turn caused Shire’s shares to plunge, with Paulson and other investors seeing the value of their holdings fall. Paulson had a 1.7 percent stake in Shire as of June 30, according to Thomson Reuters data. The sources said any deal between Allergan and Shire, which is based in Dublin, would not be structured as a so-called tax inversion.  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts previously said a deal between Allergan and Shire could make sense because it would diversify the sales mix, expand Shire’s geographic reach and preserve research and development programs.  Allergan shareholders, including Paulson, have been looking at alternative strategies for the company as it tries to fend off Valeant. The Canadian company teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman in April to bid for Allergan.  Valeant might raise its bid for Allergan and will not abandon its pursuit ahead of a Dec. 18 special meeting, Michael Pearson, CEO of the Laval, Quebec-based company, said on Monday.  Some large Allergan shareholders have said they would prefer a deal with drugmaker Actavis Plc ACT.N to a tie-up with Shire. Actavis plans to approach Allergan again about a potential merger, sources previously told Reuters.

398,AGN,Valeant says may raise Allergan bid; beats on profit,"(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX.TO VRX.N said on Monday that it may raise its bid for Botox maker Allergan Inc AGN.N after the Canadian company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said a possible revised stock and cash bid would be worth more than $200 per share, assuming that Valeant’s stock rises, and would include more cash. The current bid is worth about $52.7 billion or $176 per share. Shares of Laval, Quebec-based Valeant were up 3 percent at C$139.51 in Toronto on Monday. Allergan stock was up 1.7 percent at $180.45. Valeant’s third-quarter results were keenly anticipated for their potential impact on Valeant’s bid for Allergan, maker of anti-wrinkle injection Botox. Unlike most quarters in which, according to critics, one-time charges related to acquisitions obscure Valeant’s performance, the company made few deals as it stalked Allergan. “When people have time to reflect on our performance this quarter, it hopefully goes a long way of convincing the Allergan shareholders that our currency is actually a great stock to own,” Pearson told Reuters. He said Valeant is considering adding more cash to its bid, and could make a decision on it at any time. “We have some money in our pocket,” he said. Pearson expects that once it becomes clear Valeant will win Allergan, Valeant’s stock will rise, adding further value to the bid. Valeant teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman in April to make a hostile offer for Allergan, which rejected Valeant’s offer. Allergan did not immediately respond to Pearson’s comments. Allergan will hold a special shareholder meeting on Dec. 18, when Ackman hopes to remove most directors, possibly leading to negotiations with Valeant. Valeant’s relationship with Ackman and his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund is not strained as some have speculated, Pearson said. “We’re completely aligned,” he said on an earlier call with analysts. The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $8.22-$8.32 per share from $7.90-$8.10 per share. The company raised its fourth-quarter adjusted profit forecast to $2.45-$2.55 per share on expectations of double-digit same-store organic growth. Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $8.03 per share for the full year and $2.38 per share for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Valeant also raised its 2015 adjusted profit forecast to $10 per share from $9.65 per share. Analysts were expecting $9.58 per share. Valeant posted a profit attributable to the company of $275.4 million, or 81 cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $973.2 million, or $2.92 per share, a year earlier.  Cash earnings, or profit adjusted for one-time items, was $2.11 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.99 per share. Revenue jumped 33 percent to $2.06 billion, matching analysts’ expectations.

Advances of around 3 percent in both BP and Royal Dutch Shell added the most points to the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, as stronger oil prices lifted energy stocks. Brent crude oil, which had fallen to four-year lows last week, held onto gains at around $86 a barrel after data showed robust oil demand in China, the world’s largest energy consumer. “The oil majors are benefiting from a rise in the underlying oil price, but unless the crude oil price can move much further beyond last week’s lows and hold onto the rebound, those oil stocks could fall back again,” said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. The FTSE 100 index closed up by 1.7 percent, or 105.26 points, at 6,372.33 points. Shire rose 2.6 percent after Reuters reported that Allergan  shareholder Paulson & Co was urging the firm to merge with Shire as an alternative to a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Online fashion retailer ASOS, which is not listed on the FTSE 100 but is part of the broader London stock market, also surged by 16.3 percent. ASOS expressed confidence it could reach its annual sales target of 2.5 billion pounds ($4 billion) by 2020, and said price cuts would help to reignite growth after three profit warnings this year. Chip designer ARM, however, missed out on the broader market rally, tumbling 5.3 percent after its third-quarter results lagged some market forecasts. The FTSE 100 hit a peak of 6,904.86 points at the start of September, its highest level since early 2000. The index slumped last week after weak European economic data, but some traders said the FTSE’s rebound at the start of this week meant there was a good chance it could now push on for the rest of October. The FTSE remains down by around 6 percent since the start of 2014. “While there is still the possibility that we may re-test last week’s lows, the chances have diminished somewhat as we head into November with a possibility of a good rally to the year-end,” said Securequity sales trader Jawaid Afsar.

405,AGN,Allergan says it stands by statements on Valeant,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Allergan Inc said on Tuesday it saw no evidence to support claims by hostile suitors Valeant Pharmaceuticals and hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management that its chief executive officer had spearheaded a campaign to spread misinformation. “Allergan stands by its statements regarding the unsustainability of Valeant’s business, and we welcome the opportunity for a full hearing on Valeant’s business model at the appropriate time,” the company said in a statement. Pershing Square, run by billionaire William Ackman, has been working with Valeant for months to craft a deal for the Canadian drugmaker to buy Allergan, which has rejected the overtures and tried to find other potential partners to avoid a deal. Allergan has also sued Valeant and Pershing Square, saying they broke insider trading rules. It said court papers that Valeant and Pershing Square filed in federal court in Santa Ana, California, late on Monday “try to distract shareholders from the serious insider trading allegations Allergan has raised.” In the heavily redacted court papers, Valeant and Pershing Square say Allergan CEO David Pyott misled shareholders about the departure of Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards. “That and other documents confirm that the pressure to mischaracterize events came from Pyott,” the documents said. They went on to say Pyott “falsely stated to the market and Valeant’s top investors .... that Valeant’s accounting was opaque and problematic, when Allergan’s own advisor Goldman Sachs indicated otherwise.” Lawyers for Pershing Square and Valeant said Allergan’s board members were intent on preserving their own well-paying jobs “at the expense of the truth, with Allergan engaging in a specific campaign to decrease Valeant’s stock price, one of the components of the proposed transaction.” Most Allergan board members earned more than $400,000 in 2013. The court filing late on Monday further raises the tensions between the two sides in a deal that, if struck, could become the year’s biggest. The information came to light last month when Allergan produced 4,200 pages of documents and lawyers for Ackman and Valeant deposed the company’s executives and board members, including Pyott. Ackman has succeeded in calling for a Dec. 18 special meeting, where he hopes to replace most of Allergan’s board with his own slate, which would be ready to discuss a takeover. Last week Allergan said that Harvard Business Review ranks Pyott as one of the of world’s top five CEOs, based on three quantitative metrics, but Ackman, who earned his undergraduate and business degrees from Harvard, said the journal had goofed on the math and that the hedge fund had asked for a correction.

408,AGN,Gains in oil stocks and Shire lift UK's FTSE,"* FTSE 100 up 1.4 pct, continues rebound off 15-month lows * Higher oil price lifts BP and Shell * Shire buoyed by Paulson comments on Allergan tie-up * ARM slumps after Q3 results disappoint By Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Gains in major oil companies and drugmaker Shire helped Britain’s top equity index extend its rebound on Tuesday after falling to 15-month lows last week. Advances of around 2 percent in both BP and Royal Dutch Shell added the most points to the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, as the energy sector was buoyed by stronger oil prices. Brent crude oil, which had fallen to four-year lows last week, held onto gains at around $86 a barrel after data showed robust oil demand in China, the world’s largest energy consumer. “The oil majors are benefiting from a rise in the underlying oil price, but unless the crude oil price can move much further beyond last week’s lows and hold onto the rebound, those oil stocks could fall back again,” said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. The FTSE 100 index was up by 1.4 percent at 6,354.76 points going into the close of the trading session. Shire rose 2.3 percent after Reuters reported that Allergan  shareholder Paulson & Co was urging the firm to merge with Shire as an alternative to a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Online fashion retailer ASOS, which is not listed on the FTSE 100 but is part of the broader London stock market, also surged, by 14.4 percent, after the company expressed confidence it could reach its annual sales target of 2.5 billion pounds ($4 billion) by 2020. Price cuts would help to reignite growth after three profit warnings this year. Chip designer ARM, however, missed out on the broader market rally, tumbling 7 percent after its third-quarter results lagged some market forecasts. The FTSE 100 hit a peak of 6,904.86 points at the start of September, its highest since early 2000. The index slumped last week after weak European economic data, but some traders said the FTSE’s rebound at the start of this week meant there was a good chance it could now push on for the rest of October. “I expect stocks to post gains across the board this week,” said Mike Jarman, chief market strategist at H2O Markets.

414,AGN,COLUMN-New details in Allergan anti-takeover campaign: Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) By Alison Frankel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Earlier this week, I told you about new filings by the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant and the hedge fund Pershing Capital that suggested their target Allergan had disregarded advice from its financial adviser Goldman Sachs. The Pershing and Valeant briefs were heavily redacted and the underlying exhibits were sealed, but the implication from unredacted snippets was that Goldman had suggested Allergan request accounting information from Valeant and Allergan rejected the recommendation. Then, according to Pershing and Valeant, after Goldman refused to go along with attacks on Valeant’s business model, Allergan hired additional experts with no such reservations. Much of the once-sealed evidence in the case is now public. It’s must-read stuff for M&A; buffs - an unusually robust account of one of the most innovative and celebrated takeover battles I can remember. But I don’t see much in the emails or testimony to prove that Allergan refused to follow Goldman’s advice to engage with Allergan. ‘VALEANT IS VILE’ There are definitely some headaches for Allergan in the newly disclosed emails, including one from CEO David Pyott to Allergan corporate development vice president David Lawrence, summarily rejecting Lawrence’s suggestion that Allergan tone down a presentation entitled “Valeant Is Vile.” Lawrence subsequently emailed Allergan’s CFO, describing how Pyott had “paddled” him for objecting to the presentation and how he’d since been excluded from directors’ meetings and consultations with Allergan’s financial advisers. (Lawrence also sent a copy of his original email to Pyott to his personal email account, an interesting move.) There’s also some new evidence to back up Pershing chief William Ackman’s claim that Allergan deliberately set out to drive down Valeant’s share price as part of Allergan’s defense against the hostile bid. As far back as March 2014 - before Valeant and Pershing even surfaced with an unsolicited bid for Allergan - Allergan was modeling negative forecasts for Valeant, according to an internal email. By June, with Allergan’s anti-Valeant campaign underway, Allergan CEO Pyott was “taking credit” for a $5 drop in Valeant shares, according to an exchange between the Allergan CFO and an adviser from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The next month, Pyott asked M&A; adviser Innisfree for a list of Valeant’s top shareholders, presumably in connection with what Pershing and Valeant have described as Allergan’s “highly unusual” roadshow to convince Valeant shareholders to oppose the takeover bid. And in a July 14 presentation to the Allergan board, Allergan’s bankers at Goldman Sachs and Merrill highlighted the fall in Valeant’s share price - to below its levels preceding the Allergan offer - as a sign of the success of Allergan’s tactics. But let’s get back to the Pershing and Valeant representation in filings this week that Allergan rejected “Goldman’s recommendation to ask for information from Valeant” and “disregarded input” from its outside advisers about Valeant’s business model. There is no smoking-gun Allergan email to back that assertion. On May 19, a Goldman banker sent Merrill counterparts and Allergan officials an email describing Tenet Healthcare’s fraud suit against Community Health Systems, which was part of Tenet’s defense against Community’s hostile takeover bid. Tenet had obtained the information at the heart of its suit through a non-disclosure agreement, the Goldman email said. Goldman seemed to intimate that Allergan might be able to pull off a similar coup. If Allergan were actually to begin negotiations with Valeant, the email said, “we would have the opportunity to do real, detailed due diligence of V as well. We would also insist in the NDA that we have the right to make our findings public to our shareholders as fiduciaries. V may never agree to this, which in and of itself would be telling.” Is that really a recommendation to request information from Valeant? It seems more like a hypothetical to me. I didn’t see any subsequent reference to the non-disclosure agreement idea, though in a separate email chain with a different Goldman banker the same day, Allergan’s CEO said, “I need Goldman to take off its white hat and put on a darker one.” (The Goldman banker responded, “I hear you!”) Pershing and Valeant claimed that Allergan’s “Valeant Is Vile” presentation was vetted by Allergan accounting advisers Alvarez & Marsal and FTI Consulting because Goldman Sachs and Merrill refused to go along with Allergan’s criticisms of Valeant. (Both banks had been bullish about Valeant in recent analyst reports, and Goldman was the sole underwriter in a $2.3 billion Valeant stock offering in 2013, in which it invested $300 million in Valeant shares.) But when Pershing lawyer Mark Holscher of Kirkland & Ellis asked Pyott during the CEO’s deposition about Goldman’s view of the “Valeant Is Vile” Powerpoint, Pyott refused to concede that Goldman had any problem with it. “I think the word ‘approve’ is wrong, because at the end of day, the only person who puts out the presentation is ourselves,” Pyott testified. “Obviously if they had some form of objection, I would be listening carefully.” Holscher directly asked Allergan’s lead director, Michael Gallagher, if Goldman and Merrill told him Valeant had an unsustainable business model. “They agreed that it did, yes,” Gallagher replied. Holscher also asked whether Allergan had considered a non-disclosure agreement to obtain information from Valeant. Gallagher said no: That request would have sent the wrong message to the marketplace and, besides, Allergan already knew plenty about Valeant’s business model. (Allergan’s shareholders may be wondering why the company is paying $6 million a quarter for financial advice to both Goldman and Merrill - according to Holscher’s questions to Gallagher - if its board already knows everything it needs to know about Valeant’s business, but that’s another story.) MUD-SLINGING Allergan shareholders, as you know, are weighing Pershing proposals to oust six board members and begin talks with Valeant. Both sides seem to believe that the more mud they can throw at the other, the better their chance of winning the proxy fight. Allergan says Pershing is an inside trader and Valeant is a company with an unsustainable business plan. The hostile bidders say Allergan’s board members are breaching their duties to shareholders in a desperate effort to save their own jobs. Bill Ackman said in his deposition in the Allergan litigation that he doesn’t like to describe unsolicited offers as “hostile” bids, preferring to call them “happy deals” because “there are very few unhappy shareholders when a company makes a public proposal to acquire a business.” I’m sure the arbitrageurs who have bought Allergan shares since the Valeant offer last April have been happy to see the upward trend line of the company’s share price in the last six months. But when you’re caught in the middle of a mud fight, you can’t help feeling a little dirty.

415,AGN,Valeant ready to raise Allergan bid to at least $200/share,"(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) on Monday said in a letter to Allergan Inc’s (AGN.N) board of directors that it was prepared to raise its offer to at least $200 per share but stopped short of doing so. Valeant, whose existing offer values the Botox maker at about $179 per share, or $53.25 billion, said last week that the Canadian pharmaceutical company was considering raising the bid and would increase the cash portion of the offer to do so.  “To be clear, Valeant is prepared to improve its offer and provide value to your shareholders of at least $200 a share. We are confident that an increase in our stock price, and in consideration, will provide that value,” Valeant Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson said in the letter. At $200 per share, the offer would be worth more than $59 billion. Allergan said the letter was a tactic to distract investors from Allergan third-quarter earnings, which it announced on Monday morning and did not include offer details. “I think all we saw today was an offer to negotiate,” Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said during a conference call.  Valeant and hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management launched a hostile offer for Allergan in April, but the Botox maker has staunchly refused it. The company has said that shareholders will be better off if it stays independent or finds its own acquisitions.  Pyott declined to answer questions during the call about whether or not the company is pursuing a “white knight” acquirer for Allergan or its own purchases.  Allergan will hold a shareholder meeting on Dec. 18 at the request of investors who own more than 35 percent of the company’s stock, including Pershing Square head William Ackman. Investors will vote on new directors put forth by Ackman and to open discussions on the deal. A hearing is scheduled on Tuesday in federal court in California where a judge will hear from both sides on if Ackman’s stake in Allergan of nearly 10 percent should count as part of that shareholder vote. Allergan asked to exclude the shares as part of an insider trading suit it filed against Valeant and Pershing Square. Separately on Monday, Allergan reported a third-quarter profit of $1.78 per share, excluding items. On Oct. 9, the company preannounced those earnings and said it would report a profit that was more than 20 percent higher than it had previously expected, in the range of $1.76 to $1.78 per share. Allergan also raised the outlook for the current quarter, saying it now expects earnings of $1.80 to $1.83 per share, and for the year of $6.27 to $6.30 per share. Allergan’s shares were off 0.1 percent or 20 cents at $184.01 on Monday. Valeant shares were up 0.2 percent or 30 cents at $129.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.

419,AGN,Allergan says has been approached by another party about a deal,"(Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N), fighting a hostile takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO), said on Monday it was approached about a potential transaction by another party, identified as Actavis Plc ACT.N by a source familiar with the situation. Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns nearly a 10 percent stake in Allergan, made an offer that is now worth $55 billion for Allergan. Allergan has been fighting a six-month-old takeover battle with Valeant and is trying to convince investors that Valeant’s plan for cost-cutting is too extreme. Reuters reported in early October that Actavis, which had already reached out to Allergan once in the prior months, was planning a second approach to the company with an offer worth more than $200 per share. Last week during a conference call with analysts, Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott was asked if the company had received an offer from another party besides Valeant. He responded that he could not comment on “any particular market rumor.” It was not clear if Allergan’s disclosure on Monday referred to a new approach or to one of the older overtures.  Valeant, whose cash-and-stock offer is worth about $182 per share, recently said it was prepared to raise its offer so that it would be worth around $200 per share.  Activist investor William Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, spearheaded calling a vote on new board members at a special meeting of Allergan shareholders. The meeting will be held Dec. 18. Allergan, which has sued Valeant and Ackman claiming insider trading, is waiting to decide on the Actavis approach to see if a California judge will issue a temporary injunction to exclude Ackman from voting at the meeting, a second source familiar with the situation said.  If the ruling goes against Allergan, that could push the company to the table with Actavis, the source said. A hearing on the issue was held last Tuesday and a ruling was expected any day. Separately, Allergan confirmed that business development head David Lawrence had left the company recently. His departure followed that of Allergan’s top financial executive, who left this summer for family reasons.  “David Lawrence made the decision to retire from Allergan in the beginning of September to commit more time to his health and family,” an Allergan spokesman said in a statement. The spokesman declined to comment on emails written by Lawrence and disclosed as part of the insider trading lawsuit in which he described being “paddled” by the company’s top executive for suggesting it tone down a presentation called “Valeant is Vile.”  Allergan shares rose $2.58, or 1.4 percent, to $192.64, about 6 percent above Valeant’s offer price, while Actavis gained $4.74, or 2 percent, to $247.48.

Separately, Allergan confirmed that business development head David Lawrence had left the company recently. His departure followed that of Allergan’s top financial executive, who left this summer for family reasons. “David Lawrence made the decision to retire from Allergan in the beginning of September to commit more time to his health and family,” an Allergan spokesman said in a statement. The spokesman declined to comment on emails written by Lawrence and disclosed as part of the insider trading lawsuit in which he described being “paddled” by the company’s top executive for suggesting it tone down a presentation called “Valeant is Vile.” Allergan shares rose $2.58, or 1.4 percent, to $192.64, about 6 percent above Valeant’s offer price, while Actavis gained $4.74, or 2 percent, to $247.48. Valeant added 0.3 percent to $133.37 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

During the call, Deutsche Bank analyst Gregory Gilbert asked Saunders about the importance of biologics, and quipped on a potential name for the merged companies: “I’ll skip the “Actergan” question for now.” Saunders responded, “Is that like Bennifer? You coined the first new phrase there?” - referring to a name used by the media for celebrities Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez when they were dating. “I just wanted to get it on the record,” Gilbert said.

Saunders was not specifically asked during the conference call about Allergan, which has been fighting a hostile takeover by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc for six months.  He discussed debt levels, capital deployment and bringing shareholders on board with a vote if required. “I think given the need for consolidation and what’s happening in our industry ... companies that aren’t investing for long term value creation and long term growth are missing an opportunity,” he said.

Actavis is willing to pay around $200 per share, or $60 billion, while Allergan wants more than $210 per share, Bloomberg said. Actavis and Allergan declined to comment. Allergan is trying to fend off a hostile takeover by Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which has offered about $54 billion in cash and stock for the company, but has said it is prepared to raise that to $200 per share.  Allergan said last week it was in talks with a second bidder, and sources familiar with the situation said the company was Actavis.

The amended laws now include a provision that requires Allergan’s board to call for a meeting within 90 days of a valid request rather than exercise its discretion, Allergan said. The company also reduced the amount of information required from someone calling for a special meeting, and eliminated a requirement to disclose who is acting in concert with the shareholder making the proposal. Ackman and proxy advisory firms pressured Allergan to change these rules, saying they were too onerous.

435,AGN,Allergan amends shareholder meeting bylaws ahead of Dec. 18 meet,"Nov 12 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc changed its bylaws associated with calling a special shareholder meeting, about a month before such a meeting where William Ackman, the Botox maker’s biggest shareholder, aims to replace most of Allergan’s board. Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, is pushing the company to sell itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc , a move that Allergan has constantly rebuffed. The amended laws now includes a provision that requires Allergan’s board to call for a meeting within 90 days of a valid request rather than exercise its discretion in setting a date, Allergan said in a statement on Wednesday. The company also reduced the amount of information required to be submitted by a shareholder calling for a special meeting, and eliminated the requirement that the shareholder disclose who else is “acting in concert with the proposing person”. Ackman and Valeant have gathered investors representing an additional 25 percent of Allergan shares in order to call the special meeting on Dec. 18. They want to use the proxy battle as a platform to force Allergan to open talks about a deal. The amendments to the bylaws are to ensure next month’s meeting “is focused on the question of value,” Michael Gallagher, Allergan’s lead independent director said. “Allergan remains confident that it can create more value than Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s offer to acquire the company’s shares,” Gallagher said.

436,AGN,"Allergan near buyout of up to $65 billion to escape Valeant, Ackman: source","(Reuters) - Allergan Inc is close to a buyout deal worth up to $65.5 billion by Actavis Plc, one that could end months of pursuit by Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals and William Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, according to a person familiar with the matter. Actavis may pay Allergan between $215 and $220 per share, with the final price likely coming at the high end of that range, according to the source. A deal could be announced as early as Monday, the source said. If such a price materializes, it will likely put Botox maker Allergan out of Valeant’s reach, despite the drugmaker’s willingness to raise its cash and stock offer above a current value of about $54 billion, two sources familiar with the matter said.  However, if the agreed price comes in lower and Actavis investors show skepticism over the deal by trading their shares lower, Valeant may consider a new approach, according to one of the sources familiar with Valeant’s thinking. Actavis, Allergan and Valeant declined to comment. Pershing Square was not available for comment. “I think Actavis is going to win,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. “Ackman is going to be content to take his profit on his Allergan shares and go onto the next battle.” The bid for Allergan has proven one of the most complex and unorthodox in the healthcare sector. Ackman disclosed in late April a nearly 10 percent stake in the drugmaker and plans to bid for the company together with Valeant.  Allergan’s resistance to the deal has led both sides to fight their cases with shareholders, in court and even raise the potential of alternate acquisitions. Allergan had held on-and-off discussions about purchasing Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd for more than $10 billion in cash, a deal that would have made it harder for Valeant to acquire the combined company.  Last week, Pershing Square unveiled an 8.5 percent stake in animal health company Zoetis Inc, another potential takeover target.

437,AGN,"UPDATE 2-Allergan near buyout of up to $65 bln to escape Valeant, Ackman -source","(Adds source comments on potential pricing and Valeant moves) By Olivia Oran and Svea Herbst-Bayliss Nov 16 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc is close to a buyout deal worth up to $65.5 billion by Actavis Plc, one that could end months of pursuit by Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals  and William Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, according to a person familiar with the matter. Actavis may pay Allergan between $215 and $220 per share, with the final price likely coming at the high end of that range, according to the source. A deal could be announced as early as Monday, the source said. If such a price materializes, it will likely put Botox maker Allergan out of Valeant’s reach, despite the drugmaker’s willingness to raise its cash and stock offer above a current value of about $54 billion, two sources familiar with the matter said. However, if the agreed price comes in lower and Actavis investors show skepticism over the deal by trading their shares lower, Valeant may consider a new approach, according to one of the sources familiar with Valeant’s thinking. Actavis, Allergan and Valeant declined to comment. Pershing Square was not available for comment. “I think Actavis is going to win,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. “Ackman is going to be content to take his profit on his Allergan shares and go onto the next battle.” The bid for Allergan has proven one of the most complex and unorthodox in the healthcare sector. Ackman disclosed in late April a nearly 10 percent stake in the drugmaker and plans to bid for the company together with Valeant. Allergan’s resistance to the deal has led both sides to fight their cases with shareholders, in court and even raise the potential of alternate acquisitions. Allergan had held on-and-off discussions about purchasing Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd for more than $10 billion in cash, a deal that would have made it harder for Valeant to acquire the combined company. Last week, Pershing Square unveiled an 8.5 percent stake in animal health company Zoetis Inc, another potential takeover target. Some viewed the move as possibly supplanting Ackman’s interest in Allergan. News of an imminent deal with Actavis comes ahead of a Dec. 18 special meeting of Allergan shareholders initiated by Ackman, who is seeking to replace several of Allergan’s board members and compel the company to enter takeover talks. “Ironically, the Allergan shareholders should send thank-you notes to Bill Ackman,” said Gordon, noting they may soon receive far more for their shares than they would have considered even six months ago.

440,AGN,S&P; 500 ends at record high; mergers offset Japan recession,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 edged up to close at a record high on Monday as deal activity worth $100 billion offset concerns about overseas growth after Japan’s economy slipped into recession. Shares of Baker Hughes, up 8.9 percent, and Allergan, up 5.3 percent, gave the S&P; 500 its biggest boost after Halliburton said it would buy Baker Hughes and Allergan agreed to be bought by Actavis.  The Nasdaq closed lower, weighed down by Google, which fell 1.5 percent to $546.64, and Gilead, down 1.6 percent at $100.44. “It shows the strength of the overall market that you could have this recession news out of Japan, and yet have the market inch upwards,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago.  But he said the outperformance of larger-cap names compared with smaller caps shows investors still are gravitating toward the more liquid investments. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.01 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,647.75, the S&P; 500 gained 1.5 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,041.32, a record closing high. Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.54 points, or 0.37 percent, to 4,671.00, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index ended down 0.8 percent. Shares of LinkedIn dropped 4.5 percent to $223.28. Facebook’s professional version of its social network will launch in the next few months that would compete with services such as LinkedIn, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

441,AGN,Allergan agrees to $66 billion Actavis offer; Valeant walks,"(Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Inc on Monday accepted a $66 billion takeover bid from Actavis Plc, ending a seven-month hostile pursuit by activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.     Dublin-based Actavis offered $219 per share in cash and stock, amounting to billions more than Canada’s Valeant was prepared to pay. Valeant said it would walk away from its Allergan campaign shortly after the deal was announced. Ackman was not available for comment. The deal marks a surprise win for Allergan, which had fought the Valeant-Pershing alliance in court and among shareholders in one of the healthcare sector’s most complex takeover efforts.  Allergan shares rose 5.3 percent to close at $209.20. Actavis gained 1.7 percent to $247.94. Allergan had argued that the Valeant cash-and-stock offer, most recently worth about $54 billion, would hurt its shareholders, given the Canadian drugmaker’s history of cutting research and development spending at companies it acquires. Besides the higher price tag, the Actavis deal came with only $400 million in R&D; cuts for Allergan, far less than the $900 million decrease that Valeant had proposed, the companies said on a conference call with investors.     Actavis’ approach may help the two companies integrate their operations and ensure some of Allergan’s promising experimental eye treatments for macular degeneration and glaucoma remain in the pipeline.  “If these bets turn out well, Actavis will be seen as a better call,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse. Ackman in late April disclosed a nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan and plans to bid for the company together with Valeant. Despite losing his takeover target, Ackman’s Pershing Square will earn at least $2.3 billion from Allergan’s buyout by Actavis.  The $18 billion hedge fund has roughly 30 percent of its capital invested in Allergan, whose share price has nearly doubled from the $126.54 it paid earlier this year.  Valeant, meanwhile, may find new acquisition targets more willing to push back on its overtures, some of its investors said. Actavis Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders said in an interview that he had reached out to Allergan CEO David Pyott many times during the Valeant-Ackman campaign to express his interest in a combination. “As he was in discussions, or the throes of battle, with Valeant and Pershing Square, we would connect from time to time,” Saunders said, “and I would let him know that we were a friend and we thought it made sense - from 10,000 feet - to combine the businesses.”  But talks with Actavis did not begin in earnest until a few weeks ago. Until then, Pyott had publicly fought to keep his company independent and told investors that Allergan was working on acquisitions that would pay off.  Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that they included discussions about a more than $10 billion deal for Salix Pharmaceuticals that did not materialize.  Allergan also sued Valeant and Ackman, saying that when the hedge fund teamed up with the drugmaker before it made the joint April offer, it broke insider trading rules.  Ackman and Valeant fought back with a proxy battle, seeking to replace Allergan board members and initiating a special shareholder meeting for Dec. 18 to compel the company to negotiate.  Under the buyout deal, Actavis will lead a combined company with $23 billion in revenue from Allergan’s ophthalmology, neurosciences, and dermatology business and Actavis’ gastroenterology and women’s health franchises. In the last two years, Actavis has purchased Forest Laboratories, which Saunders ran, and Warner Chilcott, which enabled it to move headquarters to Dublin. Actavis said it expected $1.8 billion in savings, on top of the $475 million in cuts that Allergan has already made this year. Valeant planned on savings of about $2.7 billion. The new company will operate from both California, where Allergan is based, and New Jersey. Its tax rate will be 15 percent compared with Allergan’s current rate of about 26 percent. Actavis was advised by JPMorgan and law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. JPMorgan, Mizuho Bank and Wells Fargo provided the deal financing.  Allergan was advised by Goldman Sachs & Co and BofA Merrill Lynch as well as law firms Latham & Watkins, Richards, Layton & Finger and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz.

The Japanese yen steadied against the U.S. dollar, pulling back from a fresh seven-year low, as the news set the stage for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to delay an unpopular sales tax hike and call an election two years before he has to. Japan’s economy shrank an annualized 1.6 percent, after a 7.3 percent drop in the second quarter, when a sales tax hike hit consumer spending. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 2.1 percent growth in the third quarter, but consumption and exports remained weak, saddling companies with big inventories. Tokyo’s Nikkei index lost 3 percent, its biggest one-day drop since August, and Wall Street was mixed in choppy trade. Brent oil initially fell more than $1 toward $78 a barrel, as Japan is the world’s No. 4 crude importer. “Concern about deceleration of economic growth particularly in Asia” weighed on markets, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. News that Allergan agreed to be bought by Actavis, while Halliburton said it would buy Baker Hughes in deals worth $100 billion, helped offset declines. Allergan and Baker Hughes were the top point gainers on the S&P; 500, up 5.5 percent and 10.4 percent, respectfully. Comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank is ready to do more if its stimulus is not enough to accelerate the euro zone recovery also offset declines. MSCI’s all-country world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, slipped 0.19 percent to 419.54. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 21.74 points, or 0.12 percent, at 17,656.48. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 1.06 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,040.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 12.87 points, or 0.27 percent, at 4,675.67. European shares rebounded, turning solidly positive after Draghi reasserted he was ready to do more to fight deflation. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0.51 percent to close at 1,352.01. Yields on most lower-rated euro zone bonds fell because Draghi said unconventional monetary policy measures could include buying sovereign debt. Italian 10-year bond yields fell 5 basis points to 2.29 percent, while equivalent Spanish yields  fell 3 basis points to 2.21 percent Brent crude fell 63 cents to $78.78 a barrel, after dipping as low as $77.94 a barrel earlier in the session. U.S. crude for December delivery was 61 cents lower at $75.21 a barrel. The dollar was last at 116.46 yen, or 0.16 percent higher, after earlier rising as high as 117.04 yen. The dollar also gained against the euro after a European Central Bank Executive Board member said the bank could theoretically extend purchases to gold, shares, exchange-traded funds or other assets if more action is needed to stimulate the region’s economy. The euro was last at $1.2451, down 0.56 percent. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell in choppy trading as investors took profits on gains fueled by the weak Japanese data. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last down 6/32 in price to yield 2.3417 percent.

447,AGN,"Actavis eyes short-dated debt, equity to buy Allergan","NEW YORK, Nov 17 (IFR) - Actavis will issue around US$27.5bn of new debt to finance its US$66bn acquisition of Botox-maker Allergan, but about half of it will be short-dated to help the company keep its investment-grade ratings. The acquisition will send the combined company’s gross debt leverage multiples to around 4.8 times,according to Fitch, in excess of what it would usually tolerate for a company it rates BBB-. Both Moody’s and Fitch said they would not downgrade Actavis to junk despite the increased debt, believing strong cash flow will enable it to bring leverage back down fairly quickly. In a move to preserve its investment-grade status, Actavis also said it would issue around US$9bn of new equity and mandatory convertible preferred shares, as well as US$28bn of new equity to Allergan shareholders to finance the deal. “Strong free cash flow will enable us to de-lever quickly to below 3.5 times debt to adjusted Ebitda within 12 months after close,” Actavis CEO Brent Saunders told analysts on a conference call on Monday after the deal was announced. “We expect to maintain our investment-grade rating following the close of this transaction.” Todd Joyce, the CFO, said around US$5bn of the new debt would be a short-dated term loan facility, and US$10bn of it short-term bonds of less than five years in duration. The remaining US$12.5bn of debt will have a maturity of longer than five years. The prospect of a such a deluge of bonds still sent Actavis spreads about 20bp wider, with its 3.85% 2024s spotted at 210bp over Treasuries mid-morning from a 190bp close on Friday. Analysts nevertheless said the financing package overall was better than expected from a credit standpoint. “Actavis management had previously indicated that in those very rare circumstances where it found a transformational asset worth pursuing, that it would consider taking its leverage ratio to 5.0-5.5x to exploit the exceedingly low interest rate environment,” wrote Cowen and Company equity analysts. Joyce said keeping the investment-grade rating drove the capital structure of the combined organization. “Investment-grade ratings are incredibly important to us, because it really allows us the flexibility longer term to finance our business at very attractive rates,” he said. The average weighted interest cost on the new debt financing is expected to be around 4.25%. “We laid out a range of options to the rating agencies and then agreed with them not only on the amount of equity versus debt that we were going to issue in connection with the transaction, but also (that) ... we look to ladder the new debt and the maturity schedule for those new borrowings.” JP Morgan, Mizuho and Wells Fargo have provided the underwriting commitment. The acquisition puts an end to a hostile bid by activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. The offer values Allergan at $219 per share and is US$6bn more than the price Valeant had last offered to pay. Valeant said in a statement that it could not justify paying such a high price for Allergan.

452,AGN,Ackman says supports Allergan's $66 billion sale to Actavis -CNBC,"Nov 18 (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman is supporting the $66 billion deal in which Actavis PLC  will buy Allergan Inc and plans to withdraw from an Allergan special shareholder meeting he had planned, CNBC television reported on Tuesday. Ackman, who had been fighting alongside Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc for control of Allergan, had called for the Allergan meeting to vote out board members and force the company to the table to consider their joint offer. The meeting is scheduled for Dec. 18 but the move means that there is no longer a need for it, CNBC said. Ackman’s comments come after Actavis said on Monday it would pay $219 per share for Allergan, billions more than Valeant was willing to pay. Ackman, who owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, had paper gains of more than $2.3 billion based on that price. CNBC reported that Ackman will meet with executives from Actavis later this week. Pershing Square did not respond to a request for comment.

Further support for equities came from U.S. producer prices that kept intact a trend of benign inflation and from higher homebuilder sentiment in November, while German analyst and investor sentiment advanced this month for the first time in almost a year. The S&P; 500 has risen in seven of the past eight sessions, but its largest gain was of less than 0.4 percent and overall volume has been low. The index gains on Tuesday stopped right at the 2,050 level. Allergan on Monday accepted a $66 billion takeover bid from Actavis Plc in cash and stock. At least two analysts raised Actavis’ price target, one to as high as $300. Actavis shares rose Tuesday 5.3 percent to $261.16 as the top percentage gainer on the S&P; 500. “There is more space for M&A;, companies are looking for areas to have growth,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston. “Healthcare stocks are doing well, but not as a defensive play, and it is a positive that stock prices are strong and stocks are being used as currency,” he said. At 10:45 a.m. EST (1545 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.65 points, or 0.12 percent, to 17,669.4, the S&P; 500 gained 6.41 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,047.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.38 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,694.38. The largest decliner on the S&P; was Urban Outfitters , down 8.8 percent the day after posting earnings. Solar company SunEdison rose 26.2 percent to $20.96 as it announced that, together with its unit TerraForm Power , it would buy First Wind for $2.4 billion to enter the U.S. wind power market. TerraForm shares jumped 26 percent to $32.57. Chinese solar company JA Solar Holdings reported its fourth straight quarterly profit, sending its shares up 5.6 percent.

454,AGN,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia stocks sag while Japan rebounds, euro dips","* Nikkei up 2.2 pct after big losses on GDP shock * Spreadbetters see slightly higher open for Europe * Euro dips amid expectations for more ECB easing By Hideyuki Sano and Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Asian stocks sagged on Tuesday amid profit taking in Hong Kong and Chinese markets, while Tokyo shares rebounded on expectations that Japan will opt for a snap election that may lead to fresh stimulus measures. Spreadbetters saw a slightly higher start for Europe in the wake of Japan’s rebound, forecasting Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC to open about 0.1 percent higher. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  dropped 0.3 percent. Hong Kong and Chinese shares fell for a second straight day after the debut of the landmark Hong Kong-Shanghai trading link as investors continued to lock in profits in stocks that had risen sharply ahead of the launch. Downbeat Chinese home prices data also dampened sentiment. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.9 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.7 percent. Tokyo’s Nikkei, in contrast, rose sharply as the market waited to see if Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call a snap election, delay a sales tax increase that had been planned for October next year, and consider further economic stimulus. The Nikkei gained 2.2 percent, erasing much of Monday’s 3 percent fall suffered when shock data showed Japan had slipped into recession. If he does call an election, Abe will hope his ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) will trounce a weak opposition to reaffirm its mandate to pursue reflationary economic policies. “While there has been some decline in the support rate for  Abe’s cabinet there has been no accompanying rise in the support for the opposition from the depressed level. We would therefore expect the main ruling LDP to maintain its majority and for Abenomics to continue,” said Miyuki Kashima, managing director at BNY Mellon Asset Management. “As a result, our positive view on the (Tokyo share) market remains unchanged.” Investors sold the euro on prospects of further easing by the European Central Bank, preferring to hold dollars as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates next year. ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank was ready to provide further stimulus if its current efforts are not sufficient to accelerate the region’s recovery, adding such new measures could include purchases of sovereign bonds. The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.2473, pulling further away from a 2 1/2-week high of $1.2580 hit the previous day. The dollar traded little changed at 116.605 yen, near a seven-year high of 117.06 struck in the wake of Monday’s shocking GDP data. The Australian dollar rained on expectations that it will benefit from investors turning away from the euro zone and Japan in search of higher yields. The Aussie rose 0.1 percent to $0.8719. “I see a risk for the AUD/USD to be squeezed higher because of capital flows into Australia,” said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Singapore. Gold lost momentum on the dollar’s strength, trading at $1,188.20, off a 2 1/2-week high of $1,193.95 hit on Monday. Oil prices sagged as recession in Japan, the world’s fourth largest crude importer, added to oversupply worries. But prices managed to hover above four-year lows as Russia and Venezuela appeared to be coordinating a price defence plan. U.S. crude futures were down 44 cents at $75.20 per barrel  but off Friday’s four-year low of $73.25.

455,AGN,Suvretta's Cowen says Actavis stock could nearly double,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After months of fending off a hostile bid, Allergan Inc (AGN.N) Chief Executive David Pyott made the right call in selling to rival Actavis Plc ACT.N, whose stock price could nearly double in the next two years, a prominent investor said on Wednesday. Pyott “did sell to the right company and we thought this was the right outcome,” hedge fund manager Aaron Cowen said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit about the year’s biggest pharmaceutical deal. Actavis will pay $219 a share for Allergan. Cowen said the company will be so attractive in the future that its share price could hit $400 in 12 to 24 months. Cowen’s $1.25 billion Suvretta Capital owned 392,000 shares of Allergan at the end of the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing in which the New York-based fund also said it owned 247,500 shares of Actavis. Botox-maker Allergan on Monday agreed to sell itself to Actavis for $66 billion, in a deal that came in far above the offer that rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) and hedge fund manager William Ackman had been making since the end of April. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund is Allergan’s biggest investor with a nearly 10 percent stake, had been highly critical of Pyott and his board, saying they failed shareholders by steadfastly rejecting the Valeant deal. Cowen said Pyott had missed the fact that Allergan’s balance sheet was inefficient and he failed to take advantage of tax arbitrage. “When you have a profitable business, fat margin costs can creep in,” Cowen said. Valeant planned deep cost cuts. Ackman’s relentless push for Allergan to sell itself helped pave the way for a rival bidder to appear. Allergan’s share price surged to $212.54, nearly doubling since January. “We owned Allergan before Ackman got involved but we welcomed his activism,” said Cowen, who worked at Soros Fund Management and SAC Capital Advisors before launching his fund. Actavis’ share price has climbed 57.9 percent to $265.05 since January. Low interest rates are helping fuel the current mergers and acquisition boom, and Cowen expects the pace of consolidation to pick up next year. “We still like the pharma space it is a good place to be, it is not expensive.”      Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits ",11192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-yearend-suvretta/suvrettas-cowen-says-actavis-stock-could-nearly-double-idUSKCN0J32DY20141119

Pershing Square, run by billionaire William Ackman, had been working with Valeant for a deal for the Canadian drugmaker to buy Allergan.

461,AGN,Ackman's Pershing Square sees big payoff from Allergan deal,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund mogul William Ackman told investors they could see a $6 billion payday when he closes the chapter on Allergan Inc., his firm’s biggest bet of 2014. One week after Allergan agreed to sell itself to rival Actavis Plc., Ackman wrote in his quarterly investment letter that his Pershing Square Capital Management, the Botox-maker’s biggest investor, still owns 26.6 million shares.  At the end of the third quarter Ackman’s $18 billion fund owned 28.87 million Allergan shares, a regulatory filing showed. While this isn’t the deal the activist investor originally wanted - he had been pushing since April for rival Valeant buy Allergan - it will be lucrative all the same. “If we hold the shares until transaction closure, we will receive $3.4 billion in cash and 9.81 million shares of Actavis worth $2.6 billion at current value,” the letter said. Currently Pershing Square’s stake is worth $5.64 billion and the stock was trading at a $15.70 discount to the transaction value, which translates into about a 19 percent annualized return assuming the deal closes next April. Ackman’s firm is having one of its best years ever with a 35 percent gain for the year through the end of October. The average hedge fund has gained only 2 percent and the broader S&P; 500 index has gained about 13 percent. The battle for Allergan has captivated Wall Street for months, with Pershing Square waging court battles and finally winning a special meeting where it planned to replace many Allergan directors. Speculation has mounted recently over what Ackman planned to do with his holding, especially after he announced a stake in animal health company Zoetis Inc two weeks ago.  Sounding a conciliatory note, Ackman said he now supports the Actavis deal and said his team had been impressed with Actavis Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders and his business plan for the combined company after a recent meeting. In terms of other investments, Ackman said he still likes his short bet against Herbalife Ltd, which he disclosed publicly for the first time two years ago, and said it paid off well during the third quarter when it added 3.2 percent to the fund’s performance.

464,AGN,Actavis aims to add Allergan CEO to its board: sources,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) Chief Executive David Pyott is close to joining the board of directors of Actavis Plc ACT.N, which reached a deal to buy the Botox-maker for $66 billion in November, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Actavis CEO Brent Saunders is trying to recruit Pyott to join the board and is working through corporate governance issues, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. They said Saunders described the plan at a small meeting with shareholders during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco this week. One investor who attended the meeting told Reuters that adding Pyott to the board could lend more credibility to Actavis’s efforts to integrate Allergan into its operations. Actavis said in November that two members of the Allergan board would be invited to join the board of the combined company, but did not specify what Pyott’s new role would be. If Pyott were to join the Actavis board, he would be considered a non-independent board member because of his ties to the acquired company, bringing the number of non-independent board members at Actavis to three. They include Saunders and Executive Chairman Paul Bisaro. While proxy advisory firms like ISS do not have guidelines on the precise number of non-independent directors they like to see on a board, outsiders typically view a board more favorably if it has fewer non-independent directors. Actavis said in December it would replace the majority of Allergan’s top executives once the deal closes, with the exception of Allergan president Doug Ingram who will serve as a special adviser to Saunders. The deal, which thwarted a seven months-long hostile attempt by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) to buy Allergan, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.

Ingram has now accepted an advisory role to facilitate the merger and will soon be looking for a job outside the combined company.

To be sure, Ingram has many options.

We had a really exciting vision for this company and people were very much behind me,” Ingram said.  Ingram will get more than $26 million in cash, stock and benefits as a payout for the merger, a regulatory filing shows. His total compensation in 2013 was $3.6 million. Ingram focused on running Allergan’s core business over the last year while 61-year-old CEO David Pyott, who was preparing for his retirement, served as Allergan’s public face and met with investors to defend the company from a hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO).

469,AGN,"Actavis to take Allergan name, reflecting brand-drug focus","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Actavis Plc ACT.N, a generic drugmaker that has been steadily acquiring branded medicines, said it will change its name to Allergan Inc after it completes its planned $66 billion purchase of the Botox maker, signaling its growing focus on patent-protected drugs. Allergan’s medicine chest is chock full of branded drugs, which command far higher prices than generics. They include Botox, a $2.3 billion-a-year anti-wrinkle drug also used to treat migraine headaches and other ailments. The company also has a leading portfolio of eye treatments, facial fillers and medical devices. Actavis, which began as a New Jersey-based generics company called Watson, took its current name after it bought Swiss drugmaker Actavis Group in 2012, a deal that made it the world’s third largest generic company. It then beefed up its slate of branded drugs by purchasing Forest Laboratories and Warner Chilcott, which enabled it to move its headquarters to tax-friendly Dublin. Fourth-quarter sales of Actavis’s branded drugs nearly tripled to $1.83 billion in North America, accounting for 45 percent of total revenue, the company said on Wednesday.   Generic drug sales rose 1 percent to $1.78 billion. Actavis posted a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, saying it expected strong sales of new branded drugs. It agreed to buy Allergan Inc (AGN.N) last November, outbidding a hostile offer by activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO). Actavis said drugs in its pipeline could bring in $9 billion in revenue once approved. The company said it expects products in women’s health, anti-infectives and bowel drugs to support sales in the near future, even as it continues to focus on making copycat versions of drugs. “We remain focused on the development of complex generic products with barriers to entry that support longer-term value in this competitive pharmaceutical segment,” said Actavis CEO Brent Saunders, who held a meeting with investors in New York on Wednesday. Actavis has more than 200 generic drug marketing applications pending with the U.S. health regulator. For the full year, Actavis said it expects an adjusted profit of $16.30-$17.30 per share on revenue of about $15 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $16.63 per share on revenue of $15.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Actavis earned $3.91 per share on an adjusted basis. Analysts on average had expected $3.67, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company expects the Allergan deal to close late this quarter or early second quarter 2015. Company shares were down 1.5 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid moderate declines for the drug sector.

473,AGN,Exclusive: Ackman's Pershing Square makes $3.3 billion bet on Valeant,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman has purchased a five percent stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) (VRX.N), his hedge fund said on Monday, making him the Canadian drug company’s fifth-largest stakeholder. Ackman’s $20 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund began building up the $3.3 billion stake, only months after its vocal effort to help Valeant buy Botox-maker Allergan (AGN.N) failed, a source familiar with the investment told Reuters. The source, who asked not to be named, said the fund would take a passive approach to Valeant, instead of pressuring it to change management or pursue strategic options, as it does with most of its investments. Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said “we have a good working relationship with Pershing Square and welcome them as shareholders.” Valeant shares were up nearly 2.5 percent at $203.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The drug maker’s Toronto-listed shares gained about 2.4 percent to C$256.52. Known as one of corporate America’s noisiest agitators, Ackman was the top performer in the realm of large hedge fund managers last year with a 40 percent return. His Pershing Square has notched big wins at railway firm Canadian Pacific (CP.TO) and shopping mall operator General Growth Properties (GGP.N), and also made money with its Allergan stake. Valeant sought Ackman’s help in early 2014 to buy Allergan, leaving the hedge fund to spend roughly $4 billion to build its 9.7 percent stake in the Botox-maker. But Allergan rejected Valeant’s overtures, sued the hedge fund and instead sold itself to rival Actavis in November. While working with Valeant on the takeover bid, Ackman could not buy Valeant shares. All restrictions fell away when the deal fell through, leaving him able to buy in, paying just under $200 per share initially, the source said. Last month, Valeant bought Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion, pushing its share price up further.  Some investment industry sources had speculated that Ackman would press for a deal between Valeant and animal health company Zoetis (ZTS.N), in which Ackman has a $2 billion stake and a Pershing Square partner on the board. But the source said Pershing Square would take a passive approach because Ackman had faith in Valeant’s management, including its chief executive officer, Michael Pearson, who has slashed costs, cut the company’s tax rate by moving it to  Canada and turned it into a serial acquirer during his seven years as CEO. Pershing Square confirmed on Monday that its various funds had bought more than 16.4 million shares of Valeant, representing 4.9 percent of the company. It said that Valeant now made up 16.9 percent of Pershing Square Holdings (PSH.AS), a fund that was publicly listed last year.  The options on the U.S.-listed shares of Valeant were unusually busy over the last two weeks with average daily volume of about 15,000 contracts, more than twice the average for the last 200 days, according to Trade Alert data. Bets on the shares rising above $210 by April 17 were the most active with more than 16,000 contracts traded over the last two weeks.

478,AGN,Actavis expects Allergan business to drive 2015 growth,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Actavis Plc ACT.N expects its full-year revenue to rise at least 57 percent, helped by double-digit growth from the Allergan business it bought in March. Sales of Allergan products for 15 days and the drugs acquired with the Forest Laboratories deal helped Actavis beat revenue estimate in the quarter ended March 31.  Allergan business contributed $258 million to Actavis net revenue in the quarter. Actavis, whose shares were up 3 percent, outbid Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) and activist investor William Ackman in November in their seven-month pursuit for the Botox maker. Actavis forecast 2015 revenue of $20.5 billion to $21 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company expects revenue of $22 billion to $22.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $21.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts termed Actavis forecast “conservative” and said the drugmaker usually raises its forecast as the year progresses. “The new guidance should provide investors with confidence that Actavis is well on its way of delivering on the promises of cost cuts and growth,” BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris wrote. The third largest generic drugmaker forecast a full-year adjusted profit of $17.00 to $18.50 per share, largely above analysts’ average expectation of $17.70.  “As we have mentioned before, we believe the Allergan business was firing on all cylinders and will provide notable strength and earnings reliability to the Actavis business,” analyst Maris said.     Sales of Allergan products, including Botox, rose 13 percent in the first quarter, Actavis said.  Actavis reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue as sales of branded drugs in North America tripled.  Higher sales of its treatment for dementia of Alzheimer’s type, and female health products pushed up branded sales. Actavis gained dementia drug Namenda when it bought Forest Laboratories in July.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned $4.30 per share, handily beating analysts expectation of $3.93 per share.  Revenue rose 60 percent to $4.23 billion, above the estimated $4.03 billion. Quarterly sales of its branded drugs in North America was $1.72 billion. Actavis shares were up about 3.5 percent at $303.18 in midday trading.

483,AGN,"Eli Lilly wins UK Alimta drug patent case on appeal, shares jump","LONDON (Reuters) - Eli Lilly has won a patent case in the Court of Appeal in London over its blockbuster Alimta lung cancer drug, boosting prospects for future sales and dealing a blow to generic challenger Actavis, now renamed Allergan. Alimta generated worldwide sales of $2.79 billion for Lilly last year, making the medicine its biggest-selling product. Shares in the U.S. drugmaker jumped 5 percent on Thursday. The verdict, which reverses a 2014 decision by the English High Court, will also apply to France, Italy and Spain under a legal system of corresponding declarations. The London appeals court ruled Actavis’s plan to market certain alternative salt forms of Alimta — known generically as pemetrexed — after the basic patent on the medicine expires in December 2015 would indirectly infringe another Lilly patent. The additional patent is valid to 2021 and covers the administration of two nutrients, folic acid and vitamin B12, that are given to patients before and while they receive Alimta to prevent side effects.  Lilly said that the latest ruling “increases the likelihood that the vitamin regimen patents for Alimta will provide exclusivity in the UK, France, Italy and Spain through June 2021”. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson estimated Alimta sales in the four countries totaled between $400 million and $500 million in 2014, and the drug’s high margins meant continuing revenue streams to 2021 would boost earnings per share (EPS)significantly. “By our estimate, this could boost Lilly’s EPS by nearly 10 percent annually from 2016 to 2020,” he wrote in a note.    Analysts at Cowen also increased earnings estimates for the company and raised their price target for the stock to $90 from $85. Lilly shares have enjoyed a strong run recently on growing hopes for its experimental drug solanezumab, an Alzheimer’s disease treatment once considered a dud. Litigation over Alimta patents is continuing in the United States, where the consensus view is currently that Lilly is likely to prevail.  In Germany, by contrast, the argument has gone against Lilly, following a decision in March by an appeal court there that Actavis would not infringe Lilly’s patent if it sold its product after December 2015.

484,AGN,"UPDATE 2-Anacor skin cream succeeds in studies, fuels takeover expectations","* Data enhances chances of takeover - stakeholder, analysts * Drug expected to be blockbuster - stakeholder, analysts * Shares rise 50 pct to record high   (Adds analyst, fund manager and executive comments; updates shares) By Vidya L Nathan and Natalie Grover July 13 (Reuters) - Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc’s  experimental skin ointment succeeded in late-stage studies, taking the drugmaker a step closer to having a potential blockbuster in its portfolio and raising expectations that it could be taken over. The company’s shares, which have more than quadrupled in the past year up to Friday’s close, rose more than 50 percent on Monday to a life high of $127.19. “Personally, I’d love to see Anacor independent a little bit longer, but I don’t think its going to happen,” said Paul Yook, portfolio manager at BioShares Biotechnology Funds, which holds a stake in the drugmaker. Analysts said they expected the ointment to eclipse $1 billion in sales and potentially be prescribed as a first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis, an unsightly skin condition characterized by itchiness and inflammation. That could make Anacor an attractive target. Potential bidders could include Novartis AG, Allergan Plc and Japan’s Astellas Pharma Inc, among others, Yook said. Yook said he expected any offer for Anacor to be at a per share premium of 50-90 percent. That compares with the 23.5 percent premium Allergan agreed to pay for Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc and its double-chin product in a $2.1 billion deal in June. Anacor represents the “holy grail of biotech company investment,” Yook said, pointing to the company’s robust portfolio, including the potential blockbuster skin ointment that Anacor is developing without a partner. The ointment, Crisaborole, cleared two late-stage studies testing it for use in atopic dermatitis and was successful in both children and adults, the company said. Atopic dermatitis affects about 18-25 million people in the United States, mostly infants and children, Anacor said. Existing treatments include topical cortical steroids, which can weaken skin, and non-steroidal treatments, such as Novartis AG’s Elidel and Astellas Pharma US Inc’s  Protopic, which have been linked with cancer. Other companies developing treatments for atopic dermatitis include Oculus Innovative Sciences Inc, Pfizer Inc , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Celsus Therapeutics Plc. Palo Alto, California-based Anacor said it expects to submit a marketing application for the drug in the first half of 2016. Wedbush Securities’s David Nierengarten said Crisaborole’s safety and efficacy profile would make it the best product in its class. Shares of the company, which is also testing Crisaborole for psoriasis, were up 48.4 percent at $125.60 on Monday, making them the top percentage gainer on the Nasdaq.

491,AGN,Allergan bid may be healthier for Teva than battle with Mylan,"TEL AVIV, July 26 (Reuters) - After months of sparring in a hostile takeover bid for rival Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceutical’s move to buy Allergan Plc’s  generic drug business instead could be a smoother ride that will bring bigger returns, faster. Israel-based Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, is in advanced talks to buy Allergan’s generic drugs unit for between $40-45 billion dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the deal broke on Saturday after Teva’s $40 billion bid for Mylan hit a snag when a Dutch foundation linked to Mylan bought temporary control of half the company in an attempt to block the takeover. A Teva spokesman declined to comment on possible talks with Allergan. Though the Teva-Mylan feud has hogged the industry spotlight since April, Allergan’ generics business may actually have been Teva’s first choice. Teva CEO Erez Vigodman is believed to have approached Allergan last year, which was called Actavis prior to a March merger. In June 2014, just a few months after joining the company himself, Vigodman hired the former head of Actavis’ generic drug business, Sigurdur Olafsson, to fill a similar role at Teva. “There was previously a preference for Actavis over Mylan but for some reason it didn’t materialise,” said Bank of Jerusalem analyst Jonathan Kreizman. Should the deal with Dublin-based Allergan now go through, there will be two big upsides for Teva, he said. First, there is less overlap than with Mylan. Teva has been planning a generic version of Mylan’s EpiPen, a billion-dollar product, while Mylan has been working on a generic version of Teva’s best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. In the short term, Teva would benefit from removing the uncertainty over the outcome of the Mylan deal that has weighed on its stock. Since hitting a year high of $68.74 in New York on April 9, just before speculation on a possible Mylan bid had surfaced, Teva shares are down more than 10 percent, closing on Friday at $61.85. Kreizman said he assumes the size of the deal would be similar in scope to Mylan, noting Allergan has about 8 percent of the U.S. drugs market, compared with 9 percent for Mylan and 14 percent for Teva. “Assuming the entity is more or less the same size, valuation is less of an issue,” he said. The Mylan deal is hard for the market to digest, he said, while “any friendly transaction ... would have better impact.” Allergan’s generics operations has about $7 billion in sales, said Umer Raffat, an analyst with investment research firm ISI Group. “Theoretically, a Teva/Allergan generics business combo offers Teva the opportunity to get what it was looking for without having to go through Dutch courts,” he said. This includes boosting its scale and getting access to complex generics like injectables as well as biosimilar drugs through Allergan’s partnership with Amgen on oncology biologic drugs, he said.

492,AGN,Teva nears deal for Allergan's generic drugs unit: source,"(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) is in advanced talks to buy Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) generic drug business following a thus far unsuccessful effort to acquire peer Mylan NV (MYL.O), according to a person familiar with the matter. Jerusalem-based Teva, which has offered to buy Mylan for $40 billion, is now close to an agreement to acquire Dublin-based Allergan’s generic drugs unit for between $40 billion and $45 billion, the person said on Saturday. A deal could be announced as early as next week, the person said, cautioning that negotiations had not yet been completed and asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. Teva and Allergan representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Large drug makers are trying to realign their operations to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers are seeking larger scale. Allergan’s branded drugs business makes products such as Botox and Alzheimer’s drug Namenda. Its generics business makes up about a third of the company’s total revenue. A successful deal with Allergan would give Teva, which has a market capitalization of $60 billion, a much bigger footprint in the generic drugs sector. It would also offer opportunities for significant cost synergies and tax savings. Last year, Actavis Plc outbid Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) and activist investor William Ackman to merge with Allergan and adopt its name. Allergan now has a market capitalization of $121 billion. Teva’s bid for Mylan took a hit earlier this week when the latter’s independent Dutch foundation exercised a call option allowing it to buy 50 percent of Mylan’s total issued and outstanding capital, giving it temporary control of half the company. The foundation, known as Stichting, opposes Teva’s bid, arguing that a Teva takeover would likely lead to job losses at Mylan and reduce access to cheap generic medicines in emerging markets. Mylan for its part is pressing on with a $34 billion hostile bid for Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N). Were Teva to clinch a deal with Allergan for its generic drug business and drop its bid for Mylan, this would likely strengthen the hand of Mylan’s management in its campaign to buy Perrigo.

494,AGN,"Teva to buy Allergan generic business for $40.5 bln, drops Mylan bid","TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries will pay $40.5 billion in cash and stock for Allergan’s generic drugs business, solidifying Teva’s position as the world’s No. 1 maker of generics while freeing Allergan to focus on branded drugs, paying down debt and potential “transformational” acquisitions. The deal, the largest in Israel’s corporate history, allows Teva stronger economies of scale, crucial in the low-margin generic drugs business. Teva , which dropped its hostile pursuit of Mylan, will likely have to sell off some drugs to allay antitrust concerns. “Allergan’s business is more high-end (than Mylan). It’s a more interesting business ... a profitable business and it’s well managed,” said Gilad Alper, an analyst at brokerage Excellence Nessuah. Allergan, known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, became the third-largest generic drugmaker in the United States after combining with Actavis in March. It is seen as a better fit than Mylan because it will improve Teva’s distribution channels and access to profitable injectable drugs. Pressure has been growing on Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman to find new revenue sources to combat generic competition for its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. Copaxone accounts for about half of Teva’s profit. Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, who led Actavis’ purchase of Forest Laboratories and then Allergan, said the company will use the $36 billion in net proceeds from the generics sale to help fund further large acquisitions. “We can accelerate our timing on transformational M&A;,” Saunders said during a conference call. He cited aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal therapies as areas for potential future deals. Wall Street analysts speculated that possible targets include Biogen Inc , Amgen Inc and AbbVie Inc. The healthcare sector has seen an unprecedented wave of deals since early 2014, from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals, to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers. Global healthcare M&A; reached $398.5 billion as of July 23, up 80 percent on a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Teva shares, which had been weighed down by the Mylan uncertainty, rose 16.4 percent in New York on Monday. Allergan shares gained about 6.1 percent and Mylan shares slid 14.5 percent. Mylan had used a poison pill-style defence to fight a $40 billion takeover by Teva, arguing that a deal was “without sound industrial logic or cultural fit” and would face regulatory hurdles. The company said on Monday it would continue efforts to buy Perrigo Company PLC, whose shares were up 3.8 percent. Teva may need to sell a large number of assets to satisfy antitrust authorities about the Allergan transaction, according to two antitrust attorneys who handle pharmaceutical deals. “But if you look at the total size of the deal, that’s going to be a tiny fraction,” one of the lawyers said. It may also be harder to find buyers for those drugs given the consolidation already seen in the generics sector, they said. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission requires buyers for proposed divestitures before it will approve a deal. Teva said it has identified asset sales needed for the deal to pass muster with U.S. and UK antitrust regulators, and that the number was less than what had been anticipated in a combination with Mylan. Teva said it had approached Allergan a year ago but did not generate interest. It then went after Mylan, which repeatedly rebuffed its offers, and only turned its attention back to Allergan earlier this month. In June 2014, Vigodman hired Sigurdur Olafsson, former head of Actavis’s generic drug business, to fill a similar role at Teva. “My sense always was that Mylan was Teva’s Plan B,” said Benny Landa, an industrialist who led an investor bid last year to shake up Teva’s board, calling the deal “brilliant.” Teva will pay $33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion in shares, representing a 10 percent stake in the Israel-based company, Teva said. It expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2016. Vigodman said the combined company will have proforma revenue of $26 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $9.5 billion in 2016. “This acquisition reinforces our strategy, accelerates growth and diversifies revenues both by product and geographically, supporting our new business model,” he said. Teva, which will gain a portfolio of more than 1,000 products, forecast a double-digit boost to adjusted earnings per share in 2016 and a more than 20 percent benefit in years two and three after closing the deal. It expects cost synergies and tax savings of $1.4 billion annually by the third anniversary from efficiencies in operations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. It also expects the acquisition to generate free cash flow of $6.5 billion in 2016 and increased free cash flow in subsequent years. This means Teva will be able to pursue acquisitions to expand its portfolio in both speciality pharmaceuticals and generics. J.P.

496,AGN,"Allergan CEO, fresh off one deal, sets sights on others","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan plc CEO Brent Saunders is ready to put the $36 billion his company will net from the sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to work, possibly with another large, “transformational” merger. The readiness for a new transaction just after the Teva deal was announced on Monday represents what Saunders calls a strategy to remain nimble and open to opportunity as the healthcare sector remakes itself. Saunders has already shown a penchant for quick deal-making. Just last year, he helped orchestrate the $25 billion sale of Forest Laboratories Inc, where he was CEO, to Actavis Plc. As head of Actavis, he then sealed a $66 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan, beating out rival suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its acquisition partner, hedge fund billionaire William Ackman. The latest deal had just closed in March and Saunders was busy integrating the two companies under the Allergan name. At the time, he did not consider unloading the generics assets of Actavis. “While I had a different strategy a few months ago, the thing that sets us apart ... is our strategy to be nimble,” Saunders said in an interview.  Saunders now plans to use the proceeds from its $40.5 billion asset sale to Teva to increase the size of existing drug businesses, expand into new therapy areas and pursue larger deals.  He declined to discuss any specific targets, a list Wall Street that analysts speculated may include Biogen Inc, AbbVie Inc and Amgen Inc. “Clearly we are watching many companies - we have been for some time - but what has changed is our timeline for being able to execute has accelerated, if the opportunity presents itself,” Saunders said. The $40.5 billion cash-and-stock sale of generic drugs business to Teva is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.  That will essentially “reload” Allergan’s balance sheet for more acquisitions, Saunders added. When asked if Allergan planned to spend the cash within 18 months, he replied that the company would, as long as it could maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Saunders said his change of direction for Allergan came only a few weeks ago when Teva CEO Erez Vigodman called to make an offer. Vigodman had already approached Actavis earlier in the year, but the company was not interested at that time. “To be fair, I didn’t think it was a good idea to sell it until Erez called me and put a compelling offer on the table,” Saunders said. “It caused me to step back and think about the industry and the dynamics.” The healthcare industry has consolidated in the past year, with pharmacies and distributors aligning through merger deals or purchasing agreements that give them more leverage over prices for generic drugs. These deals, such as CVS Health’s purchases of Target Corp’s pharmacies and the Omnicare specialty pharmacies and distributor McKesson Corp’s purchasing agreement with pharmacy Rite Aid Corp, will force more consolidation among generics makers so they can compete, Saunders said. Two of the largest U.S. health insurers - Humana Inc and Cigna Corp - have also agreed to be bought in the past month, signaling fresh pressure on prices, Saunders said. Of the seven main therapeutic areas that Allergan will focus on after the generics sale, he said there are four with the strongest opportunities in terms of unmet medical care: aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system therapies and gastrointestinal therapies. Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Asset Management, which owns Allergan shares, said Saunders should look for something with a reasonable risk versus reward profile. “If it were my $40 billion, I would probably do four or five deals in the $10 billion range, aiming for late-stage drug programs where you have some idea if the drug works,” Funtleyder said.

504,AGN,Teva's MS drug Copaxone has strong second-quarter sales,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.N), which this week revealed plans to buy Allergan’s (AGN.N) generics drugs business in a $40.5 billion deal, said on Thursday sales of its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone rose 12 percent in the second quarter even though it faces new competition. Teva, the world’s biggest generic drug maker, said that global Copaxone sales rose to $1.1 billion in the April-June quarter and it held a 31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States. Sales of the best-selling drug, had dropped 14 percent in the first quarter. Sandoz, part of Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG NOVM.VX, and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA.O) in June launched a once daily 20 mg version of Copaxone called Glatopa. To stem the tide of generic competition, Teva has been moving patients to a three times a week 40 mg version of Copaxone, which the company said accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States.    Pressure had been growing on Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman to find new revenue sources to combat generic competition for Copaxone, which accounts for about half of Teva’s profit and 20 percent of revenue. Teva has already published some details of its results on Monday when it unveiled its proposed purchase of Allergan’s generics business. This is the largest deal in Israel’s corporate history and aims to give Teva greater economies of scale, crucial in the low-margin generic drugs business. Teva on Thursday reiterated that it recorded quarterly earnings of $1.43 per diluted share excluding one-off items, up from $1.25 a year earlier and well above analysts’ estimates of $1.31 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in the quarter slipped 2 percent to $4.97 billion but rose 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the sale of U.S. over-the-counter plants.

510,AGN,Allergan CEO says better to leave discoveries to others,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - Allergan, which is selling its generics business to focus on branded drugs and aesthetics products, aims to acquire or license products that have already shown promise in studies, and leave the riskier discovery process to small biotechs and academic researchers. “The best way for us to participate in discovery is investing in a more ‘virtual’ sense, than actually building and running our own labs,” company Chief Executive Brent Saunders said in an interview after Allergan reported second-quarter results on Thursday. Dublin-based drugmaker Actavis in March acquired Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment and eye medicines, and took the Allergan name. Last week, in another major reshaping, Allergan agreed to sell its generics to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  for $40.5 billion. That would leave Allergan with an array of prescription drugs and aesthetics products with far higher profit margins than generics. Saunders said discovery research, where researchers test ideas and compounds in test tubes and animals, typically eats up about 30 percent of pharmaceutical company research budgets, although only about one of every 20 such products that enters human trials succeeds and is approved. “Discovery is where the industry has its lowest return on investment,” he said, “and not a good (use) of Allergan’s research dollars.” Instead, he said Allergan will acquire products from companies that have already done the research spadework, and then itself develop the medicines and submit them for regulatory approvals. “The quality of the science and leadership in these smaller biotechs has improved vastly over the last few years and there is a whole ecosystem of discovery that we can tap into via partnerships, collaborations and mergers and acquisitions,” Saunders said. Allergan has almost 1,400 scientists at its research sites in California and in New Jersey, following about 200 layoffs since the Actavis/Allergan merger. There is no shame in them harnessing the ideas and inventions of others, he said, pointing out that Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp have spun life-saving drugs and commercial riches from the same formula - Gilead in its treatments for hepatitis C and Celgene from its oncology drugs. “They are often admired as some of the most innovative and forward-looking biotech companies, and they deploy the same model we do.” ",8062015,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-medicine/allergan-ceo-says-better-to-leave-discoveries-to-others-idUSL1N10H3EO20150806

529,AGN,"Pfizer, Allergan drug merger talks raise tax hackles in U.S.","(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells. Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland’s lower tax rates. Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77. Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes. A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates. “Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called ‘inversions,’ where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,” Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said. Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: “The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.” From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul. “These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,” he said in a statement. “We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave.”  Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country’s 10th largest company to Ireland. Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan’s U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday. Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes. “Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,” Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. “I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.” Pfizer’s effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan’s is 15 percent. Given that both sides characterized the talks as “friendly,” Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc’s board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year. “It’s definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,” said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. “The hurdle will really be the price.” Moody’s Investor Service said the deal would have “credit positive implications for both companies.” A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy.  Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal.  Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines. Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.  A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer’s long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world’s top-selling medicine. It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent. Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva. Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling. Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO. The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan. Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan’s wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment. By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.

530,AGN,Pfizer-Allergan sparks fresh tax inversion angst on Capitol Hill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc faces political risks in Washington if it proceeds with a bid for Allergan, but with little chance of legislation to curb such tax inversion deals, the Obama administration may be able to throw up only limited obstacles. Lawmakers are widely seen as unlikely to tackle major tax code changes before the 2016 presidential election, but they were already scolding Pfizer publicly on Thursday, showing that companies considering inversion deals do face reputational risk.  “When corporations choose to invert and don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab. That isn’t right,” said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin in a statement. Durbin has voiced similar views on prior inversions, including one that was abandoned by retailer Walgreen. An inversion deal typically involves a U.S. company buying a foreign company and then relocating corporate headquarters, on paper at least, to the foreign company’s home country, with the goal of reducing the combined company’s overall taxes. New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said they have not reached an agreement and declined to give details. A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, which could create the world’s largest drugmaker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Ireland has been a frequent redomiciling destination for U.S. corporations fleeing the U.S. tax system, though most of them leave their actual core operations in the United States. The latest wave of inversions crested in late 2014, when the Obama administration cracked down, making it harder both to do the deals and to realize their benefits.  A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said further actions could be taken, but stressed that only Congress can slam the door completely. Among the department’s options is tightening rules against a tax-dodging technique known as “earnings stripping” that is often a key component of inversions. This practice involves shifting profits earned in the United States to a lower-tax jurisdiction. “We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action but there is a limit to what we can do administratively. Congress must take action to end this loophole‎,” the Treasury spokesperson said in a statement. Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank, agreed that earnings stripping was a good place for the Treasury to start. “Otherwise you leave a loophole and incentive for these combinations to continue,” he said.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.72 points, or 0.13 percent, to 17,755.8, the S&P; 500 lost 0.94 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,089.41 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 21.42 points, or 0.42 percent, to 5,074.27. The three indexes recovered much of the day’s losses late in the session. After the bell, U.S.-listed shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals  fell 11.5 percent to $98.63, extending losses from the regular session, when it dropped 4.7 percent to end at $111.50. Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health Corp  said they had dropped Philidor Rx, a specialty pharmacy used by Valeant, from their networks in a sign the fall-out from the drugmaker’s connection with the specialty pharmacy is spreading. Also after the close, shares of LinkedIn jumped 12.4 percent to $244 as it reported earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations. The S&P; healthcare sector ended the session up 0.4 percent, making it the top-performing sector, as Allergan’s shares  shot up 6 percent to $304.38. The Botox maker confirmed it was in buyout talks with Pfizer. Pfizer dropped 1.9 percent. Sixty percent of the S&P; 500 companies have reported quarterly results so far. Analysts now expect overall third-quarter profit to decline a modest 1.7 percent, compared with the 4.2 percent drop forecast on Oct. 1, according to Thomson Reuters data. NXP Semiconductors sank 19.7 percent to $73 after its bleak forecast. The slide took down other chipmakers, with the broader semiconductor index down 3 percent. F5 Networks Inc shares fell 9.3 percent to $110.08 after a disappointing outlook, making it the biggest percentage loser in the S&P; 500 technology index. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,852 to 1,185, for a 1.56-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,820 issues fell and 959 advanced for a 1.90-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 6 lows; the Nasdaq recorded 102 new highs and 76 new lows.

533,AGN,"UPDATE 5-Pfizer, Allergan drug merger talks raise tax hackles in U.S.","(Adds Hillary Clinton comment, updates shares) By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson Oct 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells. Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland’s lower tax rates. Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77. Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes. A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates. “Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called ‘inversions,’ where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,” Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said. Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: “The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.” From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul. “These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,” he said in a statement. “We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave.” Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country’s 10th largest company to Ireland. Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan’s U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday. Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes. “Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,” Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. “I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.” Pfizer’s effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan’s is 15 percent. Given that both sides characterized the talks as “friendly,” Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc’s  board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year. “It’s definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,” said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. “The hurdle will really be the price.” Moody’s Investor Service said the deal would have “credit positive implications for both companies.” A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy. Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal. Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines. Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   for $40.5 billion. A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer’s long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world’s top-selling medicine. It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent. Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva. Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling. Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO. The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan. Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan’s wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment. By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.

534,AGN,"UPDATE 3-Allergan unit to plead guilty to healthcare fraud, pay $125 mln","(Adds Allergan CEO comment) By Jonathan Stempel Oct 29 (Reuters) - Warner Chilcott US Sales LLC, now part of Botox maker Allergan Plc, agreed to plead guilty to felony healthcare fraud and pay $125 million to resolve U.S. charges that it paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe several of its drugs. The U.S. Department of Justice, which announced the settlement, also said former Warner Chilcott President W. Carl Reichel was arrested in Boston on Thursday and charged with one count of conspiring to pay kickbacks. At least four other people have pleaded guilty or been charged over Warner Chilcott’s activities, the department said. The settlement resolves charges that from 2009 to 2013, Warner Chilcott illegally marketed seven drugs, including Asacol to treat ulcerative colitis, and Actonel and Atelvia to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis. Investigators said this marketing included the making of payments or offering of perks such as expensive restaurant meals to persuade doctors to prescribe the drugs. Warner Chilcott agreed to pay a $22.94 million criminal fine and admit to paying kickbacks, improperly inducing insurers to pay for Atelvia prescriptions, and making unsubstantiated claims about Actonel. It also agreed to pay $102.06 million to the U.S. government and states to resolve civil charges that it caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs. Allergan is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. It said it cooperated with the U.S. probe and had previously set aside funds for the accord. Chief Executive Brent Saunders said in a statement that Allergan is committed to operating “in full compliance with the regulations and high ethical standards we have set.” Reichel, 57, of Chester, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Boal in Boston, and was released without bail, said his lawyer Joe Savage. “The charges brought today by the U.S. Attorney’s office are false,” said Savage, a partner at Goodwin Procter. “For more than 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, Carl Reichel worked hard and did the right thing, and these baseless claims can’t change that.” Whistleblowers who sued Warner Chilcott under the federal False Claims Act in 2011 will receive $22.9 million from the civil settlement, the Justice Department said. Warner Chilcott was acquired by Actavis Plc in October 2013. Actavis bought Allergan in March 2015 and took its name. Also on Thursday, Allergan confirmed that it is in preliminary talks to merge with drugmaker Pfizer Inc. The cases are U.S. ex rel Alexander et al v. Warner Chilcott Plc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 11-01121; and U.S. v. Reichel in the same court, No. 15-cr-10324.

539,AGN,RPT-Pfizer-Allergan sparks fresh tax inversion angst on Capitol Hill,"(Repeats with no change to text) By David Lawder WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc faces political risks in Washington if it proceeds with a bid for Allergan, but with little chance of legislation to curb such tax inversion deals, the Obama administration may be able to throw up only limited obstacles. Lawmakers are widely seen as unlikely to tackle major tax code changes before the 2016 presidential election, but they were already scolding Pfizer publicly on Thursday, showing that companies considering inversion deals do face reputational risk. “When corporations choose to invert and don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab. That isn’t right,” said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin in a statement. Durbin has voiced similar views on prior inversions, including one that was abandoned by retailer Walgreen. An inversion deal typically involves a U.S. company buying a foreign company and then relocating corporate headquarters, on paper at least, to the foreign company’s home country, with the goal of reducing the combined company’s overall taxes. New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said they have not reached an agreement and declined to give details. A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, which could create the world’s largest drugmaker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Ireland has been a frequent redomiciling destination for U.S. corporations fleeing the U.S. tax system, though most of them leave their actual core operations in the United States. The latest wave of inversions crested in late 2014, when the Obama administration cracked down, making it harder both to do the deals and to realize their benefits. A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said further actions could be taken, but stressed that only Congress can slam the door completely. Among the department’s options is tightening rules against a tax-dodging technique known as “earnings stripping” that is often a key component of inversions. This practice involves shifting profits earned in the United States to a lower-tax jurisdiction. “We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action but there is a limit to what we can do administratively. Congress must take action to end this loophole,” the Treasury spokesperson said in a statement. Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank, agreed that earnings stripping was a good place for the Treasury to start. “Otherwise you leave a loophole and incentive for these combinations to continue,” he said.

A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer’s long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world’s top-selling medicine. It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent. Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva. Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling. Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO. The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan. Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan’s wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment. By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.

541,AGN,Factbox: Pfizer-Allergan puts focus on U.S. tax inversion rules,"(Reuters) - The proposed corporate tie-up between Pfizer Inc and Allergan Plc, both drug makers, is refocusing attention in Washington on tax-driven corporate inversion transactions. U.S.-based Pfizer moved last week to acquire Ireland’s Allergan. Details of their deal were still unavailable, but the companies were said to be eyeing a tax inversion structure. In an inversion, a U.S. company typically acquires a smaller, foreign rival and then reincorporates into its home country, on paper at least, to escape U.S. income taxes. In most cases, the U.S. company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign company, although the U.S. company’s core operations, such as management and research, remain in the United States. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service enforce the rules on inversions. For an inverting U.S. company, the goal is to satisfy the IRS’s definition of being a company with a foreign parent, thereby escaping some of the tax burdens of being a company with a U.S. parent, while minimizing the transfer of actual control and management operations overseas. Under IRS rules, an inverted company will not be recognized as having a foreign parent if the shareholders in the old, U.S. company still own 80 percent or more of the new, combined company, and if the combined company has no substantial business activities in the foreign company’s home country. In cases where the old U.S. shareholders hold between 60 percent and 80 percent, the inverted company can qualify as foreign-parented under certain restrictions, even if it fails the “substantial business activities” test. Some Democrats have proposed a 50 percent foreign ownership test and other new limits, but legislation was widely seen as unlikely before 2017. Treasury could tighten its rules in the meantime, though it can only go so far on inversions without congressional action. Treasury last cracked down in September 2014, when it blocked inverted companies from using “hopscotch” loans to avoid dividend taxes when tapping tax-deferred foreign profits. It also barred inverters from gaining access to offshore profits through “decontrolling” strategies that make foreign units no longer U.S.-controlled; and it curbed “skinny down” and “spinversion” strategies aimed at circumventing inversion rules. Another way inverted companies cut taxes is earnings stripping, or shifting U.S. profits out of the country to a low- or no-tax jurisdiction. Treasury has been expected to issue tighter rules on earnings stripping, but has not yet done so.

Guggenheim is advising Pfizer alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), while JPMorgan is advising Allergan alongside Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the people said on Monday. Other investment banks are also vying to secure roles, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the financial advisory roles are not yet public. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Pfizer, Allergan, Guggenheim and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Banks advising Allergan stand to collectively earn between $140 million and $180 million, while banks advising Pfizer could make between $80 million and $100 million in total, depending on the purchase price, according to estimates by consultancy Freeman & Co.   Pfizer, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan disclosed last week they were in friendly talks to merge. Pfizer and Allergan have market capitalizations of $215 billion and $122 billion respectively.  The deal, which is several weeks away from an agreement, would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland’s lower tax rates, where Allergan is domiciled, according to the sources.

Shares of Allergan, created from the merger of Actavis and Allergan, rose 1.4 percent to $313.50 in premarket trading on Wednesday. The Actavis-Allergan merger brought signature drugs such as Botox anti-wrinkle treatment and eye drops Restasis under one roof, freeing Allergan to enter into a deal to sell its generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Allergan had said it expected revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of the year. Since then, Allergan has entered into friendly buyout talks with Pfizer. Dublin-based Allergan said on Wednesday it would not update its forecasts as that would need more disclosures, according to Irish takeover rules, with respect to its talks with Pfizer. A merger between Allergan and Pfizer will be the biggest takeover deal this year and create the biggest healthcare company in the world. Allergan said revenue from branded products jumped 50 percent to $2.39 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, accounting for 58.5 percent of total revenue. The business’s gross margin improved to 87.9 percent from 84.1 percent.

547,AGN,RPT-Pfizer-Allergan deal would set up US company for a split,"(Repeats story with no change to text) By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson Nov 6 (Reuters) - A Pfizer Inc merger with Ireland-based Allergan, in addition to providing tax benefits, would bolster the U.S. drugmaker’s growth prospects should it decide to sell or spin off its portfolio of products that have gone off patent. Many Wall Street analysts believe Pfizer will decide to split late next year, after compiling three years of financial data treating its “established products” division, which sells generic medicines, and its “innovative” patent-protected medicines unit, as if they were separate companies. Such a split would dramatically boost the company’s profitability, because in-patents drugs command much higher prices that rise every year, as opposed to off-patent medicines, that become commoditized and their prices decline. “This would be the creation of two companies really, not one huge $350 billion Pfizer,” Andy Summers, co-portfolio manager at Janus Capital Group, said of the likely Pfizer split post merger. Janus is the 11th largest Allergan shareholder with about 6.5 million shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Pfizer’s $15 billion purchase earlier this year of hospital products maker Hospira, which sells generic injectable drugs and is developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines, was widely seen as a move to make the established products business more attractive ahead of a sale. A combination with Allergan would add lucrative product lines to Pfizer’s core innovative business, including aesthetics such as anti-wrinkle treatment Botox and facial fillers, and  opthalmology and neurology brands. At a business review on Wednesday, Allergan highlighted some of its more promising new medicines, including Viberzi for irritable bowel syndrome, which the company believes will be a $1 billion drug. Allergan could also contribute somewhat to established products as well, notably the Alzheimer’s treatment Namenda, which was not included in the $40.5 billion agreement to sell Allergan’s huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. The deal is expected to close early next year. Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Asset Management, which holds Pfizer shares in client portfolios, said a combination with Allergan “certainly gives Pfizer more flexibility in terms of how it wants to execute that strategy” of splitting the company. “It makes it more of a growth company.” Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, vaccines and consumer products. It gets about $21 billion from the established products, which consist of older medicines that now face competition from cheap generics, including the cholesterol fighter Lipitor, once the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. Allergan, which was created in its current form in March following its merger with Actavis, expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including the generic drugs it is selling to Teva. “All of Brent’s growth areas at Allergan would stay at the growth company,” said Janus’s Summers, referring to Allergan CEO Brent Saunders. Revenue from Pfizer’s established products fell 9 percent in 2014, creating a drag on overall growth. That has only worsened this year with the impact of the strong dollar on overseas sales. The unit’s sales were down 16 percent in the third quarter. In contrast, businesses Pfizer would keep were up 13 percent for the quarter, with vaccines the biggest growth driver led by its current top seller, Prevnar 13, used to prevent pneumonia. Pfizer’s new breast cancer drug Ibrance will also be a big driver of future growth, with some analysts forecasting eventual annual sales in excess of $5 billion. With its huge name recognition, Botox would be a crown jewel addition to the innovative drug lineup, which includes Viagra and nerve pain treatment Lyrica. Botox has about $2.4 billion a year in sales, much of it a cash business that does not require reimbursements from payers. It also has approvals for medical uses, such as for overactive bladder and chronic migraine. Allergan on Wednesday said the drug has a lot of room to grow, as it undergoes tests for a dozen new uses, including as a treatment for atrial fibrillation, a potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythm. “Botox is a growing market, so that is a benefit,” Pursche said. Allergan currently has some 30,000 employees, but it is too early to know how many would lose their jobs if the deal goes through.

550,AGN,Pfizer-Allergan deal refocuses market on U.S. tax-inversion rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) buyout bid for Allergan Plc (AGN.N) has financial markets on edge over a possible new move by the U.S. Treasury Department against tax-inversion deals, but the outlook for any such steps was still unclear on Friday.     For months, Treasury has offered no fresh guidance on the inversion issue, leaving tax experts to speculate about what could come next. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign rival and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.     Allergan shares fell 2.3 percent on Thursday afternoon amid reports that Treasury might move to block its deal with Pfizer.     Possible steps the government might take include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: “earnings stripping” and “skinny down” distributions.     Treasury took several actions in September 2014 to reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding. The moves stemmed a wave of inversions, but not before Minnesota medical technology group Medtronic (MDT.N) reincorporated in Ireland.     At the time, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service said they were weighing further actions. On Friday, a Treasury spokeswoman offered more of the same language.     “The Treasury Department and the IRS expect to issue additional guidance to further limit inversion transactions,” said the statement from late last year.     That guidance said Treasury was looking at ways “to address strategies that avoid U.S. tax on U.S. operations by shifting or ‘stripping’ U.S.-source earnings to lower-tax jurisdictions, including through intercompany debt.”     Because U.S. corporations don’t disclose what they pay in income taxes, it’s hard to estimate how much revenue has been lost to inversions or could be lost in the future. A congressional committee estimated in May 2014 that legislation then being debated to largely slam the door on inversions would raise almost $20 billion from 2015 through 2024. That legislation was never adopted.      Tighter earnings-stripping rules would curtail a key attraction of inversions, but Treasury has struggled to write such a rule within the constraints of present law, experts said.    Fresh legislation from Congress on inversions, despite occasional rhetoric to the contrary from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, is regarded as unlikely before the 2016 elections.     “The rhetoric is heating up over Pfizer, but I don’t see anything immediate on the horizon,” said Edmund Outslay, a tax accounting professor at Michigan State University. Nor, he said, did he expect Treasury to act on its own.     Corporate tax law consultant Robert Willens said a tighter earnings stripping rule from Treasury was unlikely without action from Congress. But, he said, Treasury could harden its existing rule on “skinny down” restructuring strategies meant to circumvent existing inversion rules.     No two inversions are identical, but the goal is usually for a U.S. company to do just enough to satisfy Treasury and IRS requirements for treatment as a foreign entity, while avoiding the actual transfer abroad of core management and research.     To be recognized as a foreign entity under U.S. law, one key hurdle is to ensure that the original U.S. shareholders own less than 60 percent of the combined company. One way to do that is through “skinny down” share buybacks or other distributions that shrink the size of the U.S. company going into the inversion.    Treasury likely could tighten that rule, perhaps by extending the time limit on covered transactions, without accompanying legislation from Congress, experts said.    “I think that’s where they’ll focus their attention,” Willens said.

No two inversions are identical, but the goal is usually for a U.S. company to do just enough to satisfy Treasury and IRS requirements for treatment as a foreign entity, while avoiding the actual transfer abroad of core management and research. To be recognized as a foreign entity under U.S. law, one key hurdle is to ensure that the original U.S. shareholders own less than 60 percent of the combined company. One way to do that is through “skinny down” share buybacks or other distributions that shrink the size of the U.S. company going into the inversion. Treasury likely could tighten that rule, perhaps by extending the time limit on covered transactions, without accompanying legislation from Congress, experts said. “I think that’s where they’ll focus their attention,” Willens said.

552,AGN,Mylan fails in $26 billion takeover bid for Perrigo,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Mylan NV’s (MYL.O) $26 billion hostile bid for Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N) failed on Friday, putting an end to the ongoing saga, which started more than seven months ago. Netherlands-based Mylan has made a number of attempts to buy Perrigo but was unsuccessful in securing at least half of Perrigo outstanding shares in a tender offer, which expired Friday, 8.00 a.m. ET. Through Thursday’s close, Mylan’s stock had lost about 37 percent of its value since it made public its offer to acquire Perrigo on April 8. Changes to Mylan stock price account for part of the change in total deal value. Following is a summary of key events highlighting the course of the offer: April 8, 2015: Mylan offers to buy Perrigo for about $29 billion in cash and stock in a move that some analysts suggested was an effort to help fend off a $40 billion acquisition by larger rival Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries (TEVA.TA) April 24, 2015: Mylan goes hostile with a sweetened bid of $60 plus 2.2 Mylan shares, valuing Perrigo at $31 billion; Perrigo rejects offer April 29, 2015: Perrigo rejects Mylan’s second raised bid of $75 and 2.3 Mylan shares for every Perrigo share, or $34.1 billion July 23, 2015: Dutch foundation linked to Mylan adopts poison pill in efforts to block takeover by Teva, citing potential job losses July 27, 2015: Teva drops its hostile pursuit of Mylan, decides to buy Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) generic business in a deal worth $40.5 billion Aug. 13, 2015: Mylan lowers the percentage of Perrigo shares it needs to control the company to just over 50 percent from its original plan of 80 percent Sept. 14, 2015: Mylan launches a tender offer in a move to lure Perrigo investors to support its take-over efforts Sept. 17, 2015: Perrigo recommends shareholders to reject Mylan’s tender offer, which was set to expire on Nov. 13, saying it substantially undervalued the company Oct. 22, 2015: Perrigo announces its plans to lay off 6 percent of its global workforce and buy back shares worth $2 billion Nov. 13, 2015: Mylan fails $26 billion bid in tender offer as it was unable to secure at least half of Perrigo’s shares ",11132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-nl-perrigo-company-timeline/mylan-fails-in-26-billion-takeover-bid-for-perrigo-idUSKCN0T221W20151113

554,AGN,RPT-INSIGHT-How Pfizer has shifted U.S. profits overseas for years,"(Repeats story published late on Monday, with no changes) By Tom Bergin and Kevin Drawbaugh RINGASKIDDY, Ireland, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer’s  plans to take over Allergan have faced a political backlash in the United States over fears a deal would lead to the company shifting its headquarters and taxable profits to Ireland. However a Reuters examination of corporate filings in Europe, patent databases and other information shows the company has for over a decade been shifting profits generated by American scientists and patients overseas - to a subsidiary based in the rolling hills of County Cork. Pfizer and Allergan are in talks to create the world’s biggest drug company by market value and analysts expect a deal would likely involve Pfizer “inverting”, or reversing into the smaller, Irish-registered Allergan. Ireland’s tax rate is 12.5 percent, a fraction of the 35 to 40 percent levied in the United States. President Barack Obama has described inversions as unpatriotic and last year changed some tax rules to make inverting less attractive. Allergan investors fear the U.S. treasury department may scupper a deal with additional measures. Yet any such actions would already be too late to stop New York-based Pfizer from reporting in Ireland profits tied to its U.S. activities. Pfizer has used transactions between companies within its group to allow an Irish subsidiary based in Ringaskiddy - Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals - to buy the rights to patents developed in the United States and then use them to make drugs which are sold back to U.S. affiliates. Even though the Irish and other overseas units pay $3.2 billion a year in royalties to use such patent rights, the higher prices at which Pfizer in the United States imports manufactured drugs from affiliates means almost all the profits from these drugs are reported overseas. Drugs which were discovered in the United States, manufactured in Ringaskiddy and sold back to the United States include anti-cholesterol treatment Lipitor - the best-selling prescription drug of all time - and epilepsy drug Lyrica, which generated revenue of over $5 billion last year for Pfizer. Pfizer’s actions are entirely lawful and all companies seek to manage their tax bills down. The drugmaker said the prices it used for its inter-subsidiary transactions were fair and that its business structure was motivated primarily by a desire for operational efficiency rather than tax minimisation. “Pfizer fully complies with all applicable accounting and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and pays all taxes due,” spokeswoman Joan Campion said. Jerry Buttimer, a member of the Irish parliament in whose constituency Ringaskiddy lies, said there was nothing wrong or unusual in companies seeking to reduce their tax bills. “All companies will do what is in the best interest of its operations and shareholders,” he said. But Ed Kleinbard, Professor of law at the University of Southern California said the company’s arrangements reflected “aggressive tax planning” and it seemed, from the outside, to be almost as capable in tax planning as pharmacology. “This is a company that is investing heavily in tax research, as well as pharmaceutical research,” he joked. Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals is at the centre of the drug company’s tax-minimising structure. It is registered at a two-storey 1970s era office block on the road into Ringaskiddy, a hamlet with two pubs and several factories operated by major drug manufacturers, a reflection of Irish government policy over the decades to create jobs in the area. Pfizer licenses the rights to drugs developed in the United States and in other countries like Britain, to Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, according to accounts filed by the Dutch and Belgian parents of Pfizer’s Irish units. A manufacturing facility on the 200-acre Ringaskiddy site, which is bordered by green fields on one side and Cork Harbour on the other, produces active ingredients for drugs, based on formulas discovered by overseas affiliates. It currently makes the active ingredients for Lipitor, anti-impotence drug Viagra, anti-lung cancer drug Xalkori and Ibrance, which fights breast cancer. Pfizer also operates other factories across Ireland, and smaller operations in Singapore and Puerto Rico. The compounds pass through a series of Irish companies which, like Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, have unlimited status meaning they do not have to publish accounts, a requirement of similar-sized limited companies in Ireland. Reuters pieced together the Irish subsidiary’s activities over the past 11 years from notes in the accounts of affiliates such as UK-registered Pfizer Ltd, Belgian registered Pfizer Research and Development Company NV and CP Pharmaceuticals International CV, the tax-exempt Dutch partnership through which Pfizer owns its overseas activities, including the Irish operations. It also examined patent and public-health databases and spoke to three company executives. Pfizer does have manufacturing plants in the United States but filings for its overseas units show non-U.S. companies supply over 80 percent of U.S. sales. Those sales generate margins of around 40 percent for Pfizer’s overseas arm - earning it over $17 billion in 2013. However, Pfizer has reported losses on its U.S. business in each of the past five years. Pfizer said it follows the “arm’s length” tax principle when conducting inter-company sales and purchases. This says companies should transact with affiliates at the same prices unconnected companies would. However, academics say it is very hard to judge whether inter-company sales of unique products like patented chemicals, for which there is no independent open market, are conducted at prices that independent companies would agree to use. “The current arm’s length rules are always difficult to enforce because of the lack of a comparable price (in the drugs industry),” said Edmund Outslay, tax accounting professor, Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University. Many of Pfizer’s group costs like research, debt and top management are mostly borne in the United States, despite non U.S. operations accounting for over 60 percent of global sales and 50 percent of hard assets like plants and property. For example, Pfizer has $30-40 billion in long-term debt but only $12 million of it is borne by the overseas arm, filings for CP Pharmaceuticals International show. The company said the practice of borrowing in the United States reflected lender preferences rather than any attempt to shift profits. It added that it was natural for a U.S. company to bear a big share of its overhead costs in the United States. But academics and campaigners are sceptical. “Pfizer maximises the deductions it takes in the U.S. and maximises the income it shifts to low-tax jurisdictions,” Outslay said. Pfizer denies its allocation of costs is an intentional ploy to cut taxes. While it manages to report most of the profits generated by U.S. activity overseas, if it wants to take the overseas profits home, to pay dividends or fund buybacks, it has to pay the difference between the tax paid on the money - around 12.5 percent - and the U.S. tax rate. Of $16 billion of U.S. income taxes Pfizer has paid since 2009, almost all reflects payments in relation to such remitting of profits from overseas subsidiaries, a Reuters analysis of group filings shows. Even including this tax on remitted earnings, the amount of cash Pfizer pays in overall income taxes as a share of its profits is lower than rivals like Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline , Denmark’s Novo Nordisk and Paris-based Sanofi. To avoid having to pay the tax due when cash is repatriated, Pfizer keeps most of its foreign earnings overseas and, indeed, much of it stays in Ireland. In the capital, an office building near the mouth of the Liffey in Ringsend houses Pfizer’s Dublin Treasury Centre, which the company says is responsible for treasury operations outside the United States and for helping manage Pfizer’s offshore pile of cash on which no U.S. tax has been paid. According to a presentation given by one of its staff last year, this unit overseas a cash mountain approaching $50 billion. But if Pfizer does complete an inversion, the practice of stockpiling foreign profits in Dublin may no longer be necessary. That’s because as an Irish-headquartered group it would be free to use its cash for dividends without incurring additional U.S. tax.

555,AGN,U.S. funds optimistic about Allergan piled in before Pfizer bid,"(Reuters) - Several large U.S. funds that boosted their stakes in Allergan Plc (AGN.N) in recent months appear to be optimistic about the company’s growth prospects, even before Pfizer’s reported $150 billion takeover bid for the botox maker.   Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is negotiating to buy Allergan, which also makes dry eye treatments, for $370 to $380 per share, a person familiar with the discussions said, compared to its current traded value of around $301. There is some dissatisfaction, however, with that price range, according to a poll by Sanford C. Bernstein research. Its poll of 87 investors showed that 54 percent wanted $390 to $400 a share, but 36 percent were satisfied with the lower reported price range.  Wells Fargo senior portfolio manager Margaret Patel, whose  Diversified Capital Builder Fund owned $2.7 million worth of Allergan at the end of September, said on Thursday Pfizer’s reported bid is plenty good. “I think it’s a big premium over the current valuation, and at some point you have to say, ‘Is there any more new good news to be uncovered?”  Apparently so. Third-quarter fund disclosures reveal that existing Allergan shareholders added a net 10.4 million shares to their holdings. There were newcomers, too. Geode Capital, the hedge fund unit of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, bought 3.1 million Allergan shares, fund disclosures show. Takeovers have been a staple for the pharmaceutical industry, but investors are not necessarily making acquisition premiums a part of their investment thesis. In a note last month to investors, hedge fund Lone Pine Capital said it expects Allergan’s profits to grow at double-digit rates even without acquisitions that have historically been part of their value-creation formulas. At the end of September, Lone Pine reported owning 2.6 million shares worth $709 million. Polen Capital sold its remaining stake in Allergan at the end of last year, but only after generating a nearly six-fold return for clients, according to analyst Stephen Atkins.     Funds run by Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O) are among Allergan’s largest investors, owning about 6 percent each of the company’s outstanding stock, according to Thomson Reuters data.  A takeover deal would redomicile U.S. drug giant Pfizer in Ireland just as the U.S. Treasury is preparing to clamp down on so-called inversions that limit a company’s tax liability. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign competitor and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.  Inversions figure to be a hot topic in 2016 in a national election year that will determine the next U.S. president. “We shall see whether the administration and Congress are able to block deals that are largely done based on tax inversions,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors’ U.S. Intermediary Business in Boston. Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors owned $23 million worth of Pfizer stock at the end of September, said he would commend Pfizer for making a move to get Allergan and lower its tax rate. “The U.S. corporate tax structure is uncompetitive,” Gabelli said.

561,AGN,UPDATE 3-Pfizer-Allergan talks accelerate amid new inversion clamp-down,"(Adds details on Pfizer’s talks with Allergan) By Greg Roumeliotis and Kevin Drawbaugh NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s  talks to acquire Allergan Plc in a $150 billion deal that would see the U.S. drug giant redomicile in Ireland accelerated on Wednesday, as the U.S. Treasury prepared to clamp down further on such tax inversions. Pfizer is negotiating a price of $370 to $380 for each Allergan share, a person familiar with the discussions said, asking not to be identified because the talks are confidential. Allergan shares ended trading on Wednesday at $310.8 per share. While negotiations have made progress in recent days, an agreement is not imminent and its timing remains uncertain following the Treasury’s disclosure that it would seek to tighten the rules on inversions, the source added. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign competitor and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation. Ireland is a common destination. Management usually stays in the United States. “Later this week, we intend to issue additional targeted guidance to deter and reduce further the economic benefits of corporate inversions,” according to a letter from the Treasury seen by Reuters. Pfizer was not named in the letter, which was signed by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and addressed to four senior lawmakers: U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Orrin Hatch, and Representatives Kevin Brady and Sander Levin. All four serve on the Senate and House tax committees. “We have no further comment beyond what is in the letter, at this time,” a Treasury spokesman said. Pfizer and Allergan also declined to comment. Levin said in a statement: “The fact that American companies, including Pfizer, continue to pursue inversions makes clear that additional steps are needed to stop this trend.” Noting that Treasury can only do so much on its own, Levin urged Congress to “get off the sidelines and take action to change the law to stop these tax-motivated inversions.” As a wave of inversions peaked in September 2014, Treasury took several regulatory actions to reduce the tax benefits of inverting, while also making new deals more difficult. That slowed deal flow but did not stop it entirely. For months tax experts have speculated about what could come next from Treasury. Possible steps might include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: so-called “earnings stripping” and “skinny down” distributions. Earnings-stripping rules combat shifting of U.S. profits out of the country to low-tax jurisdictions. Treasury has struggled to write new rules on this under present law, said tax experts. Rules targeting skinny-down distributions are meant to keep U.S. companies from shrinking their operations ahead of  inversions to evade standards for minimum levels of foreign ownership in inverted companies. A combination of Dublin-based Allergan with New York-based Pfizer would follow an unprecedented wave of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry as companies seek access to new drugs and increased leverage on pricing. Apart from tax considerations, a deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan’s dominance in the aesthetics and ophthalmology markets, and displace Johnson & Johnson as the world’s biggest healthcare group.

564,AGN,"Exclusive: Pfizer, Allergan CEOs agree on combined company roles - sources","(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Allergan Inc chief executives have agreed on the roles they would assume in a combined company, removing one of the last hurdles to the largest ever healthcare merger, people familiar with the matter said. Pfizer CEO Ian Read will be CEO of the combined company, while Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will have another very senior role, the people said on Friday, without providing more details. A deal announcement is expected in the coming days, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment. A top job at the combined company would position Saunders, 45, to have a claim at the CEO job when Read, 62, steps down. This arrangement also shows that Pfizer’s management plans to remain in control, at least in the short term, even if the deal is technically structured so that Allergan buys Pfizer. The roughly $150 billion merger would see New York-based Pfizer redomicile in Ireland, where Botox-maker Allergan is registered. The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday took steps to clamp down on tax-avoiding inversion deals with new rules, though there was scarce evidence it would stop the biggest inversion of them all, between Pfizer and Allergan. Read, a soft-spoken trained accountant, spent more than 30 years working his way up the Pfizer ranks, taking the reins in 2010 with the sudden departure of CEO Jeffrey Kindler. He viewed refocusing and reigniting the company’s research engine as one of his most important tasks after a decade in which Pfizer had produced no important new medicines from its own labs. On Read’s watch, Pfizer has seen approval of 10 new medicines, including the breast cancer drug Ibrance, which analysts forecast will eventually generate $5 billion a year, and Trumenba, a potentially important meningitis vaccine, both products of Pfizer labs. In his meteoric career, Saunders has lead Bausch & Lomb, Forest Laboratories and Actavis, which took the Allergan name after acquiring the Botox maker this year, all in the past five years. While his drug discovery credentials are not as strong as Read’s, he is highly regarded among his peers as a CEO with top-notch operational expertise. A protégé of industry veteran Fred Hassan, who fixed Pharmacia and sold it to Pfizer, Saunders is credited with helping turn around struggling Schering-Plough and then leading its integration with Merck & Co.

Its poll of 87 investors showed that 54 percent wanted $390 to $400 a share, but 36 percent were satisfied with the lower reported price range.  Wells Fargo senior portfolio manager Margaret Patel, whose  Diversified Capital Builder Fund owned $2.7 million worth of Allergan at the end of September, said on Thursday Pfizer’s reported bid is plenty good. “I think it’s a big premium over the current valuation, and at some point you have to say, ‘Is there any more new good news to be uncovered?”  Apparently so. Third-quarter fund disclosures reveal that existing Allergan shareholders added a net 10.4 million shares to their holdings. There were newcomers, too. Geode Capital, the hedge fund unit of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, bought 3.1 million Allergan shares, fund disclosures show. Takeovers have been a staple for the pharmaceutical industry, but investors are not necessarily making acquisition premiums a part of their investment thesis. In a note last month to investors, hedge fund Lone Pine Capital said it expects Allergan’s profits to grow at double-digit rates even without acquisitions that have historically been part of their value-creation formulas. At the end of September, Lone Pine reported owning 2.6 million shares worth $709 million. Polen Capital sold its remaining stake in Allergan at the end of last year, but only after generating a nearly six-fold return for clients, according to analyst Stephen Atkins.     Funds run by Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O) are among Allergan’s largest investors, owning about 6 percent each of the company’s outstanding stock, according to Thomson Reuters data.  A takeover deal would redomicile U.S. drug giant Pfizer in Ireland just as the U.S. Treasury is preparing to clamp down on so-called inversions that limit a company’s tax liability. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign competitor and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.  Inversions figure to be a hot topic in 2016 in a national election year that will determine the next U.S. president. “We shall see whether the administration and Congress are able to block deals that are largely done based on tax inversions,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors’ U.S. Intermediary Business in Boston. Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors owned $23 million worth of Pfizer stock at the end of September, said he would commend Pfizer for making a move to get Allergan and lower its tax rate. “The U.S. corporate tax structure is uncompetitive,” Gabelli said.

566,AGN,UPDATE 2-U.S. unveils new inversion rules; unlikely to thwart Pfizer,"(Adds details from Treasury, analyst comment on Pfizer, background) By Kevin Drawbaugh and Ransdell Pierson WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday took steps to clamp down on tax-avoiding “inversion” deals with new rules, though there was scarce evidence they would stop the biggest inversion of them all, between Pfizer Inc and Allergan Plc. The $150 billion proposed deal, still under negotiation, would see New York-based Pfizer redomicile in Ireland, where Botox-maker Allergan is registered. Treasury, which said its new measures are effective immediately, has been wrestling with inversion deals for years because they erode the U.S. corporate tax base by shifting profits overseas. A wave of inversions peaked in September 2014, when Treasury last cracked down, reducing deal flow but not stopping it. U.S. companies are still taking advantage of the law “to move their tax residence overseas to avoid paying taxes in the U.S., without making significant changes in the nature of their overall operations,” Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said. “While we intend to take additional action in the coming months, there is only so much the Treasury Department can do to prevent these tax-avoidance transactions. Only legislation can decisively stop inversions,” Lew said in a statement. In an inversion, a U.S. company typically buys a smaller foreign rival and relocates, at least on paper, to the rival’s home country so the new combined company is not U.S.-based, though core management usually stays in the United States Because of the expected structure of the Pfizer and Allergan deal, many analysts believe the new Treasury inversion rules may present little risk. Allergan shareholders would own more than 40 percent of the combined company following a merger with Pfizer, people familiar with the terms being negotiated have said. “If ... Allergan is more than 40 percent of the new company, most (if not all) of the content of today’s Treasury press release doesn’t even apply,” Evercore ISI senior analyst Umer Raffat said in an emailed note. The exact structure of the merger between Pfizer and Allergan is not known, making the full impact of the new Treasury rules on inversions difficult to assess. Nevertheless, the deal could be structured so that Allergan is technically the acquiring entity, though Allergan shareholders would still get a premium in a primarily stock-based transaction, according to the source familiar with the terms. In a sign that the two companies are not discouraged by the regulatory hurdles, Pfizer is negotiating a 2-3 percent break-up fee with Allergan, which would be in line with most deals that do not face such risks, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Over the years, Pfizer’s profits held outside the United States have grown to $74 billion. The 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate is not due on those earnings unless and until Pfizer brings them into the United States, under U.S. law. Some tax experts have said these overseas profits are a crucial part of the Allergan deal because if Pfizer were no longer a U.S. company it would have readier and less costly access to them. Under Treasury’s new rules, it is making inversions harder to do by limiting a U.S. acquirer’s ability to set up a new foreign parent in a third country and to “stuff” assets into a foreign parent to meet existing limits on post-inversion ownership levels. Treasury will also now require that an inverted company be tax-resident in its new home country under that country’s rules, not just U.S. law, to pass a test of whether it has 25 percent of its business activity in the new country. Passing that means it can be recognized as a foreign company. Treasury is also imposing a rule, retroactive to September 2014, limiting an inverted company’s ability to transfer foreign operations to the new foreign parent after an inversion transaction without paying current U.S. tax. No action was taken to curb inversion-related “earnings stripping,” in which U.S. companies shift U.S. profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes, but Lew said Treasury would continue to examine that issue and others. “Corporate tax inversions are costing the U.S. tens of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue,” Democratic Representative Sander Levin said in a statement. “The rumors that Pfizer may announce its plans to invert as soon as next week ... highlight the urgent need for Congress to act.”     (Reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh in Washington D.C. and Ransdell Pierson in New York; Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Eric Walsh, Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler)",11202015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tax-inversions/update-2-u-s-unveils-new-inversion-rules-unlikely-to-thwart-pfizer-idUSL1N13E30720151120

570,AGN,Pfizer to buy Allergan in $160 billion deal,"NEW YOR (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan Plc in a deal worth $160 billion to slash its U.S. tax bill, rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver. The acquisition, which would create the world’s largest drugmaker and shift Pfizer’s headquarters to Ireland, would also be the biggest-ever instance of a U.S. company re-incorporating overseas to lower its taxes. U.S. President Barack Obama has called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pledged to propose measures to prevent such deals. The merger was also slammed by her rival Senator Bernie Sanders as well as by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. “The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,” Trump said in a statement. It was not immediately known how many jobs would be lost as a result of the merger. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent and Pfizer closed down 2.6 percent as investors learned the merger, under discussion since late October, would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped. Pfizer also disappointed some investors by delaying by two years a decision on whether to sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition. To avoid potential restrictions, the transaction was structured as smaller, Dublin-based Allergan buying Pfizer, although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. The U.S. Treasury, concerned about losing billions in tax revenue, has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals, but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves. The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer’s faster-growing branded products business, with additions like Botox, and its older established products unit. Still, investors had hoped Pfizer would sell off the lower-margin business in 2017, a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan. “The only thing I’d really say I’m disappointed about is Pfizer’s postponing their break up,” said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. He called the delay decision “pretty conservative and a little late.” Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal, including the projected cost savings, and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks. “Synergies of $2 billion plus in the third year are less than the $4 billion we had estimated in year 1,” said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala. On a conference call with analysts, Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks, dividend payments and business development. The combined company would have annual sales of about $64 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company, with oversight of all commercial businesses. Read, who has long sought to slash Pfizer’s U.S. tax rate,  said the deal would help put the company on “on a more competitive footing” with overseas-based rivals. The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year, compared with about 15 percent for Allergan. Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017. The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read’s initial attempt at an inversion, a $118 billion bid to acquire Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company’s management and UK politicians. Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products, such as Botox wrinkle treatment, Alzheimer’s drug Namenda and dry-eye medication Restasis. For 166-year-old Pfizer, Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years - one for each of the last 4 CEOs - following purchases of Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth. This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions, taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than $600 billion.. They include prior big deals involving Saunders, such as the $70.5 billion acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which then took the Allergan name, and an agreement to sell that company’s huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion. Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent, excluding special items, in 2019 and add by a high-teens percentage rate in 2020. The deal values Allergan shares at $363.63 each, about 16 percent more than their closing price of $312.46 on Friday. Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company. The record-breaking deal includes $8 billion in debt, Pfizer said. Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co, Centerview Partners and Moelis & Co. Its legal advisers are Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and A & L Goodbody. Allergan was advised by J.P.

574,AGN,Hedge funds' favorite stocks lag broader market: Goldman data,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers’ favorite stocks stumbled hard this year to post their worst returns since the financial crisis with health-care companies, such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO), leading the way lower, according to new data from Goldman Sachs. Goldman analysts calculated that the basket of managers’ 50 most heavily owned stocks - among which are Allergan (AGN.N), Facebook (FB.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Cheniere Energy (LNG.A) - lost 2.4 percent since January, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index gained 3 percent during the same time. Since August, when Goldman rebalanced what it calls its Hedge Fund VIP list, the industry’s favorite stocks have lost 5 percent, compared with the S&P; 500’s 1 percent gain, Goldman said in a report released on Monday. “Health-care stocks within the basket, most notably VRX, were responsible for nearly 70 percent of the basket’s negative return,” the report said, referring to Valeant. Valeant’s stock price tumbled some 70 percent in the 3-1/2 months from July through mid-October amid questions about its drug pricing strategy and accounting practices. The heavy losses have weighed on hedge funds including William Ackman’s Pershing Square and Nehal Chopra’s Tiger Ratan, investors have said. Hedge funds’ stock picks and what managers earn off their bets have been scrutinized for years, but they are receiving extra attention now that pension funds and other institutional investors are putting more money into hedge funds. Energy company Cheniere, which is among the top-10 holdings of 14 hedge funds and is 64 percent-owned by hedge funds, also dragged on returns, having dropped 29 percent this year. Traditionally, the Hedge Fund VIP list has outperformed the S&P; 500, the Goldman data show, noting that the list beat the S&P; 500 by 2.65 percentage points last year. In 2013 it beat the S&P; 500 by 9 percentage points after beating it by 7 percentage points in 2012. When stocks tumbled in August amid concerns of slower growth in China and nervousness about when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, many fund managers adjusted their holdings, cutting health-care exposure and adding to technology holdings. “Hedge funds moved away from laggards to stronger performers,” Goldman analysts wrote, noting that the VIP list now includes Chinese web services company Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and online payments system company PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) and no longer includes food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Valeant.

580,AGN,Pfizer to buy Allergan in $160 billion deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan Plc in a deal worth $160 billion to slash its U.S. tax bill, rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver. The acquisition, which would create the world’s largest drugmaker and shift Pfizer’s headquarters to Ireland, would also be the biggest-ever instance of a U.S. company re-incorporating overseas to lower its taxes. U.S. President Barack Obama has called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice.  Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pledged to propose measures to prevent such deals. The merger was also slammed by her rival Senator Bernie Sanders as well as by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. “The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,” Trump said in a statement.  It was not immediately known how many jobs would be lost as a result of the merger.  Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent and Pfizer closed down 2.6 percent as investors learned the merger, under discussion since late October, would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped. Pfizer also disappointed some investors by delaying by two years a decision on whether to sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition. To avoid potential restrictions, the transaction was structured as smaller, Dublin-based Allergan buying Pfizer, although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. The U.S. Treasury, concerned about losing billions in tax revenue, has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals, but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves. The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer’s faster-growing branded products business, with additions like Botox, and its older established products unit. Still, investors had hoped Pfizer would sell off the lower-margin business in 2017, a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan.  “The only thing I’d really say I’m disappointed about is Pfizer’s postponing their break up,” said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. He called the delay decision “pretty conservative and a little late.”  Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal, including the projected cost savings, and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks. “Synergies of $2 billion plus in the third year are less than the $4 billion we had estimated in year 1,” said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala. On a conference call with analysts, Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks, dividend payments and business development. The combined company would have annual sales of about $64 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company, with oversight of all commercial businesses.  Read, who has long sought to slash Pfizer’s U.S. tax rate,  said the deal would help put the company on “on a more competitive footing” with overseas-based rivals.  The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year, compared with about 15 percent for Allergan. Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017. The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read’s initial attempt at an inversion, a $118 billion bid to acquire Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company’s management and UK politicians. Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products, such as Botox wrinkle treatment, Alzheimer’s drug Namenda and dry-eye medication Restasis. For 166-year-old Pfizer, Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years - one for each of the last 4 CEOs - following purchases of Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth. This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions, taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than $600 billion..  They include prior big deals involving Saunders, such as the $70.5 billion acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which then took the Allergan name, and an agreement to sell that company’s huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion. Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent, excluding special items, in 2019 and add by a high-teens percentage rate in 2020.   The deal values Allergan shares at $363.63 each, about 16 percent more than their closing price of $312.46 on Friday. Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company. The record-breaking deal includes $8 billion in debt, Pfizer said. Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co, Centerview Partners and Moelis & Co. Its legal advisers are Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and A & L Goodbody.  Allergan was advised by J.P.

588,AGN,UPDATE 1-Ackman's fund sells 5 mln Valeant shares to generate tax loss,"(Adds details on investment, background on fund) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss BOSTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Thursday he sold about 5 million shares in drug company Valeant International in order to generate a tax loss as investors in his Pershing Square Capital Management face the biggest loss in the company’s history. Ackman’s hedge fund now owns 29.1 million shares in Valeant, or 8.5 percent of the company, down from 34.1 million shares, or 9.9 percent, according to a regulatory filing made after the market closed on Thursday, the last trading day of 2015. Pershing Square sold shares in its two on-shore portfolios in order to generate a tax loss for investors while the two off-shore portfolios did not sell any shares, the filing said. News that Ackman, one of Valeant’s biggest and most vocal backers, sold some of his shares comes at the tail end of a tumultuous year for the Canadian pharmaceutical company, whose share price had surged and then plummeted amid questions about its drug pricing and accounting practices. The company, after disclosing last week that its chief executive officer, Michael Pearson, had been hospitalized with severe pneumonia, this week named a trio of company executives to take over until Pearson returns. Ackman was not available to comment, and a company spokesman declined to say anything beyond the filing. For Ackman, 2015 is sure to be one of his worst years ever, in part because of the heavy losses in Valeant. One of Ackman’s funds posted a 19.7 percent loss through Dec. 29. Final calculations for all of the firm’s funds have not been made. The results mark a dramatic about face from last year’s 40 percent gain, which ranked Ackman among the hedge fund industry’s best performers. The 2014 gain was fueled mainly by an increase in drug company Allergan’s shares as Ackman pressured it to sell itself to Valeant. Allergan sold itself to Actavis instead and in March of 2015, Ackman said he had made a sizable bet in Valeant. But by late August, Valeant had gone from being one of Ackman’s biggest winners to being his largest loser, costing him and his investors, including state pension funds, billions in losses. While Ackman criticized Valeant for having a public relations problem, the activist investor stuck by the company, upping his stake significantly. Valeant’s shares closed the year down 22 percent, at $101.67, at less than half the year’s high of $260 reached in early August.

589,AGN,"Pfizer, Allergan say combined drug pipeline 'underappreciated'","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The research chiefs of betrothed drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Allergan (AGN.N) say the proposed combination of their experimental drugs deserves more credit, including potential blockbuster treatments for schizophrenia and depression. Pfizer agreed in November to buy Botox-maker Allergan for $160 billion in a transaction meant to slash Pfizer’s tax rate and achieve other cost savings. The tax-inversion deal would shift Pfizer’s headquarters to Dublin and is slated to close in the second half of 2016. Industry regulators and U.S. lawmakers have criticized the deal for its reliance on financial engineering. But more recently, company executives have said medical benefits of bringing together their drugs in development have been “underappreciated” and some healthcare analysts are making the case that combining the two research programs will yield sales and earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations. “There has been a lot of attention on financial aspects of the deal, but there has been an underestimation of the Allergan pipeline,” Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in a recent interview. Dolsten told Reuters that Allergan’s depression treatment rapastinel, which has shown promise of treating symptoms within hours rather than weeks required for standard treatments, could be “transformational” if it succeeds in late-stage trials. Further studies of Vraylar, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder approved in September, could show it has “unique” ability to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as social withdrawal and slowed movement, Dolsten said.  Relamorelin, potentially the first new treatment in decades for delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is another big opportunity, he said. Allergan has predicted peak annual sales of up to $2 billion for rapastinel and up to $1 billion each for Vraylar, relamorelin, an experimental treatment for uterine fibroids called Esmya and Allergan’s recently approved Viberzi treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.  It expects potential annual sales of up to $2 billion each for experimental treatments for migraine headaches and for a leading cause of blindness called macular degeneration.  The forecasts have largely fallen on deaf ears, said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan.  “Right now there are almost no expectations for Allergan’s pipeline,” Divan said. “Even if they get just a few billion dollars out of these products, that would be more than people give them credit for.” Pfizer expects a modest lift to its earnings in 2018 from the planned purchase of Allergan, a boost of 10 percent in 2019 and a high-teens percentage boost in 2020. Divan said he expects Allergan’s pipeline to add a few extra percentage points of sales and earnings growth in all three of those time periods. “We have 70 products in mid- to late-stage trials, but I think our pipeline is under-recognized,” David Nicholson, research head for Allergan’s branded products, said in an interview. He attributed the lack of visibility to the rapid series of acquisitions and deals that created the present-day Allergan, folding in the portfolios of large drugmakers such as Forest Laboratories and Actavis.  “It takes time for people to realize these are all part of one company’s pipeline,” said Nicholson. Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra said less than 20 percent of Allergan sales are from outside the United States, and that Botox and other Allergan products could eventually get a surprisingly strong boost from 70 new international markets that Pfizer will open up, including Japan. “The biggest advantage for Allergan would be in leveraging Pfizer’s global sales forces,” Malhotra said. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is slated to lead the combined company, with Allergan’s younger Chief Executive Brent Saunders serving as president and chief operating officer. Nicholson, in a presentation on Tuesday with Read, Saunders and Dolsten at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said Allergan’s pipeline deserves far more credit, as does Pfizer’s array of immuno-oncology drugs. “When we put these pipelines together, (other) companies better watch out!” ",1122016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-allergan-pfizer/pfizer-allergan-say-combined-drug-pipeline-underappreciated-idUSKCN0UQ2SM20160112

591,AGN,Bond investors hope AB InBev will wet their whistles,"NEW YORK, Jan 12 (IFR) - Investors could easily soak up a US$60bn bond from AB InBev if the beer giant wants to sell that much debt this week to help fund its acquisition of rival brewer SABMiller. AB InBev could raise US$30bn-$60bn in funding - perhaps setting a new mark for the largest bond ever - and the deal is expected to be a blowout success. The buyside is primed and ready for a large and liquid high-grade bond issue to kick off a primary market that has been uneven so far in 2016, largely due to broader volatility. “It will help establish a clearing level for large deals, and also help pave the way for more M&A; deals to come,” one syndicate banker told IFR. “This is a defensive credit, and there will be a gravitational pull towards a deal like that.” In addition to the liquidity inherent in such a massive bond - the current record is Verizon’s US$49bn trade from 2013 - many believe the company will meet its post-acquisition targets. One portfolio manager on a call with the company Monday said he was comfortable that AB InBev would limit dividend increases and stock buybacks for some time after the acquisition. “They have been able to execute large mergers in the past,” he said. “Management lived up to bond investors’ expectations and executed well. They want to replicate that.” He said the company did not discuss details of the bond but expected multi-billion tranches with maturities of two, three, five, 10 and 30 years, as well as a possible floating-rate note. Amid worries out of China, flagging commodities prices and other woes, the market has seen heavy volatility of late - which could make AB InBev have to pay more in new issue concessions. Yet it is unlikely to have to offer the whopping premiums Verizon did on its record deal in September 2013. Verizon offered a 50bp NIC on top of the 50bp widening in its curve after announcing its US$130bn acquisition of Vodafone’s stake in Verizon Wireless in one hit. Since those days, however, the dollar bond market has repeatedly shown its ability to absorb trillions of dollars in debt issuance. “Verizon was very much a trek into the unknown,” said one banker. “I don’t think (AB InBev) will have to pay as much.” The banker expected the final concession to be in the range of 15bp-30bp, depending on the size of the offering and broader market conditions on the day. The deal is expected as soon as  Wednesday. A 30bp premium would be high in the investment-grade market for such a well-heeled corporate, but not exceptional given the potential size of the offering, bankers said. A likely worst-case scenario would see AB InBev paying slightly more than Actavis did last year on its US$21bn 10-tranche deal to finance its Allergan acquisition - the second-largest bond sale after Verizon’s. That deal paid a measly 4bp to 6bp in concession versus outstanding bonds on the day. “The risk for the market is if (AB InBev) doesn’t price right,” said the banker. “Investors are writing big checks here, and if the bonds don’t trade well, that is going to be an issue.” Given the recent spate of volatility, driven in part by the to and fro surrounding the Federal Reserve rates hike last month, investor demand of late has skewed to shorter maturities. Of the close to US$30bn of bond issuance done in the last month, some US$15bn has been in tenors up to five years and almost all of the balance in 10 years, according to IFR data. Still, AB InBev should easily be able to do some longer tenors if it decides it wants to. “I expect the company will see demand across the maturity curve, including long maturities,” said Jonathan Duensing, deputy CIO and senior portfolio manager at Amundi Smith Breeden. The brewing giant started meeting with investors about the deal near the end of last year, and has been roadshowing the bonds to both US and European investors Monday and Tuesday. “It is a perfect name and sector for a volatile market,” said a banker away from the deal. “Look at the financial crisis: people were drinking more beer than ever before.”   (Reporting by Hillary Flynn and Davide Scigliuzzo; Editing by Shankar Ramakrishnan, Natalie Harrison, Jack Doran and Marc Carnegie)",1122016,http://www.reuters.com/article/sabmiller-ma-a-b-i-bonds/bond-investors-hope-ab-inbev-will-wet-their-whistles-idUSL2N14W1QL20160112

602,AGN,Eli Lilly loses latest round in UK drug patent battle,"LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly said on Friday it lost the latest round of a lengthy patent saga over its blockbuster Alimta lung cancer drug in the UK High Court, in a boost for generic drugmaker Actavis, now renamed Allergan . Alimta, known generically as pemetrexed, had worldwide sales of $2.49 billion last year, making it Lilly’s second biggest-selling product. The setback follows a win for Lilly in the UK appeals court in June and highlights the complexity of legal arguments over patents that cover the administration of vitamins given alongside Alimta. Lilly said the latest court ruling was that its vitamin regimen patent would not be infringed by Actavis marketing pemetrexed trometamol with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. In June, the appeals court said Lilly’s patent would be indirectly infringed by the sale of certain alternative salt forms of pemetrexed with instructions to dilute them with saline solution, but it left open the question of dextrose solution. The UK court rulings also apply to France, Italy and Spain under a legal system of corresponding declarations, and Lilly said it planned to appeal the latest decision. In major European countries, the basic compound patents for Alimta expired in December 2015 but its vitamin regimen patents run until June 2021.

The EU competition enforcer is expected to seek feedback from third parties before deciding whether to accept the proposal, demand more changes or open a lengthy investigation that could last up to five months. Teva also declined to provide details. “Those discussions (with the Commission) are productive and positive, but we’re not in a position at this time to predict or comment on how or when they will be completed,” it said.

607,AGN,Allergan's revenue beats on higher U.S. brand sales,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by strong performance in its U.S. brands segment, and said it continues to expect its takeover by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) to close in the second half 2016. The company’s shares rose 3.2 percent to $284. Allergan said revenue in its U.S. brands business rose 38 percent to about $2.5 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, accounting for 58.7 percent of total revenue. Botox global sales were about $460 million, while Restasis global sales came in at about $348.2 million. Pfizer agreed in November to buy Allergan in a $160 billion deal which is meant to slash Pfizer’s tax rate as it would shift its headquarters to Dublin. The deal has been under intense regulatory scrutiny with politicians condemning it as a tax-dodge. Talking about the speculation around the takeover, CEO Brenton Saunders said he saw no obstacles with the closing of the deal. “(The deal) was constructed in a highly legal way with advice of many experts and I think we’re in a very strong position to close this deal in the second half of the year.” Allergan forecast 2016 adjusted revenue of about $17 billion, just shy of the analysts’ average estimate of $17.66 billion. This estimate takes into account foreign exchange impact of $200 million and a $500 million decline in the company’s low-margin generics business. RBC Capital Markets analysts said the 2016 forecast was largely in line with the Street’s expectations.  “But importantly, it implies 10 percent plus growth in the core branded revenue which is solid,” they wrote. Allergan’s net loss narrowed to $700.5 million, or $1.78 per share, in the fourth quarter, from $732.9 million, or $3.34 per share, a year earlier. GAAP results were impacted by acquisition-related expenses, the company said. Excluding special items, Allergan earned $3.41 per share, while analysts were expecting a profit of $3.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose about 74 percent to $4.20 billion in the quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of $4.19 billion.

610,AGN,Generic drug ETF ailing despite political focus on high drug prices,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Calls in the U.S. presidential campaign to cut pharmaceutical prices are not helping to revive a barely two-month-old exchange-traded fund that invests in shares of generic drugmakers. In fact, low prices that define generic drugs may be the ETF’s biggest stumbling block, analysts said this week. The Market Vectors Generic Drugs ETF, which fund manager Van Eck Associates Corp launched with $2.5 million in assets on Jan. 12, has fallen 5 percent through Wednesday and has failed to attract even $1 in new money, according to Lipper. The iShares Global Healthcare ETF, with three-quarters of its portfolio in pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, fell only 0.9 percent. The Market Vectors fund, which tracks the Indxx LLC-built generic index, is the only U.S. ETF built on shares of generic drugmakers, which have been languishing. Attacks on soaring drug prices by Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and other politicians have failed to boost profits on cheaper alternatives to patented branded drugs. Distributors like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc are squeezing prices of generics. “Generic drugs are essentially commodity products chosen on cost and as the purchasers consolidate and exert their leverage we would expect downward pressure,” said Michael Levesque, analyst for Moody’s Corp. “There is a lot of discussion around drug-pricing reform and different initiatives such as letting Medicare negotiate drug pricing, but none of those become a reality unless Congress implements them through the passage of a law, and that has not happened despite the statements in campaigns.” Mylan NV, the Market Vectors ETF’s fifth-largest holding, is off 16 percent this year after posting weak results and as investors panned the company’s deal to acquire Swedish rival Meda AB. Another top holding, Endo International PLC, is off 29 percent this year in part after February earnings were dented by pricing pressure on its generic drugs. Two of the Market Vectors fund’s top three holdings, Allergan Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, have lost value this year, while the third, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, has risen 6 percent. Enthusiasm has faded for biosimilars, drugs designed to have properties similar to those licensed previously, during the long wait for U.S. regulatory approval. Only one biosimilar, by Novartis AG, has come on the U.S. market. The treatment for chemotherapy side effects, designed to rival Amgen Inc’s Neupogen, has been less successful than investors such as Andy Acker, manager of the Janus Global Life Sciences Fund, had expected. Amgen is Acker’s top holding. Celltrion Inc, a top-10 holding of the Market Vectors generic ETF, backs a biosimilar drug expected to win approval. The stock has rallied 30 percent this year, but that has not been enough to make up for losses in the ETF’s other stocks. Indxx LLC, whose index the Market Vectors generic ETF tracks, said 15 percent of the fund’s returns come from companies that stand to profit from biosimilars, and that just half of its return comes from U.S. companies. “You tend to see a lot of companies get caught up in” market selloffs, said James Duffy, ETF product manager for Van Eck. “This is an area that we feel may have the potential to drive a lot of growth in the near future.” ",3032016,http://www.reuters.com/article/etf-pharmaceuticals-genericdrugs/generic-drug-etf-ailing-despite-political-focus-on-high-drug-prices-idUSL2N161224
611,AGN,EXCLUSIVE-Teva set to win EU okay for $40.5 bln Allergan deal -sources,"* Deal cements Teva as world’s largest generic drugmaker * Concessions include products on the market, in the pipeline   (Adds analyst comments, closing share price; paragraphs 6-10) By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, March 9 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  is expected to win EU antitrust approval for its $40.5 billion bid for Allergan’s generics unit after agreeing to sell off some of its products to appease regulators, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Teva, the world’s biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan. Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators. Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel’s corporate history. The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, did not reply immediately to an email for comment. Teva declined to comment. Shares of Teva closed up 3 percent to $57.90 on the New York Stock Exchange, outpacing a 0.7 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers. Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said Allergan’s generics business ranks as one of the best in the industry and will considerably strengthen Teva’s extensive product line. Teva will gain a number of products from Allergan that have less competition, and therefore more stable pricing, than typical generics, Waterhouse said. They include formulations of Johnson & Johnson’s Concerta treatment for attention deficit disorder. Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said he expects the Teva-Allergan deal to be completed in April, after winning approvals from EU and U.S. regulators. “We see no hurdles to the deal closing as expected,” Maris said. Teva, which has extensive sales forces in Europe and the United States, will obtain big cost savings by having more products to sell through its existing infrastructure, he added. The deal has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January. Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is slated to be acquired later this year by Pfizer Inc in a $160 billion deal, creating the world’s largest drugmaker.

632,AGN,GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar touches 17-month low vs yen as stocks slump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level against the yen since October 2014 and stock markets worldwide slumped as economic data out of Europe and the United States prompted a retreat from riskier assets.  The Japanese currency, often sought in times of market turmoil or economic uncertainty, strengthened. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, speaking to parliament on Tuesday, stressed his readiness to expand monetary policy, such as pushing interest rates further into negative territory.  Wall Street followed declines across Europe and Asia. The MSCI All-World Index .MIWD00000PUS dropped 1.4 percent, on target for its worst day since early February.  In New York, shares of Dublin-based Allergan (AGN.N) were hammered after the U.S. Treasury Department on Monday unveiled rules designed to curb corporate tax inversion mergers that could possibly stymie the company’s tie-up with New York-based Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). A source told Reuters that Pfizer was leaning toward abandoning, not altering, the deal. Allergan shares slumped nearly 15 percent, their biggest percentage drop in nearly 12 years, and were the worst performer on the S&P; 500. Pfizer shares rose 2.1 percent. The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in February in the latest indication that economic growth weakened further in the first quarter, although other data suggested the economic growth picture could improve in the months ahead.  “The mix of global growth being perhaps a bit slower and a more gradual path for the U.S. fed funds rate... are likely positive for the yen,” said Brian Daingerfield, currency strategist for RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 133.68 points, or 0.75 percent, to 17,603.32, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 20.96 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,045.17 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 47.86 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,843.93. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 share index .FTEU3 dropped 1.9 percent. Germany's DAX index .GDAXI slid 2.6 percent after data showed industrial orders in Germany, Europe's largest economy, unexpectedly fell 2.1 percent in February. Further muddying the waters for investors, two senior officials of the U.S. Federal Reserve said the market’s views of when the central bank would raise interest rates may be too pessimistic. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said just last week the U.S. central bank would proceed cautiously in raising rates. Those remarks were viewed as dovish and sent U.S. stocks to their highest levels of the year so far. The dollar fell as low as 109.94 against the yen JPY= and was last down 0.87 percent at 110.34 yen.  Oil steadied after Kuwait said an output freeze by major oil producers would proceed without Iran. Brent crude LCOc1 gained 18 cents to settle at $37.87 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 19 cents at $35.89 a barrel.     Yields on low-risk government bonds fell. German 10-year yields DE10YT=RR, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, fell as far as 0.08 percent, the lowest level in almost a year. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR were last up 16/32 in price to yield 1.7235 percent, after hitting a session low of 1.717 percent.

633,AGN,U.S. Treasury rules put Pfizer-Allergan deal in question,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department’s proposed new tax regulations threw a series of corporate mergers into question on Tuesday, fanning a hot political situation and pushing Pfizer Inc closer to a decision to walk away from buying Botox maker Allergan Plc. Pfizer is leaning towards abandoning its $160 billion agreement to buy Allergan in light of the U.S. Treasury’s new measures to curb tax-evading deals, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. Pfizer is not willing to change the terms of its deal with Allergan which, under the new tax rules, would no longer benefit from the move to Ireland, the source said. U.S. President Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a “huge problem” and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from tax-avoiding corporate “inversions”, which lower companies tax bills by redomiciling overseas. “While the Treasury Department’s actions will make it more difficult ... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good,” Obama said. Besides Pfizer-Allergan, deals that could be affected by the new rules include the proposed $16.5 billion merger of Johnson Controls Inc with Ireland-based Tyco International Plc Johnson Controls said it is reviewing the regulations. Tyco did not immediately reply to a request comment. Waste Connections Inc and Canada’s Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd said on Tuesday they will go ahead with their $2.67 billion deal. Both companies’ shares fell. The largest among the affected deals is Pfizer’s plan to buy Dublin-based Allergan, move its headquarters to Ireland, and lower its tax rate. Allergan shares were down 15.4 percent at $234.94 in the busiest trading day in company history. Pfizer shares rose 2 percent to $31.33. Discussions between the two companies and their lawyers are set to continue Tuesday and no final decision has been made, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Pfizer, which announced the deal in November, has said its tax rate would drop to about 17 or 18 percent after the deal, from around 25 percent. That would represent more than $1 billion in annual cost savings. On Monday night, Pfizer and Allergan said in a joint statement that they were reviewing the notice and declined to speculate on whether the deal would go forward. Allergan’s bonds sold off in heavy trading on expectations the deal would fall through and that Allergan would not get the credit ratings lift that market players had expected by its merger with Pfizer. Trading activity in Allergan and Pfizer options surged to several times normal. Shares of M&A; advisory firms, meanwhile, tumbled in response to the new U.S. inversion rules. The S&P; 600 Investment Banking & Brokerage Index lost 2.9 percent, M&A; advisor Evercore Partners fell 4.7 percent, while Greenhill & Co  was down 4.5 percent. The federal government has grappled with a wave of inversions in recent years as U.S. companies seek to slash their tax bills by redomiciling overseas, although their core operations and management usually remain in the United States even as they claim a new tax home. Late on Monday, the Treasury Department introduced a regulation that would negate the benefits of inversions. Treasury said it will impose a three-year limit on foreign companies bulking up on U.S. assets to avoid ownership limits for a later inversion deal. Allergan’s key deals in the prior 36 months include the $66 billion merger with Actavis Plc and the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories. Several U.S. presidential candidates, including Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, have seized on the issue in their campaigns. “We have so many companies leaving, it is disgraceful,”  Trump told reporters as he greeted voters in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders both expressed support for Treasury’s plan. If Pfizer does not acquire Allergan’s new, fast-growing medicines, Pfizer will need to look for other companies with attractive products, such as U.S. drugmakers Biogen Inc , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and AbbVie Inc , said Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director of brokerage H.C. Wainwright. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said if the deal collapses, Pfizer will likely move up its decision on a key business strategy - whether to sell or spin off its hundreds of generic medicines. Pfizer had planned to make a decision by 2016 whether to split off its generics, but delayed the decision until 2019 after announcing its merger with Allergan. Conover said the decision could be moved to late 2017 or 2018. Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli funds which owns Allergan shares, said Allergan stock was falling as merger-related investors sold out, but that Allergan as a standalone company is attractive. “They’ve been very successful as an acquirer over the years, making smart deals, not overpaying for them, integrating them well and making them work. They just get back to that,” Jonas said. He said he thinks Allergan is worth about $250 per share.

634,AGN,Allergan shares fall as investors bet on Pfizer deal collapse,"NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Shares in Allergan Plc  opened down more than 15 percent on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. Treasury Department proposed new tax regulations that analysts said could kill its $160 billion agreement to be bought by Pfizer Inc. Pfizer’s deal to buy Dublin-based Allergan was conceived under rules that would have allowed the company to move its headquarters to Ireland and lower its tax rate. The government has been trying to stop that type of deal, called a tax inversion. Late on Monday, the Treasury Department introduced a regulation that would negate the tax benefits of Pfizer’s acquisition of Allergan. Allergan shares were trading down 15.3 percent at $235 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer shares rose 1.6 percent to $31.20. “By how the stocks are trading, the market thinks the deal is almost dead,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, whose firm holds Pfizer shares. On Monday night, Pfizer said that it was reviewing the notice and declined to speculate on whether the deal would go forward. “To us, whether Pfizer and Allergan stay committed will be known shortly - more important for many is if the deal breaks, where should Allergan trade?” Wells Fargo analyst David Maris wrote in a research note on Tuesday morning. Maris lowered his valuation range for the stock to a range of $265 to $270 from a range of $345 to $350.

635,AGN,"Pfizer, Allergan scrap $160 billion deal after U.S. tax rule change","(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) walked away from their $160 billion merger on Wednesday, a major win for President Barack Obama, who has been pushing to curb deals in which companies move overseas to cut taxes. Pfizer said the decision was driven by new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at such deals, called inversions. The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by an estimated $1 billion annually by domiciling in Ireland, where tax rates are lower. While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan’s history as a major acquirer of other companies. Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on CNBC television that the new Treasury rule would not stop the company from doing other stock-based acquisitions as soon as this fall. The new Treasury rule takes into account the past three years of a company’s deals. “It really looked like they did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,” Saunders said. Saunders said that he would stay to run the standalone company with a focus on both deals and research and development. Allergan will also move ahead with plans for its $40.5 billion sale of its generic drug business to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). It expects the transaction to close by June. With the deal behind it, Pfizer said it would decide this year about whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines into a separate business. It had put off making that decision until 2019 after announcing its deal with Allergan last November. Pfizer will pay Allergan $150 million to reimburse expenses from its deal. Shares of Allergan, which fell 15 percent on Tuesday, were up 3.3 percent at $244.38 at mid-afternoon. Pfizer rose 4.7 percent to $32.84.  Pfizer has new products coming and plenty of money that it could put to work with acquisitions, though not on the scale of Allergan, said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, which holds Pfizer shares. It is not clear that Pfizer should definitely split into two, he said. “It is true that these larger companies are a little unwieldy to manage,” Funtleyder said, “but there are plenty of strategies to keep them together and increase shareholder value.”     The decision to call off the deal came in part because Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage its deal with Allergan might have provoked new rules by the Treasury, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday. Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a “huge problem” and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from deals that allow it. U.S. inversion rules have unraveled other mergers. U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) abandoned its $55 billion takeover of Ireland-domiciled peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) in 2014 after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions. AbbVie had to pay Shire a $1.6 billion break-up fee. ",4062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-m-a-pfizer/pfizer-allergan-scrap-160-billion-deal-after-u-s-tax-rule-change-idUSKCN0X3188

638,AGN,US STOCKS-Wall St rises with healthcare; oil rallies,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday, bolstered by gains in healthcare shares after the collapse of the $160 billion merger of Pfizer and Allergan, and by a rise in energy shares. Minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting suggested the Fed was unlikely to raise interest rates before June.  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) called off their merger after new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at curbing tax-cutting inversion deals.  News of the merger’s breakup boosted the healthcare sector on hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets.  The S&P; healthcare index .SPXHC gained 2.7 percent, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI jumped 6 percent. Shares of Pfizer rose 5 percent to $32.93 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500, while Allergan was up 3.5 percent at $244.74. “I guess the feeling is Pfizer will now look for a new target,” said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer, Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. But, he said, “the rally in healthcare is a little counter-intuitive, given the political climate seems to be negative for big pharma right now.” The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 112.73 points, or 0.64 percent, to 17,716.05, the S&P; 500 .SPX had gained 21.49 points, or 1.05 percent, to 2,066.66 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC had added 76.78 points, or 1.59 percent, to 4,920.72. Crude oil jumped after data showed an unexpected draw in U.S. stockpiles last week, boosting shares of energy companies. The S&P; 500 energy index .SPNY rose 2.1 percent. The day’s rally, which included gains in all but two sectors, followed two days of declines in the S&P; 500. The index had rallied 13 percent in the previous seven weeks, thanks to stabilizing oil prices and reduced concerns about China’s economy.  Investors will soon turn their attention to first-quarter S&P; 500 earnings, which are estimated to be down 7.4 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some strategists see further gains in the market if companies are able to handily beat such low earnings expectations. Federal Reserve policymakers debated whether they might hike rates in April but “a number” of them argued headwinds to growth would probably persist, with many arguing they should be cautious about raising rates. “I don’t think there was anything particularly surprising there. We knew from earlier comments immediately following (the meeting) that there was some dissension,” Massocca said. About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.2 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,286 to 734, for a 3.11-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 2,003 issues rose and 789 fell for a 2.54-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

639,AGN,US STOCKS-Wall St rises with healthcare; oil rallies,"* Pfizer, Allergan lead gains in healthcare sector * Oil gains boost energy sector * Indexes up: Dow 0.2 pct, S&P; 0.5 pct, Nasdaq 1 pct   (Updates to after Fed minutes) By Caroline Valetkevitch April 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, bolstered by gains in healthcare shares after the collapse of the $160 billion merger of Pfizer and Allergan, and by a rise in energy shares. Indexes slightly pared gains after the release of minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting. They showed policymakers debated last month whether an interest rate hike would be needed in April, though a consensus emerged that risks from a global economic slowdown warranted a cautious approach. “The minutes were a little more hawkish than the tone that we’ve heard from (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen post-FOMC meeting, but that was to be expected somewhat in my view,” said Scott Smith, senior market analyst at Cambridge global Payments in Toronto. Investors have been grappling with mixed signals from Fed officials, including comments from Yellen last week that eased anxiety about potential interest rate hikes. The collapse of the Pfizer and Allergan merger bolstered the healthcare sector on hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets. Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $32.57 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500, while Allergan was up 3.6 percent at $245.05. The S&P; healthcare index was up 2.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index jumped 4.8 percent. At 2:52 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average was up 28.39 points, or 0.16 percent, to 17,631.71, the S&P; 500  gained 10.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,055.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.28 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,891.21. Crude jumped after data showed an unexpected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles last week, boosting shares of energy companies. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,898 to 1,074, for a 1.77-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,748 issues rose and 991 fell for a 1.76-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 29 new highs and 18 new lows.

640,AGN,Mega-deal collapse a second-quarter wake-up for merger-arb hedge funds,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds which bet on mergers and acquisitions were hurt by the collapse of a $160 billion tie-up between pharmaceutical companies Pfizer (PFE.N) and Allergan (AGN.N) - although the effects could have been even worse. The deal was pulled after the U.S. Treasury drafted new rules to deter companies from moving their headquarters to countries with a more favorable tax regime, so called ‘tax inversions’, echoing the failed merger between Shire (SHP.L) and ABBVie (ABBV.N) in 2014 which hurt many funds. Shares in Allergan fell 15 percent on Tuesday after Reuters reported the mega-deal had likely fallen through, while Pfizer rose 2 percent. The companies confirmed the deal was off on Wednesday. While few funds came through unscathed, with large U.S. funds such as Paulson & Co among the worst hit, a mix of optimism the deal would go ahead and a reluctance to super-size positions had helped many trim their losses. “For managers doing risk-arb, it was super-consensual. But most people who were trading that specific spread were lightly hedged or were long Pfizer as well, which helped,” said a London-based fund of hedge funds manager. “If you were purely trading the spread, you’d have been killed. Everyone got hurt, but most got hurt just on the Allergan leg, which is unusual.” Merger arbitrage funds often aim to make money by buying shares in a company that is the target of a takeover bid in the hope they will rise towards the offer price. They also bet that the share price of the company making the bid will fall and they can make a return from the spread between the two prices. If they think the opposite, they can reverse the trade, although data from industry tracker Markit showed less than half a percent of Allergan stock was out on loan heading into the news. The strategy is also used by funds with a broader event-driven investing remit, which aims to take advantage of share price differences that may occur in the run up to a corporate sale, or merger or other corporate event. One investment consultant said the deal had cost the 12 hedge funds he tracks between 25 basis points and 70 basis points of performance. Lyxor Asset Management senior analyst Jean Baptiste Berthon said 16 funds, mostly located in the United States, had lost up to 1 percent of their fund’s value after the deal fell through, although many had lost “hardly anything” by buying both stocks. Some had also hedged their exposure by placing a short position on other firms engaged in tax inversions, effectively a bet that the share price will fall, while others had kept position sizes small after being burnt by the Shire/Abbvie hit. Given there were relatively fewer tax inversion deals in play as a result of growing political pressure in the United States to curb them, there was much less risk of contagion across a merger-arb hedge fund’s portfolio. “The situation seems quite different from last year where you could see several major deals with a tax inversion embedded in it, which had a very large ripple effect on these funds ... we are not seeing such contagion today,” Berthon said. Fourteen tax inversion deals were announced in 2015 for a combined $183.7 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed, with Pfizer/Allergan representing the bulk. This year there have been just two tax-driven deals, valued at $33.8 billion. After making 8.4 percent during a bumper year for deal-making in 2015, merger arb funds had enjoyed a positive start to the year, data from Hedge Fund Research showed, with the HFRX Merger Arbitrage Index up 1.75 percent to end-March. The broader HFRX Event Driven Index, meanwhile, was down 1.13 percent in the year to end-March, HFR data showed, adding to a fall of 6.94 percent in 2015 and HFR President Kenneth Heinz said it could face a 20 basis points hit from Allergan. Given the solid month for many funds in March, the impact of the deal collapse would likely not weigh on year-end performance, said Anthony Lawler, Head of Portfolio Management at GAM Alternative Investments Solutions. “It hurts ... event driven investors will dislike this Allergan news, but it will not alone badly impact year-to-date numbers except for the very concentrated event managers.” ",4062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-m-a-pfizer-hedgefunds/mega-deal-collapse-a-second-quarter-wake-up-for-merger-arb-hedge-funds-idUSKCN0X32DF

642,AGN,"UPDATE 3-Pfizer, Allergan scrap $160 bln deal after U.S. tax rule change","(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) walked away from their $160 billion merger on Wednesday, a major win for President Barack Obama, who has been pushing to curb deals in which companies move overseas to cut taxes. Pfizer said the decision was driven by new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at such deals, called inversions. The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by an estimated $1 billion annually by domiciling in Ireland, where tax rates are lower. While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan’s history as a major acquirer of other companies. Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on CNBC television that the new Treasury rule would not stop the company from doing other stock-based acquisitions as soon as this fall. The new Treasury rule takes into account the past three years of a company’s deals. “It really looked like they did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,” Saunders said. Saunders said that he would stay to run the standalone company with a focus on both deals and research and development. Allergan will also move ahead with plans for its $40.5 billion sale of its generic drug business to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). It expects the transaction to close by June. With the deal behind it, Pfizer said it would decide this year about whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines into a separate business. It had put off making that decision until 2019 after announcing its deal with Allergan last November. Pfizer will pay Allergan $150 million to reimburse expenses from its deal. Shares of Allergan, which fell 15 percent on Tuesday, were up 3.3 percent at $244.38 at mid-afternoon. Pfizer rose 4.7 percent to $32.84.  Pfizer has new products coming and plenty of money that it could put to work with acquisitions, though not on the scale of Allergan, said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, which holds Pfizer shares. It is not clear that Pfizer should definitely split into two, he said. “It is true that these larger companies are a little unwieldy to manage,” Funtleyder said, “but there are plenty of strategies to keep them together and increase shareholder value.”     The decision to call off the deal came in part because Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage its deal with Allergan might have provoked new rules by the Treasury, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday. Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a “huge problem” and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from deals that allow it. U.S. inversion rules have unraveled other mergers. U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) abandoned its $55 billion takeover of Ireland-domiciled peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) in 2014 after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions. AbbVie had to pay Shire a $1.6 billion break-up fee. ",4062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-ma-pfizer/update-3-pfizer-allergan-scrap-160-bln-deal-after-u-s-tax-rule-change-idUSL3N17936X
643,AGN,"US STOCKS-Wall St pushed higher by healthcare, energy stocks","* Fed March meeting minutes due at 2pm ET * Crude up nearly 5 pct * Pfizer, Allergan lead gains in healthcare sector * Indexes up: Dow 0.39 pct, S&P; 0.65 pct, Nasdaq 1.02 pct   (Updates to early afternoon) By Abhiram Nandakumar April 6 (Reuters) - Healthcare and energy stocks drove gains on Wall Street on Wednesday ahead of the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting on interest rates in March. Investors, who have been grappling with mixed signals on rate hikes from Fed officials, will parse the minutes to gain insight into the central bank’s thinking on the economy. The minutes are due at 2 p.m. ET (1600 GMT). The collapse of the $160 billion merger of Pfizer and Allergan bolstered the healthcare sector on rising hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets. Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $32.57 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500, while Allergan was up 3.6 percent at $245.05. Crude jumped nearly 5 percent after data showed an unexpected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles last week. A seven-week rally - sparked by rising oil, strength in the economy and a cautious Fed - helped stocks recover from a steep selloff that had sent the S&P; 500 down more than 10 percent earlier this year. The index closed flat for 2016 on Tuesday. “We’re still technically in a declining environment, and we have to get to an all-time high before we can give the all-clear signal,” said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P; Global Market Intelligence in New York. Stovall said better-than-expected corporate earnings could provide the catalyst to drive stocks higher that investors were looking for. S&P; 500 companies on average are expected to report a 7.4 percent fall in first-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:48 p.m. ET (1648 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 68.15 points, or 0.39 percent, at 17,671.47, the S&P; 500 was up 13.25 points, or 0.65 percent, at 2,058.42 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 49.43 points, or 1.02 percent, at 4,893.36. Seven of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 2.09 percent rise in energy. The sector is up 2.5 percent in 2016, having tracked the rebound in crude. The S&P; healthcare sector, which was up 2.03 percent on Wednesday, is one of only two sectors in negative territory for the year. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,108 to 814. On the Nasdaq, 1,851 issues rose and 803 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed eight new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 15 new lows.

653,AGN,Teva Pharm finalizing asset sales to clear Allergan deal: source,"(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd is finalizing as much as $2 billion in asset sale agreements to win U.S. antitrust clearance for its $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc’s generic drug portfolio, according to a source familiar with the matter. The divestments would boost efforts by Teva, the Israeli pharmaceutical company, to close the deal with Allergan, which is domiciled in Ireland. Teva said in March that a regulatory review of the deal by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was taking longer than anticipated, and that it expected the transaction to be completed by June.  Teva has found buyers for nearly all of the assets it expects to divest, which could be worth as much as $2 billion in total, the source said on Thursday. They include around 50 drugs already on the market and 25 in development that treat illnesses ranging from cancer to respiratory disease and central nervous system disorders, the source said. Teva is still on track to close the deal next month, the source added, asking not to be identified because the latest developments are not public. Teva declined to comment, Allergan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Finalizing a divestiture plan does not guarantee approval from the FTC, which can sometimes surprise companies by making demands for additional asset sales or proclaim that a transaction is anti-competitive. Teva’s deal with Allergan has been cleared by European antitrust regulators.  In July, Teva agreed to buy the generics portfolio of Allergan, solidfying Teva’s position as the world’s largest generic manufacturer. For Allergan, the transaction will help focus its business on brand-name drugs and provide a massive war chest for future acquisitions. Allergan had subsequently agreed to a $160 billion takeover by larger player Pfizer Inc, but the deal was derailed last month by the U.S. Treasury which introduced rules that eliminated tax benefits central to the transaction.  Investors and industry analysts expect Allergan will look for new acquisition targets once the sale to Teva is completed. Teva is still in the process of finding buyers for one set of assets, a bundle of drugs in various stages of development worth about $500 million, but expects to agree to a deal as soon as next week, the source said.

660,AGN,"Allergan profit beats estimates, share buybacks planned","(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N), whose $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) collapsed last month, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would buy back up to $10 billion in company stock, helping lift its shares 4 percent. The Dublin drugmaker on Tuesday said the planned $40 billion sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) will close next month and that it will use $8 billion of the money to pay down company debt.  Since the U.S. government torpedoed the merger, a deal that would have relocated Pfizer’s legal domicile to Ireland to reduce Pfizer’s taxes, investors have speculated Allergan might use the Teva proceeds for sizeable new deals. However, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, in a conference call with industry analysts, said he was more interested for now in “stepping stone deals” valued at up to a few billion dollars meant to bolster the company’s existing disease areas. Allergan, known as Actavis Inc until it bought Botox-maker Allergan Inc last year and took on its name, said it expects to buy back $4 billion to $5 billion of its shares over the next four to six months and would consider more stock repurchases if  market conditions allow. The company’s market value is currently $84.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding special items, the company earned $3.04 per share in the first quarter, topping the average analysts’ estimate of $3.01 largely because of lower than expected research spending. Up to Monday’s close of $213.71, Allergan’s stock had fallen about 23 percent since Pfizer scrapped the merger, which would have been the biggest-ever in the pharmaceutical industry. The deal collapsed after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules curbing tax inversions, or moves by American companies to relocate their domicile overseas to cut taxes. “With this highly controversial quarter now in the rear view mirror, we see an attractive setup in Allergan shares going forward based on a combination of attractive valuation, ongoing healthy organic growth and significant capital deployment optionality,” said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott. Revenue in its U.S. brands business, including Botox, rose 27.3 percent to $2.30 billion. The unit accounts for about 60 percent of the company’s total revenue. The company reported net income of $186.1 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with a loss of $535.2 million, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue rose 48 percent to $3.80 billion, below Wall Street’s expectations of $3.95 billion. Revenue fell in the company’s generic distribution unit, which lost business from Target Corp’s (TGT.N) in-store pharmacies after they were acquired by CVS Health (CVS.N).

He added that while large-scale, “transformational” deals are not currently on the table, Ireland-based Allergan will be able to consider transactions worth multiple billions of dollars. The FTC has blocked several major transactions this year, prompting concerns among investors that there could be problems closing the Allergan-Teva deal. Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) deal to buy Allergan for $160 billion was derailed last month by new U.S. Treasury rules that targeted its anticipated tax benefits.

680,AGN,"Carl Icahn acquires 'large position' in Allergan, backs CEO","(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Tuesday he had acquired a “large position” in Botox-maker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) and that he was very supportive of Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders. Shares of Allergan rose 0.8 percent to $237.85 in mid-morning trading. Icahn, who did not disclose details of the stake, said in a statement on his website that he was confident in Saunders' ability to enhance value for all Allergan shareholders. (bit.ly/1UatnIM) Allergan has “no reason to believe that this investment was made for purposes of influencing the actions of management or control of the company,” spokesman Mark Marmur said in an emailed statement. Saunders has come close to Icahn before. Saunders became CEO of Allergan after it was bought by Actavis, where he had been CEO, and then changed its name. Saunders had moved into the top spot at Actavis from the CEO job at Forest Labs, which Actavis acquired. Icahn had a Forest Labs stake and was agitating for change when the company’s long-time management ceded control and Saunders took the CEO job in 2013. Icahn said he sold the Forest position when the company changed hands. Allergan is near to closing the sale of its generic business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). Once that happens, Saunders has said the company will be able to make acquisitions of more than $1 billion. Allergan needs to pay off more debt before it will make even bigger deals, he has said. The move comes a few months after Allergan’s plans to be bought by Pfizer (PFE.N) fell apart. In that so-called “inversion” deal, Pfizer would have moved its headquarter to Dublin, where Allergan is based, in order to lower the taxes it pays in the United States. Icahn, who launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate such deals, had said the Pfizer-Allergan tie-up would result in the loss of the country’s 10th largest company to Ireland. The government effectively blocked that deal by issuing new tax rules that made it less favorable.

686,AGN,FDA approves Allergan's combination therapy for hypertension,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Allergan Plc’s treatment for high blood pressure or hypertension, the company said on Monday. The therapy, Byvalson, is a fixed-dose combination of two FDA-approved blood pressure lowering agents, Nebivolol and Valsartan. The two drugs fight hypertension using different mechanisms of action and are administered once a day. Byvalson was tested against a placebo in two late-stage trials and also showed patients given the drug had a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure than those given either just Nebivolol or Valsartan, Allergan said. Hypertension often has no warning signs or symptoms, and has been associated with serious cardiovascular risks, such as stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Allergan said lowering blood pressure in such cases reduces the risk to the heart, but there are no controlled trials showing that Byvalson could reduce such risks. The treatment is expected to hit the market by the second half of 2016, the company added in its statement.

The deal is part of the divestiture process mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in relation to Teva’s acquisition of Allergan’s generics business for $40.5 billion.

However, the company’s shares fell 10 percent to $28.72 in morning trading on Tuesday.

Impax said it will also take back from Teva rights to a generic version of Concerta, an ADHD drug made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), adding a near-term launch product to its pipeline. The acquired marketed generic products generated about $150 million in net sales and about $100 million in gross profit in 2015, Impax said.

The deal was announced more than a year ago and had been expected to wrap up last month, but it has taken longer as the companies have arranged sales of more drugs than anticipated to clear the antitrust regulators. “We expect the closing of the ... generics deal at any time now,” Teva Chief Executive Officer Erez Vigodman said during a conference call with analysts to discuss the Israeli drugmaker’s financial outlook. The deal closing is contingent on clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the antitrust regulator reviewing the deal, which the companies said they expect at any time. After it clears that hurdle, it will take another 10 days to close on the sale, Vigodman said. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment. Teva shares (TEVA.N) rose 2.95 percent to $54.01 in late morning trading in New York, and Allergan gained 1.96 percent to $244.42. Allergan also said in a regulatory filing earlier on Wednesday that the companies had amended their sale agreement to extend the deadline by three months into late October. As the review has continued into July, it has raised the likelihood of the companies missing the deadline later this month.

722,AGN,"Teva, Allergan win U.S. antitrust approval for generics deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) won U.S. antitrust approval to purchase Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) generics business, after agreeing to divest 79 generic drugs to rival firms, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.  The $40.5 billion deal, which was announced in July 2015, solidifies Teva’s position as the world’s No. 1 maker of generics while freeing Allergan to focus on branded drugs. Teva will sell rights and assets related to the 79 pharmaceutical products to 11 rival firms, marking the largest ever drug divestiture order in an FTC pharmaceutical merger case, the commission said in a statement. Generics, drugs on which patents have expired and typically a source of healthcare savings, have made headlines over the past year as some drugmakers sharply raised prices on medications with few competitors. “Millions of Americans rely daily on generic drugs to treat a wide range of illnesses,” Debbie Feinstein, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the statement. “The FTC’s settlement safeguards the competitive availability of these medications for patients across the country who depend on them,” she added. Products being sold include anesthetics, antibiotics, weight-loss drugs, oral contraceptives and treatments for a wide variety of diseases and conditions, the statement said. The acquirers of the divested drugs are Mayne Pharma Group Ltd (MYX.AX), Impax Laboratories Inc IPXL.O, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd (RDY.N), Sagent Pharmaceuticals Inc SGNT.O, Cipla Ltd  (CIPL.NS), Zydus Worldwide, Mikah Pharma, Perrigo Pharma International PRGO.O, Aurobindo Pharma (ARBN.NS), Prasco LLC and 3M Co (MMM.N), according to the FTC. There has been an unprecedented wave of deals in the healthcare sector since early 2014, from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals, to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers. Teva, which expects to close the transaction next week, said the combined company will have about 338 product registrations pending U.S. regulatory approval and will hold the leading position as the initial market entrant for around 115 pending U.S. generic drug applications. Chief Executive Erez Vigodam said in a statement that the deal will generate $1.4 billion in operational and tax savings by the end of 2019 and raise adjusted earnings by 14 percent next year.

The talks were informal and preliminary, the Journal said, adding they may might not result in a deal, in part because Biogen may not be interested.  Allergan was unlikely to pursue the deal, CNBC said, citing a source. Biogen shares closed up 9.4 percent at $330.11 on Tuesday, valuing the company at about $72.33 billion. The stock fell 1.3 percent in extended trade following the CNBC report. Officials at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen could not be reached for comment. Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur and Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said they do not comment on speculation. The WSJ report came less than two weeks after Biogen reported surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings but said Chief Executive George Scangos, 68, would step down in coming months after a successor is found. Although Biogen significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast, growth for its flagship Tecfidera treatment for multiple sclerosis has been slowing. The slowdown prompted the company last year to embark on a sweeping restructuring program to cut costs and focus on core areas, such as neurology, including treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges said Merck, Allergan or other large drugmakers would benefit from acquiring Biogen and its experimental drugs in late-stage trials, which include treatments for Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. “There’s a scarcity of assets in the industry,” Porges said. “The industry needs to bulk up and consolidate and neither Merck nor Allergan have a multiple sclerosis business today,” he said, while Biogen is leading the field.

731,AGN,"Pfizer beats estimates, but branded drugs disappoint","(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, driven by lower taxes and sales of generic medicines, but revenue from its branded patent-protected medicines brought disappointment. The largest U.S. drugmaker did not offer any hints on whether it plans to split into two separate companies, a long-mulled potential decision that has kept investors in suspense.  Pfizer, whose shares fell 2.3 percent in morning trading, said second quarter revenue rose 11 percent to $13.15 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $13.01 billion. Sales of generic medicines rose 16 percent to $6.04 billion, helped by Pfizer’s $16 billion purchase last year of generic hospital products company Hospira.  Although generics beat expectations, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said sales of Hospira products, at $1.14 billion, were 7 percent below his forecast, and suggested “limited revenue synergies” from that acquisition. Sales of Pfizer’s patent-protected drugs rose 7 percent to $7.11 billion, 2 percent below Arfaei’s estimate.     Higher sales of nerve-pain drug Lyrica helped offset disappointing sales of its Prevnar vaccine for pneumococcal infections. In April, Pfizer terminated a $160 billion deal to acquire Irish drugmaker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) after the U.S. Treasury Department issued new rules restricting tax inversion transactions aimed at slashing taxes. With collapse of the deal, investors have shifted their focus to whether Pfizer will break up, creating one company specializing in patent-protected drugs and another geared toward branded generic drugs. Pfizer for several years has weighed whether such a split makes sense, largely because its patent-protected medicines routinely enjoy sales growth, while its portfolio of generics usually post declines.  Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read on Tuesday said the company will decide by year end. “We’re presenting all the pros and cons to our board.”        The company’s new breast cancer treatment, Ibrance, generated sales of $514 million, exceeding Evercore ISI’s forecast of $496 million. Pfizer earned 64 cents per share, excluding special items, beating the average analyst estimate by 2 cents. Net income fell to $2.02 billion, or 33 cents per share, from $2.63 billion, or 42 cents per share, hurt by restructuring charges and acquisition costs. Pfizer reaffirmed it expects 2016 earnings of $2.38 to $2.48 per share. It earned $2.20 per share in 2015. Separately, the company on Tuesday said it had reached a $486 million settlement of shareholder litigation accusing it of causing big losses for shareholders by concealing safety risks of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs.

740,AGN,UPDATE 1-Teva Pharm eyes more acquisitions after buying Allergan's generics business,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) will remain in the hunt for more acquisitions after completing a deal to buy Allergan’s (AGN.N) generics business for $40.5 billion this week. Teva expects to generate free cash flow of more than $25 billion through 2019 from the integration of Actavis, $5 billion of which will go towards dividend payouts. “The rest will be divided between paying down debt and entertaining attractive specialty deals,” Erez Vidogman, Teva’s chief executive, told a conference call of analysts following the publication of second-quarter results. The deal, announced in July last year and partly financed by bond offerings totalling more than $20 billion, solidifies Israel-based Teva’s position as the world’s No. 1 maker of generics. Teva this week also bought Allergan’s Anda Inc distribution for $500 million. It now seeks to expand further into the branded segment. Its own blockbuster multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone has 30 percent of the U.S. market, the company said. It expects to launch a drug to treat Huntington’s disease next year. In the second quarter, specialty drug revenue rose 9 percent to $2.3 billion. Teva’s generics drug revenue fell 7 percent to $2.3 billion, led by a 33 percent drop in the United States. But Copaxone recorded an 8 percent rise in sales to $1.1 billion. The drug, which Teva said accounts for about 22 percent of revenue and 47 percent of its profit, faces competition. Sandoz, part of Swiss Novartis AG (NOVN.S), and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA.O) last year launched a once-daily 20 mg version called Glatopa, which had sales of $20.7 million in the second quarter. To minimize the damage, Teva has been shifting MS patients from a daily 20 mg dose to a three times a week 40 mg and Teva’s patent on the higher dosage is being challenged in court. Sandoz and Momenta are vying for approval to sell such a version. Teva holds five patents on Copaxone and believes they will be upheld. “Any generic launch prior to a final non-appealable court ruling on all five patents, which is not expected before the second half of 2018, would be at risk” to legal action, Vigodman said. Teva posted earnings per share excluding one-time items of $1.25 per share, down from $1.43 a year earlier. Revenue grew 1 percent to $5.0 billion. Vigodman said Teva’s main focus would be on integrating Actavis but also on delivering on its operational and financial targets and on development and commercialisation of more than 35 products in its pipeline. The company reaffirmed it expects 2016 revenue of $22-$22.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.20-$5.40. Last month it provided a financial outlook through 2019. Teva declared a cash dividend of 34 cents a share for the second quarter, the same as the previous three months. Its New York-listed shares were 1.2 percent higher in morning trading at $54.22.

741,AGN,Teva Pharm to focus on integrating Allergan's generics business,"JERUSALEM, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  will focus on the integration of Allergan’s  generics business into its operations, it said on Thursday, after completing the $40.5 billion deal this week. The deal, which was announced in July last year, solidifies Israel-based Teva’s position as the world’s No. 1 maker of generics.

742,AGN,"Allergan focused on 'stepping stone' deals, not big ones like Biogen","(Reuters) - Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) chief executive officer said on Monday he is not interested in using the drugmaker’s cash pile for big deals, one week after selling its generics business for $40.5 billion. Wall Street has been looking for clues as to when Allergan CEO Brent Saunders would target a big acquisition to gain pharmaceutical or dermatology products with growth potential. But the seasoned dealmaker dampened those hopes on Monday during a conference call with analysts to discuss the company’s second-quarter results, saying he was in no hurry to complete a big transaction. After paying down debt, Allergan said it now holds $27.6 billion in cash.   When asked if he was interested in buying U.S. biotechnology company Biogen Inc (BIIB.O), which was widely reported last week, Saunders said the company was focused more on “stepping stones.” “We are not looking at and we are not focused on any large transformational M&A;,” Saunders said. Later on the call, he said that if an extraordinary situation presented itself, Allergan would obviously look at it, but that it does not “need a big deal.” The company was created when Dublin-based Actavis bought the Botox maker in March 2015, snatching it from hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) and taking Allergan’s name. Four months later the company agreed to sell the Actavis generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N), and in November agreed to a merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) for $160 billion. Pfizer walked away from the agreement in April after the U.S. government cracked down on deals in which companies move to countries that have a lower tax rate.  Saunders said that rather than make big deals, the company would continue to focus on buying back shares. Allergan said that plunging second-quarter sales of its Alzheimer’s drug Namenda IR, now facing generic competition, canceled out growing revenue from Botox and its other major prescription drugs. Sales of Namenda IR plummeted to $4.1 million in the quarter from $233 million in the year-ago period. The medicine lost patent protection a year ago. Second-quarter net revenue rose marginally, to $3.68 billion from $3.63 billion a year earlier, but was below the average Wall Street estimate of $4.08 billion. Company spokesman Mark Marmur said the sales miss was largely because many analysts, in their estimates, had not taken into account that Allergan is now reporting its Anda generics distribution business as a discontinued operation. Allergan said last week it would sell Anda for $500 million to Teva, a day after the Israeli drugmaker completed the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s generic-drug portfolio. Allergan cut its forecast for adjusted full-year net revenue to a range of $14.65 billion to $14.90 billion, from $17 billion. But the updated forecast also treats the Anda distribution unit as discontinued.      Allergan shares were down 3.1 percent to $245.93 in afternoon trading, alongside a 1.4 percent decline in the Arca Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large drugmakers. Up to Friday’s close of $253.85, Allergan had fallen nearly 19 percent this year.

It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant’s deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month. The U.S. Treasury said the Commission’s order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel . A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made “a cheap money grab” for U.S. revenues. But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple’s taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas. “The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues,” he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. “So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple’s tax avoidance.” For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states’ efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. “Companies are playing one government against another,” he told Reuters. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish  predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. “The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter,” Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe. The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home. As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp  are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration that Europe is out to punish American success. Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too. “When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support,” he said. The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc’s proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called “tax inversions”, by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes. Pfizer abandoned the merger.

760,AGN,"Allergan vows limited price hikes, says 'outliers' deter research","(Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Allergan Plc said his company would limit annual price increases on its prescription drugs, and that “outlier” drugmakers that have imposed huge price increases on their products were scaring off venture capital investors. Allergan, the maker of such products as Botox, plans to raise prices no more than once a year and keep price hikes to no more than low-to-mid-single-digit percentages, slightly above the current annual rate of inflation, CEO Brent Saunders said on Tuesday.  Price increases taken by Allergan so far this year reflect that range, and will be the pattern for price increases next year and beyond, Saunders said in an interview. “Allergan is committed to being a good citizen in self-policing and being disciplined about price increases,” Saunders said. “And I hope others in the industry follow.” Without mentioning names, Saunders said several drugmakers that have come under fire from patients, consumer groups and politicians for huge price increases, had been “reprehensible” and were choking off investment in start-up companies doing cutting-edge drug research. “My biggest fear, every time there’s another headline or more regulator negativity, is that venture capital needed for innovation could move out of the sector,” Saunders said, adding the amount of venture capital backing for early stage drugmakers was slowing. “If the bottom of the ecosystem, which is so important for early drug discovery, begins to evaporate, innovation will start to go away,” he said. “It has started.” Saunders outlined his price-restraint vow in a blog earlier on Tuesday.      Allergan’s biggest products are Botox, used to treat wrinkles and medical conditions such as migraine headaches, and Restasis to treat dry eye. Although a significant portion of Botox sales are for uninsured cosmetic conditions that patients pay out of pocket, Saunders said Allergan would attempt to limit price increases for all uses of the brand. Allergan shares closed 1.3 percent higher at $239.12 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, amid a moderate advance for the Arca Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has cited Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC’s 5,000 percent price increase for AIDS drug Daraprim and Mylan NV’s repeated steep price increases on its EpiPen device for severe allergy sufferers as “troubling” examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc has also drawn criticism for hefty increases on two heart drugs and  other medicines. Clinton said on Friday that if elected president in November, she would create an oversight panel to protect U.S. consumers from large price hikes on long-available innovative drugs, a proposal that Saunders described as “impractical.”  “I’d like to stop outliers too, but implementing that would be hard to do,” Saunders said. “In a free market, who says what would fall under the panel’s purview, and what the price should be?” Clinton also called for emergency government imports of generics when there is insufficient market competition. Saunders said such imported drugs, lacking strict U.S. regulatory review and made under different manufacturing conditions, could have safety issues.

767,AGN,Allergan to buy Tobira in push for fatty liver disease drugs,"(Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Plc, in its third acquisition this month, said it would pay up to $1.7 billion for Tobira Therapeutics Inc to get a leg up in the race to develop therapies for NASH, an incurable fatty liver disease closely linked to obesity. Just hours later on Tuesday, Allergan announced it would also pay $50 million upfront and make future milestone payments for Akarna Therapeutics Ltd, a privately held company that is planning early-stage studies of a treatment for NASH. There are no approved treatments for the disease affecting more than 15 million Americans, which involves accumulation of fat in the liver not caused by alcohol, and can lead to cirrhosis, liver transplants or liver cancer. “Allergan is making an excellent move into the NASH space, which is under appreciated by Wall Street and one of the major categories of untreated diseases,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of StocDoc Partners who holds shares of Tobira. Allergan’s offer on Tuesday of $28.35 upfront per Tobira share is a whopping 500 percent premium to the stock’s close on Monday, which had given Tobira a market capitalization of about $89 million. Tobira shareholders could receive up to $49.84 per share, contingent on the company achieving certain milestones. Tobira’s stock surged 720 percent to $38.91 on Tuesday. But Allergan’s fell 2.7 percent to $238.67 as some industry analysts said the deal came at a steep price. Tobira shares have been on a roller coaster ride since July 25, when they tumbled 60 percent to $4.50 after the company’s lead product, cenicriviroc, failed its main goal in a mid-stage trial of showing a 2-point reduction on a scale that measures features of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis).     But cenicriviroc achieved a secondary goal by reducing by at least one stage the extent of fibrosis, a scarring of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, without worsening of NASH. Tobira said the drug has potential to be approved if that favorable secondary finding can be duplicated in a larger late-stage study. Yaffe said cenicriviroc and related therapies being developed by the company have potential to reap annual sales of $5 billion. He said experimental NASH drugs being developed by Gilead Sciences Inc have similar sales potential and that treatments being studied by Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc and others also have blockbuster sales potential. Allergan research chief David Nicholson, in an interview, said liver biopsies are now required to confirm NASH, but  less-invasive diagnostic tests should be available by the time the first NASH treatments reach the market, or soon after. “The science in NASH is breaking now and this could become one of Allergan’s largest categories” of medicines, Nicholson said.  The proposed acquisition is the latest in a string of deals orchestrated by Brent Saunders, Allergan’s chief executive, since the company’s planned $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc collapsed in April because of unfavorable new U.S. tax regulations. Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment,  last week said it would pay $639 million for Vitae Pharmaceuticals, which is developing drugs for psoriasis, eczema and autoimmune disorders. It agreed on Sept. 6 to pay $60 million for RetroSense, a privately held company developing an ophthalmology gene therapy.  Other major contenders in the race to develop a drug to treat NASH include Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc, whose shares rose 19.4 percent, and Galectin Therapeutics Inc, whose stock gained 14.8 percent.

769,AGN,REFILE-DEALTALK-Allergan pays top dollar for 'stepping stones' from neurology to dermatology,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N) CEO Brent Saunders calls them “stepping stones” - small, bolt-on acquisitions, as opposed to the mega-deals common in the drug industry. And they’re expected to boost dealmaking in sectors ranging from neurology to skin care. Allergan’s agreement on Tuesday to acquire liver drug developer Tobira Therapeutics Inc TBRA.O for $1.7 billion may seem trivial compared to the proposed $160 billion deal Allergan crafted last year to sell itself to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). But that deal was torpedoed in April by the U.S. Treasury’s latest curbs on tax inversions. Now the company, domiciled in Ireland, is taking a new tack, preparing to spend a war chest of more than $20 billion on stepping-stone deals.  The small deals are aimed at filling gaps in its core therapeutic areas, which range from the central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases, to dermatology and eye care. Allergan has added four other small companies to its portfolio this year, three of which sold for less than $100 million upfront, plus performance payments. Two, ForSight Vision and Retrosense Therapeutics, treat eye disorders. The others, Topokine Therapeutics and Vitae Pharmaceuticals Inc. VTAE.O, focus on dermatology.  Allergan agreed to acquire Vitae last week for $639 million. The fact that Allergan is paying top dollar for some of these companies - including a nearly 600 percent premium for Tobira, excluding performance payments - has investors and dealmakers speculating about the company’s next stepping stone. Logical acquisition targets for Allergan would include Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (ACAD.O), a maker of treatments for Parkinson’s disease; Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc (ITCI.O), a developer of psychiatric medications; Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O), which focuses on neurology and women’s health; and Dermira Inc (DERM.O), a dermatology company, according to investment bankers and industry investors.  In an interview with Reuters, Saunders declined to comment on any specific companies that Allergan may want to acquire next. But he said that stepping stones will play a key role in helping the company continue to meet its ambitious annual revenue growth target of 10 percent for years to come.  “I needed to do big deals to get where we are, but the strategic vision was always to get to a point where we could use stepping stones,” Saunders said. 	 Allergan has relied heavily on M&A; because it views inventing its own drugs in-house as too risky. Saunders, 46, has attempted or executed mergers and acquisitions totaling more than $300 billion in the last three years.  Allergan now has the money to embark on a major acquisition spree thanks to the sale of its generic drug portfolio to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). Allergan received $33.4 billion in cash and $5.1 billion in Teva stock last month as a result of that deal.  While Allergan has pledged to spend some of those dollars on share buybacks, it will still have cash reserves of more than $20 billion it can spend on deals.	 Allergan wants to build out its central nervous system franchise, which is one of the largest in the industry and treats diseases including Alzheimer’s, depression, migraines and schizophrenia, Saunders said.      He added that he would like to branch out into other types of neurological treatments, including multiple sclerosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson’s disease.     One of Allergan’s successful endeavors in the central nervous system space, its Namenda Alzheimer’s franchise, took a hit over the past year after one of its key drugs, Namenda IR, lost patent protection. Namenda IR generated more than $500 million in 2015.    Allergan is hoping that a ramp-up of its newly commercialized anti-psychotic drug, Vraylar, can help offset that decline. Saunders said he also is optimistic about opportunities in dermatology and eye care, adding that he would be open to a medium-sized deal to build out its opthalmic products.      In dermatology, Allergan has the world’s biggest franchise by sales, largely due to its flagship drug, Botox, for wrinkle-smoothing. Last year, in a stepping-stone acquisition, Allergan bought a publicly traded dermatology company called Kythera for $2.1 billion, and it has been ramping up sales of its key drug, Kybella, which treats double chins. “There’s definitely potential for more deals like that in dermatology,” said Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Botox is a gateway product into the entire world of aesthetics.” In the interview, Saunders left open the possibility of a transformative acquisition or merger for Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $95 billion. He said a company with a cutting-edge treatment that reversed Alzheimer’s was an example of the type of big deal Allergan would consider making.     Biogen Inc BIIB.N and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) both have late stage drugs that promise to reverse the effects of the degenerative neurological disease. Biogen and Eli Lilly have market capitalizations of $65 billion and $86 billion, respectively. Reuters reported in August that Allergan had held informal conversations with some members of Biogen’s board before deciding against any acquisition offer.

784,AGN,FDA staff flag concerns about Allergan's urinary drug,"(Reuters) - The proposed dosing for a drug being developed by Allergan Plc to treat frequent urination at night has not been adequately studied in trials, a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff concluded. The drug, SER120, is a low-dose nasal version of the commonly used treatment, desmopressin, and is designed to treat adults with nocturia, a disorder where a person wakes up to urinate twice or more at night. There are no FDA-approved drugs to specifically treat nocturia.  Allergan has proposed starting patients with a 0.75 microgram (mcg) dose, and moving up to 1.5 mcg if necessary, but this dosing regimen was not studied in any clinical trials,  staff reviewers said on Monday.  (bit.ly/2dIxcrs) In addition, late-stage data showed that only the higher dose met the statistical criteria for efficacy. The “clinical meaningfulness” of the drug’s benefit was also unclear when compared with a placebo, the reviewers said.  Desmopressin was first approved in the United States in 1978 to treat patients with diabetes insipidus, a rare disorder that causes an imbalance of water in the body.  Since then, the FDA has sanctioned the drug’s use in other conditions.  An oral desmopressin pill from privately held Ferring Pharmaceuticals has been rejected twice by the FDA, which said the risk of hyponatremia, or abnormally low sodium levels in the blood, outweighed the drug’s benefit.     The FDA had asked Allergan to enroll patients aged at least 50 to better assess the risk of hyponatremia, which is greater in the elderly, in its late-stage trials for SER120.  However, since the company is seeking approval for adults regardless of age, efficacy in patients younger than 50 has not been assessed, the staff said.  Of the five deaths among patients on SER120 during clinical trials, the role of the drug cannot be definitively ruled out in two, the reviewers said.  Four of the five deaths were in patients older than 75.  Nocturia is a considered a symptom of one or more underlying conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure.  The review comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside experts who will recommend to the FDA whether to approve the drug.  The agency is not obliged to follow its advisory panel’s recommendations but typically does so.  Allergan in 2010 acquired from privately held Serenity Pharmaceuticals exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and sell the drug for all potential indications, excluding bedwetting in children. The company’s shares were down 1.3 percent at $224.42 in morning trading.

788,AGN,FDA panel backs Allergan's drug for frequent nightly urination,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The benefits associated with Allergan Plc’s experimental drug to treat frequent nightly urination outweigh the risks for certain patients, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Wednesday. The panel voted 14-4 to recommend that the drug, SER120, be approved for certain patients with nocturia, defined as waking to urinate two or more times a night. The FDA is not obliged to follow its advisory panel’s recommendations, but typically does so. SER120 is a low-dose nasal version of desmopressin, a drug used to treat a variety of conditions, including diabetes insipidus, a rare disorder that causes an imbalance of water in the body. Allergan is seeking approval to market the drug for frequent nightly urination in general. The panel recommended the FDA approve it for a narrower population of patients whose nocturia is specifically caused by an increase in total urine volume, a condition known as nocturnal polyuria. The panel made its recommendation based on a subset of patients in the clinical trial who seemed to fit the narrower criteria though the company’s clinical trial was not specifically designed to test that population. Some panelists described the drug’s efficacy as modest, and only at the higher dose studied, 1.5 micrograms. They also expressed concern physicians may prescribe it indiscriminately, increasing the risk of side effects, especially in the elderly.

798,AGN,Allergan CEO takes blame for big miss on quarterly earnings,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc’s chief executive officer on Wednesday took the blame for disappointing quarterly earnings as the drugmaker underestimated sales declines for its older medicines, forcing it to cut its 2016 profit forecast. Allergan (AGN.N) shares fell 4 percent in late-morning trading amid slight gains for the drug sector.  CEO Brent Saunders, who has snapped up a number of smaller drugmakers since Allergan’s planned $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) collapsed in April, said the company overlooked sales trends for some of its older products, including Asacol for ulcerative colitis and Alzheimer’s dementia treatment Namenda. “The miss wasn’t in our promoted products,” Saunders said, but instead “in some products we don’t pay much attention to. It’s not an excuse; hopefully it won’t happen again ... I accept full accountability for the situation.”   But the company was able to cheer investors, saying it expanded its share buyback program by $5 billion to $15 billion and initiated a first-ever quarterly dividend of 70 cents per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2017. In May, Allergan said it would buy back up to $10 billion in stock, and on Wednesday said it had repurchased $5 billion in shares ahead of schedule.  The Dublin-based company earned $3.32 per share, excluding special items, in the third quarter, widely missing the average analyst estimate of $3.56, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    The profit miss was driven by weaker-than-expected sales, slightly lower gross margins and higher expenses, Evercore ISI’s Umer Raffat wrote in a note.    Net revenue rose 4.4 percent to $3.62 billion but was less than the average analyst estimate of $3.68 billion.    The company was created when Dublin-based Actavis, under Saunders’ leadership, bought the Botox maker in March 2015, snatching it from hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO), and taking the Allergan name. Saunders has been one of the industry’s most active dealmakers. Allergan has sold its Actavis generics business for $40.5 billion and its Anda drug distribution business for $500 million to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N).    The net loss from continuing operations, net of tax, narrowed to $380.1 million, or $1.15 per share, from $875 million, or $2.40, a year earlier.       The company cut its adjusted full-year net revenue forecast for continuing operations to $14.45 billion-$14.65 billion from $14.65 billion-$14.90 billion.  Allergan also reduced its full-year adjusted profit to a range of $13.30-$13.50 per share from a previous range of $13.75- $14.20. Shares dropped $8.26, or 4 percent, to $200.43.

809,AGN,Some hedge funds bet big on health insurers before Trump vote,"NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Healthcare stocks, including insurers, are primed for a shot in the arm from a Trump presidency and some hedge fund managers stand to reap the gains after making new bets in the sector in the third quarter. Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, who recently told clients  that idiosyncratic opportunities have buoyed Third Point’s portfolio this year, invested in insurer Humana Inc  during the third quarter, according to a new filing.

810,AGN,REUTERS SUMMIT-Omega's Einhorn sees Trump's policies boosting stocks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are poised to climb more in 2017 as the policies of Republican President-elect Donald Trump are likely to boost earnings, Steven Einhorn, vice chairman of Hedge fund Omega Advisors, said on Monday.  “The outlook for the equity market for next year should be as good or a bit better than this year,” Einhorn said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York.  He cited Trump’s positions on repatriation of earnings and lower taxes as brightening his market view.  “I would reiterate and repeat a total return of 6 percent to 8 percent growth” including dividend yields of 2 percent, Einhorn said. The biggest danger to his outlook, he said, is that gains would be even stronger. “The odds favor exceeding it rather than missing it.” Einhorn said many of Trump’s plans, including cutting the corporate tax rate and allowing companies to bring earnings home more easily, would help them deliver higher profits in the years ahead, keeping stocks on their bull market path. While the effective tax rate may not fall to Trump’s proposed 15 percent from 27 percent today, it may come in around 20 percent, Einhorn said. The cash that companies bring back to the United States could help fuel more stock buybacks, which also would boost the market. Einhorn made a similarly optimistic call one year ago when he also expected the market to gain between 6 percent and 8 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index has risen 5.7 percent since January, even after a sharp drop early in the year, when fears of slower growth in the United States and in China weighed on sentiment.  Omega Advisors, a hedge fund founded in 1990, oversees roughly $4 billion in assets and has long been considered one of the industry’s best stock pickers. This year it has gained roughly 4 percent.  Even though Einhorn expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates beginning in December, he said the benefits of Trump’s expected policies were likely to outweigh any effects that a tighter monetary policy might have on companies. “There have been molehills that the markets made into mountains,” he said, adding that the factors that typically herald the end of a bull market are still nowhere in sight. Healthcare companies especially stand to benefit from new policies, Einhorn said, noting that many of those stocks have suffered from fears that Democrat Hillary Clinton could win the White House and impose stricter regulations. Einhorn said many healthcare stocks now have attractive valuations and “significant repatriation potential.” Omega made bigger bets on pharmaceutical company Shire Plc in the third quarter, raising its investment by nearly 75 percent, a regulatory filing shows. The filing also said Omega trimmed its holdings of Allergan Plc (AGN.N) by 19 percent. With a positive outlook for the stock market, Einhorn said many active money managers could now better show their mettle. He said he expected some reversal in the tide of money that has been flowing into passively managed funds that largely mirror their indexes’ moves.

813,AGN,Teva trims 2016 outlook on drug launch delays,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) on Tuesday lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing launch delays for some drugs that have been pushed back by a year or so. Israel-based Teva reported stronger than expected third-quarter profit as sales were boosted by its $40.5 billion purchase of Allergan’s (AGN.N) generic drug business in August. The world’s biggest generic drugmaker forecast earnings per share (EPS) excluding one time items of $5.10-$5.20 in 2016 and revenue of $21.6-$21.9 billion. In August, it had  estimated adjusted EPS of $5.20-$5.40 and revenue of $22-$22.5 billion. “What has brought numbers lower are revenues from new launches,” Siggi Olafsson, CEO of Teva’s global generic medicines, told an analysts’ conference call, noting the company had expected 3-4 more launches. “They will come later in 2017 or 2018, they are not lost at all. This moves the growth curve.” Teva (TEVA.N) shares were down 5 percent at $39 in early trade in New York. Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman said the company had spent a significant amount in the past year to acquire assets. “Now it is time for Teva to step away for the foreseeable future from executing material ... deals and focus all of its energy on organic growth and extracting all of the deal-related synergies,” Vigodman said. He said the company was re-evaluating priorities in 2017. “If there are projects that won’t generate value I will terminate those projects,” he said. Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said: “We like this as we think companies benefit from pausing for a period after major deals to help consolidate the businesses.” Maris rates Teva “outperform”. Teva earned $1.31 per share, excluding one-time items, in the third quarter, down from $1.35 a year earlier due to share offerings in December to finance the Allergan deal and shares issued to Allergan in August. Adjusted net income rose to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion.     Revenue rose 15 percent to $5.6 billion, primarily due to the inclusion of $887 million from Allergan. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, revenue increased 19 percent.   Teva was forecast to earn $1.28 excluding one-off items on revenue of $5.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler attributed the revenue miss to its speciality drugs business, which had revenue of $2.05 billion versus $2.06 billion forecast by analysts.     Global sales of its best-selling multiple sclerosis drugCopaxone slipped 2 percent to $1.1 billion. The drug is now facing competition after Sandoz, part of Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG NOVM.VX, and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA.O) last year launched a once daily 20 mg version called Glatopa. Teva said it would disclose its 2017 operating plan and forecast with fourth-quarter results in February. Teva also made a $520 million provision to settle previously disclosed investigations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The provision relates to conduct in Russia, Mexico and the Ukraine during 2007-2013.

LifeCell makes regenerative tissue products that are commonly used in breast reconstruction procedures and complex hernia surgeries to provide soft tissue support. The products will support Allergan’s portfolio of medical aesthetics, breast implants and tissue expanders, the company said. Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders has described the company’s acquisition strategy as being one of “stepping stones.” Allergan’s deal to sell itself last year to Pfizer Inc for $160 billion was dropped due to a change in tax law. Allergan, best known for its Botox product, said Lifecell’s 2016 sales are expected to be $450 million and grow at a mid-single digit rate. It expects the deal to close in the first half of 2017. Dublin-based Allergan, which was created through the combination of Actavis and Allergan, earlier this year sold its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, freeing up cash for deals. Allergan has agreed to 12 deals this year, including the $1.7 billion acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics Inc, maker of an experimental treatment for fatty liver disease, and $639 million acquiring Vitae, maker of an experimental drug to treat psoriasis. Allergan shares fell 1.2 percent to $190.17. ",12202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-acelity-divestiture-allergan/allergan-to-buy-acelitys-tissue-unit-lifecell-for-2-9-billion-idUSKBN1491TT
826,AGN,Allergan expects mid-single digit 2017 revenue growth,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N), taking a more “realistic” approach to its forecast, said on Thursday it expects mid-single digit net revenue percentage growth this year, helped by key products and new launches. Chief Executive Brent Saunders said that Allergan was now moving away from “aspirational goals”. Allergan, which has snapped up a number of smaller drugmakers since its planned $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) collapsed in April, reported disappointing quarterly earnings in November and cut its 2016 forecast. “This is an important step in setting appropriate expectations,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said. Mizuho Securities USA analyst Irina Koffler also noted that Allergan’s guidance serves as a realistic baseline that should prevent last year’s unexpected disappointments. The company, which promised it would limit its price increases to 10 percent in September as part of a “social contract”, is not planning to have another round of hikes in June, Saunders said at the Goldman Sachs healthcare conference on Thursday. Drug pricing has become a lightning rod for criticism with several drugmakers coming under federal investigation for price gouging. Saunders said he did not expect his peers to subscribe to this policy, but was encouraged by what he had seen so far. “It seems the industry is taking pricing seriously.” The company, best known for Botox, sold its Actavis generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) for $40.5 billion in August, freeing up cash for deals. Allergan has agreed to 12 deals in 2016, including the $1.7 billion acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics Inc, maker of an experimental treatment for fatty liver disease, and $639 million acquiring Vitae Pharmaceuticals Inc, maker of an experimental drug to treat psoriasis. Dublin-based Allergan, which will report its fourth-quarter results in February, also said it expects to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings growth in 2017. “We are not surprised by these conservative expectations as the company is still managing the declines of some of its established products while its newer launches ramp,” Mizuho’s Koffler wrote in a note. Analysts on average expected 2017 adjusted earnings of $16.04 per share and revenue of $15.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Allergan’s 2016 adjusted net revenue from continuing operations is expected to be $14.45 billion-$14.65 billion and adjusted profit $13.30-$13.50 per share. The company’s shares were marginally up at $217.06. The shares had fallen 36 percent last year.

832,AGN,UPDATE 1-Allergan to pay $15 mln over failing to disclose merger talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A unit of Botox maker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) will pay a $15 million penalty and admit to wrongdoing, after U.S. regulators on Tuesday accused the unit of failing to disclose 2014 merger talks with Actavis, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said. In a statement on Tuesday, the SEC said that the disclosure failures occurred in the months after the company received a tender offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO) and co-bidder Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by Bill Ackman. Allergan resisted a seven month-long hostile pursuit by Ackman and Valeant, and in November 2014 announced it had accepted a $66 billion takeover bid from Actavis. According to the SEC, Allergan previously told investors that Valeant’s bid was inadequate and that it was not in merger talks.  In fact, the SEC said Allergan did have merger talks with an unnamed North Carolina company that it never disclosed. After those failed, the SEC said, Allergan did not provide timely disclosures about its talks with Actavis.

837,AGN,FTC reaches pay-for-delay settlement with Endo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Endo International Plc said on Monday it has reached a proposed settlement with U.S. antitrust regulators under which it will not pay rivals to delay the introduction of generic competitors to its medications. The Federal Trade Commission had alleged Endo paid Impax Laboratories Inc to delay the introduction of a generic version of its painkiller Opana ER. The agency also alleged Endo paid Watson Laboratories Inc to delay introduction of a generic version of its Lidoderm pain treatment. The proposed settlement must be ratified by a court. Endo said it is not required to make any monetary payment to the FTC and made no admission of liability. It said the settlement is “consistent with the company’s position that the Lidoderm and Opana ER settlements fully complied with the law both at the time they were executed and today.” Watson and Impax were also named in the FTC’s lawsuit, which alleges the companies illegally blocked access to low-cost alternatives to Endo’s products. The complaint against those companies remains outstanding. Watson, which was formerly owned by Allergan Plc, is now owned by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Teva and Allergan declined to comment. A spokesman for Impax was not immediately reachable. U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in a statement that they have introduced legislation, “Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act,” to crack down on such arrangements. The FTC’s actions “are an important step in ending pay-off agreements that allow drug manufacturers to rake in huge profits while keeping cheaper generic drugs off the market,” Klobuchar said. Grassley added that drug companies are still entering into agreements to stall drug competition, “leaving consumers to pay higher prices for prescription medications.” Branded drugs typically lose up to 90 percent of their market share once a generic comes onto the market. The FTC’s complaint states that in 2011, Endo generated more than $825 million, or 30 percent of its total revenue, from Lidoderm, a pain patch. To stave off a generic threat from Watson, Endo provided payments and incentives worth $250 million, according to the complaint. The FTC is seeking an order permanently barring the companies from engaging in similar behavior and “disgorgement of the defendants’ ill-gotten gains.” The FTC alleges Endo paid Impax more than $112 million to delay the introduction of Opana ER.

839,AGN,House lawmaker seeks more documents in FDA criminal office inquiry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. lawmaker accused the Food and Drug Administration on Friday of failing to hand over documents that would show whether its criminal office is fulfilling the critical mission of protecting public health. “The FDA’s long-overdue response leaves key questions unanswered about the performance and effectiveness of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations,” House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden told Reuters in a statement. An FDA spokeswoman did not have an immediate comment. Walden’s comments come about four months after the congressional panel launched an examination into the criminal office and how it was managing cases involving food, drugs and devices. The review came after Reuters reported that FDA agents were concerned that managers, including former OCI Director George Karavetsos, were forcing them to pursue often toothless cases involving mislabeled foreign-imported injectable drugs, at the expense of cases with more potential to protect the public health. The agents said they had become the “Botox Police” and were spending hours chasing down doctors who purchased authentic versions of Allergan’s popular anti-wrinkle drug that were labeled for use in other countries. Those concerns came at a time when the office was seeing more than half its opened cases ultimately get closed without action, Reuters found. Reuters also reported on how the FDA permitted Karavetsos to relocate back to Florida in mid-2016 and run the OCI from its Miami office, even after the FDA had already paid more than $25,000 to move him to Maryland in 2015. The FDA did not meet the committee’s October deadline to provide written answers to questions until Jan. 19. The next day, Karavetsos departed to work for DLA Piper where he will represent drug and device industry clients. In its letter reviewed by Reuters, the FDA listed its investigative priorities and said that traditional metrics used to gauge success, such as arrests and convictions, cannot capture the impact of its public health mission. It also provided annual data on arrests, convictions, and the number of opened cases. However, it omitted preliminary-stage investigative numbers from the total number of cases opened each year, which makes the conviction rate appear higher, according to a side-by-side comparison. Walden said the FDA did not provide a performance plan, among other things. He also complained of redactions on a separate record, which according to a committee aide contained salary and compensation information for Karavetsos.",1262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-fda/house-lawmaker-seeks-more-documents-in-fda-criminal-office-inquiry-idUSL1N1FG2GR

841,AGN,U.S. court ruling on MS drug is the latest blow for Teva,"(Reuters) - A bitter defeat in a U.S. patents case sent shares in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries plummeting on Tuesday, the latest in a series of setbacks that has investors calling for major changes at the world’s largest generic drugmaker. A U.S. District Court on Monday rejected four out of five of Israel-based Teva’s claims of patent infringement on its top-selling multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone, potentially opening the door for generic competition. Chief Executive Erez Vigodman promised an “immediate appeal” and to “vigorously protect” the drug against further challenges. The patents cover a 40-mg injection of Copaxone that patients administer three times a week. The rejection comes four months after U.S. patent officials invalidated three patents on Copaxone, in response to challenges by Mylan NV, which has been trying to market a generic version of the drug. Mylan welcomed the court ruling as a “positive step” and said it has already filed a drug application for its product. Momenta and Novartis unit Sandoz, which already sell a generic version of 20 mg Copaxone, are also working on a copycat for the 40 mg dosage.  “Today’s favorable ruling further bolsters our confidence in the potential for us to offer multiple sclerosis patients a more affordable generic version of Copaxone 40 mg following regulatory approval,” Momenta said after Monday’s ruling. Though Teva primarily produces generic drugs, it also makes branded drugs, led by Copaxone, which accounted for 19 percent of the company’s revenue in 2016. Teva’s shares were down 7.6 percent in Tel Aviv at a 12-month low of 121 shekels ($32), continuing a months-long slump that has unnerved investors, and a number of analysts cut their price targets further. U.S.-listed shares of Teva, which have lost 44 percent in the past year, wiping out over $20 billion from its market value, were down 6.4 percent to $32.30 in pre-market trade on Tuesday. A price fixing scandal and increasing public pressure to lower drug costs has taken a toll on the generics industry. Teva has been hit particularly hard due to a series of questionable and costly acquisitions, along with delayed drug launches, prompting big stakeholders in recent weeks to call for a shakeup in management — the head of its generics business and a board member have already stepped down — as well as more sweeping structural changes. “They depend on just a few drugs, not only Copaxone, but also on the generic side. They need to become more diversified,” said Joshua Schachter, senior portfolio manager at Pennsylvania-based Snow Capital, which as of Sept. 30, 2016 had a $44 million stake in Teva. Teva’s poor timing in its $40.5 billion purchase of Actavis, announced in July 2015 when generic stock prices were at a peak,  and a botched $2.3 billion acquisition of Mexican drugmaker Rimsa, which has resulted in lawsuits, were “self-inflicted” woes, Schachter said. Some investors have told Reuters they would like to see Teva spin off its specialty drug business. “They should split up the company into two separate companies: a generics company and a branded specialty company. That would allow for greater management focus and improved capital allocation,” said Andy Summers, a pharmaceutical specialist for Janus Capital Management, which as of Sept. 30 had a $215 million stake.  Schachter said the move makes sense, but Teva should first strengthen its specialty drug pipeline, which would require it to reduce debt. Israeli investment house Halman-Aldubi said it has been slowly increasing its stake in Teva in the past month on the belief that the bad news has been priced into the shares. “The most important thing that Teva has to do is to win back the market’s confidence. The market doesn’t buy the company’s forecast and that’s not healthy,” buyside analyst Tal Levi said. Earlier this month Teva provided a disappointing forecast for 2017, saying it expects earnings per share of $4.90-$5.30 on revenue of $23.8 billion-$24.5 billion. But the company also provided a “bear case” of two generic competitors in February that could cut revenues by $1 billion-$1.2 billion, and hurt adjusted profit by 65 cents-80 cents. It also agreed in December to pay more than $519 million to settle U.S. criminal and civil allegations that the company bribed overseas officials to gain business for its medications. Following Monday’s court ruling, analysts see generic competition for at least one dosage of Copaxone coming in the second quarter of 2017. “This could raise questions around the sustainability of its dividend ... and this will also now likely push back any potential M&A; or share buybacks,” said RBC analyst Randall Stanicky.

846,AGN,UPDATE 5-Teva CEO exits in ongoing crisis of confidence at drugmaker,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) was left without a permanent chief executive on Tuesday after Erez Vigodman stepped down, leaving new management to restore confidence in the world’s biggest generic drugmaker after a series of missteps. A string of costly acquisitions, along with delayed drug launches, have sent Teva shares plummeting and led to calls for management and structural changes, including a possible split into separate generic and branded medicine units.  Teva, Israel’s largest company, said late on Monday that Vigodman was departing immediately and would be replaced on an interim basis by Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg. Investors say Teva, which faces pricing pressure in its core generics business and recently lost patent protection on its key branded drug Copaxone for multiple sclerosis, must choose a new CEO with extensive pharmaceutical experience.  The new boss needs to set a clear strategy, said Eldad Tamir, head of investment house Tamir Fishman, whose funds have cut their holdings in Teva by 90 percent in the past two years. “Is it the biggest generics company or is there an understanding that generics is hitting a glass ceiling and it should do other stuff such as investing more in branded drugs?” he told Reuters.  Teva’s bad run continued on Tuesday, when the company said it was being investigated in Israel over the same issues that led to a $519 million U.S. bribery settlement in December over criminal and civil allegations that it bribed overseas officials to gain business. Compounding the challenge for Teva, U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to crack down on drug prices and a number of shareholders are pushing Teva to split into separate branded and generic companies. “A single management team of a global corporation really can’t focus on two businesses that are as diverse as these and do justice to both,” Benny Landa, an industrialist who in 2014 led an investor bid to shake up Teva’s board, said. Landa said Teva’s recent “fixation on mega-generic acquisitions” had “mortgaged its ability to make substantial investments in speciality drugs.” Teva shares fell around 2 percent in Tel Aviv on Tuesday following Vigodman’s departure, which comes after the head of Teva’s generics business, Siggi Olafsson, left. At 1435 GMT, its New York-listed stock (TEVA.N) was down 2.9 percent at $33.35.  Tal Levi, buyside analyst for Israeli investment house Halman-Aldubi, said Teva needed to better manage cashflow and deliver the hoped-for synergies from its acquisition last year of the Actavis generics business. Teva’s New York-listed shares, which hit $72 in July 2015, tumbled to around 10-year lows last week after a U.S. court found Copaxone patents to be invalid. The drug accounted for almost a fifth of Teva’s revenue last year. Investors and analysts have raised concerns Teva might have to cut its dividend if Copaxone faces short-term generic competition. Vigodman joined Teva in 2014 after success in rejuvenating an ailing Israeli agrochemicals firm, but he embarked on a costly buying spree that culminated in buying Actavis for $40.5 billion, a price many investors believe was too high. Teva now has debt of nearly $36 billion, similar to its market value, making it difficult to raise new equity, Tamir said. Meanwhile, a $2.3 billion deal for Mexican drugmaker Rimsa has led to both sides suing each other and last month Teva forecast 2017 revenue and profit below Wall Street’s estimates. Peterburg, who will work alongside Teva’s new chairman, former Celgene (CELG.O) CEO Sol Barer, said he would conduct a “thorough review” of Teva’s business while it searches for a permanent CEO.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said it was unclear whether asset sales could be on the agenda. “We find it interesting that Teva would pursue a review before naming a permanent CEO, which may be suggestive of further close involvement of the board and broader management team,” Stanicky said. Should Teva spin off its speciality drug business, it might please U.S. activist investors as it could give a short-term boost to the stock, said Levi, whose firm Halman-Aldubi has been slowly raising its Teva stake in the past month. “But Israeli institutions are long-term investors. I’m not sure making a short-term profit is a good idea for the Israeli market and Teva,” he said. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal, in a video to clients, called Peterburg “a good caretaker CEO, but clearly not a candidate to run the company long term”. Prior to rejoining Teva’s board of directors in 2012,  Peterburg led the company’s research and development efforts as head of global branded products, from 2010 until October 2011.

848,AGN,"Allergan says U.S. tax reform unlikely in 2017, sees strong year","(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N) Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on Wednesday he does not anticipate U.S. tax reforms this year and that an import tax could hurt the Dublin-based drugmaker.   President Donald Trump and the Republicans are pushing for a tax reform that will likely reduce tax rates and could include a border-adjustment measure that could satisfy Trump’s interest in promoting U.S. manufacturing by taxing imports while exempting export revenues from corporate taxation. “There’s no real plan yet for what tax reform will look like nor when it will appear,” Saunders said on call with analysts after the company reported a strong fourth quarter and forecast an upbeat 2017, helped by key products and new launches. House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that House Republicans are unlikely to begin tackling tax reform legislation until the summer, focusing first on revamping the healthcare system.

849,AGN,"UPDATE 3-Allergan says U.S. tax reform unlikely in 2017, sees strong year","(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N) Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on Wednesday he does not anticipate U.S. tax reforms this year and that an import tax could hurt the Dublin-based drugmaker.   President Donald Trump and the Republicans are pushing for a tax reform that will likely reduce tax rates and could include a border-adjustment measure that could satisfy Trump’s interest in promoting U.S. manufacturing by taxing imports while exempting export revenues from corporate taxation. “There’s no real plan yet for what tax reform will look like nor when it will appear,” Saunders said on call with analysts after the company reported a strong fourth quarter and forecast an upbeat 2017, helped by key products and new launches. House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that House Republicans are unlikely to begin tackling tax reform legislation until the summer, focusing first on revamping the healthcare system.        But even if tax reforms are implemented, they will not adversely impact Allergan’s dealmaking, executives said, adding that a tax overhaul could actually benefit the company’s large U.S. business.

855,AGN,Allergan adds ice and a slice to M&A; cocktail,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Allergan has added ice and a slice to its M&A; cocktail. The drug company is paying just under $2.5 billion for Zeltiq Aesthetics and its diet-avoiding, fat-freezing tech. It sounds a wackier play than the dozen deals Allergan struck last year. But vain customers pay cold cash for the treatment, making it less speculative than other acquisitions, like gene therapy. Allergan’s deal machine received a $40 billion injection, before tax, from the well-timed sale of the company’s generic drugs unit to Teva Pharmaceutical last year. Boss Brent Saunders used the pick-me-up to shrink debt and repurchase shares. He’s also trying to refill the pipeline by ramping up R&D; spending while spending heavily on acquisitions. The company’s biggest drug, Botox, will soon face increased competition, while its second-biggest drug may be about to lose patent protection. That may help explain Allergan’s deal hunger. In addition to aesthetic drugs, it has since the start of 2016 bought or licensed gastrointestinal drugs, gene therapy for eye disease, and long-shot treatments for Alzheimer’s and other neurological disease. Zeltiq may be a safer bet, despite its odd beginning. It was founded after doctors noticed that kids who ate popsicles tended not to have chubby cheeks. Zeltiq applies this idea to other areas of the body. The treatment fits well with Allergan’s other cosmetic surgery assets, such as Botox and chin-fat reducing Kybella. Moreover, customers pay, rather than insurers and governments which demand big discounts for more essential drugs. Allergan is not getting the fat-freeze technique on the cheap. It’s paying well over 100 times estimated earnings and six times estimated 2017 revenue. Zeltiq’s growth should be some 20 percent this year, about half of 2016’s performance. A further slowdown, perhaps because customers question whether the service is worth the price, would mean a poor return on the purchase. Allergan has now churned through a substantial chunk of its Teva windfall. It had about $13 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the year. That’s still enough for several more deals, especially as its business should throw off $6.5 billion of free cash flow this year. The frenetic pace of the company’s M&A;, and the scattershot targets, raise the risk that the company is misspending its windfall.",2132017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-zeltiq-m-a-breakingviews/allergan-adds-ice-and-a-slice-to-ma-cocktail-idUSKBN15S260
856,AGN,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Allergan to buy Zeltiq Aesthetics for about $2.48 bln,"(Corrects bullet and paragraph 8 to clarify deal is expected to close second half, not second quarter, of 2017) * Deal expected to close in second half of 2017 * Offering at 14.4 pct premium * Zeltiq shares jump 12.6 pct premarket Feb 13 (Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Plc said it would buy body-contouring product maker Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc  for about $2.48 billion, adding muscle to its line-up of products used to fight fat and smoothen wrinkles. Zeltiq’s CoolSculpting System is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and utilizes a cooling mechanism to reduce the appearance of stubborn fat - which may not respond to diet or exercise - without disturbing surrounding tissue. The Botox maker agreed to pay $56.50 per Zeltiq share, or a premium of 14.4 percent to the company’s Friday close. Zeltiq’s shares jumped 12.6 percent to $55.65 in premarket trading on Monday. Dublin-based Allergan, led by its acquisitive Chief Executive Brent Saunders, has orchestrated a flurry of deals since its $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc collapsed in April. Earlier this month, Saunders painted lofty expectations for its injection Kybella - used to diminish fat under the chin, leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected - for 2017, and expressed an interest in continued deal making. In the three months ended Dec. 31, total medical aesthetic product sales accounted for 28 percent of Allergan’s net revenue. Allergan, which estimates that body contouring is a $4 billion market, said the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017. Moelis & Co is Allergan’s financial adviser, while Debevoise & Plimpton LLP serve as legal counsel. Guggenheim Securities is Zeltiq’s financial adviser, while Cooley LLP will provide legal advice.

884,AGN,UPDATE 1-India watchdog orders antitrust probe into Roche cancer drug,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s antitrust regulator has ordered a probe into Swiss drugmaker Roche for allegedly using anti-competitive practices to restrict cheaper copies of a blockbuster cancer drug from reaching patients. Trastuzumab has been a mainstay of Roche’s profit for years and brought in global sales of about $6.7 billion in 2016, but it has been challenged in the last three years by biosimilars which are sold at about a 25 percent discount to the original. India’s Biocon and U.S. firm Mylan, which together sell biosimilars of the drug in over a dozen countries including India, filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year alleging Roche misled doctors and regulators to thwart competition to trastuzumab. “Roche adheres to all applicable laws and regulations in countries where it operates,” Roche spokeswoman Shilpika Das said in a statement. “We are fully committed to cooperating with the authorities in India.”  India, with among the highest number of cancer patients in the world, is a big market for trastuzumab, which is indicated to treat certain forms of breast and gastric cancer and which Roche sells under the brand name Herceptin. Globally, the market for trastuzumab is getting increasingly crowded, with analysts saying late on Wednesday that U.S. biotech firm Amgen and partner Allergan are seeking approval for their form of trastuzumab later this year. Roche first launched the drug in India in 2002 and sells it for about 75,000 rupees ($1,170) for a 440 mg vial. In an interim order released on Tuesday, the CCI said it found merit in Biocon and Mylan’s arguments, and ordered its director general to conduct a “detailed investigation” and submit a report within 60 days. Although the order is not final, the investigation could result in penalties, said a lawyer at the Delhi High Court, who declined to be named. Biocon said in a statement that it welcomed the CCI’s order.  Roche, which has been engaged in a legal tussle with Biocon and Mylan since 2014, has the option of filing a petition to contest the order, the lawyer added. In their complaint, Biocon and Mylan allege Roche wrote to doctors, hospitals, and state and federal regulators, misleading them about the safety of efficacy of the biosimilar versions. “When seen collectively in the background of surrounding facts and circumstances, they only appear to be a part of the bigger plan/strategy of Roche Group to eliminate competition posed by biosimilars to Roche’s products in the relevant market,” the CCI said in its order.

887,AGN,Allergan posts loss as it writes down Teva holdings,"(Reuters) - Botox-maker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) posted a first-quarter loss on Tuesday as it took a nearly $2 billion write-down on the value of its stake in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA), which has lost more than 40 percent of its value since last year. Allergan sold its generics business Actavis to Teva in August 2016 for $33 billion in cash and 100 million shares of the Israeli generic drugmaker, worth around $5.3 billion at the time. Under the terms of the deal, Allergan agreed to hold on to the shares for at least one year. Teva has struggled since then, and the company’s chief executive stepped down in February after sharp criticism for a string of costly acquisitions and delayed drug launches. Allergan said its net loss was $2.63 billion, or $7.86 per share, compared with a profit of $186.1 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Most of the loss was from the write-down of the Teva stake, as well as research and development related costs. Allergan said it concluded that Teva’s decline was not temporary and took the impairment. Allergan Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders told an Israeli newspaper earlier this year that the company plans to sell the stake in cooperation with Teva after the lockup period ends. Excluding the write-down and other costs, Allergan’s earnings exceeded analyst expectations. It earned $3.35 per share in the quarter, beating the average analyst estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Higher demand for its facial aesthetics, eye care and newer products, more than offset declining sales of older drugs. The company is armed with its top-selling Botox drug, known for smoothing wrinkles, but it also had a busy deal-making 2016, announcing at least a dozen deals. This past February, Allergan agreed to buy Zeltiq to gain access to a device which uses cooling to kill fat cells, adding to its line-up of aesthetic products that are not dependent on reimbursement for sales. The company raised its forecast for 2017 slightly to reflect the Zeltiq deal. Shares of the Dublin-based company, which also posted first-quarter revenue that edged past estimates, fell $1.51, or 0.6 percent, to $240.48 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday afternoon.

Billionaire investor Carl Icahn sold out of the pharmaceutical giant entirely, while Farallon Capital Management LLC, David Tepper’s Appaloosa LP and Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group LLC were among those trimming their stakes by as much as 32 percent, according to regulatory filings. Paulson & Co Inc and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors Inc also pulled back on the stock during the quarter, their filings showed. The Botox-maker recorded a strong rally in early February after seeing strong sales, but it posted a first-quarter loss last week as it took a nearly $2 billion write-down on the value of its stake in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). William Blair & Co LLC analysts Tim Lugo and Raju Prasad said in a note last week that the company’s eye care business also faced some potential challenges this year. President Donald Trump and his Republican party are pushing for a tax reform that could include a border-adjustment measure to satisfy Trump’s interest in promoting U.S. manufacturing by taxing imports and exempting export revenues from taxation. Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders has said he does not anticipate U.S. tax reforms this year but that an import tax could hurt the Dublin-based drugmaker. Omega and Paulson offered no comment, while the other four investors did not respond to inquiries from Reuters. Allergan declined to comment. Shares in Allergan were up 13.77 percent in the first quarter.  The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in what are known as 13F filings, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril in part because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what stocks fund managers saw as opportunities for profit.

908,AGN,UPDATE 1-Mylan defends chairman to ISS ahead of June 22 investor vote,"(Reuters) - Mylan NV (MYL.O) defended Chairman Robert Coury’s role to ISS this week as the influential proxy firm prepares to advise shareholders on how they should vote on the re-election of Coury and other directors, according to a letter the drugmaker released on Wednesday. New York City and State pension funds and the California Teachers’ Retirement System are urging shareholders to vote on June 22 against Coury and five other directors. The funds cite the board’s poor oversight of Coury’s high pay package, investigations into how much it charged the government and consumers for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment business and a takeover offer.  The investors, who hold 4.3 million shares, said Mylan walked away from a deal with rival Teva International Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N) in 2015, causing shares to lose value. ISS is preparing to issue a report on the vote, and Mylan’s letter was aimed in part at convincing the firm that it should let it see a copy before publication.  ISS spokesman Subodh Mishra said the advisory firm would not do so, which it said is typical in controversial situations.  “We believe that the pending “vote no” campaign led by certain Mylan shareholders creates a contentious/controversial situation and so ISS is not providing MYLAN with a pre-publication review,” Mishra said.  Mylan met with ISS on Monday and discussed the role of Coury in growing the company, according to the letter, and defended his compensation, which was more than $97 million in 2016.     Mylan also defended its dealings with Teva, saying it “never” received an offer from the Israeli drugmaker.  Teva said in an open letter in April 2015 it would pay $82 per share in cash and stock, and Coury responded in a letter to Teva that the offer was too low and that the starting point for discussions was $100 per share. Teva walked away in July 2015 after reaching a $40 billion deal for Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) generic unit. Mylan shares rose 0.5 percent to $38.74 on Wednesday. Mylan has been the subject of federal and state investigations and agreed last fall to pay $465 million to settle U.S. Justice Department allegations it overcharged the government for EpiPens, although the agreement has not been finalized. Last week, a government agency put out a report saying that Mylan may have overcharged the government by $1.27 billion.

Israel’s Teva needs extra financial firepower to develop new drugs and has few options left other than striking alliances with big pharma players, sources familiar with the company said. “Teva will avoid injecting any extra funding in new drugs,” one of the sources said. “They will partner with other big pharmas and share the proceeds.” Earlier this month the world’s largest generics drugmaker, which is facing price erosion in the United States, reported a steeper than expected drop in second-quarter earnings, slashed its dividend by 75 percent and cut its 2017 forecast. Teva is saddled with debts amounting to some $35 billion, mostly from financing its $40.5 billion purchase of Actavis — Allergan’s (AGN.N) generics business — last year. A loss of confidence in the company’s management have led to a nearly 50 percent drop in Teva’s shares since Aug. 3, while losses are about 75 percent since the start of 2016. Investors say Teva paid too much for Actavis, prompting Chief Executive Erz Vigodman’s resignation in February and his temporary replacement by Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg, while Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of June, again with only an interim stand-in. “People have lost faith in Teva not for what happened, but we don’t see where its going,” Eldad Tamir, head of the Tamir Fishman Investment House, said. In addition to seeking partners, Teva is responding by speeding up plans to divest non-core assets, the sources said, with long-term decisions including a possible break-up into two companies, generics and specialty drugs, only likely to be discussed after it fills its leadership vacuum. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have been asked to find buyers for Teva’s women’s health business and European oncology and pain unit, respectively.  Industry players including U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL.O), German healthcare group Fresenius (FMEG.DE) and Indian drug firm Intas Pharmaceuticals INTA.NS are all carrying out due diligence on the assets, which could be worth about $2 billion combined, the sources said. A source familiar with the divestments said that India’s Intas, which last year bought the generics business of Actavis in the UK and Ireland from Teva, is now bidding for specific assets within the women’s health unit, adding Teva is open to a break-up to speed up the sale. This means the business could be sold in two or three chunks with its U.S. and international operations being chopped and some products like contraceptive drugs Plan B and Paragard being carved out and sold separately, the sources said. The oncology business could also be broken up as industry players are mainly interested in pure cancer drugs while pain treatment medicine, which is being offered as part of the same deal, is seen as less attractive, the sources said. The prospect of a piecemeal deal has drawn interest from private equity funds including Advent and TPG, the sources said. Fresenius, Mylan and Advent declined to comment while Intas Advent and TPG were not immediately available for comment. Teva is also considering options for its respiratory treatments business as part of a review of its entire portfolio, the sources said. It recently decided to part ways with Iceland-based Medis, a supplier of development work to third-party drugmakers, which one source said could fetch about $500 million. Some banks have suggested a possible sale of PGT Healthcare, a consumer care products joint venture with Procter & Gamble (PG.N), but Teva’s spokeswoman Bradley said this remains core. Some shareholders have called on Teva to either split into two or sell off its generics business completely. Pressure is mounting on the U.S. generic drug industry because pharmacy groups, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O), are wielding more leverage when buying such drugs. “Teva should get out of generics. It means splitting the company of course, selling the generics in pieces and focusing on specialty drugs,” Benny Landa, an entrepreneur who in 2014 led an investor bid to shake up Teva’s board, said. Teva should become more like research-focused Novartis NOVM.S and its generics unit Sandoz, which are run as two separate firms, he added. But such changes could be slowed by Teva’s articles of association. These were designed to prevent a hostile takeover and include provisions that limit the number of board members to be replaced per year to a third of all seats. Teva’s problems also stem in large part from its specialty business. Its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone had contributed much of Teva’s revenue and profit, but its patent has run out and now is facing generic competition. Teva had no other drugs to take its place, although it has a pipeline of 21 specialty medicines for migraine, Huntington’s Disease, pain, respiratory and neurology in various stages of development, from early stage clinical trials to drugs already registered and awaiting regulatory approval.

939,AGN,Allergan pays Mohawk Tribe to protect patents from challenges,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc will transfer to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe the rights to its blockbuster Restasis dry-eye treatment, the drugmaker said on Friday, in an unusual deal to protect it from patent challenges. The tribe, which has sovereign immunity from such challenges, will receive a one-time payment of $13.75 million and annual royalties of around $15 million under the arrangement proposed by the Saint Regis, Allergan said in a statement. Sales of Restasis, which totaled over $1.5 billion last year, account for about 15 percent of Allergan’s profits, according to AllianceBernstein. “If this maneuver is successful, we will probably see multiple branded (drug) companies housing their patents with Indian tribes,” AllianceBernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a video statement. “It could be the next big Indian tribe industry after gaming.” Other analysts and legal experts said they expect legal challenges to the tactic, including possible action by lawmakers at the state and federal levels. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which originated in the northeastern region of what is now New York State, operates casinos in upstate New York. Allergan said it entered into the deal after reviewing recent case law showing it was harder to challenge patents held by certain entities.  These include a February ruling by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s trial and appeal board that patents owned by the University of Florida could not be challenged by Medtronic Plc’s Covidien unit because the university enjoyed sovereign immunity. A different panel of patent and trial appeal board judges reached a similar conclusion in May in a dispute over patents owned by the University of Maryland. Those rulings will be appealed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Allergan said the patent agreement had no impact on litigation involving applications for generic versions of Restasis which recently went to trial in Federal District Court in Marshall, Texas.  A decision in that case, brought by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd and other generic drugmakers, is expected in a few months. “Today’s news from Allergan is a new and unusual way for a company to try to delay access to high-quality and affordable generic alternatives,” Teva said in an emailed statement.  The generic drugmaker said it will continue to pursue its application with the Food and Drug Administration for a generic version of Restasis “and also will be interested to see what comments are made about this tactic by regulatory agencies.” According to Allergan, the six transferred patents are due to expire in August 2024.

945,AGN,Tech entity has tribal patent deal similar to Allergan's,"(Reuters) - The Native American tribe that agreed to hold patents for the drug company Allergan Plc in an attempt to shield them from U.S. administrative review is also doing so for a technology firm. According to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records, SRC Labs LLC on Aug. 2 transferred around 40 patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe.  Allergan announced on Friday it had reached a deal to transfer several patents relating to the dry-eye medication Restasis to the tribe in exchange for ongoing payments. The drug company claims the tribe’s status as a sovereign nation means the Restasis patents will be immune to review by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Generic companies often challenge brand-name drug patents before the board. SRC’s similar agreement suggests the tactic of shielding patents by transferring them to a sovereign tribe will extend beyond the pharmaceutical sector. The deals announced so far “are just the tip of the iceberg,” said David Pridham, chief executive of Dominion Harbor Group, a Dallas-based firm that advises patent owners on monetization efforts.  “There are dozens and dozens of tribes talking to law firms about this structure,” he said. Headed by Dallas lawyer, entrepreneur and investment manager Brandon Freeman, SRC Labs holds patents previously awarded to SRC Computers, a company founded by supercomputer pioneer Seymour Cray just before his 1996 death. Freeman declined to comment.  Similar patent-holding entities often engage in aggressive litigation against larger corporations seeking licensing fees or damages for infringement. The defendants frequently respond by initiating PTAB proceedings to invalidate the patents at issue. In a document posted on its website, the tribe did not name SRC but said it had a deal with an unnamed tech company along with Allergan. According to the tribe, Dallas law firm Shore Chan DePumpo was planning to enforce the tech company’s patents in court. “Right now a federal court case is being prepared for filing,” the tribe said, adding that it “expects that it will earn a significant amount of money through the Shore firm’s enforcement of the patents in federal court.” Shore Chan DePumpo was the architect of Allergan’s deal with the tribe and is advising the tribe on its efforts to cut similar deals.

949,AGN,REFILE-Challenge of Allergan tribal patent deal in uncharted legal territory,"(Reuters) - As generic drug manufacturers are gearing up to argue that a deal Allergan Plc made with a Native American tribe to shield patents from administrative review is a sham, some experts say the generic companies are in uncharted legal territory. Last week, Allergan announced it would transfer the patent rights to its Restasis dry-eye treatment to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which will license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments. Allergan says the tribe’s sovereign immunity puts the patents beyond the authority of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court created in 2012 that can cancel patents. But Richard Torczon, a lawyer for generic drug company Mylan NV, said the tribe is abusing the defense of sovereign immunity, which he said is intended to shield tribes that get dragged into court without their consent.  “The tribe here has not been dragged into this proceeding against its will,” Torczon said during a hearing on Monday before three judges from the patent board. “It has deliberately by its own admission targeted these proceedings for exactly this kind of revenue-generating opportunity,” he said, according to a transcript. Torczon also compared the deal to cases in which payday lenders have partnered with tribes to get around state laws barring high interest rates. Michael Shore, a lawyer for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, dismissed Torczon’s statements in an interview on Wednesday and said the deal would hold up. “Literally nothing the guy said is legally accurate,” Shore said of Torczon.  Gregory Ablavsky, a professor of early American legal history, said there is no direct precedent on which either side can rely because of the unique nature of the deal. However, he  said a bankruptcy case involving tribal immunity could support Mylan’s waiver argument.  Monday’s hearing, which dealt mostly with scheduling issues, offered a preview of arguments Mylan and two other generic drug companies, Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc and Akorn Pharmaceuticals, will make against Allergan’s deal. There is much at stake for generic manufacturers, which frequently ask the patent board to invalidate patents on brand-name drugs so they can bring generic versions to market. If Allergan’s groundbreaking deal is upheld and other pharmaceutical companies follow suit, generic drug companies will lose access to an attractive forum for challenging patents. Allergan has said generic rivals can still bring patent challenges in federal court, which the company described as a time-tested and fair process.  In addition to arguing that the tribe has waived immunity, the generic manufacturers plan to rely on cases in which payday lenders have partnered with tribes to circumvent state laws barring high interest rates.  Some courts have ruled that such lenders were not entitled to sovereign immunity because they were not arms of the tribe. Michael Risch, a professor of patent law at Villanova University School of Law, said the payday lending disputes are legally distinct because in this case Allergan actually transferred its patents to the tribe. But Risch said the argument has rhetorical force because Allergan might balk at being compared to a payday lender. “I think this has a decent chance of holding up,” he said. “If it works, it is brilliant.” ",9142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/allergan-patents/refile-challenge-of-allergan-tribal-patent-deal-in-uncharted-legal-territory-idUSL2N1LU1ME

951,AGN,U.S. senator slams Allergan patent deal with Native-American tribe,"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown said on Friday a deal that drugmaker Allergan Plc made with a Native-American tribe to shield patents “rips off consumers” and cannot “become the new normal.” The Ohio Democrat said he will look at how Congress can “close loopholes that drug companies exploit to avoid competition.” Brown’s staff has requested a meeting with Allergan representatives to press them about the transaction. Allergan said it has reached out to Brown’s office “to provide the facts and context around this agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe.” Allergan said on Sept. 8 it will transfer patents relating to its dry-eye medicine Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which will exclusively license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments.  Allergan said the tribe’s sovereign status puts the patents beyond the authority of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court created in 2011 that can cancel patents.  Companies like Allergan that sell brand-name prescription drugs typically hold several patents that cover the technology behind their medicines. Rivals need to wait until the patents expire to launch lower-cost generic versions unless they win a court ruling that the patents should not have been granted in the first place. Generic drug companies frequently challenge patents through lawsuits at the patent board, a cheaper and faster alternative to litigation in federal court.  Legal experts said if Allergan’s strategy is widely copied, generic drug companies will lose access to an effective venue for these patent disputes and brand-name drug companies will have an easier time preserving their monopolies on various medicines. Allergan has said the maneuver is only intended to shield the company’s Restasis patents from review at the patent board and would not affect patent challenges filed in federal court. “We have clearly stated that this agreement with the Tribe has no impact on the pending patent litigations regarding the Restasis patent family which recently completed a five-day trial in Federal District Court in Marshall, Texas,” Allergan said in a statement.

952,AGN,U.S. senator slams Allergan patent deal with Native-American tribe,"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown said on Friday a deal that drugmaker Allergan Plc made with a Native-American tribe to shield patents “rips off consumers” and cannot “become the new normal.” The Ohio Democrat said he will look at how Congress can “close loopholes that drug companies exploit to avoid competition.” Brown’s staff has requested a meeting with Allergan representatives to press them about the transaction. Allergan said it has reached out to Brown’s office “to provide the facts and context around this agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe.” Allergan said on Sept. 8 it will transfer patents relating to its dry-eye medicine Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which will exclusively license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments.  Allergan said the tribe’s sovereign status puts the patents beyond the authority of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court created in 2011 that can cancel patents.  Companies like Allergan that sell brand-name prescription drugs typically hold several patents that cover the technology behind their medicines. Rivals need to wait until the patents expire to launch lower-cost generic versions unless they win a court ruling that the patents should not have been granted in the first place. Generic drug companies frequently challenge patents through lawsuits at the patent board, a cheaper and faster alternative to litigation in federal court.  Legal experts said if Allergan’s strategy is widely copied, generic drug companies will lose access to an effective venue for these patent disputes and brand-name drug companies will have an easier time preserving their monopolies on various medicines. Allergan has said the maneuver is only intended to shield the company’s Restasis patents from review at the patent board and would not affect patent challenges filed in federal court. “We have clearly stated that this agreement with the Tribe has no impact on the pending patent litigations regarding the Restasis patent family which recently completed a five-day trial in Federal District Court in Marshall, Texas,” Allergan said in a statement.

In a filing to the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe asked that Mylan’s case seeking to invalidate Allergan’s patents on dry-eye medicine Restasis be thrown out on the grounds that the board has no jurisdiction over the tribe. The move was expected after Allergan announced on Sept. 8 that it had transferred Restasis patents to the tribe in order to protect them from administrative challenges. Mylan in late 2016 asked the patent board to invalidate Allergan’s Restasis patents so it could launch its own generic version of the medicine, which generated $1.5 billion in revenue for Allergan last year. A lawyer for Mylan said at a Sept. 11 court hearing that the company would vigorously oppose Allergan’s efforts, calling the deal with the tribe a “sham transaction.” In its court filing on Friday, the tribe said it is sovereign government that cannot face litigation in an administrative court unless it expressly waives its immunity or the U.S. Congress abrogates immunity. “Neither of these exceptions apply here,” the tribe said. The tribe will receive a one-time payment of $13.75 million and annual royalties of around $15 million under the arrangement, Allergan said.

961,AGN,Allergan boosts shares with $2 billion buyback,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) on Monday authorized a $2 billion buyback of its common stock, sending its shares up after a week of disappointing news on its drug development pipeline. Allergan shares have fallen by around a fifth in value since late July but were up nearly 4 percent in morning trading on Monday. The company also said its Chief Financial Officer Tessa Hilado, 53, would retire. The planned stock buyback follows Allergan’s completion of a separate $15 billion repurchase, and after the company reported mixed trial data for its experimental treatment of NASH liver fibrosis. Allergan on Friday also received a “refusal to file” letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an expanded approval for its Vraylar drug to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia in adults. Allergan said it had begun to search for a new finance chief, but declined to provide further comment on Hilado’s departure. Analysts at Bernstein, based on discussions with Allergan’s investor relations team, said Hilado’s departure was her personal decision and should not be viewed as suggesting “issues this year or 2018.” Hilado did not have broad support among Allergan investors and her exit would not be a “particularly strong negative,” they added. Hilado joined Allergan in 2014 and will continue in her current role until a successor is named. Allergan, which said it was committed to boosting its dividend payout annually, also backed its 2017 financial guidance and its commitment to pay down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018. The drugmaker had $30.24 billion in current and long-term debt and capital leases as of June 30. “While the CFO’s departure may create greater uncertainty, we take the company’s reaffirmation of 2017 guidance and third quarter revenue projections as offsetting positives,” Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said.

Democrats Maggie Hassan, Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey and Richard Blumenthal in the letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday called Allergan’s deal “a blatantly anti-competitive attempt to shield its patents from review and keep drug prices high.” Allergan said on Sept. 8 that it was transferring patents on its dry eye medication Restasis to upstate New York’s Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which agreed to exclusively license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments. Allergan said in an emailed response to a Reuters request for comment that it met last week with the staffs of Senators Brown and Hassan to provide detailed briefings on the agreement. “We would welcome the opportunity to provide additional briefings for these Senators, as well as the opportunity to brief Senators Casey and Blumenthal, and answer any questions they may have,” Allergan said in the email.

On Friday, the tribe asserted this immunity in an ongoing administrative proceeding brought by generic drugmakers led by Mylan NV (MYL.O), which are seeking to invalidate Allergan’s patents to introduce cheaper versions of Restasis to the market.  Mylan has called Allergan’s deal with the tribe a “sham transaction” and said the tribe should not be allowed to invoke immunity to prevent administrative review.

968,AGN,Shire sues Allergan in U.S. over dry eye drug,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc was sued on Monday by Shire Plc for allegedly scheming to block doctors from prescribing its new treatment for dry eye disease. In a complaint filed with the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Shire accused Allergan of violating antitrust laws to preserve its roughly 90 percent share in Medicare prescription drug plans for its older and “clinically inferior” dry eye drug Restasis, and block prescriptions of Shire’s rival drug Xiidra. “Quite simply, Allergan has and will continue to use bundled discounts, exclusive dealing, coercion and interference to unlawfully ‘block’ Shire from competing with it, and to maintain its monopoly in the Part D market at all costs,” Shire said, referring to the Medicare drug plans. The lawsuit follows Allergan’s announcement on Sept. 8 that it transferred its Restasis patents to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in upstate New York, whose sovereign status could limit legal challenges. The Tribe subsequently agreed to license the patents to Allergan. Four U.S. senators last week called for a probe of whether the unusual move was anti-competitive and intended to keep prices high. Restasis is Allergan’s largest drug other than Botox, with sales of $1.49 billion in 2016 and $676.4 million in the first six months of 2017, regulatory filings show. Shire has said  Xiidra sales totaled $96 million from January to June. Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the lawsuit has no merit, and the company complies with Medicare procedures. “Competition in the chronic dry eye therapeutic market has driven pricing down for patients and payers in Medicare Part D and commercial plans,” he said in an email. “Restasis continues to provide significant value to Medicare beneficiaries, providers and the Part D program.” Dry eye occurs when the eye produces tears improperly or with the wrong consistency. Failing to treat it can lead to inflammation, scarring and even vision loss. The condition is often chronic, and affects nearly 16 million U.S. adults.  Allergan and Shire are headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, although Allergan has operations in Parsippany, New Jersey, and Shire in Lexington, Massachusetts. Shire won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in July 2016 for Xiidra, the first dry eye disease drug to win FDA approval since Restasis in 2002. The chemical name for Restasis is cyclosporine, and for Xiidra it is lifitegrast. The case is Shire US Inc v Allergan Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 17-07716.

In a complaint filed with the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Shire accused Allergan of violating antitrust laws to preserve its roughly 90 percent share in Medicare prescription drug plans for its older and “clinically inferior” dry eye drug Restasis, and block prescriptions of Shire’s rival drug Xiidra. “Quite simply, Allergan has and will continue to use bundled discounts, exclusive dealing, coercion and interference to unlawfully ‘block’ Shire from competing with it, and to maintain its monopoly in the Part D market at all costs,” Shire said, referring to the Medicare drug plans. The lawsuit follows Allergan’s announcement on Sept. 8 that it transferred its Restasis patents to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in upstate New York, whose sovereign status could limit legal challenges. The Tribe subsequently agreed to license the patents to Allergan. Four U.S. senators last week called for a probe of whether the unusual move was anti-competitive and intended to keep prices high. Restasis is Allergan’s largest drug other than Botox, with sales of $1.49 billion in 2016 and $676.4 million in the first six months of 2017, regulatory filings show. Shire has said  Xiidra sales totaled $96 million from January to June. Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the lawsuit has no merit, and the company complies with Medicare procedures. “Competition in the chronic dry eye therapeutic market has driven pricing down for patients and payers in Medicare Part D and commercial plans,” he said in an email. “Restasis continues to provide significant value to Medicare beneficiaries, providers and the Part D program.” Dry eye occurs when the eye produces tears improperly or with the wrong consistency. Failing to treat it can lead to inflammation, scarring and even vision loss. The condition is often chronic, and affects nearly 16 million U.S. adults.  Allergan and Shire are headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, although Allergan has operations in Parsippany, New Jersey, and Shire in Lexington, Massachusetts. Shire won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in July 2016 for Xiidra, the first dry eye disease drug to win FDA approval since Restasis in 2002. The chemical name for Restasis is cyclosporine, and for Xiidra it is lifitegrast. The case is Shire US Inc v Allergan Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 17-07716.

971,AGN,U.S. court strikes down Obama-era rule on tax inversions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal court in Texas on Friday ruled that the Obama administration acted unlawfully last year when its Treasury Department cracked down on U.S. companies that try to reduce their U.S. taxes by rebasing abroad, in a process known as inversion. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Texas Association of Business had filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court that said a regulation from the Treasury Department in April 2016 exceeded what the law allows the department to do.     They argued the Internal Revenue Service rule used was “arbitrary and capricious” because it was instated without notice and opportunity for comment in violation of standards required for rulemaking.      The U.S. District Court for Western Texas in Austin agreed, saying the IRS rule was a substantive or legislative regulation that required a notice and comment period before it was instated. The U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Texas Association of Business could not be immediately reached for comment.     The lawsuit was the first to challenge a rule on inversion. The deals are legal, but have drawn criticism from some politicians who say U.S. companies that do them are avoiding their tax obligations. A wave of inversions largely ended after Treasury moved against the deals.     The IRS rule had been aimed at transactions involving non-U.S. companies, such as Ireland-based drugmaker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) that have grown through a series of acquisitions.     It had helped scuttle what had been a planned $160 billion combination of Allergan and U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in what would have been the largest inversion ever.     Dozens of U.S. companies have done inversions since 1983, when the first such deal was completed. Treasury has periodically moved to curb the flow of deals because inversions erode the U.S. corporate income tax base.     Treasury unveiled a package of rules in 2016 meant to further discourage the deals, which typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller company in a foreign country with lower corporate taxes and then rebasing there, if only on paper.     Inverting U.S. companies usually leave their core U.S. operations at home, transferring only their legal tax domicile to the home country of the acquired company. Recent popular destinations for the deals are Ireland, Britain and Canada.",10022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-usa-tax/u-s-court-strikes-down-obama-era-rule-on-tax-inversions-idUSKCN1C71CP
972,AGN,U.S. House committee launches probe of Allergan patent deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee launched a probe into drugmaker Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) deal to transfer some of its patents to a Native American tribe to shield them from review. A bipartisan group of four representatives from the House Oversight and Government Committee, including Republican Chairman Trey Gowdy and top Democrat Elijah Cummings, sent a letter to the company on Tuesday saying the arrangement could “impair competition across the pharmaceutical industry.” Allergan said last month that it was transferring patents on its dry eye medication Restasis to New York’s Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which agreed to exclusively license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments.  The representatives asked Allergan to provide documents about its agreements with the tribe, financial details about the drug covered by the patents and documents on whether the drugmaker is considering similar arrangements for its other drugs. Allergan said it plans to cooperate with the committee’s requests. The company’s shares closed down $1.18, or 0.6 percent, at $209.80 on Tuesday. Allergan has argued that the legal maneuver is aimed at removing administrative patent challenges through inter partes review (IPR) by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and not challenges in federal court. The drugmaker said it believes that the patents should not be subject to the IPR process because of the tribe’s sovereign immunity.  The company still faces a challenge to the patents in federal court and has said that it does not plan to invoke the tribe’s immunity in federal court. Still, some legal experts say the maneuver could also be used to protect patents from challenges in federal court as well. Earlier on Tuesday, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders defended the transactions as a proper way to shield the patents from the “flawed and broken” IPR process. Saunders sent a letter to Republican Senator Charles Grassley and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  after four Democratic U.S. senators asked them to launch a committee investigation into the deal last week. Allergan competitor Mylan NV MYL.N, which is challenging the patents through the IPR process, has called Allergan’s deal with the tribe a “sham transaction” and said the tribe should not be allowed to invoke immunity.    The patent board has previously recognized the immunity of state entities such as public universities, and tribal immunity is considered by some to be an even stronger shield.

He argued, however, that the patents should not be subject to the “flawed and broken” IPR process, because of the tribe’s sovereign immunity.

McCaskill’s response follows a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives committee decision to investigate the deal earlier this week and previous calls by Democratic Senators for a probe. “Any thinking person would look at what this company did and say, ‘That should be illegal.’ Well, I agree,” McCaskill said in a statement. “Congress never imagined tribes would allow themselves to be used by pharmaceutical companies to avoid challenges to patents, and this bill will shut the practice down before others follow suit.” Allergan was not immediately available for comment.

980,AGN,UPDATE 4-Pfizer weighs $15 bln sale of consumer healthcare business,"(Reuters) - Pfizer said on Tuesday it was considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer healthcare business, shaking up the industry and potentially putting a headache pill to lip balm operation worth some $15 billion up for grabs. The move comes as Germany’s Merck KGaA is also looking to divest its non-prescription products, including brands such as Seven Seas vitamins, which could be worth around $4.5 billion. As aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the fragmented consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years. Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers. Pfizer’s consumer healthcare business, whose brands include painkiller Advil and lip balm Chapstick, had revenue of about $3.4 billion in 2016. Industry experts said it could fetch some four times sales, implying a potential value of just under $14 billion, although two healthcare sector bankers said Pfizer was aiming for at least $15 billion. People familiar with the matter said Swiss food giant Nestle could be among those interested, along with existing manufacturers of over-the-counter (OTC) treatments and private equity firms. Pfizer, whose shares were little changed on Tuesday, said it would decide on the future of its consumer unit during 2018. Reuters first reported last November that a divestment of the business was under consideration.  Established consumer health companies that may be interested in the Pfizer assets include Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble, GlaxoSmithKline,  Johnson & Johnson and Abbott. They could be joined by Nestle, which is exploring the boundaries between food and healthcare. Nestle’s new CEO Mark Schneider told investors last month it would keep identifying new opportunities and that 10 percent of group sales could be ripe for portfolio adjustment.   A second person familiar with the matter said Pfizer expected a “broadening” of buyer interest to include Nestle. Bayer and Sanofi may be less likely to bid, despite their consumer health presence, given they are busy absorbing Monsanto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer business respectively. In explaining the thinking behind the review, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said consumer healthcare was connected but not integral to its core prescription drug business. “Although there is a strong connection between consumer healthcare and elements of our core biopharmaceutical businesses, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there is potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company,” he said. Options to be considered include a full or partial separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. Pfizer may also ultimately decide to keep the business. The Pfizer business includes two of the 10 top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally in Advil and the multivitamin line Centrum. It also has 10 brands that each exceeded $100 million in 2016 sales. A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Allergan last year. It also tried and failed to buy AstraZeneca in 2014. Since then there has been persistent speculation that Pfizer is scouting for another major deal, with a bid for cancer specialist Bristol-Myers Squibb  widely tipped as an option. However, the first source said the consumer healthcare review and the amount of cash it would raise was “irrelevant” to a possible takeover of Bristol-Myers, which has a market value of $105 billion. Pfizer has hired Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley as financial advisers for the review,  Germany’s Merck KGaA had hired JP Morgan to sell its consumer health business.

981,AGN,Texas judge poised to decide if Allergan patent deal with Mohawks was a sham,"(Reuters) - Last month, in the midst of post-trial briefing in Allergan’s patent suit against generic drug makers that want to begin selling a version of Allergan’s dry eye medication Restasis, Allergan sent a one-paragraph letter to U.S. District Judge William Bryson of Marshall, Texas. Allergan informed the judge that it had just assigned its rights to the patents at issue in the case to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which, in turn, had granted Allergan an exclusive license to the patents. Allergan assured Judge Bryson that it did not expect its deal with the tribe to affect the Texas case, except for a routine motion for the tribe to join as plaintiff.  But now that seemingly routine procedural issue - adding the tribe as a plaintiff in the Texas case – has escalated into a test of the legitimacy of a patent litigation tactic that is as creative as it is controversial. Allergan’s deal with the tribe won’t determine whether Judge Bryson deems six Restasis patents valid; that evidence was already before the judge when Allergan assigned its patents to the Saint Regis Mohawk tribe. The Texas judge will, however, decide if Allergan’s agreement was merely a sham to allow the drug company to evade a challenge to its patents in a completely different forum.  Allergan’s agreement with the tribe, according to an Oct. 10 filing in the Texas case, specifically requires the Saint Regis Mohawks to assert their sovereign immunity in a challenge to the validity of the Restasis patents at the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The PTAB challenge, filed by the generic drug maker Mylan, parallels the patent litigation before Judge Bryson in federal court in Texas, except that the Texas case has already been tried and the PTAB case has not.  True to its agreement with Allergan, the tribe moved last month to dismiss Mylan’s case at the PTAB, citing its sovereign immunity. If Allergan’s strategy succeeds, the PTAB will never hear Mylan’s challenge.  As my colleague Jan Wolfe has reported, Allergan’s sovereign immunity play has created a bit of an uproar in Congress, which is worried that other brand-name drug makers will copy Allergan’s agreement with Native American tribes in order to ward off competition from generic drug companies.  Mylan has been fulminating about Allergan’s deal with the Saint Regis Mohawks from almost the moment it was announced. On Sept. 11, three days after Allergan informed Judge Bryson about the assignment and licensing agreement, Mylan’s lawyers at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati filed a response calling Allergan’s deal a “desperate tactic,” a “transparent, last-minute attempt to shield the patents-in-suit from inevitable cancellation” and an abuse of Native American sovereignty.  Mylan refused, according to Allergan, to consent to the tribe’s joinder in the Texas case. Allergan claimed in an Oct. 9 filing that its lawyers asked Mylan to allow the tribe to be added as a plaintiff, promising Mylan that the tribe would not assert its sovereign immunity in the Texas litigation. After Allergan provided Mylan with a draft motion outlining its argument that, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the tribe is now an interested party, Mylan said it would oppose joinder because it could not determine whether the assignment and licensing agreement was a sham.  Judge Bryson, meanwhile, was itchy to decide the merits of the case. With no joinder motion on the docket, he issued an order on Oct. 6 that directed Allergan to file documents from its deal with the Saint Regis Mohawks and both sides to brief the questions of “whether the tribe should be joined as a co-plaintiff in this action, or whether the assignment of the patents to the tribe should be disregarded as a sham.”  In a flurry of filings after the judge’s order last week, Mylan asked for additional discovery from Allergan and Allergan claimed Mylan was fishing to defend its unsupported assertion of a sham. In a second order on Oct. 10, Judge Bryson denied Mylan’s motion to take depositions, although he directed Allergan to provide Mylan with all of the documents it had filed with him. Briefs are due Friday.  You may be wondering, as I did, why Mylan is so adamantly opposed to the tribe’s addition as a plaintiff in the Texas case. Allergan has promised, after all, that the tribe will not attempt to hijack the case by claiming sovereign immunity. And some commenters have suggested that if the Saint Regis Mohawks join the Texas case, Mylan can tell the PTAB that the tribe waived its sovereign immunity. If that’s true, shouldn’t Mylan be eager for the tribe to jump into the Texas case?  I emailed Mylan’s lawyers at Wilson Sonsini and Allergan’s counsel at Fish & Richardson, none of whom got back to me. But the tribe’s lawyer, Michael Shore of Shore Chan DePumpo, told me Mylan has nothing to gain, and potentially a lot to lose, if Judge Bryson allows his clients to come in as plaintiffs in the Texas case. According to Shore, Mylan can’t claim the tribe waived sovereign immunity at the PTAB by joining a case in federal court under the Federal U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ 2006 decision in Tegic Communications v. Board of Regents of the University of Texas  – a case Shore knows well because he won it. “I made that law, I know that law,” Shore said. “Waiver of sovereign immunity is not an issue.”  Judge Bryson’s evaluation of the deal between Allergan and the tribe, however, could influence the PTAB’s consideration of the tribe’s motion to dismiss Mylan’s challenge, Shore said. If the Texas judge agrees to join the tribe in the case before him, Shore said, “it kills any chance Mylan has to convince the PTAB the agreement is a sham.”  Mylan, of course, is hoping Judge Bryson concludes the agreement was a sham transaction so it can use that holding at the PTAB. I asked Shore whether he read Bryson’s Oct. 6 order as an indication that the judge doubts the legitimacy of the tribe’s assignment and licensing deal with Allergan. As you would expect, he said no. The judge just wants to make sure everyone with an interest in the case is a party before he issues findings.  “It’s as simple as that,” Shore said.",10112017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-allergan/texas-judge-poised-to-decide-if-allergan-patent-deal-with-mohawks-was-a-sham-idUSKBN1CG2NK

985,AGN,U.S. judge in Texas invalidates Allergan patents on Restasis,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday invalidated patents on Allergan Plc’s dry-eye medicine Restasis on grounds that the patents cover ideas that are obvious, sending shares of the pharmaceutical company down 3.5 percent. Judge William Bryson issued the ruling in federal court in Marshall, Texas, in a longstanding dispute between Allergan and generic drugmakers Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Akorn Inc.  Bryson said a group of patents Allergan obtained on Restasis, which are set to expire in 2024, should not have been granted because they describe methods of treatment that were obvious in light of earlier patents granted to the company. Allergan said it was disappointed and plans an appeal of the ruling, which would enable the generic drug companies to sell their own versions of Restasis. The drug generated around $1.5 billion in sales for Allergan last year and accounted for more than 10 percent of the company’s revenue.  Bryson also criticized Allergan’s recent deal to transfer the patents to a Native American tribe, which the company has said was an effort to protect them from administrative review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, not challenges in federal court. “What  Allergan  seeks  is  the  right  to  continue  to enjoy  the  considerable  benefits  of  the U.S. patent system without accepting the limits that Congress has placed on those benefits,” Bryson wrote of the deal. U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have criticized the drugmaker’s maneuver. Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill drafted a bill in response to the move and a U.S. House of Representatives committee is investigating the deal. Allergan said on Sept. 8 that it transferred the patents to New York’s Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which agreed to exclusively license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments. The tribe and Allergan argue that the patents are not subject to the patent office’s review because of the tribe’s sovereign immunity. Bryson said he believed Allergan’s deal with the tribe was a “ploy” and that he had “serious concerns” about its legitimacy. After the ruling, Allergan’s stock price dropped as much as 6.5 percent to a session low of $192.22. It later pared losses to close at $198.41, down 3.5 percent. Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said he believes the ruling had largely already been priced in to the company’s shares as Allergan’s market value has dropped around $9 billion since early September due in part to worries about the Restasis patents.  He also said he does not expect a generic version of the drug to launch until 2019, because an appeal could take 12 to 18 months and none of the generic drugmakers currently have an approved version ready to launch.

986,AGN,UPDATE 3-U.S. judge in Texas invalidates Allergan patents on Restasis,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday invalidated patents on Allergan Plc’s dry-eye medicine Restasis on grounds that the patents cover ideas that are obvious, sending shares of the pharmaceutical company down 3.5 percent. Judge William Bryson issued the ruling in federal court in Marshall, Texas, in a longstanding dispute between Allergan and generic drugmakers Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Akorn Inc.  Bryson said a group of patents Allergan obtained on Restasis, which are set to expire in 2024, should not have been granted because they describe methods of treatment that were obvious in light of earlier patents granted to the company. Allergan said it was disappointed and plans an appeal of the ruling, which would enable the generic drug companies to sell their own versions of Restasis. The drug generated around $1.5 billion in sales for Allergan last year and accounted for more than 10 percent of the company’s revenue.

992,AGN,UPDATE 1-Native American tribe holding patents sues Amazon and Microsoft,"(Reuters) - A Native American tribe sued Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in federal court in Virginia on Wednesday for infringing supercomputer patents it is holding for a technology firm. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe was assigned the patents by SRC Labs LLC in August, in a deal intended to use the tribe’s sovereign status to shield them from administrative review.   SRC is also a plaintiff in the case. Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment. The tribe, which would receive a share of any award, made a similar deal in September to hold patents for Allergan on its dry eye medicine Restasis. SRC and Allergan made the deals to shield their patents from review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court run by the U.S. patent office that frequently revokes patents. The tribe would get revenue to address environmental damage and rising healthcare costs. Companies sued for patent infringement in federal court often respond by asking the patent board to invalidate the asserted patents. Both Microsoft and Amazon have used this strategy to prevail in previous disputes. A federal court in Texas separately invalidated Allergan’s Restasis patents on Monday. The company responded that it would appeal that ruling. Allergan’s deal with the tribe has drawn criticism from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, some of whom have called it a “sham.” Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill on Oct. 5 introduced a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty.

994,AGN,Allergan ruling casts doubt on tribal patent strategy,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge’s ruling on Monday invalidating Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) patents on its blockbuster $1.5 billion dry-eye medicine, Restasis, has cast doubt on the company’s novel strategy to enlist a Native American tribe to help shield those patents from challenge by generic drugmakers, legal experts said. In a deal announced last month, Allergan transferred the Restasis patents to New York state’s Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe,  claiming the group’s status as a sovereign nation meant the patents could not be reviewed by the U.S. patent office. Allergan said the move was justified because the same patents were already being reviewed in federal court, but critics said it was a cynical attempt to prolong the company’s monopoly on Restasis. The federal judge, William Bryson, expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the tribal transfer, calling it a ploy by Allergan to “rent” the tribe’s sovereign immunity.  He did not rule directly on whether the transfer was legal, however, because that question was not squarely before him. But his decision on Monday rendered Allergan’s move largely meaningless, since he invalidated the Restasis patents himself instead of waiting for the patent office to rule. Allergan said it was disappointed by Bryson’s decision to invalidate the patents and vowed to appeal.  Legal experts said the rebuke from a prominent judge will make other patent owners reluctant to copy Allergan’s maneuver.  “This should flash some serious yellow lights, if not red lights, in front of parties considering a deal like this,” said Michael Carrier, a professor of patent law at Rutgers Law School. The dispute over the Restasis patents dates back to 2015 when generic drug companies led by Mylan NV (MYL.O) asked a federal judge sitting in Texas to invalidate Allergan’s Restasis patents in hopes of launching their own generic versions of the medicine. The generic drugmakers also asked the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), an administrative court run by the patent office, to revoke the patents. Companies often ask both a federal judge and PTAB to cancel patents. Allergan said in September that it had transferred its Restasis patents to the tribe, which agreed to license the patents back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments. The company said the PTAB proceeding should be terminated because the tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the tribe. Allergan said it wanted to avoid defending the patent in both federal court and before PTAB. But after Bryson’s ruling, other patent owners will be less likely to transfer such patents to tribes to shield them from review, said Rachel Sachs, a professor of patent law at Washington University in St. Louis. Bryson said “sovereign immunity should not be treated as a monetizable commodity that can be purchased by private entities as part of a scheme to evade their legal responsibilities.” Sachs said Bryson is a well-regarded judge and that his reasoning could be cited by other courts, including PTAB judges.  She noted the ruling comes after weeks of criticism on Capitol Hill, where politicians have slammed Allergan’s move as a sham, with one U.S. senator introducing a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty. [nL2N1MG26D] In a research note on Monday, analysts at Credit Suisse said     Allergan suffered a “public relations backlash” from the deal without helping its bottom line.  Allergan said in a statement on Tuesday that its deal with the tribe has helped raised awareness about the need to reform the PTAB process, which the company said does not provide due process to patent owners. Some legal experts said it is too early to declare Allergan’s patent gambit a failure.  Jacob Sherkow, a professor of patent law at New York Law School, said PTAB may still rule in favor of Allergan on its sovereign immunity defense.  If that happens, Allergan’s deal with the tribe could be copied by other patent owners, said Joshua Landau, a patent lawyer with the trade group Computer & Communications Industry Association. Bryson’s decision “will make patent owners question the arrangement, but I don’t know if the ruling will prevent it entirely,” Landau said.

It will cost 99 cents for a month’s supply and refills start at $79 a month.

1005,AGN,Allergan assuages shareholder fears over losing Restasis patent,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc on Wednesday reassured shareholders that it would return to earnings growth in 2019 after losing a major patent ruling last month on its second-most important drug, dry-eye treatment Restasis. Shares of the drugmaker were up around 5 percent at $185.97 in afternoon trading.  The drugmaker, which also announced third-quarter earnings, said it will combat generic competition for the drug by expanding its base business, reducing costs and possibly buying back stock. The company added, however, that it has yet to decide on a specific strategy. “We are in the planning stages, and we will be implementing something as soon as we complete our planning,” Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on a conference call with investors. “But rest assured, we will do it rapidly.”  Allergan worked hard in recent years to protect Restasis,  which generated about $1.5 billion in sales last year, from generic rivals. It struck a controversial deal with a Native American tribe in September to shield review of the patents by U.S. regulators, drawing the ire of lawmakers and rival drug companies. Last month, a Texas federal judge invalidated Restasis patents on grounds that they cover ideas that are obvious, making it possible for rival generics to hit the market as early as next year. Allergan has appealed the ruling.  Allergan said it evaluated its dry eye-related assets as a result of the court order, and took an impairment charge of $3.2 billion related to Restasis in the quarter.  It said it expects next year’s adjusted earnings to be down as much as 9 percent from this year if a generic competitor to Restasis launches early in 2018. If a rival launches during the second half, the impact on earnings will be more modest, the company said. The company said it expects earnings to grow from 2017 levels by 2019, regardless of whether a generic launches next year. Allergan’s shares hit four-year lows earlier in the day before recovering. Since June, they have lost nearly a quarter of their value. “Even with the Restasis concerns, the stock is oversold,” said Kevin Kedra, healthcare analyst at Gabelli & Co. “This is manageable. It’s a cheap stock.” Including the impairment charge for Restasis and other items, Allergan reported a net loss of $4.03 billion, or $12.07 per share, for the quarter, compared with a profit of $15.15 billion or, $38.58 per share, a year earlier. Excluding those items, Allergan earned $4.15 per share and topped analysts’ average estimate of $4.05, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 11.4 percent to $4.03 billion, matching analysts’ expectations as the drugmaker benefited from products it acquired over the last year and it sold more of its top-selling Botox treatment. The regenerative medicine business it picked up in its February acquisition of LifeCell and the CoolSculpting business acquired in its April deal for Zeltiq accounted for nearly half of the revenue increase. The company’s CoolSculpting products are meant to help people slim down by freezing away fat.

The company added, however, that it has yet to decide on a specific strategy. “We are in the planning stages, and we will be implementing something as soon as we complete our planning,” Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on a conference call with investors. “But rest assured, we will do it rapidly.”  Allergan worked hard in recent years to protect Restasis,  which generated about $1.5 billion in sales last year, from generic rivals. It struck a controversial deal with a Native American tribe in September to shield review of the patents by U.S. regulators, drawing the ire of lawmakers and rival drug companies. Last month, a Texas federal judge invalidated Restasis patents on grounds that they cover ideas that are obvious, making it possible for rival generics to hit the market as early as next year. Allergan has appealed the ruling.  Allergan said it evaluated its dry eye-related assets as a result of the court order, and took an impairment charge of $3.2 billion related to Restasis in the quarter.  It said it expects next year’s adjusted earnings to be down as much as 9 percent from this year if a generic competitor to Restasis launches early in 2018. If a rival launches during the second half, the impact on earnings will be more modest, the company said. The company said it expects earnings to grow from 2017 levels by 2019, regardless of whether a generic launches next year. Allergan’s shares hit four-year lows earlier in the day before recovering. Since June, they have lost nearly a quarter of their value. “Even with the Restasis concerns, the stock is oversold,” said Kevin Kedra, healthcare analyst at Gabelli & Co. “This is manageable. It’s a cheap stock.” Including the impairment charge for Restasis and other items, Allergan reported a net loss of $4.03 billion, or $12.07 per share, for the quarter, compared with a profit of $15.15 billion or, $38.58 per share, a year earlier. Excluding those items, Allergan earned $4.15 per share and topped analysts’ average estimate of $4.05, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 11.4 percent to $4.03 billion, matching analysts’ expectations as the drugmaker benefited from products it acquired over the last year and it sold more of its top-selling Botox treatment. The regenerative medicine business it picked up in its February acquisition of LifeCell and the CoolSculpting business acquired in its April deal for Zeltiq accounted for nearly half of the revenue increase. The company’s CoolSculpting products are meant to help people slim down by freezing away fat.

1009,AGN,U.S. Congress to hold hearing on Allergan tribal patent deal,"Nov 2 (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on Thursday called a Nov. 7 hearing on the legitimacy of an agreement between drugmaker Allergan Plc and a Native American tribe intended to shield patents from administrative review. The House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on intellectual property, chaired by Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, said in a statement that the hearing would include testimony from four experts on patent law, including a former in-house attorney at drug company Johnson & Johnson and a lawyer with a trade group representing the software industry. An Allergan spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would send any executives to the hearing. Allergan on Sept. 8 transferred patents on its dry eye medication Restasis to the upstate New York Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which agreed to exclusively license the patents back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments. According to Allergan, the tribe’s status as a sovereign entity places the patents outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court created by Congress in 2011 that can cancel patents it decides should not have been granted. Generic drug companies frequently ask the tribunal to revoke patents on brand-name prescription drugs in hopes of launching their own lower-cost versions. A challenge to Allergan’s Restasis patents brought by rival Mylan NV is pending before the board. Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders has said the patent tribunal is a flawed and unfair forum. He has said Allergan would not object to the Restasis patents being reviewed in federal court, which it called a fair and time-tested process. A federal court invalidated Allergan’s Restasis patents on Oct. 16, rendering the tribal deal mostly meaningless. Allergan has appealed that ruling. Lawmakers have called Allergan’s deal with the tribe a sham transaction. A bipartisan group of four representatives from the House Oversight and Government Committee on Oct. 3 asked Allergan to provide documents about its agreements with the tribe. After the ruling the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe said it was eager to make similar deals with other patent owners to generate much-needed revenue for its members.

1016,AGN,Novartis posts eye drug data amid play for Eylea's turf,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s bid to move in on Bayer’s and Regeneron’s eye-drug turf was buoyed on Friday by data showing patients on the Swiss drugmaker’s new RTH258 drug showed less disease activity than those on its rivals’ drug Eylea. Active disease was observed in 23.5 percent of RTH258 patients versus 33.5 percent of Eylea patients at 16 weeks, Novartis said, of its investigational treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where abnormal, leaky blood vessels can cause blindness.  A second, similar study found active disease in 21.9 percent of RTH258 patients versus 31.4 percent of those on Eylea for the condition affecting 20-25 million people worldwide. Novartis in June touted initial data showing its drug may require fewer injections directly into the eye than Eylea, while matching it on vision and safety measures. The Basel-based drugmaker hopes this latest analysis lends RTH258 additional muscle when matched head-to-head with Eylea as well as Lucentis, which Roche sells in the United States.  “When you take all of that together ... we believe we have a very compelling proposition,” Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s chief drug developer who will become CEO in 2018, said on a conference call. Novartis, which released the data at the American Academy of Opthalmology conference in New Orleans, predicts RTH258 annual sales will top $1 billion and aims to file for U.S. approval in late 2018.  Making it a success is by no means clear sailing. For one, Novartis owns Lucentis rights in Europe where it has contractual obligations to continue marketing that drug. Analysts say cannibalization from RTH258 will be a challenge. Competition abounds, too: Eylea, with $5 billion in annual sales, has made inroads against the $3.2 billion-per-year Lucentis, whose 2020 U.S. patent expiration will expose it to cheaper copies. Moreover, Roche’s cancer drug Avastin is effective in off-label AMD use and has won favor because it costs a fraction of Lucentis and Eylea. In Britain, Novartis and Bayer are fighting doctor groups aiming to switch to Avastin. Other would-be rivals are racing to market, too.  Allergan, whose investigational Abicipar is in Phase III trials, is also trumpeting prospects of reduced injections compared to Lucentis. Gene therapies may also be on the distant horizon. Still, Novartis’s Narasimhan remains optimistic for RTH258’s reception when it hits the market, likely in 2019.  “When you actually see an image of a patient having a needle inserted into their eye, this is something patients definitely want to avoid,” he said.  “Retinal surgeons have busy offices and want to do more complex retinal surgery. Today, they have offices filled with patients waiting for injections.” ",11102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/novartis-eye-drug-bayer/novartis-posts-eye-drug-data-amid-play-for-eyleas-turf-idUSL8N1NF7SI
1017,AGN,Allergan to sell a quarter of its Teva stake in first quarter of 2018,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N) said on Monday it will sell just under a quarter of its roughly 10 percent stake in Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N) during the first quarter of 2018, as it starts to unwind its position in the struggling generic drugmaker. Botox maker Allergan said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will sell 25 million shares to a JP Morgan Chase and Co (JPM.N) unit - acting as a dealer for the shares - sometime next quarter. The JP Morgan unit will pay a price based on the average trading price over a yet-to-be determined period before the sale. Allergan sold its generics business to Teva in August 2016 for $33 billion in cash and 100 million shares of the Israeli generic drugmaker, worth around $5.3 billion at the time. Under the terms of the deal, Allergan had to hold the shares for at least one year. That has turned out to be a costly agreement for the drugmaker, as Teva’s shares have lost more than three-fourths of their value since the deal. Allergan’s shares have lost around a third of their value over that period. Allergan said on Nov. 1 that it planned to begin selling its Teva stake, and this was the first announced sale of the stock. Two of Israel’s leading financial news outlets reported later that week that billionaire businessman Len Blavatnik was looking to buy a significant stake in debt-ridden Teva, possibly through a deal with Allergan.  It was not clear who the ultimate buyer of Allergan’s shares will be in the JP Morgan transaction. In the same filing, Allergan said it had taken a margin loan from JP Morgan on its whole 100 million-share stake in Teva.

1026,AGN,Tech firms tell patent court to ignore Allergan deal with tribe,"(Reuters) - Over 30 technology companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc. (FB.O) on Friday urged a U.S. patent court to disregard drugmaker Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) contention that its transfer of some of its patents to a Native American tribe shields them from the court’s review. Two trade groups comprised of tech industry leaders argued in a joint brief submitted to the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board that the board has the right to review the validity of patents covering the dry eye medicine Restasis that Allergan transferred to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in a deal announced in September. “This panel’s statutory authority to review whether the Restasis patents were properly granted as a matter of federal law does not and should not depend on the identity of the patents’ owner,” said the trade group. Allergan is arguing the tribe’s sovereign status means the patent review board, an administrative court, has no jurisdiction over the transferred patents. The tribe agreed to exclusively license the Restasis patents back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments. Many technology companies have praised the patent court, saying it is a low-cost and efficient way to cancel dubious patents used to bring abusive lawsuits.

1027,AGN,Tech firms tell patent court to ignore Allergan deal with tribe,"(Reuters) - Over 30 technology companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc. (FB.O) on Friday urged a U.S. patent court to disregard drugmaker Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) contention that its transfer of some of its patents to a Native American tribe shields them from the court’s review. Two trade groups comprised of tech industry leaders argued in a joint brief submitted to the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board that the board has the right to review the validity of patents covering the dry eye medicine Restasis that Allergan transferred to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in a deal announced in September. “This panel’s statutory authority to review whether the Restasis patents were properly granted as a matter of federal law does not and should not depend on the identity of the patents’ owner,” said the trade group. Allergan is arguing the tribe’s sovereign status means the patent review board, an administrative court, has no jurisdiction over the transferred patents. The tribe agreed to exclusively license the Restasis patents back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments. Many technology companies have praised the patent court, saying it is a low-cost and efficient way to cancel dubious patents used to bring abusive lawsuits. They fear that, if upheld, Allergan’s strategy could be widely adopted and used against them.

1028,AGN,Fitch Affirms Allergan's 'BBB-' Rating; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Allergan plc (Allergan; NYSE: AGN) and subsidiaries at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed and withdrawn the 'BBB-' IDRs of Allergan's subsidiaries, Warner Chilcott Limited and Allergan Finance LLC. These IDRs are no longer considered by Fitch to be relevant to the agency's coverage. A full list of rating actions, which apply to approximately $30.3 billion of debt outstanding at Sept. 30, 2017, follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Scaled and Growing: Allergan is among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, with a diversified, well-positioned product portfolio and a growing (internal and externally derived) product pipeline. Fitch expects Allergan to generate low- to mid-single-digit organic sales growth, augmented by targeted acquisitions, over the ratings horizon. External R&D; Strategy: Allergan is pursuing an ""Open Science"" R&D; strategy, which should have lower development risk than that of most traditional pharma firms. However, large cash outflows related to acquisitions, in-licensing and milestone payments will likely be greater than traditional organic/adjusted R&D; expenses, which lead to somewhat inflated EBITDA margins and understated leverage figures. Notably, this dynamic is likely to moderate in the longer term, as Fitch expects acquired R&D; to become a smaller proportion of total R&D; activities as the firm grows. Active Acquirer, Now More Targeted: Fitch expects Allergan will remain an active acquirer, using steady FCF and cash balances for targeted growth-oriented assets. Deals are expected to be generally smaller and funded with internally generated liquidity, supporting a more stable debt leverage profile than during the past five years. However, management has stated that large leveraging M&A; is not out of the question. Restasis Exclusivity at Risk: Restasis (chronic dry eye) accounts for roughly 9% of total firm sales and its patent is scheduled to expire in August 2024. However, generic companies are challenging the patent and in October 2017, a U.S. district court invalidated Restasis' patent. Allergan has stated that it will appeal the decision. Generic competition could enter the market as early as 2018 depending on future legal rulings and generic manufacturers' ability to gain regulatory approval of their versions of the drug. Fitch believes Allergan would adjust its operations and cash in the event of generic competition deployment, in order to maintain its investment-grade rating should generic competition arrive early. Positive FCF: Fitch expects Allergan to generate FCF of at least $2.9 billion in 2018. Strong FCF supports management's commitment to repay all debt maturing 2018 and targeted M&A;, funded with internal liquidity. Furthermore, Allergan's Irish domicile provides an efficient tax structure and allows the firm to use its cash without material repatriation penalties. U.S. federal tax reform could make this attribute less advantageous relative to other U.S. based innovative pharmaceutical firms. DERIVATION SUMMARY Allergan plc. (BBB-/Stable) is competitively positioned in terms of scale, breadth, depth, geographic reach and patent risk compared to its industry peers, Amgen Inc. (BBB/Stable), Bristol-Myers Squibb (A-/Stable) and Eli Lilly & Co. (A/Stable). Allergan's largest product, Botox, has lost patent exclusivity but continues to grow with expanded treatment indications and its difficult-to-replicate, complex chemical structure. Allergan and Amgen have much greater margins compared to Bristol-Myers and Lilly, owing to a number of their specialty products. Allergan also has significantly higher gross debt leverage than Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers, driven by a recently more aggressive capital deployment posture, with a gross leverage sensitivity of less than or equal to 3.5x for its 'BBB-'rating. Allergan can access its international cash in a more tax-efficient manner than its peers because it is domiciled in Ireland. Allergan's rating reflects the smaller and less diversified nature of the company's operating profile relative to larger innovative pharmaceutical industry peers Pfizer and Merck. This is particularly evident regarding scale, breadth, depth, and patent risk. Gross leverage durably below 2.2x is supportive of Merck's 'A' rating, while Pfizer 'A+' rating gross debt to EBITDA sensitivity of 1.4x-1.7x is supportive of Pfizer's  'A+' rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -Organic sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits (assuming mid-to-late 2018 generic Restasis competition) during the next three years and possibly greater than that, if Restasis' patent is ultimately validated. - SG&A; prioritized toward growing profitable segments while pared from areas expect to generate soft and growing R&D; costs, resulting in relatively steady EBITDA margins around 50% with some softness tied to timing of generic competition for Restasis. -Normalized annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus dividends) of $2.6 billion-$3.6 billion during the four-year forecast period. -All debt maturities repaid (not refinanced) in 2018, leading to gross debt/EBITDA of roughly 3.4x at YE2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Allergan's 'BBB-' ratings consider run-rate gross debt/EBITDA in the range of 3x-3.5x. Possible temporary increases are consistent with the 'BBB-' rating, if expected to be followed by a period of deleveraging. Annual post-dividend, post-milestone FCF of at least $1 billion-$2 billion should provide ample ongoing liquidity for continuing bolt-on acquisitions of established businesses and in-process R&D; assets. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Positive ratings momentum is slowed to the degree internal liquidity is directed toward share repurchases and committed dividend payouts. -A capital deployment strategy that provides a period of time without large, leveraging M&A; that allows gross debt/EBITDA to trend to 3x or below on a reported basis will be required before an upgrade to 'BBB' is considered. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -A downgrade could be considered if the firm were to pursue a significantly large debt-funded acquisition that would cause gross debt/EBITDA to be sustained above 3.5x for a period of greater than 18-24 months. -Given the well-diversified nature of Allergan's product portfolio, a downgrade scenario involving operational difficulties is unlikely. Allergan's 'BBB-' ratings consider run-rate gross debt/EBITDA in the range of 3x-3.5x. -Possible temporary increases are consistent with the 'BBB-' rating, if expected to be followed by a period of deleveraging. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Liquidity is sufficient with full availability on its $1.5 revolving credit facility, approximately $5.4 billion in cash and marketable securities at Sept. 30, 2017. Fitch expects Allergan to pay down debt maturing in 2018 with cash flow. Estimated debt maturities include: $3 billion in 2018; $1.25 billion in 2019; $4.65 billion in 2020; and $20.7 billion thereafter. Unlike many of its U.S. pharma peers, Allergan is able to use substantially all of its cash flows free from the relatively high U.S. taxes associated with repatriation of earnings generated outside the U.S. This advantage relative to U.S. domiciled peers could fade depending on reform of the U.S. tax code.

1029,AGN,"UPDATE 2-Teva considering cutting up to 10,000 jobs - Bloomberg","(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) is considering cutting up to 10,000 jobs as CEO Kare Schultz seeks to reduce $1.5 billion to $2 billion in costs over the next two years, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. U.S.-listed shares (TEVA.N) of the debt-laden Israeli drugmaker jumped as much as 7 percent to $16.09 on Friday. No final decision has been taken, and the targets may be modified, with a range of 5,000 to 10,000 jobs being discussed, Bloomberg reported. bloom.bg/2kdYEBI “We don’t comment on market rumors,” Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley said in an emailed statement. Israeli financial news website Calcalist had reported two weeks ago that the drugmaker would send termination letters to “tens of percent” of its 10,000 employees in the United States. Schultz, who took over as CEO of the world’s largest maker of generic drugs last month, has ousted the company’s three top division heads. Teva is saddled with nearly $35 billion in debt after its $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) generic drug business last year.  Profits from generics have slumped since that deal closed, and the CEO who engineered the purchase was forced to step down earlier this year. Teva has about 57,000 employees globally, according to the company’s website.

1032,AGN,"UPDATE 3-Teva Pharm to lay off a quarter of workforce, suspends dividend","TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) (TEVA.N) is to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, give up many of its manufacturing plants and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares in a much-anticipated overhaul to help pay off its debts. The Israel-based company, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, said on Thursday the move will result in a reduction of 14,000 jobs globally, with the majority to come in 2018. The two-year restructuring plan is intended to reduce Teva’s cost base by $3 billion by the end of 2019, out of an estimated cost base for 2017 of $16.1 billion. Shares in Teva were up 14.6 percent at $18 in New York, but are down 53 percent since January. Investors will like this plan as most are focused on the near-term cost cuts and not the business outlook, Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said. “However, in our view, the new CEO’s $3 billion cost-savings goal is larger than we had anticipated, and while this is more needed for survival versus optimization, it may also have significant negative effects to Teva’s competitiveness,” said Maris, who rates the shares “market perform”.  Saddled with nearly $35 billion in debt since acquiring Allergan’s (AGN.N) Actavis generic drug business for $40.5 billion, Teva made a series of changes after Kare Schultz joined as its new chief executive on Nov. 1. In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Schultz said action was needed to ensure Teva’s future. “It is clear that without taking drastic steps in the coming weeks and months, the company will be increasingly vulnerable to potential takeover by global financial institutions or activists with their own agendas and the risk is real,” he said. Teva expects a restructuring charge from the plan in 2018 of at least $700 million, mostly to come in the second and third quarters and mainly related to severance costs. Additional charges may follow decisions on closures or divestment of plants, R&D; facilities and office locations. “A longer-term strategy will come later in the year, however, in the near term we must remain focused on cash-flow generation, short-term revenue and serving our debt,” Schultz said in a letter to employees. Investors and analysts have questioned how Teva will be able to service its debt in coming years.      In a conference call with analysts, Schultz said Teva would use cash flow to pay down debt, initially focusing on bank debt. “We have no plans for raising new equity, short term or long term,” he told Reuters in an interview. The company also expects help next year from two new branded products - its migraine drug fremanezumab and Austedo, which treats abnormal, involuntary movements associated with Huntington’s disease. In the U.S. generics market, which has suffered from price declines in the past year, Schultz expects further price erosion overall in 2018. This has led to some products becoming unprofitable. Teva is now determining which products it can adjust the price for and which products it “needs to get out of”. Despite the consolidation, Schultz said he is confident Teva can remain competitive because of its broad portfolio of generic drugs. Some 1,700 jobs will be cut and a manufacturing site will be closed in Israel, where the main labor federation threatened to hold a half-day general strike on Sunday, the start of the Israeli work week, in protest at the layoffs. Schultz said Teva will maintain its headquarters in Israel. The government went into damage-control mode ahead of Teva’s announcement, including a telephone call from Netanyahu to Schultz, asking that he keep layoffs in Israel to a minimum. Economy Minister Eli Cohen said Teva’s employees should not pay for the company’s failed investments abroad. “Teva has succeeded thanks to grants and tax benefits it received from the state and thanks to developments by Israeli scientists,” he said, adding: “We will fight for every employee.” The company said dividends on convertible preferred shares would be evaluated on a quarterly basis. Teva will provide its 2018 outlook in February.

1034,AGN,Fears of Israeli job cuts at Teva sparks call for general strike," (This version of the story was refiled to modify the headline) By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Reports that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) is planning a restructuring involving mass layoffs in Israel sparked calls on Wednesday for a half-day general strike to be held in protest. The plan includes closing Teva’s research and development center in the coastal city of Netanya, selling its logistics center in Shoham and cutting 3,300 jobs out of 6,430 nation-wide, the Israeli financial news website Calcalist reported.   Teva (TEVA.N), the world’s largest generic drug maker which employs more than 56,000 people, did not comment on the details of the report. But it confirmed there was a restructuring plan that it would discuss in a 1300 GMT conference call on Thursday. Saddled with nearly $35 billion in debt since acquiring Allergan’s (AGN.N) Actavis generic drug business for $40.5 billion, Teva made a series of changes after Kare Schultz joined as its new chief executive on Nov. 1. Israeli Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon said only that he was following the situation closely. Avi Nissenkorn, chief of the Histadrut labor federation, declared a half-day general strike for Sunday, the beginning of the Israeli work week.  “The entire economy - from the (Ben Gurion) airport to the banks to the seaports to the municipalities to the government service to the health clinics - will stand until noon on Sunday in solidarity with Teva’s employees,” Nissenkorn told reporters. He predicted mass layoffs under the Teva restructuring plan, which he described as “ruinous” for a company that was long a symbol of Israeli enterprise.  One of the plants earmarked for sale, Calcalist said, is the Teva Tech factory in Israel’s southern Negev desert. It produces raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry and employs 870 workers, according to Teva’s website. “This is a young plant ... and hundreds of millions of shekels of Israeli government money were invested here,” Meir Babayoff, chairman of the Negev region in the Histadrut, told Israel Radio. He vowed to stop any layoffs and called on Israel’s government “to wake up”. Last week Bloomberg reported that the firm was considering cutting up to 10,000 jobs to reduce costs by $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the next two years. Teva said on Tuesday that Yitzhak Peterburg, who previously served as its chairman and interim CEO, had resigned from its board with immediate effect. Schultz ousted top division heads last month and said he would combine the firm’s generic and specialty drug businesses. He had also said Teva was working on a detailed restructuring plan to be unveiled in mid-December.

1035,AGN,UPDATE 2-Strike over Teva Pharm job cuts briefly shuts down Israel,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s main public-sector labor union staged a half-day strike on Sunday, closing the airport, stock exchange, banks and all government ministries to protest at mass layoffs planned by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA).  Debt-ridden Teva (TEVA.N), one of Israel’s largest companies and the world’s largest generics drugmaker, said last week it would cut its global workforce by more than a quarter, or 14,000 jobs. Some 1,700 jobs will be cut and a manufacturing site will be closed in Israel. This has angered unions and politicians, who believe Teva’s employees should not pay for the company’s failed investments abroad. Sunday is the beginning of the Israeli work week. Hundreds of thousands of workers went on strike until 12 noon (1000 GMT) and many held solidarity rallies outside Teva facilities. Protesters also blocked major roads across the country, including the entrance of Jerusalem, and burned tires outside many Teva offices. Demonstrators sat in the middle of streets and crosswalks, halting traffic in a number of cities. The Histadrut labor federation said hundreds of Teva workers in its Jerusalem plant were squatting inside and would continue a strike again on Monday, while there will also be strikes at other Teva facilities.  The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange shortened its trading day, opening at 1 pm and closed as usual at about 4:30 pm. Teva’s shares fell 0.8 percent. Departing flights at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport between 8 a.m. and at least 12 p.m. were either canceled or delayed. Similarly, no flights were allowed to land until after 12 p.m. Trains and buses were initially supposed to strike as well, but the Histadrut allowed public transit to operate so that soldiers could get back to their bases as usual. “We are fighting on behalf of Teva’s workers to save Israel’s industry ... and to convey the message that layoffs are the last and not the first step in the public and private sectors,” Histadrut chief Avi Nissenkorn said. He called the current crisis the fault of Teva’s management and board, adding: “It is the state’s responsibility to prevent thousands of Israeli families from paying the price for this.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he planned to meet with Kare Schultz, Teva’s chief executive, this week to try and minimize the blow to workers. “We need to do everything possible to prevent the closure of plants in Jerusalem,” Netanyahu said at the outset of a cabinet meeting, adding Teva should remain based in Israel. “It employs thousands of workers,” he said. “It started as an Israeli company and we want it to remain as an Israeli company. We will use various means at our disposal to try and achieve these goals.” He did not elaborate. Schultz said Teva would maintain its headquarters in Israel.

1036,AGN,Strike briefly shuts down Israel over Teva Pharm job cuts,"JERUSALEM, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Israel’s main public-sector labour union went on a half-day strike on Sunday, closing the airport, the stock exchange, banks and all government ministries as part of a protest against mass layoffs planned by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. The debt-ridden Teva, one of Israel’s largest companies and the world’s largest generics drugmaker, last week said it would cut its global workforce by more than a quarter, or 14,000 jobs. Some 1,700 jobs will be cut and a manufacturing site will be closed in Israel, prompting anger from unions and politicians, who believe Teva’s employees should not pay for the company’s failed investments abroad. Sunday is the beginning of the Israeli work week. Hundreds of thousands of workers went on strike until 12:00 pm (1000 GMT) and many held solidarity rallies outside Teva facilities. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange said the trading day would be shortened, opening at 1 pm and closing as usual at about 4:30 pm. All departing flights - mainly from Europe -  at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport between 8 am and at least 12 pm were either cancelled or delayed. Similarly, no flights will be allowed to land until after 12 pm. Trains and buses were initially supposed to strike as well, but the Histadrut labour federation decided to allow public transit to operate so that soldiers could get back to their bases, as they typically do on Sunday mornings. “We are fighting on behalf of Teva’s workers to save Israel’s industry ... and to convey the message that layoffs are the last and not the first step in the public and private sectors,” said Histadrut chief Avi Nissenkorn. He called the current crisis the fault of Teva’s management and board, adding: “It is the state’s responsibility to prevent thousands of Israeli families from paying the price for this.” Saddled with nearly $35 billion in debt since acquiring Allergan’s Actavis generic drug business for $40.5 billion, Teva made a series of changes after Kare Schultz joined as its new chief executive on Nov. 1. Its two-year restructuring plan is intended to reduce Teva’s cost base by $3 billion by the end of 2019, out of an estimated cost base for 2017 of $16.1 billion. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Schultz last week, asking that he keep layoffs in Israel to a minimum. Schultz said Teva would maintain its headquarters in Israel.

1037,AGN,"Allergan, Richter's bipolar depression drug succeeds in key trial","(Reuters) - Allergan Plc and Hungary’s Gedeon Richter Plc said on Monday their drug to treat severe bipolar depression in adults met the main goal of a late-stage study, bringing the them closer to getting another approval for the drug. The drug, cariprazine, sold under the brand name Vraylar, is already approved to treat manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in adults. The late-stage trial was testing two doses of cariprazine - 1.5 mg and 3 mg - in adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder versus a placebo. Bipolar disorder is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy and activity levels that range from depressive lows to manic highs. It affects more than 5.7 million adults each year in the United States, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. The companies said on Monday that both doses of the drug showed a statistically significant improvement in the severity of depressive episodes, as measured on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). MADRS measures sadness, tension, suicidal thoughts and reduction of sleep and appetite in patients. The companies said they would file an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to get an additional approval for the drug in the second half of 2018.

1044,AGN,"Pershing Square, Valeant arrive at settlement split for Allergan lawsuit","(Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square PHS.AS and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) on Friday decided to pay $290 million to settle a lawsuit that accused them of insider trading before bidding for Allergan Plc (AGN.N) in 2014. Pershing Square said it decided to raise its share of the settlement to 66.8 percent, or $193.75 million, in a bid to quickly wind up the litigation, which it claimed had “no merit”.  “We decided, however, that it was in the best interest of our investors to settle the case now instead of continuing to spend substantial time and resources pursuing the litigation,” said Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman.  The hedge fund said Valeant will now pay around 33 percent, or $96.25 million, of the settlement costs. Valeant had previously agreed to pay 60 percent of the costs. “We believe this agreement to resolve the legacy litigation is in the best interests of the Company, because it enables us to focus our attention and resources on the transformation of Valeant,” said Valeant’s Chief Executive Joseph Papa. Papa, who took over the reins of Valeant in April 2016, has been trying to reshape the company and regain investor confidence, after a flurry of investigations into the Canadian drugmaker’s accounting and pricing practices hit its shares. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of investors who sold Allergan shares in the two months before Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant made an unsolicited $51 billion bid for Allergan. reut.rs/2DwW6XN Actavis Plc eventually bought Allergan in 2015, taking its name. Both Pershing Square and Valeant did not immediately respond to emails seeking comments.

1048,AGN,"Allergan to cut over 1,000 jobs as it works to cut costs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Botox-maker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) on Wednesday said it plans to cut over 1,000 jobs, more than 5 percent of its workforce, and eliminate an additional 400 currently open positions, as it works to cut costs in the face of new competition for its second most important drug, dry-eye treatment Restasis.  The company said the jobs and positions it plans to eliminate mostly focus on products and categories where the company has or expects to soon lose exclusivity. The drugmaker said it expects to take a $125 million charge from the job cuts, primarily due to severance, most of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.  Analysts estimated that the company had around $5.8 billion of net income in 2017 on roughly $15.9 billion of revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It said cost savings from this restructuring program should be around $300 million to $400 million per year. Allergan currently employs 18,000 people, according to its website. RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said the savings should add around 75 cents to $1 of earnings per share support going forward. In November, the company said it was working on a program to expand its base business and reduce costs so it could return to earnings growth by 2019, but did not disclose a specific strategy at that point. Allergan worked hard in recent years to protect Restasis, which generated about $1.5 billion in sales in 2016, from generic rivals. It struck a controversial deal with a Native American tribe in September to shield review of the patents by U.S. regulators, drawing the ire of lawmakers and rival drug companies. But in October, a Texas federal judge invalidated Restasis patents on grounds that they cover ideas that are obvious, making it possible for rival generics to hit the market as early as next year. Allergan has appealed the ruling. Shares of Allergan rose $1.02, or 0.6 percent, to $171.34 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

1065,AGN,FDA approves Allergan's Avycaz for two types of pneumonia,"Feb 1 (Reuters) - Allergan Plc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the drugmaker’s antibiotic Avycaz to treat two types of pneumonia caused by drug-resistant bacteria. The decision comes after a successful late-stage study testing the drug on adults with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP). HABP and VABP are serious bacterial infections that occur in hospitalized patients who are associated with critically ill and vulnerable populations. Avycaz was first approved in 2015 to treat adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections in combination with metronidazole. Last year, the drug was also approved to treat complicated urinary tract infections including kidney infections.

1072,AGN,"Allergan completes restructuring, pushes hard in China","PARIS (Reuters) - Botox-maker Allergan (AGN.N) has embarked on a big push in China where it plans to hire 200 additional staff this year and will also be on the lookout for potential acquisitions in the country, a senior executive told Reuters on Friday. The drugmaker is about to complete a restructuring in which more than 1,000 staff will leave the company, more than 5 percent of its current workforce, as it faces a drop in revenues coming from new competition for its second most important drug, dry-eye treatment Restasis. Speaking on the sidelines of aesthetic and cosmetic dermatology congress IMCAS in Paris, Allergan’s Executive Vice President in charge of international operations Marc Princen said Allergan was eyeing annual sales of around $500 million in China by 2022. The company recorded sales of around $180 million there last year, he said. “At this point in time, 80 percent of our sales are in the U.S and 20 percent abroad. Over the next five years, we will bring the 20 percent to 30 percent,” Princen said in an interview. “The focus will be on high potential must-win markets, for example China. We have added 300 staff there in 2017 and we grew  revenues by 60 percent. We will add another 200 this year,” he said. Princen said his team had identified 12 key markets outside the United States. Among them China, Brazil, Russia as well as  European countries such as France, Italy, Germany and Spain. “I am a strong believer in mainland Europe for instance. We can have double-digit growth there by doing the right things. At the moment, in Europe, we have growth of around between 7-8 percent, it will grow...” he said. The executive said the company, which has recently bought Zeltiq Aesthetics for $2.48 billion, had many options to grow out of its own resources but that other acquisitions would also be considered. “What we are not going to do : mega deals. We will not go into that. But we will buy early stage-products that we will develop and market further, the closer they are to launch, the better,” he said without giving further details. “I will not go country by country on M&A.; I would say though mainland Europe is important as well as Asia.” Princen said 90 percent of the job cuts announced in November were completed. “If we look at the proportion, its 800 departures in the U.S and 200 outside the U.S,” he said. The company is due to publish its annual results on Feb.6. ",2022018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-strategy/allergan-completes-restructuring-pushes-hard-in-china-idUSKBN1FM2JJ

1075,AGN,Allergan's profit beats; migraine drug succeeds in key study,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on robust demand for Botox, boosted its earnings forecast and announced positive data on one of the two migraine treatments it is developing. Shares jumped 3 percent in early trading to $169.77 on a day of chaotic activity in the broader U.S. stock market.  Wall Street is focused on the company’s drugs pipeline as it faces new cheaper competition for its Restasis eye treatment and its Namenda XR for Alzheimer’s disease. The company sold its generic drug business in 2016, leaving its operations about split between aesthetic products and various drugs. Allergan forecast earnings for 2018 in the range of $15.25 to $16.00 per share, excluding items. Analysts, on average, expect $15.50 after the company previously projected earnings of at least $15.25 per share. The company said its tax rate would rise to about 14 percent in 2018, reflecting a new U.S. corporate tax law that has set a fresh minimum for companies. Because the company is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, it has traditionally paid a lower tax rate than its U.S-based counterparts. Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders said on a conference call the company expects to maintain a step-back approach to mergers and acquisitions this year. “2018 will most likely be a relatively boring year for Allergan on the M&A; front,” Saunders said. Data on the drug Ubrogepant - a pill used to treat migraine episodes - came a bit earlier than analysts expected and was positive. The company expects two more studies before it submits the drug for regulatory approval next year. The treatment belongs to a class of migraine drugs being developed by rivals such as Eli Lilly, Amgen and Alder Biopharmaceuticals that target a protein associated with pain signaling called CGRP. Botox sales jumped nearly 17 percent to $864.3 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, above consensus estimates of $778.20 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of dry-eye drug Restasis rose nearly 1 percent to $414.9 million, ahead of estimates of $388.6 million. Allergan recorded a gain of about $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, related to recent changes in U.S. tax law. Net profit was $3.05 billion, or $8.88 per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $70.2 million, or $0.20 per share, a year earlier.

1087,AGN,U.S. patent court deals setback to Allergan's Restasis strategy,"(Reuters) - A U.S. administrative court said it has the authority to decide the validity of patents Allergan Plc transferred to a Native American tribe, dealing a setback to a strategy the company adopted to protect one of its best-selling medicines from generic competition. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board, a court run by the U.S. patent office, declined on Friday a request to dismiss litigation brought by the generic drug company Mylan NV challenging the validity of Allergan’s patents on its dry eye medicine Restasis. In September Allergan transferred its patents covering Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, arguing that the New York-based tribe’s status as a sovereign entity meant the patents could not be reviewed by the board because of a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity.  “The PTAB’s ruling reinforces our belief that Allergan’s maneuvers to engage the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe for patent protection were a sham,” Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch said in a statement. Allergan declined to comment. Allergan holds patents covering various elements of Restasis that expire in 2024. Rivals were blocked from launching their own versions of the drug until the patents expired or were invalidated in court. In 2016 Mylan asked the patent board to invalidate the Restasis patents, saying they described obvious ideas. Mylan also asked a federal judge in Texas to invalidate the patents. The tribe agreed in September to take legal ownership of the patents and license them back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments. After announcing the deal the tribe asked the patent board to dismiss the Mylan challenge, saying entities with sovereign immunity cannot face litigation without their consent. Allergan has said the patent board is a flawed and unfair forum. The drug company said it would not object to the patents being reviewed in federal court. U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have criticized Allergan’s maneuver, with one U.S. senator introducing a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty. The patent board said in Friday’s ruling that tribal immunity does not apply to patent review proceedings.  The tribunal also said Allergan had retained an ownership interest in the challenged patents so the proceedings could continue without the tribe’s participation. In October the federal judge in Texas invalidated the Restasis patents instead of waiting for the board to rule, rendering Allergan’s move largely meaningless.

1095,AGN,Biohaven plunges as investors pit migraine data against Allergan's drug,"(Reuters) - Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding said its treatment for acute migraine cleared two late-stage studies, but investors worried about its commercial viability as the efficacy data failed to distinguish from Allergan’s rival treatment. Shares plunged as much as 33 percent to touch a record low of $16.51 in early trading on Monday. In February, Allergan reported strong efficacy data for its migraine treatment, ubrogepant.         A late entrant to the competitive arena of migraine treatments, Connecticut-based Biohaven’s rimegepant is part of a new class of medicines called CGRP receptor antagonists. Analysts said data from Biohaven’s studies showed the oral drug is much safer than Allergan’s. However, comparing the efficacy of the two drugs is complicated given the differences in placebo rates and an extra dose given after two hours in Allergan’s trial. “The bad news is that the efficacy profile will be debated given the limited 2 hour effect and is likely to lead investors to discount the commercial potential,” Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison said in a client note. The company highlighted the treatment’s strong safety profile and noted that the lack of a second “rescue” dose would be a key selling point with patients and insurers.  “We have the dosing correct ... patients do not need to chase it with another second dose, they don’t need to chase it with other rescue meds,” Biohaven’s Chief Executive officer Vladimir Coric said in a conference call with analysts.  Biohaven, which went public in May, is one of several drugmakers looking for a slice of migraine market that is expected to swell to more than $10 billion in 2025 from $3 billion in 2015 in the United States and other developed countries. Companies including Amgen Inc, Teva, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals are in a race to be the first to come out with a drug for a condition that affects 39 million people in the United States.  Given the likely primary care market where these new therapies will be marketed, William Blair’s analyst Tim Lugo said rimegepant’s impressive clean safety profile could be a strong differentiator versus Allergan’s treatment. Biohaven, which is also developing treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, said it plans to file marketing application for its migraine treatment in 2019.

1109,AGN,UPDATE 5-Shire rejects $63 bln Takeda bid as Allergan drops pursuit,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Rare disease drug maker Shire Plc (SHP.L) said on Thursday it had rejected a $63 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer by Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T), while Allergan Plc (AGN.N) reversed course on pursuing a rival bid.  The high-stakes drama underscores the surge in dealmaking this year in the pharmaceutical sector, as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. An acquisition of Shire by Takeda would be by far the biggest acquisition of a drug company year-to-date. Botox-maker Allergan confirmed on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire after Reuters reported on its interest, sending its shares down 7 percent. Later on Thursday, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders decided to drop his pursuit of London-listed Shire after receiving pushback from some of his shareholders, who were concerned about the company overstretching its resources, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not be identified discussing confidential talks. Allergan then issued a second announcement stating it did not intend to make an offer for Shire. Dublin-based Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $52 billion, had $30 billion in debt as of the end of December, the legacy of a string of acquisitions. This has weighed on Allergan’s ability to carry out big acquisitions.  Allergan’s exploration of a bid for Shire was part of its wider strategic review, Allergan said in a statement. This review is currently unlikely to lead either to a major acquisition or a breakup of the company, one of the sources said. Reuters also first reported on Thursday that Takeda had made a cash-and-stock offer of 46.50 pounds ($66.20) a share for Shire. This prompted both companies to confirm the move and announce that Shire had rejected it, although their negotiations are continuing. Buying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. It would be Weber’s boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda’s position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in drugs to treat hyperactivity. But it would be a big financial stretch since Shire, with a market value of more than 34 billion pounds ($48.3 billion), is worth a lot more than Japan’s biggest drugmaker, which has a market capitalization of 4.1 trillion yen ($31 billion). An acquisition of Shire would have given Allergan heft in the rare diseases space at a time when Saunders is seeking to cement its status as a purveyor of innovative drugs. Saunders’ plans to sell Allergan to Pfizer for $160 billion were scuppered two years ago after the U.S. Treasury changed the rules on corporate tax inversions.  Saunders “was a huge deal guy and everyone was kind of waiting for the next big deal,” said Kevin Kedra, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of both Allergan and Shire. If there was to be a big share component to a deal it would have to come before a vote of shareholders, he noted. “Shareholders seem to be voting this morning,” Kedra said. Takeda said it would remain disciplined in its approach and intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment-grade credit rating, adding that: “Discussions between the parties regarding a potential offer are ongoing.”     Shire confirmed it had received three conditional proposals from Takeda, but said they significantly undervalued the company’s growth prospects and drugs in development. Takeda’s latest 46.50 pounds offer was made on April 12 and comprised 17.75 pounds in cash, which would be paid in U.S. dollars, and 28.75 pounds worth of new Takeda shares. Shire said that valued it at approximately 44 billion pounds ($62.6 billion), based on total issued and to be issued share capital. The two earlier cash-and-share offers were worth 44 and 45.50 pounds per share, respectively. Under UK takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to make a firm offer or walk away, after it said last month it was considering a bid. Based on Takeda’s market capitalization, Shire shareholders would end up owning approximately 51 percent of the enlarged group, Shire noted. Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia said Shire was likely to be pushing for a larger cash component in current talks but Takeda was already stretched, suggesting the chances of a deal being consummated were still “reasonably risky.” Shire has been under pressure in the past 12 months, with its shares down by a third before Takeda’s interest was made public, due to greater competition from generic drugs and debts from its $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016. Shire said in January it would run its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) business, which consists mainly of its blockbuster drug Vyvanse, separately and possibly seek a separate listing. Earlier this week it struck a deal to sell its cancer drugs for $2.4 billion to unlisted French group Servier.

1114,AGN,UPDATE 4-Japan's Takeda sweetens $62 billion Shire offer,"TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical nudged up its offer for Shire to 44.3 billion pounds ($62 billion) on Friday to try to persuade the rare-disease drugs specialist into talks after it rejected three previous proposals. Japan’s biggest drugmaker increased its potential cash and shares bid to 47 pounds a share, up 1 percent from its previous proposal of 46.50 pounds. It also lifted the cash component by 3.25 pounds to 21 pounds a share, a shift that analysts said was needed to appeal to Shire’s shareholders. Shire said it was considering the new approach. The latest proposal is 7 percent above Takeda’s first offer and 58 percent above London-listed Shire’s share price prior to any takeover speculation, the Japanese firm said. But Shire’s shares were trading at 38.42 pounds on Friday, well below the latest approach and down 3 percent on the day after another company, Allergan, decided not to pursue its own bid on Thursday, ending the prospect of a battle. Botox-maker Allergan had seen its shares fall 7 percent after Reuters reported its interest. Investors in Takeda are also cautious. Its shares lost almost 5 percent of their value on Friday as investors fretted over the Japanese firm making a record-breaking purchase of the London-listed company. The drugs industry has seen a flurry of dealmaking across the world, as companies look for scale and for promising new assets to bolster their pipelines. Takeda said it wanted to work with Shire to agree a  recommended deal and to allow an extension to an April 25 deadline imposed by the British regulator to make a firm offer. “Takeda believes that the improved proposal represents a highly compelling opportunity for Shire shareholders, which reflects a further increase in value and a material increase in the cash component of the consideration mix,” it said. Shire, which also makes drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), rejected the previous three approaches, saying they significantly undervalued the company and the drugs it has in development. Buying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. It would be Weber’s boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda’s position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster haemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in ADHD drugs.  But it would be a financial stretch since Shire is worth a lot more than Takeda, which has a market capitalization of 4.1 trillion yen ($31 billion). Based on Takeda’s current market value, Shire shareholders would own approximately 49 percent of the enlarged company should the latest proposal be accepted.

1115,AGN,European shares mark fourth week of gains; Ericsson shines,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares held steady on Friday at the end of a strong week as a rally in commodities softened, although strong earnings updates boosted shares in Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Telia (TELIA.ST). The pan-European STOXX 600  index ended the session flat in percentage terms but remained up 0.7 percent on the week, its fourth straight week of gains, as global markets recovered from a turbulent first quarter. Jitters over possible trade wars, faster rate hikes in the United States and a regulatory crackdown on big tech groups sent the STOXX to 14-month lows in March.  But since April the index has been on a recovery path as those worries receded and investors were lured back into equities by cheaper company valuations. While moves were largely muted at the index level on Friday, Ericsson surged 17.5 percent and posted its biggest one-day gain since October 2002 after the Swedish mobile equipment maker reported first-quarter earnings and its gross margin above market expectations as cost savings from job cuts started to kick in.  Its gains drove shares in rival Nokia (NOKIA.HE) up 2.4 percent. “The big jump in profitability provides evidence that Ericsson’s efforts at cost reduction, addressing loss making contracts and investing in R&D; is paying off,” Liberum analysts led by Janardan Menon said in a note. However, they confirmed their ‘hold’ rating on the stock, saying overall operating margins continued to be low in an unpredictable industry environment.  Cost-cutting has been a key driver for earnings growth in Europe and could also help first quarter results. Companies on the MSCI EMU index .dMIEM00000PEU are expected to see earnings rising around 15 percent in dollar terms last quarter.     Elsewhere, dovish remarks overnight from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney weakened the pound, helping the internationally exposed FTSE .FTSE index outperform with a gain of 0.5 percent. The index weathered a 2.8 percent fall in Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) following another poor update that further stresses gloomy prospects for consumer goods makers. Shares in Shire (SHP.L) were the worst FTSE performers, down nearly 4 percent after Botox maker Allergan (AGN.N) walked away from a bid for the rare-disease drugs specialist. On Friday, Japan’s Takeda (4502.T) increased its offer for the rare-disease drugs specialist to 47 pounds-a-share. Shire has rejected Takeda’s previous three offers. Back in earnings, Telia was an outstanding gainer, up 8.6 percent, after the Nordics telecoms group announced a welcome share buyback plan as first-quarter core earnings slightly topped market expectations. But ASM International (ASMI.AS) dropped 8.4 percent after the supplier of wafer processing equipment for the semiconductor manufacturing industry reported a bigger than expected fall in gross margins. Shares in Metro (B4B.DE) were the biggest fallers, down 10.8 percent after the German retailer lowered its earnings outlook due to weak performance at its Russian operations.

1120,AGN,Shire rejects $63 billion Takeda bid as Allergan drops pursuit,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Rare disease drug maker Shire Plc (SHP.L) said on Thursday it had rejected a $63 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer by Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T), while Allergan Plc (AGN.N) reversed course on pursuing a rival bid.  The high-stakes drama underscores the surge in dealmaking this year in the pharmaceutical sector, as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. An acquisition of Shire by Takeda would be by far the biggest acquisition of a drug company year-to-date. Botox-maker Allergan confirmed on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire after Reuters reported on its interest, sending its shares down 7 percent. Later on Thursday, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders decided to drop his pursuit of London-listed Shire after receiving pushback from some of his shareholders, who were concerned about the company overstretching its resources, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not be identified discussing confidential talks. Allergan then issued a second announcement stating it did not intend to make an offer for Shire. Dublin-based Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $52 billion, had $30 billion in debt as of the end of December, the legacy of a string of acquisitions. This has weighed on Allergan’s ability to carry out big acquisitions.  Allergan’s exploration of a bid for Shire was part of its wider strategic review, Allergan said in a statement. This review is currently unlikely to lead either to a major acquisition or a breakup of the company, one of the sources said. Reuters also first reported on Thursday that Takeda had made a cash-and-stock offer of 46.50 pounds ($66.20) a share for Shire. This prompted both companies to confirm the move and announce that Shire had rejected it, although their negotiations are continuing. Buying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. It would be Weber’s boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda’s position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in drugs to treat hyperactivity. But it would be a big financial stretch since Shire, with a market value of more than 34 billion pounds ($48.3 billion), is worth a lot more than Japan’s biggest drugmaker, which has a market capitalization of 4.1 trillion yen ($31 billion). An acquisition of Shire would have given Allergan heft in the rare diseases space at a time when Saunders is seeking to cement its status as a purveyor of innovative drugs. Saunders’ plans to sell Allergan to Pfizer for $160 billion were scuppered two years ago after the U.S. Treasury changed the rules on corporate tax inversions.  Saunders “was a huge deal guy and everyone was kind of waiting for the next big deal,” said Kevin Kedra, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of both Allergan and Shire. If there was to be a big share component to a deal it would have to come before a vote of shareholders, he noted. “Shareholders seem to be voting this morning,” Kedra said. Takeda said it would remain disciplined in its approach and intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment-grade credit rating, adding that: “Discussions between the parties regarding a potential offer are ongoing.”     Shire confirmed it had received three conditional proposals from Takeda, but said they significantly undervalued the company’s growth prospects and drugs in development. Takeda’s latest 46.50 pounds offer was made on April 12 and comprised 17.75 pounds in cash, which would be paid in U.S. dollars, and 28.75 pounds worth of new Takeda shares. Shire said that valued it at approximately 44 billion pounds ($62.6 billion), based on total issued and to be issued share capital. The two earlier cash-and-share offers were worth 44 and 45.50 pounds per share, respectively. Under UK takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to make a firm offer or walk away, after it said last month it was considering a bid. Based on Takeda’s market capitalization, Shire shareholders would end up owning approximately 51 percent of the enlarged group, Shire noted. Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia said Shire was likely to be pushing for a larger cash component in current talks but Takeda was already stretched, suggesting the chances of a deal being consummated were still “reasonably risky.” Shire has been under pressure in the past 12 months, with its shares down by a third before Takeda’s interest was made public, due to greater competition from generic drugs and debts from its $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016. Shire said in January it would run its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) business, which consists mainly of its blockbuster drug Vyvanse, separately and possibly seek a separate listing. Earlier this week it struck a deal to sell its cancer drugs for $2.4 billion to unlisted French group Servier.

1122,AGN,Allergan migraine drug succeeds in second late-stage trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Plc on Friday announced positive results from a second Phase III trial for the 50 milligram dose of its drug for acute migraine, reproducing results from the previous trial. A lower dose of the drug, ubrogepant, failed to meet one of the study’s two main goals, the company said. Wall Street is focused on the company’s pipeline of drugs in development as Allergan faces new, cheaper competition for its Restasis eye treatment and Namenda XR for Alzheimer’s disease. Allergan has said that it believes the migraine drug could reasonably bring in $500 million a year. In February, the drug company reported positive results for the 50 and 100mg doses of the pill in another late-stage trial. This trial backs up those results for the 50mg dose, David Nicholson, Allergan’s Chief Research and Development Officer said in an interview. “You have to show that a drug reproducibly demonstrates benefit in the population that you intend to treat. We now have two adequate and well controlled studies clearly demonstrating the benefit of ubrogepant in the acute treatment of migraine,” Nicholson said. In the trial of more than 1,300 patients, 21.8 percent were pain-free two hours after taking the 50mg dose versus 14.3 percent on placebo. About 39 percent in the 50mg group also reported the absence of their most bothersome symptom (MBS), such as nausea or sensitivity to light or sound, compared with 27.4 percent for placebo. Both results were deemed statistically significant. The 25mg dose, while providing pain relief, was not significantly better than placebo on the MBS measure. The treatment belongs to a class of migraine drugs also being developed by Eli Lilly, Amgen and Alder Biopharmaceuticals that target a protein associated with pain signaling called CGRP. Some of these are injected therapies designed to prevent chronic migraines. Ubrogepant is intended to relieve migraine pain and other symptoms after their onset. Allergan said it is still on track to file for U.S. approval next year, and believes it will be the first oral CGRP on the market. It has two longer-term safety studies to complete this year. There have been some concerns about liver toxicity with drugs in this class. Allergan is confident that its drug does not cause liver problems for patients. “We have no reason to believe that ubrogepant has any propensity to induce liver injury,” Nicholson said.

1124,AGN,"Allergan CEO opposes fundamental shift in strategy, shares fall","(Reuters) - Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) chief executive on Monday said he was opposed to fundamental changes to the drug company’s business strategy, even as its board considers drastic moves like splitting the company, selling off assets or doing deals to turn around a steep drop in its share price. Botox maker Allergan’s shares fell 4.2 percent to $155.16 in late-morning trading, and are down more than a third over the last year. The company announced a strategic review of its business earlier this year. CEO Brent Saunders said in March the declining stock price required the company to look at all options “with a sense of urgency.”  Allergan has hired multiple advisers, Saunders said on a Monday conference call following the company’s quarterly earnings. It is considering five options: deploying capital to buy back shares, doing divestitures, splitting the company, making acquisitions, or continuing to operate Allergan as is. Investors hoping for a major shift in strategy may be disappointed. “Running the company in large part as it exists today is not only an option, but also the baseline against which all options need to be considered,” Saunders said on the call, noting that his preliminary view was that a fundamental shift was unnecessary. “We’re not going to execute an activity that doesn’t recognize the full inherent value of our assets at Allergan.” Saunders’ comments on the conference call “add risk that a ‘do nothing’ option or (the) resumption of bolt-on deals could be the answer” for Allergan, RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said in a research note. “We would expect push-back from investors if either were the case.” Large, transformational deals certainly seem off the table. Earlier this month, Allergan confirmed it was considering a bid for rare disease drug maker Shire Plc (SHP.L) after Reuters reported on its interest. However, the company put out a second statement hours later stating it did not intend to make an offer. But Saunders said in an interview that these kinds of deals are a “very low priority and a very unlikely outcome” of the review. BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED EARNINGS Allergan reported a better-than-expected first quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, driven by higher sales of its medical aesthetics products including blockbuster wrinkle treatment Botox. Sales of Botox, its best selling drug, jumped 14.5 percent to $817.3 million in the quarter. The company’s aesthetics unit posted a near 30 percent jump in sales. U.S. Sales of Allergan’s eye drug, Restasis, which is expected to face competition from cheaper drugs, fell 17.2 percent.  The company now expects 2018 adjusted earnings of $15.65 to $16.25 per share, slightly above its previous forecast. Its net loss was $332.5 million, or 99 cents per share, narrowing from a $2.63 billion loss, or $7.86 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Allergan reported a profit of $3.74 per share, topping analysts’ average expectation of $3.36, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 2.8 percent to $3.67 billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $3.59 billion.

The healthcare sector, which dropped 1.2 percent, weighed most heavily on the S&P; 500. Shares of Allergan plc fell 4.8 percent after the company’s chief executive said he was opposed to fundamental changes to the drug company’s business strategy. Celgene Corp shares fell 3.8 percent. Morgan Stanley said it expects a delay of up to three years for Celgene’s key multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod. Oil prices rallied after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had lied about not pursuing nuclear weapons and had expanded its nuclear weapons knowledge after signing a 2015 deal with global powers. U.S. President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on Iran. Oil has risen this month to the highest since late 2014, driven by concerns over potential disruptions to Iranian crude flows. Even as companies’ quarterly results have come in strong, their earnings calls have raised concerns that rising commodity prices may pinch profit margins in the future. Some investors suggested that on balance, the strong earnings season has not been enough for U.S. stocks to break out of their recent trading range. “The earnings are priced in,” said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. “There’s not a whole lot of reason to buy. We’re stuck in the mud right now.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 91.88 points, or 0.38 percent, to 24,219.31, the S&P; 500 lost 16.39 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,653.52 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 41.54 points, or 0.58 percent, to 7,078.26. The energy index, up 0.1 percent, was the only sector within the S&P; 500 in positive territory. Earlier in the session, U.S. stocks were helped as data on U.S. income and spending kept broader inflation worries in check. U.S. personal income rose 0.3 percent in March, compared with expectations of 0.4 percent. On the consumption side, personal spending in February was revised lower to 0.3 percent, instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent. McDonald’s Corp shares jumped 5.0 percent after the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue topped analysts’ forecasts for profit and sales. Shares of T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp sank on worries that the two companies’ $26 billion merger would face regulatory challenges. Sprint shares tumbled 14.5 percent, and T-Mobile shares dropped 6.2 percent. Arconic Inc shares fell 20.2 percent after the aluminum products maker slashed its 2018 forecasts. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.84-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 49 new highs and 36 new lows.
