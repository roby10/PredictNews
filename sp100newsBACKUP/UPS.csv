The rate increase, effective Aug. 1, follows similar rate increases by other transportation and logistics companies including United Parcel Service’s (UPS.N) freight division for certain shipments. [ID:nN1E7600A4].   Con-way said the increase would apply to LTL rates, minimum charges and on deliveries that require additional equipment or are out of the ordinary and move within the United States and Canada, as well as cross-border between the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada.   Con-way Freight operates 9,000 tractors and 25,000 freight trailers.

3,UPS,"USPS to study 3,600 post offices for closure"," * USPS to look at 3,600 offices in cost-cutting attempt   * Agency has not said how many will close -regulator   * 60 post offices closed since Jan. 1   By Emily Stephenson   WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service is set to review thousands of post offices for possible closure as part of the agency’s ongoing struggle to cut costs.   The Postal Service is expected to release next week a list of about 3,600 post offices, stations and branches that will be considered for potential consolidation, said Ann Fisher, director of public affairs at the agency’s regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission.   Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe also will discuss a new concept for replacing post offices, according to a Postal Service advisory.   A spokesman for the agency declined to comment on the review but said offices studied would not necessarily close.   “We only know right now how many they plan to review, but we have no idea how many of those they’ll ultimately close,” Fisher said.   The mail carrier has been struggling for years to counter falling mail volumes and competition from FedEx (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service (UPS.N).   The Postal Service, which receives no tax revenue, reported a $2.2 billion net loss in its second quarter and said it might be unable to pay its debts by September. [ID:nN10127971]   The agency in March said it planned to close about 2,000 post offices around the country by March 2012 and would cut 7,500 jobs. [ID:nN24148639]   The Postal Service has closed 60 post offices and placed 98 under suspension in 2011, Fisher said in an email.   The agency, which has struggled with growing employee costs in addition to eroding business, last month suspended some payments to retirement funds to save cash. [ID:nN1E75L0NR]   The Postal Service has repeatedly asked Congress to give it more flexibility to handle its finances.   Senator Susan Collins in February introduced legislation that would reduce the agency’s payments to pension funds and improve its contracting practices.   Representative Darrell Issa in June proposed cutting Saturday delivery and giving the agency more authority to close post offices and mail processing centers. His bill also would create an oversight board to help reduce costs.

4,UPS,"Feeling the heat on debt, earnings","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City may be frying in near record temperatures but Wall Street has been feeling the heat for months. Wrangling over the debt ceiling and questions marks over corporate earnings mean markets are unlikely to get a break any time soon.  Wall Street is set to close its worst three months in a year as July draws to a close next week after a roller coaster ride for markets. Whacked out fund managers hitting the beach in August may find themselves fiddling with their BlackBerrys more than the little umbrella in their cocktails.  “I need a vacation, man. After all the stuff that’s happened in the last three months I’m pretty much shot, I’m getting weird, even my six-year-old looks at me,” said one New Jersey-based fund manager, who was packing his bags for a destination in the Caribbean as temperatures topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City.  With euro zone leaders having reached a deal for yet another bailout for debt-laden Greece, investors will be free to chew over the rancor in Washington with even more attention.  Negotiations between President Barack Obama and the top Republican in the House of Representatives, John Boehner, still looked far from a deal to avert a looming U.S. default, lawmakers said on Friday, raising the likelihood of more volatility next week if no solution is reached over the weekend.  “It’s likely an agreement in any form will cause a relief rally for equities,” said Glenn Starkman, global head of sales trading at Dahlman Rose in New York.  “Coming on the heels of overall pretty good earnings numbers and some sort of resolution in Greece and that could make for a rally in the market,” he said.  But on the other side of the coin, the prolonged and partisan dispute over solving the country’s debt crisis means there is still a big downside risk.  “Who knows where that is going to go,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global in Chicago. “We’re vulnerable to a buyers’ strike if we don’t get any news.”  In addition, the corporate earnings season suggests other risks could dog the market. Despite generally good results so far, there have been some worrisome signs. The S&P 500 rallied 6 percent in the run-up to reporting season, but earnings misses from big industrial names like Rockwell Collins and Caterpillar Inc weighed on the Dow and S&P 500 on Friday.  Earlier in the week several big consumer names such as Whirlpool and Pepsi warned about sluggishness in developed markets, sending their shares sharply lower.  “The market still has a high degree of skepticism in it,” said Kalivas, summing up the earnings season so far.  Kalivas said he will be closely following earnings from sector and economic bellwethers next week. Those include the package delivery company UPS, chipmaker Texas Instruments, and online retailer Amazon.  Around 30 percent of the S&P 500’s $12.3 trillion market cap have reported earnings so far. They have outpaced consensus estimates by 3.8 percent, and only 7 percent have missed estimates, according to data from Morgan Stanley.  But share prices of those that have fallen short of estimates have taken a severe beating. Given the fragile sentiment a few more prominent misses could derail the market.  “The market is punishing these misses more than it is rewarding beats, an asymmetry we have been calling for and we forecast will continue,” wrote Morgan Stanley’s U.S. equity strategist Adam Parker in a note to clients.  “Our view remains that first half of the year numbers are achievable but the second half of the year looks challenged,” he said.  Next week is also a big week for economic data. Fears of a slowdown in the economy have been a large driver of market volatility over the last few months, and the coming releases will be parsed very closely.  They include early regional manufacturing data from Chicago and New York, a reading of consumer sentiment, and a first reading of U.S. growth for the second quarter, expected to show the economy grew just 1.9 percent in the period.  Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, one of the world’s largest fund managers with around $1.6 trillion of equities under management, said this week that the U.S. economy is at a critical juncture.  Doll points out that since 1960 everytime year-on-year growth has fallen under 2 percent the U.S. economy has gone into recession.  “Our bottom line view is that investors should maintain a reasonably constructive bias toward risk assets, but should also be prepared to scale back exposure if evidence of economic growth acceleration does not materialize,” said Doll.

6,UPS,Wall St Week Ahead: Markets edgy on debt talk stalemate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Much of the United States may be frying in near-record temperatures but Wall Street has been feeling the heat for months. Wrangling over the debt ceiling has kept markets on edge, and investors are still waiting for a breakthrough that leads to a deal to avoid a devastating default.  Investors have viewed as extremely unlikely the possibility of a U.S. default if the federal government does not agree to raise the debt ceiling. But the odds are growing, and Congress and the White House remained at odds just a few hours before Asian markets opened on Monday.  “Unless during the course of the day there is a specific, concrete proposal that placates the market before Asian markets open, the worst-case scenario is that the markets just sell off — sell off dramatically,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  White House officials and Republican leaders scrambled on Sunday to reassure global markets the United States would avert a debt default, but the two sides gave no sign they were moving closer to a deal.  White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley warned that there would be a “few stressful days” ahead for financial markets, with the deadline to lift the $14.3 trillion U.S. borrowing limit now only nine days away.  “To some degree the outcome of there being no deal has been priced in, but the discounting is not fully in the market and this is adding to uncertainty that has already been coupled with the events in Europe and expectations that growth was already going to be weak,” Krosby said.

8,UPS,COLUMN-LNG poised to become a transportation fuel: Kimmerle,"  — Chris Kimmerle is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.—   By Chris Kimmerle   NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Across the United States, more than 11,000 transit buses, nearly 4,000 refuse trucks, over 3,000 school buses, 15,000 to 17,000 medium-duty vehicles and more than 30,000 light-duty vehicles in federal, state, local government and private fleets are already gas-fuelled, according to the Natural Gas Vehicles for America.   Most consume compressed natural gas (CNG) but liquefied natural gas (LNG) is slowly gaining momentum as a replacement for diesel in heavy truck and bus fleets.   LNG is produced by cooling and storing natural gas at minus 260 Fahrenheit (minus 162 Celsius). The result is a liquid that occupies about 1/600 of the volume of pipeline-quality gas on an energy equivalent basis. Under current market conditions, natural gas is less expensive then diesel, and gas-fueled vehicles have lower tailpipe particulate and carbon emissions.   The emergence of CNG and now LNG as transportation fuels is rooted in the growing gap between crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices, but now legislative and regulatory initiatives combined with long-term prospects for an abundant gas supply are stimulating further investment in LNG vehicles and fueling facilities.   Despite its potential advantages, the move to increased used of LNG as a transportation fuel will be evolutionary and is unlikely to disrupt the North American natural gas market over the near to midterm.   The Energy Information Agency has identified only 44 LNG vehicle fueling stations (35 in California, four in Texas, two in Utah, and the remainder in Alabama, Arizona and Connecticut) as of June 2011. Most are dedicated to private fleets thus discouraging wider industry acceptance.   The transition to LNG-fueled trucks involves some significant corporations, including Cummings Westport, Daimler Trucks North America, Detroit Diesel, Freightliner, Kenworth, Mack, Navistar (NAV.N), Peterbilt, Volvo North America (VOLVb.ST), Republic Services (RSG.N), United Parcel Service (UPS.N), Wal-Mart (WMT.N), and Waste Management (WM.N).   On the supply side are Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE.O), Air Products & Chemicals (APD.N), the Linde Group (LING.DE) and Southeast LNG. Each has a different business model: (1) In April, Encana Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Encana Corp (ECA.TO) announced an agreement to use its mobile LNG stations to provide fueling services for Heckmann Water Resources, a firm involved in delivering water to Encana and other gas exploration and production companies in northwestern Louisiana. In addition, Encana plans to build additional fixed-base public LNG fueling stations in Louisiana. [ID:nN05154332] (2) In the west, Boone Pickens’ Clean Energy Fuels is the dominant LNG supplier to truck fleets. It owns and operates production facilities in Texas and California capable of producing 260,000 gallons per day and is planning to expand production to 340,000 gallons per day as demand increases. On July 11, Chesapeake Energy (CHK.N) announced its intent to provide $150 million in financial support to Clean Energy’s continued expansion. [ID:nN1E76A1PL] The funds will be dispersed over three years and take the form of convertible debt to be used for the construction of 150 LNG fueling facilities along the interstate highway system. The Chesapeake/Clean Energy initiative is a step to moving LNG from a niche market serving hub and spoke fleet operators to the broader long-haul truck market. (3) Southeast LNG, a joint venture between AGL Resources AGL.N and El Paso Corp EP.N, is also positioning to enter the LNG market. El Paso is the owner of the Elba Island (Louisiana) LNG import terminal while AGL holds LNG peak shaving capacity, used to meet peak day demands of its existing gas distribution systems, in Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and New Jersey. Their business model looks to leverage the value of their existing infrastructure by trucking LNG to new fleet fueling stations in the southeast. (4) The Linde Group is a major international liquid gas producer. Linde has developed world-scale base load LNG production facilities, small to mid-scale base load and peak shaving operations as well as floating production storage and offloading vessels. Now it is considering the deployment of pocket size liquefaction plants at truck fueling stations. To date, Linde is involved in joint ventures with Waste Management to convert landfill gas into a LNG truck fuel.   Using LNG in the transport sector has significant policy implications — for national security, the balance of trade and environmental policy.   The transportation sector consumed 28 percent of total U.S. energy demand of 94.6 quadrillion Btu in 2009. Within the sector, light-duty vehicles account for 59 percent of demand followed by freight trucks (16 percent) and air 10 percent. (PDF of transportation sector: r.reuters.com/daz72s)   Federal and state initiatives have the potential to drive substantial changes in the transportation fuel mix.    California has led the western states into the LNG age through its low carbon fuel standards and a suite of economic incentives. Now, according to NGVAmerica, 24 states have either recently enacted or are in the process of passing legislation supporting the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel.   At federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration are establishing greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption standards for heavy-duty vehicles. The new standards will apply to combination tractors, heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans as well as vocational vehicles. If implemented, new emission standards will accelerate the transition from oil to cleaner burning and lower CO2 natural gas.   Continued penetration of LNG and CNG into the transportation fuel market, at the expense of imported oil, could significantly reduce the U.S. trade deficit and reduce dependence on imports from potentially unstable supplies from the Middle East and Africa as well as Venezuela.   But wider uptake of LNG as a transport fuel also faces challenges.   The transition from the existing diesel fleet to LNG is being tempered by a number of factors: truck tractors have a 20-lifecycle; access to private LNG fueling facilities is still limited; new LNG tractors cost $250,000 to $300,000 more than diesel units; maintenance costs are higher; and fuel economy is lower than diesel.   LNG vehicles need pressurized cryogenic fuel tanks that are one-third larger than diesel to maintain equivalent driving ranges. The result is a weight premium of 1,000 to 1,200 lbs over comparable diesel units and an associated reduction in payload in order to comply with highway weight limits.   The evolution of the LNG market will require adoption of uniform standards for design and operation of fueling facilities including risk mitigation standards to address the hazards associated with handling a fuel with a lower flash point than diesel.   Widespread introduction of LNG onto the nation’s highways will require training for first responders called on to deal with a leaking fluid having a temperature of negative 260 F. Existing laws restricting the movement of “hazardous” gas through urban areas and transportation choke points such as bridges and tunnels will also have to be reviewed.   But the biggest impediment to adoption of LNG, for long-haul fleets, is the need to reach a critical mass of public refueling stations and, by extension, the assurance of a competitive fuel market.

9,UPS,WRAPUP 8-Hopes for deal rise as US debt fears infect markets," * Similarities between rival proposals seen as positive   * U.S. likely to lose top credit rating -economists poll   * Banks prepare for U.S. downgrade, see $100 billion cost   * Most Americans want compromise - Reuters/Ipsos poll   * UPS cites debt ceiling crisis for cautious outlook  (Recasts, adds White House hopes for compromise, details, quotes)   By Andy Sullivan and Laura MacInnis   WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - A glimmer of hope emerged on Tuesday for a compromise to break the deadlock over the U.S. debt limit as corporate America and the public betrayed growing nervousness over the risks of a credit downgrade and default.   After weeks of acrimony between Republican and Democratic leaders, similarities between rival deficit reduction plans appeared to offer some chance of a deal before an Aug. 2 deadline for Congress to raise the government’s $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.   While most expect a last-minute accord to avert the first default by the United States, the bitter partisan squabbling and absence of a political consensus on long-term deficit reduction has increased the likelihood of an unprecedented downgrade in the gold-plated U.S. credit rating.   The gridlock is unnerving investors worldwide. U.S. stocks and the dollar fell on Tuesday while gold hovered near record highs. But there was no sign of panic as markets held out hope the logjam could still be broken. [ID:nN1E76P1SP]   White House senior adviser David Plouffe said the plans advanced by House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could yield common ground.   “The Boehner and Reid proposals have quite a lot of similarities,” he said. “You can see how there could be the contours of compromise.”   Lawmakers from both parties also said a compromise was possible. But the polarizing debate has laid bare the ideological divide in Washington as each side seeks to blame the other for persistent economic and fiscal woes ahead of the November 2012 election, when Obama is seeking a second term.   Republicans control the House and Obama’s Democrats control the Senate.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    Full coverage of U.S. budget and debt     [ID:nUSBUDGET]    Insider TV                  http:link.reuters.com/zat72s    COLUMN-Death of Treasury benchmark       [ID:nN1E76O04X]    BREAKINGVIEWS-US can save its AAA rating [ID:nN1E76P1SC]    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Even if a default is avoided, a credit downgrade would undermine confidence in U.S. solvency, stunting economic recovery prospects and sending negative ripples through the international financial system where U.S. bonds are bellwethers. The world’s largest economy risks being viewed as a dysfunctional giant with feet of clay.   A Reuters poll showed that 30 of 53 economists surveyed over the past two days said the United States will lose its top-notch credit rating from one of the three big ratings agencies — Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. Most said the wrangling already has damaged the economy. [ID:nN1E76P12Q]   Executives from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are scheduled to testify to Congress on Wednesday on attempts to reform the credit rating industry and the role it is playing in the U.S. debt ceiling debate.   With the deadline for raising the government’s borrowing authority a week away, Congress was in a state of suspended animation before an anticipated Wednesday vote in the House on Boehner’s deficit reduction plan.   The outcome of that vote is in question as Boehner battles an insurrection on the right. Conservative groups warned lawmakers that a “yea” vote would be held against them.   No more than 22 Republicans can vote against the bill if it is to pass without Democratic help. At least 10 Republican lawmakers aligned to the fiscally conservative Tea Party movement have told Reuters they plan to vote against the bill.   Boehner had another setback when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said his plan would save $850 billion over 10 years, not the $1.2 trillion he claimed.   Boehner and Reid remained in touch, aides said, but no serious discussions were likely until after the House vote.   Even if Boehner’s plan passes the House, it is “dead on arrival” in the Senate, said Reid, who is delaying action on his own bill.   But several lawmakers noted the similarities between the two plans. “The commonality is pretty apparent,” said Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.   The stalemate in Washington is already having an effect on investors, with some starting to take cash out of the market and shifting away from some long-term investments.   “The time for Congress to act is now,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world’s largest business federation, said in a letter to House members.   Further underscoring the risks, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s largest package delivery company, cited the stalled debt ceiling talks as a reason for business uncertainty in its quarterly earnings report. [ID:nN1E76P021]   There were clear signs too that ordinary Americans were beginning to wake up to the dangers of the debt deadlock.   Obama, in an address to the nation late on Monday, warned that a default would mean the government would not be able to pay bills including monthly Social Security checks, veterans’ benefits and contracts with thousands of businesses.   A Reuters/Ipsos poll found Americans are overwhelmingly concerned about the debt crisis and a majority back the type of compromise pushed by Obama to end the impasse. [ID:nN1E76P1KS]   It showed 56 percent said lawmakers and Obama should agree to a combination of tax hikes and cuts to government programs — the strategy the president has promoted and Republicans have rejected.   After an appeal by Obama for Americans to make their voices heard to avert a “reckless and irresponsible default,” people crashed websites with emails and flooded the telephone lines of lawmakers in Washington with thousands of calls. [ID:nN1E76P1YU]   Big banks are preparing for the real possibility that the United States will lose its top credit rating, which they said would cost the country $100 billion in higher interest payments and hurt consumers and the economy.   “That’s an environment where hiring is going to be much less likely than it otherwise would be,” Mike Hanson, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said on a conference call organized by a Wall Street trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Most also say wrangling over debt has already damaged the economy.   * A Reuters/Ipsos poll finds 56 percent of Americans want a combination of government spending cuts and tax increases in a deal to bring down the U.S. budget deficit and permit a vote to raise the debt ceiling — the approach favored by Obama and his fellow Democrats.   * Obama will not use a clause in the U.S. Constitution to bypass Congress and raise the debt limit on his own, the White House says.   * Republican Representative Jim Jordan, who is aligned with the fiscally conservative Tea Party movement, opposes a plan proposed by House Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress. Representative Steny Hoyer, the Democrats’ top vote counter in the House, says “a few” Democrats may vote for it.   * The U.S. dollar falls broadly and gold hovers near a record high above $1,619 an ounce as investors seek safety.

The Postal Service, which is bleeding cash due to declining mail volumes and private-sector competition, said it is studying more than 3,600 sites for possible closure.   It hopes to enter contracts with about 2,500 community retailers across the United States, which will be called Village Post Offices, in the next year to sell stamps and provide flat-rate packaging services.   “When you think about it, Village Post Offices provide some really nice options for people in terms of access and convenience,” Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said on Tuesday.   “It’s a very good opportunity for a lot of small businesses ... many of these general stores have been hanging on for dear life out there.”   The agency is preparing to review 3,653 facilities in 49 states — all but Delaware. Several Washington, D.C., locations made the list, including offices at the departments of state and agriculture and at the Pentagon.   If the Postal Service closed every site, which have seen low traffic and falling revenues, the agency could save up to $200 million annually, Donahoe said.   The Postal Service has frequently seen backlash from community leaders and Congress when it tried to close offices. This time, the agency has reached out to communities under review and local input will be expanded, said Dean Granholm, vice president for delivery and post office operations.   The review is expected to take four to six months, and the Postal Service has not determined exactly how many of its 32,000 offices, stations and branches to shutter, Granholm said.   Falling mail volumes as consumers increasingly use email and pay bills online, coupled with competition from United Parcel Service UPS.N and FedEx FDX.N, have hurt revenues.   The agency, which receives no tax money, reported a $2.2 billion net loss in its second quarter and said it might be unable to pay its debts by September.

12,UPS,COMPANY VIEW-Executives on U.S. debt ceiling talks," NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The impasse over the U.S. debt limit left President Barack Obama’s Democrats and their Republican rivals further apart than ever on Tuesday, as Wall Street braced for a looming U.S. default and credit downgrade.   Here are comments from company executives over the past week on what they think about the debt talks:   SCOTT DAVIS, CEO, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC (UPS.N)   The world’s largest package delivery company gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” Davis told analysts on a conference call.   Without a debt resolution or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.   SANDY CUTLER, CEO, EATON CORP (ETN.N)   “These compromises never seem to come together until the 24th hour. It looks like that’s how this one is going to play out. I think they will find some common ground at the very last moment and pull a rabbit out of the hat.”   DAVID SIMON, CEO, SIMON PROPERTY GROUP (SPG.N)   “I’m known for checking our accounts receivable every month when I get the report. And they (the U.S. government) are always 30 days delinquent.   “But beyond that, we don’t see any real risk. Spreads will invariably widen for all of corporate America and for all asset classes. So we’ll be a participant in that, but beyond that, we can’t see anything that’s going to be anything material.”   “We’ve kind of aired our dirty laundry in the international press and that’s not good for the U.S. markets, it’s not good for U.S. business.”   JIM HAGEMANN SNABE, CO-CEO, SAP AG (SAPG.DE)   “We strongly believe that businesses and countries need stability on the financial side. We hope the U.S. will sort its financial situation out.”   Snabe said there was nothing the company can do to prepare for a possible default.   THOMAS FALK, CEO, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP (KMB.N)   “I was in Europe recently, and we were having a debate with some of our European team over which region of the world had the bigger problem: is it the Europe sovereign debt crisis or the U.S. structural budget deficits and debt ceiling?   “It’s just disappointing that the two biggest economies in the Western world can’t seem to get their fiscal house in order.”   DAVE ANDERSON, CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC (HON.N)   Anderson said the stalemate in Washington and concerns over corporate tax reform and European sovereign debt were among the principal factors affecting business sentiment.   “Despite the fact that we’re in a market upturn right now in the industrial economy, we try to hold fixed costs relatively flat. We don’t want to get out ahead of our headlights in terms of any over-hiring.”   CLAY JONES, CEO, ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (COL.N)   “I’m not sure how one prepares for a default since we’ve never had one in the history of our country. There is no playbook that I know of that suggests here’s what one should do, either as a company or a private citizen, when the country starts going out of business.”   KEITH SHERIN, CFO, GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE.N)   The largest U.S. conglomerate has boosted its cash holdings and cut its long-term debt in the past three years.   “The main thing that we’ve done, and it’s not specifically for the discussion going on in the U.S. about raising the debt ceiling or the European issue, is we just have dramatically increased our liquidity.”   YOUNG SOHN, CEO OF CHIPMAKER INPHI (IPHI.N)   “If interest rates change and people lose their confidence in a stable currency, the macroeconomic headwind will increase and that means people will be confused and maybe panic.   “We have to be very careful here. This is not something politicians should take lightly and it’s not something they can play with. They’ve had several months to fix this problem.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, Ilaina Jonas, Liana B.

14,UPS,"UPS view cautious citing debt talks, shares drop","NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s largest package delivery company, gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks, pushing its shares down nearly 4 percent on Tuesday.  UPS, which posted a higher quarterly profit and affirmed its view for record 2011 earnings, voiced caution about peak season shipments because of economic uncertainty and the deadlocked negotiations over the U.S. debt.  “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call.  Without a resolution, or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.  U.S. consumer sentiment edged up in July, but labor market worries kept consumers gloomy.  “While fuel prices have come down some and Japan appears to be recovering, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence continue,” Davis said. “The end of the second round of quantitative easing and the government debt issues only add to the uncertainty.”  As a result, he said second-half U.S. gross domestic product could be anywhere within a wide range of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent and harder than usual to estimate. Second-quarter GDP being reported on Friday is seen having grown at a 1.8 percent rate, down from 1.9 percent in the first quarter.  Jeffrey Kauffman, a managing director at Sterne Agee, said the company’s record quarterly results show resilience in the face of a tenuous economy and political wranglings. UPS had pricing power in all of its business segments, he said.  “I didn’t interpret this as UPS saying ‘look out below,’ I interpreted it as UPS delivering a message to our politicians saying ‘don’t put political ambitions ahead of a recovery that needs to sustain.’”  UPS handles goods equal to 6 percent of the U.S. GDP and 2 percent of global GDP in its trucks and planes, so its shipment trends give a tangible view of consumer demand.  Its shares were down 3.6 percent at $71.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They have declined about 1.5 percent so far this year.  Smaller rival FedEx (FDX.N) in June said cost controls and higher shipping rates more than offset the slowing economic recovery and high fuel prices in its fourth quarter, and forecast an improved second-half economy.  Its shares were 1 percent lower at $90.95, down about 2.2 percent so far this year.  In the quarter, UPS’s international shipment volume escalated while domestic deliveries stayed flat because of the tepid U.S. economy.  Global trade is a key focus at UPS, as Davis is on the President’s Export Council that aims to drive U.S. business growth by doubling exports by 2015.  “International growth is really bearing fruit for them,” said Kevin Sterling, a BB&T analyst. “The thing that caught my eye is they continued to add flights in and out of China.  The company, which said export volume rose about 8 percent in the quarter, announced it launched a new flight between Europe and western China this week.  Davis said there will be “tremendous growth in western China over the next five years and we think we are in a position to well serve that market.”  In April, when UPS raised its 2011 guidance to the current record high between $4.15 and $4.40 per share, it noted its cost-containment efforts and little customer resistance to higher rates.  Atlanta-based UPS on Tuesday reported net earnings of $1.063 billion, or $1.07 per share, up from $845 million, or 84 cents a share a year ago.  Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share, slightly beating the $1.04 per share that economists expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  UPS is ending the first half of the year with $2.3 billion in free cash flow, even after accelerated pension contributions and spending on four B-767 and two B-747-400 aircraft.  “We do think businesses and consumers are cautious given the chaos that seems to be, especially in Washington these days,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said in an interview. “Nonetheless the company is in great shape and we feel very confident that we can manage through this environment while still growing the business and producing record earnings.”  The highest second-quarter earnings per share on record were driven by “the quality of revenue in the U.S. domestic, superior export volume growth in International and record supply chain & freight results,” he said.  Revenue rose to $13.2 billion from $12.2 billion a year ago, slightly edging above analyst forecasts of $13.14 billion.

16,UPS,CORRECTED - COLUMN-LNG poised to become a transportation fuel," (Corrects cost of LNG tractors to $48,000 to $90,000 more than diesel units, instead of $250,000 to $300,000 more)   — Chris Kimmerle is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.—   By Chris Kimmerle   NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Across the United States, more than 11,000 transit buses, nearly 4,000 refuse trucks, over 3,000 school buses, 15,000 to 17,000 medium-duty vehicles and more than 30,000 light-duty vehicles in federal, state, local government and private fleets are already gas-fuelled, according to the Natural Gas Vehicles for America.   Most consume compressed natural gas (CNG) but liquefied natural gas (LNG) is slowly gaining momentum as a replacement for diesel in heavy truck and bus fleets.   LNG is produced by cooling and storing natural gas at minus 260 Fahrenheit (minus 162 Celsius). The result is a liquid that occupies about 1/600 of the volume of pipeline-quality gas on an energy equivalent basis. Under current market conditions, natural gas is less expensive then diesel, and gas-fueled vehicles have lower tailpipe particulate and carbon emissions.   The emergence of CNG and now LNG as transportation fuels is rooted in the growing gap between crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices, but now legislative and regulatory initiatives combined with long-term prospects for an abundant gas supply are stimulating further investment in LNG vehicles and fueling facilities.   Despite its potential advantages, the move to increased used of LNG as a transportation fuel will be evolutionary and is unlikely to disrupt the North American natural gas market over the near to midterm.   The Energy Information Agency has identified only 44 LNG vehicle fueling stations (35 in California, four in Texas, two in Utah, and the remainder in Alabama, Arizona and Connecticut) as of June 2011. Most are dedicated to private fleets thus discouraging wider industry acceptance.   The transition to LNG-fueled trucks involves some significant corporations, including Cummings Westport, Daimler Trucks North America, Detroit Diesel, Freightliner, Kenworth, Mack, Navistar (NAV.N), Peterbilt, Volvo North America (VOLVb.ST), Republic Services (RSG.N), United Parcel Service (UPS.N), Wal-Mart (WMT.N), and Waste Management (WM.N).   On the supply side are Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE.O), Air Products & Chemicals (APD.N), the Linde Group (LING.DE) and Southeast LNG. Each has a different business model: (1) In April, Encana Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Encana Corp (ECA.TO) announced an agreement to use its mobile LNG stations to provide fueling services for Heckmann Water Resources, a firm involved in delivering water to Encana and other gas exploration and production companies in northwestern Louisiana. In addition, Encana plans to build additional fixed-base public LNG fueling stations in Louisiana. [ID:nN05154332] (2) In the west, Boone Pickens’ Clean Energy Fuels is the dominant LNG supplier to truck fleets. It owns and operates production facilities in Texas and California capable of producing 260,000 gallons per day and is planning to expand production to 340,000 gallons per day as demand increases. On July 11, Chesapeake Energy (CHK.N) announced its intent to provide $150 million in financial support to Clean Energy’s continued expansion. [ID:nN1E76A1PL] The funds will be dispersed over three years and take the form of convertible debt to be used for the construction of 150 LNG fueling facilities along the interstate highway system. The Chesapeake/Clean Energy initiative is a step to moving LNG from a niche market serving hub and spoke fleet operators to the broader long-haul truck market. (3) Southeast LNG, a joint venture between AGL Resources AGL.N and El Paso Corp EP.N, is also positioning to enter the LNG market. El Paso is the owner of the Elba Island (Louisiana) LNG import terminal while AGL holds LNG peak shaving capacity, used to meet peak day demands of its existing gas distribution systems, in Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and New Jersey. Their business model looks to leverage the value of their existing infrastructure by trucking LNG to new fleet fueling stations in the southeast. (4) The Linde Group is a major international liquid gas producer. Linde has developed world-scale base load LNG production facilities, small to mid-scale base load and peak shaving operations as well as floating production storage and offloading vessels. Now it is considering the deployment of pocket size liquefaction plants at truck fueling stations. To date, Linde is involved in joint ventures with Waste Management to convert landfill gas into a LNG truck fuel.   Using LNG in the transport sector has significant policy implications — for national security, the balance of trade and environmental policy.   The transportation sector consumed 28 percent of total U.S. energy demand of 94.6 quadrillion Btu in 2009. Within the sector, light-duty vehicles account for 59 percent of demand followed by freight trucks (16 percent) and air 10 percent. (PDF of transportation sector: r.reuters.com/daz72s)   Federal and state initiatives have the potential to drive substantial changes in the transportation fuel mix.    California has led the western states into the LNG age through its low carbon fuel standards and a suite of economic incentives. Now, according to NGVAmerica, 24 states have either recently enacted or are in the process of passing legislation supporting the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel.   At federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration are establishing greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption standards for heavy-duty vehicles. The new standards will apply to combination tractors, heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans as well as vocational vehicles. If implemented, new emission standards will accelerate the transition from oil to cleaner burning and lower CO2 natural gas.   Continued penetration of LNG and CNG into the transportation fuel market, at the expense of imported oil, could significantly reduce the U.S. trade deficit and reduce dependence on imports from potentially unstable supplies from the Middle East and Africa as well as Venezuela.   But wider uptake of LNG as a transport fuel also faces challenges.   The transition from the existing diesel fleet to LNG is being tempered by a number of factors: truck tractors have a 20-lifecycle; access to private LNG fueling facilities is still limited; new LNG Class 8 tractors cost $48,000 to $90,000 more than diesel units; maintenance costs are higher; and fuel economy is lower than diesel.   LNG vehicles need pressurized cryogenic fuel tanks that are one-third larger than diesel to maintain equivalent driving ranges. The result is a weight premium of 1,000 to 1,200 lbs over comparable diesel units and an associated reduction in payload in order to comply with highway weight limits.   The evolution of the LNG market will require adoption of uniform standards for design and operation of fueling facilities including risk mitigation standards to address the hazards associated with handling a fuel with a lower flash point than diesel.   Widespread introduction of LNG onto the nation’s highways will require training for first responders called on to deal with a leaking fluid having a temperature of negative 260 F. Existing laws restricting the movement of “hazardous” gas through urban areas and transportation choke points such as bridges and tunnels will also have to be reviewed.   But the biggest impediment to adoption of LNG, for long-haul fleets, is the need to reach a critical mass of public refueling stations and, by extension, the assurance of a competitive fuel market. To overcome the barriers to entry, LNG cost must remain well below diesel to compensate for higher capital and operating and maintenance costs as well as the risk associated with participation in an emerging market.

17,UPS,Developments in U.S. debt talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Here is the situation on  Tuesday as lawmakers try to close in on a deal to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt limit by August 2 and avoid a federal credit default:  * The Democratic-led Senate and Republican-led House of Representatives plan to consider rival plans to reduce the deficit and raise the debt ceiling. Votes may come as early as Wednesday.  * A Reuters poll shows that 30 of 53 economists surveyed think at least one of the major credit agencies will strip the United States of its top-notch credit rating and most also say wrangling over debt has already damaged the economy.  * Conservative Republican Representative Jim Jordan, who is aligned with the Tea Party movement, opposes a plan proposed by House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress. Jordan says there are not enough Republican votes to pass it in the House without Democratic support. Representative Steny Hoyer, the Democrats’ top vote counter in the House, says “a few” Democrats may vote for it.  * International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde urges the United States to quickly resolve the stalemate, warning that failure to reach an agreement would have serious consequences for the world economy.  * President Barack Obama’s top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, tells CNN he believes Republicans and Democrats could reach a budget deal this week with “a minimum amount of compromise, a minimum amount of not ‘my way or the highway.’”  * New Washington Post-ABC News poll shows more than a third of Americans believe Obama’s policies have made the U.S. economy worse, but they blame Republicans just as much.  * Investors, who have been watching developments in Washington closely, grew more nervous but were not panicked ahead of a possible default or a cut in United States’ triple-A rating. Dollar hits record low against Swiss franc and drops against the yen while safe haven gold hovers near record high.  * A downgrade of the United States’ AAA credit rating is a bigger risk than a default and could add up to 0.7 percentage points to bond yields over time, according to members of a U.S. securities industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  United Parcel Service Inc, the world’s largest package delivery company, gives a cautious economic outlook and cites stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks, sending its shares down more than 5 percent.  * Obama says in a televised address on Monday evening that defaulting on U.S. debt obligations would be “a reckless and irresponsible outcome” to the stalemate. He calls for a “fair compromise” and rejects temporary extension of debt ceiling.  * Boehner offers a rebuttal and agrees United States cannot default on its debt obligations. Boehner blames Obama for asking for “blank check” and says Americans won’t accept a debt limit hike without spending cuts, reforms.

19,UPS,CORRECTED - RPT-COLUMN-LNG poised to become a transportation fuel,"(Repeats July 25 correction, no change to headline or text)   (Corrects cost of LNG tractors to $48,000 to $90,000 more than diesel units, instead of $250,000 to $300,000 more)   — Chris Kimmerle is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.—   By Chris Kimmerle   NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Across the United States, more than 11,000 transit buses, nearly 4,000 refuse trucks, over 3,000 school buses, 15,000 to 17,000 medium-duty vehicles and more than 30,000 light-duty vehicles in federal, state, local government and private fleets are already gas-fuelled, according to the Natural Gas Vehicles for America.   Most consume compressed natural gas (CNG) but liquefied natural gas (LNG) is slowly gaining momentum as a replacement for diesel in heavy truck and bus fleets.   LNG is produced by cooling and storing natural gas at minus 260 Fahrenheit (minus 162 Celsius). The result is a liquid that occupies about 1/600 of the volume of pipeline-quality gas on an energy equivalent basis. Under current market conditions, natural gas is less expensive then diesel, and gas-fueled vehicles have lower tailpipe particulate and carbon emissions.   The emergence of CNG and now LNG as transportation fuels is rooted in the growing gap between crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices, but now legislative and regulatory initiatives combined with long-term prospects for an abundant gas supply are stimulating further investment in LNG vehicles and fueling facilities.   Despite its potential advantages, the move to increased used of LNG as a transportation fuel will be evolutionary and is unlikely to disrupt the North American natural gas market over the near to midterm.   The Energy Information Agency has identified only 44 LNG vehicle fueling stations (35 in California, four in Texas, two in Utah, and the remainder in Alabama, Arizona and Connecticut) as of June 2011. Most are dedicated to private fleets thus discouraging wider industry acceptance.   The transition to LNG-fueled trucks involves some significant corporations, including Cummings Westport, Daimler Trucks North America, Detroit Diesel, Freightliner, Kenworth, Mack, Navistar (NAV.N), Peterbilt, Volvo North America (VOLVb.ST), Republic Services (RSG.N), United Parcel Service (UPS.N), Wal-Mart (WMT.N), and Waste Management (WM.N).   On the supply side are Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE.O), Air Products & Chemicals (APD.N), the Linde Group (LING.DE) and Southeast LNG. Each has a different business model: (1) In April, Encana Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Encana Corp (ECA.TO) announced an agreement to use its mobile LNG stations to provide fueling services for Heckmann Water Resources, a firm involved in delivering water to Encana and other gas exploration and production companies in northwestern Louisiana. In addition, Encana plans to build additional fixed-base public LNG fueling stations in Louisiana. [ID:nN05154332] (2) In the west, Boone Pickens’ Clean Energy Fuels is the dominant LNG supplier to truck fleets. It owns and operates production facilities in Texas and California capable of producing 260,000 gallons per day and is planning to expand production to 340,000 gallons per day as demand increases. On July 11, Chesapeake Energy (CHK.N) announced its intent to provide $150 million in financial support to Clean Energy’s continued expansion. [ID:nN1E76A1PL] The funds will be dispersed over three years and take the form of convertible debt to be used for the construction of 150 LNG fueling facilities along the interstate highway system. The Chesapeake/Clean Energy initiative is a step to moving LNG from a niche market serving hub and spoke fleet operators to the broader long-haul truck market. (3) Southeast LNG, a joint venture between AGL Resources AGL.N and El Paso Corp EP.N, is also positioning to enter the LNG market. El Paso is the owner of the Elba Island (Louisiana) LNG import terminal while AGL holds LNG peak shaving capacity, used to meet peak day demands of its existing gas distribution systems, in Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and New Jersey. Their business model looks to leverage the value of their existing infrastructure by trucking LNG to new fleet fueling stations in the southeast. (4) The Linde Group is a major international liquid gas producer. Linde has developed world-scale base load LNG production facilities, small to mid-scale base load and peak shaving operations as well as floating production storage and offloading vessels. Now it is considering the deployment of pocket size liquefaction plants at truck fueling stations. To date, Linde is involved in joint ventures with Waste Management to convert landfill gas into a LNG truck fuel.

20,UPS,COMPANY VIEW-Executives on U.S. debt ceiling talks," NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats rushed to rework rival deficit reduction plans on Wednesday, but with the fate of both proposals in doubt, top lawmakers pursued a behind-the-scenes compromise to avert a crippling U.S. debt default. [ID:nN1E76P2HJ]   Here are comments from company executives over the past week on what they think about the debt talks:   ROBERT GREIFELD, CEO, NASDAQ OMX GROUP (NDAQ.O)   “We’re not going to have a default. I’m confident that our political leaders will come to a pragmatic solution. I’m confident they’ll get there,” Greifeld told Reuters in an interview.   Separately, on a conference call with analysts, he said, “On a macroeconomic basis it’s not hard to say that we need greater certainty out of Washington. It’s not helpful for investor confidence in terms of what we see transpiring here.”   GREG SWIENTON, CEO, RYDER SYSTEM INC (R.N)   Swienton said the company is not undergoing any current tactical changes because of the overhanging debt ceiling tumult.   “As an American I worry about it a great deal. As the CEO of Ryder, you worry that that might have an impact on the economic environment.   “I hope we get some sanity in Washington. I hope they figure it all out for everyone’s benefit and we’ll all be much better off.”   ROBERT MOORE, CFO, LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC (LPLA.O)   “The debt ceiling issue is a major overhang for us at the moment, and how that ultimately is resolved is unclear at this point, and it’s equally unclear as to what the real consequences of the outcome from that debate will be under a variety of scenarios.”   JOSEPH ZUBRETSKY, CFO, AETNA (AET.N)   “We have a team of people who are monitoring the debt ceiling situation closely. We do not believe that a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in any short-term impact to our claims-paying ability.   “We have adequate liquidity to meet all potential funding commitments and the business should perform just fine.   “Longer-term, not addressing this situation is really just untenable for the nation. It needs to be addressed so there’s more certainty in the environment.”   WES BUSH, CEO, NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP (NOC.N)   “Continued uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and future defense budget caused our customers to move more slowly and spend more conservatively.”   MIKE JACKSON, CEO, AUTONATION (AN.N)   “If there is an extended stalemate here on the debt ceiling and the government shuts down step by step, that will have a meaningful impact on the economy and definitely affect the pace of this recovery.   “Assuming there’s an orderly resolution to the debt situation, I see a very strong close to the year.”   EMERSON ELECTRIC CO (EMR.N):   “U.S. and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft-patch and it remains unclear if they will improve much in the second half of the calendar year.   “Industrial-related businesses are still strong, but we expect them eventually to soften due to the generally poor economic environment (the negative budget discourse in Washington, D.C., and ongoing European debt crisis) and weakening trends.”   SCOTT DAVIS, CEO, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC (UPS.N)   The world’s largest package delivery company gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” Davis told analysts on a conference call.   Without a debt resolution or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.   SANDY CUTLER, CEO, EATON CORP (ETN.N)   “These compromises never seem to come together until the 24th hour. It looks like that’s how this one is going to play out. I think they will find some common ground at the very last moment and pull a rabbit out of the hat.”   DAVID SIMON, CEO, SIMON PROPERTY GROUP (SPG.N)   “I’m known for checking our accounts receivable every month when I get the report. And they (the U.S. government) are always 30 days delinquent.   “But beyond that, we don’t see any real risk. Spreads will invariably widen for all of corporate America and for all asset classes. So we’ll be a participant in that, but beyond that, we can’t see anything that’s going to be anything material.”   “We’ve kind of aired our dirty laundry in the international press and that’s not good for the U.S. markets, it’s not good for U.S. business.”   JIM HAGEMANN SNABE, CO-CEO, SAP AG (SAPG.DE)   “We strongly believe that businesses and countries need stability on the financial side. We hope the U.S. will sort its financial situation out.”   Snabe said there was nothing the company can do to prepare for a possible default.   THOMAS FALK, CEO, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP (KMB.N)   “I was in Europe recently, and we were having a debate with some of our European team over which region of the world had the bigger problem: is it the Europe sovereign debt crisis or the U.S. structural budget deficits and debt ceiling?   “It’s just disappointing that the two biggest economies in the Western world can’t seem to get their fiscal house in order.”   DAVE ANDERSON, CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC (HON.N)   Anderson said the stalemate in Washington and concerns over corporate tax reform and European sovereign debt were among the principal factors affecting business sentiment.   “Despite the fact that we’re in a market upturn right now in the industrial economy, we try to hold fixed costs relatively flat. We don’t want to get out ahead of our headlights in terms of any over-hiring.”   CLAY JONES, CEO, ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (COL.N)   “I’m not sure how one prepares for a default since we’ve never had one in the history of our country. There is no playbook that I know of that suggests here’s what one should do, either as a company or a private citizen, when the country starts going out of business.”   KEITH SHERIN, CFO, GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE.N)   The largest U.S. conglomerate has boosted its cash holdings and cut its long-term debt in the past three years.   “The main thing that we’ve done, and it’s not specifically for the discussion going on in the U.S. about raising the debt ceiling or the European issue, is we just have dramatically increased our liquidity.”   YOUNG SOHN, CEO OF CHIPMAKER INPHI (IPHI.N)   “If interest rates change and people lose their confidence in a stable currency, the macroeconomic headwind will increase and that means people will be confused and maybe panic.   “We have to be very careful here. This is not something politicians should take lightly and it’s not something they can play with. They’ve had several months to fix this problem.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, Ilaina Jonas, Liana B.

We need courageous people in Washington, and my biggest fear is they’re not there.”   McCausland said he favors a plan from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner.   JOHN FARACI, CEO, INTERNATIONAL PAPER (IP.N)   “I hope the Boehner plan is voted on by the Congress and passes. I think it’s the best plan out there.   “We can’t default. I don’t think we will. But we also can’t borrow 40 cents out of every dollar we spend.”   “The uncertainty itself does create a lot of questions and a lot of fear down value chains. We continue to work through groups like The Business Roundtable to urge Washington to resolve these matters in an expedient way.”   ABHI TALWALKAR, CEO, LSI (LSI.N)   “Frankly, I’m a bit embarrassed to be a U.S. citizen, and part of me is wondering whether our democratic process is ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of these types of problems.   “If we did this as businessmen running companies, we’d be fired.   “It definitely has the potential to impact the average consumer, who may be nervous about the economic outlook long term and conserve spending.”   ROBERT GREIFELD, CEO, NASDAQ OMX GROUP (NDAQ.O)   “We’re not going to have a default. I’m confident that our political leaders will come to a pragmatic solution. I’m confident they’ll get there.”   GREG SWIENTON, CEO, RYDER SYSTEM INC (R.N)   The company is not undergoing tactical changes because of the overhanging debt ceiling tumult, Swienton said.   “As an American, I worry about it a great deal. As the CEO of Ryder, you worry that that might have an impact on the economic environment.   “I hope we get some sanity in Washington. I hope they figure it all out for everyone’s benefit and we’ll all be much better off.”   JOSEPH ZUBRETSKY, CFO, AETNA (AET.N)   “We do not believe that a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in any short-term impact to our claims-paying ability.   “Longer-term, not addressing this situation is really just untenable for the nation. It needs to be addressed so there’s more certainty in the environment.”   MIKE JACKSON, CEO, AUTONATION (AN.N)   “If there is an extended stalemate here on the debt ceiling and the government shuts down step by step, that will have a meaningful impact on the economy and definitely affect the pace of this recovery.”   SCOTT DAVIS, CEO, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC (UPS.N)   The world’s largest package delivery company gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly.”   Without a debt resolution or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.   SANDY CUTLER, CEO, EATON CORP (ETN.N)   “These compromises never seem to come together until the 24th hour. It looks like that’s how this one is going to play out. I think they will find some common ground at the very last moment and pull a rabbit out of the hat.”   DAVID SIMON, CEO, SIMON PROPERTY GROUP (SPG.N)   “I’m known for checking our accounts receivable every month when I get the report. And they (the U.S. government) are always 30 days delinquent.   “But beyond that, we don’t see any real risk. Spreads will invariably widen for all of corporate America and for all asset classes. So we’ll be a participant in that, but beyond that, we can’t see anything that’s going to be anything material.”   THOMAS FALK, CEO, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP (KMB.N)   “I was in Europe recently, and we were having a debate with some of our European team over which region of the world had the bigger problem: is it the Europe sovereign debt crisis or the U.S. structural budget deficits and debt ceiling?   “It’s just disappointing that the two biggest economies in the Western world can’t seem to get their fiscal house in order.”   CLAY JONES, CEO, ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (COL.N)   “I’m not sure how one prepares for a default since we’ve never had one in the history of our country. There is no playbook that I know of that suggests here’s what one should do, either as a company or a private citizen, when the country starts going out of business.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, Ilaina Jonas, Liana B.

24,UPS,"RPT-UPDATE 6-UPS view cautious citing debt talks, shares drop","  (Repeating July 26 story with no change to text)   * CEO-mood could quickly change with US debt ceiling talks   * Shares down 3.6 pct in midafternoon trading   * Q2 adjusted EPS $1.05 vs $1.04 Wall Street view   * Revenue $13.2 bln vs $13.14 bln Wall Street estimate  (Adds CEO quotes, analyst comment, updates shares)   By Lynn Adler   NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s largest package delivery company, gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks, pushing its shares down nearly 4 percent on Tuesday.   UPS, which posted a higher quarterly profit and affirmed its view for record 2011 earnings, voiced caution about peak season shipments because of economic uncertainty and the deadlocked negotiations over the U.S. debt.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call.   Without a resolution, or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.   U.S. consumer sentiment edged up in July, but labor market worries kept consumers gloomy. [ID:nN1E76P0NI]   “While fuel prices have come down some and Japan appears to be recovering, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence continue,” Davis said. “The end of the second round of quantitative easing and the government debt issues only add to the uncertainty.”   As a result, he said second-half U.S. gross domestic product could be anywhere within a wide range of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent and harder than usual to estimate. Second-quarter GDP being reported on Friday is seen having grown at a 1.8 percent rate, down from 1.9 percent in the first quarter.   Jeffrey Kauffman, a managing director at Sterne Agee, said the company’s record quarterly results show resilience in the face of a tenuous economy and political wranglings. UPS had pricing power in all of its business segments, he said.   “I didn’t interpret this as UPS saying ‘look out below,’ I interpreted it as UPS delivering a message to our politicians saying ‘don’t put political ambitions ahead of a recovery that needs to sustain.’”   UPS handles goods equal to 6 percent of the U.S. GDP and 2 percent of global GDP in its trucks and planes, so its shipment trends give a tangible view of consumer demand.   Its shares were down 3.6 percent at $71.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They have declined about 1.5 percent so far this year.   Smaller rival FedEx (FDX.N) in June said cost controls and higher shipping rates more than offset the slowing economic recovery and high fuel prices in its fourth quarter, and forecast an improved second-half economy. [ID:nN1E75L034]   Its shares were 1 percent lower at $90.95, down about 2.2 percent so far this year.   In the quarter, UPS’s international shipment volume escalated while domestic deliveries stayed flat because of the tepid U.S. economy.   Global trade is a key focus at UPS, as Davis is on the President’s Export Council that aims to drive U.S. business growth by doubling exports by 2015.   “International growth is really bearing fruit for them,” said Kevin Sterling, a BB&T analyst. “The thing that caught my eye is they continued to add flights in and out of China.   The company, which said export volume rose about 8 percent in the quarter, announced it launched a new flight between Europe and western China this week.   Davis said there will be “tremendous growth in western China over the next five years and we think we are in a position to well serve that market.”   In April, when UPS raised its 2011 guidance to the current record high between $4.15 and $4.40 per share, it noted its cost-containment efforts and little customer resistance to higher rates.   Atlanta-based UPS on Tuesday reported net earnings of $1.063 billion, or $1.07 per share, up from $845 million, or 84 cents a share a year ago.   Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share, slightly beating the $1.04 per share that economists expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   UPS is ending the first half of the year with $2.3 billion in free cash flow, even after accelerated pension contributions and spending on four B-767 and two B-747-400 aircraft.   “We do think businesses and consumers are cautious given the chaos that seems to be, especially in Washington these days,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said in an interview. “Nonetheless the company is in great shape and we feel very confident that we can manage through this environment while still growing the business and producing record earnings.”   The highest second-quarter earnings per share on record were driven by “the quality of revenue in the U.S. domestic, superior export volume growth in International and record supply chain & freight results,” he said.   Revenue rose to $13.2 billion from $12.2 billion a year ago, slightly edging above analyst forecasts of $13.14 billion.

25,UPS,UPDATE 2-TNT Express shows stronger grip on costs," * Q2 revenue 1.800 bln eur v 1.861 bln eur in Rtrs poll	   * Q2 adjusted EBIT 79 mln eur v 70.5 mln eur in Rtrs poll	   * Declares interim 2011 dividend of 0.04 eur/share	   * Shares up 5 percent	   	  (Adds analyst comment, detail, background, shares)  	   By Greg Roumeliotis	   AMSTERDAM, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Dutch freight and delivery firm TNT Express reported a smaller than expected drop in second-quarter adjusted operating income on Monday due to a stronger performance in Europe and more effective cost controls.	   The express delivery firm has been suffering on two fronts; its customers are less willing to pay for pricey air transport, while operational problems in its Brazilian unit have led to a loss of clients and a drag on earnings.	   “The drop in adjusted operating income was less than expected due to improved performance in Europe and the non-allocated items, which have to do with costs,” ING analyst Axel Funhoff said.	   TNT Express said non-allocated costs were lower as a result of overhead control and reduced project-related costs. These non-allocated costs are associated with operations outside its main networks.   	   Shares in TNT jumped as much as 7.5 percent and were trading at 7.39 euros, up 5 percent. They trade at 17.8 times forward price earnings according to Thomson Reuters Starmine, compared to 14.6 and 12.7 times for UPS and FedEx , often cited by investors as possible acquirers of TNT.	   While TNT Express Chief Executive Marie-Christine Lombard acknowledged that clients continued to shift to economy services at the expense of air transport, she said the company was taking measures to improve profitability across its network.	   “Europe’s performance was once again solid ... Demand from Asia to Europe has been volatile, and we are optimising our capacity accordingly,”  Lombard said in a statement.	   The International Air Transport Association said last week that there was little sign of an uptick in air freight volumes, even though world trade is currently growing at about 7 percent a year, because a rise in jet fuel prices makes other modes of transport more attractive.	   Last week UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, said it saw international shipment volumes jump in the latest quarter while domestic deliveries stayed flat because of the tepid U.S. economy. 	   Analysts expect Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), which runs rival express delivery firm DHL, to post a 7.8 percent rise in second-quarter underlying EBIT when it reports earnings on Tuesday. 	   In its first quarterly results since the company separated from Dutch mail group PostNL , TNT Express reported an 8.1 percent drop in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to 79 million euros on revenues of 1.8 billion euros, up 0.9 percent year-on-year.	   Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast underlying EBIT of 70.5 million euros on revenues of 1.86 billion euros.	   The company said recovery in Brazil was on track and that while the short term would be challenging, it confirmed its second-half 2012 deadline to turn operations around. 	   The firm said it would issue an interim dividend of 0.04 euros per share, representing a payout of about 43 percent of normalised net income over the first half of 2011, in line with its dividend guidelines.	   TNT Express also said it had started to implement the 50 million euro cost savings it was targeting in 2012, with 5 million euro in restructuring charges in the second quarter and its head office restructuring planned for the third quarter.

Pockets of food insecurity have already been detected in drought-hit northern areas of Uganda, east Africa’s third largest economy, the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.	   “Uganda may be the next country hit with these same sort of alarming malnutrition and drought conditions,” the FAO’s Sandra Aviles told a news briefing.	   An estimated 815,000 people in drought-prone northern Uganda, mainly  in  the Karamoja region , currently face moderate food insecurity, corresponding to phase two on a U.N. scale where five means famine, she said.	   Prices for maize, Uganda’s main crop, went up by 67 percent between June and July due to a delay in the harvest and the effect of greater demand from neighbouring Kenya and southern Sudan, according to Shukri Ahmed, senior economist at the FAO. 	   “Maize prices are currently almost four times their level of the previous year. That price rise will be an added burden,” he told Reuters. “Another factor is the high fuel prices.” 	   But rainfall in the rainy season of September-October is forecast to be average to above average for most of Uganda, he said. 	   Famine has been declared in two regions of southern Somalia but may soon engulf as many as six more regions of the lawless nation, the U.N. humanitarian chief said on Monday.  	   Some 12.4 million people in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti are already in dire need of help due to the worst drought in 60 years, U.N. under-secretary-general and emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in New York.	   The world body appealed on Tuesday to air carriers to provide free or heavily discounted cargo space to transport food to starving children in the region.	   “There are over 2.3 million acutely malnourished children in the Horn of Africa. More than half a million will die if they do not get help within weeks,” Marixie Mercado of the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said.	   Tens of thousands of Somalis have already died from starvation or diseases caused by it, half of them children under age five, the United Nations says. 	   UNICEF has 5,000 tonnes of therapeutic and supplementary food supplies stored in France, Belgium and Italy, enough to feed 300,000 malnourished children for a month. The agency needs to bring 400 tonnes of supplies to its regional hub in Nairobi each week by air, a costly operation, until it can set up a food pipeline by sea in about 6 weeks.	   With therapeutic feeding, a malnourished child can fully recover in 4 to 6 weeks, Mercado said.	   British Airways  , Lufthansa , UPS  and Virgin have offered to transport between 15 to 50 tonnes per week for a limited period, she said.

29,UPS,Deutsche Post upbeat after strong Q2,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Post DHL (DPWGn.DE) nudged up its 2011 outlook as it cut costs and garnered more customers seeking supply chain services.  As the economy improves, manufacturers of machine parts, cars and other goods ramp up production and pay Deutsche Post to transport parts and finished products to and from their factories.  Europe’s biggest express delivery and mail company said on Tuesday it now expects full-year operating profit to reach the upper end of the outlook range of 2.2-2.4 billion euros ($3.2-3.5 billion), compared with consensus of 2.36 billion.  The positive earnings trend would last into 2012 if the global economy continues to recover, Deutsche Post said.  “The cyclical divisions showed an excellent performance in particular in view of slowing economic growth and what we saw from competitors,” WestLB analyst Raimon Kaufeld said.  “Express showed roughly twice the margin reported by TNT (Express) TNTE.AS as underlying development, forwarding matched the strong earnings growth reported by DSV (DSV.CO), and the progress at supply chain is significantly better than that seen from almost any competitor.”  FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and Dutch TNT Express have both reported better than expected quarterly results as cost controls offset high fuel prices.  Deutsche Post’s supply chain business, which generates about a quarter of group revenue, agreed new contracts representing about 540 million euros in annual revenue in the first half and more than doubled its operating margin to 3.6 percent.  Among other, Deutsche Post will run a high-security warehouse for Philips (PHG.AS), distribute drugs made by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) in the United States and deliver cars to dealerships in Scotland for BMW (BMWG.DE), which earlier reported consensus-busting quarterly profits.  Deutsche Post’s second-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) more than doubled to 562 million euros, beating consensus of 542 million.  Its shares gained 1 percent to 12.14 euros by 0815 GMT, while Germany's blue-chip DAX index .GDAXI fell 0.5 percent.  Aside from demand for supply chain services, results were also helped by the sale of unprofitable express businesses in Britain and France last year and by Deutsche Post’s ability to pass on higher fuel costs to customers.  The company has raised prices for express delivery in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa this year, and Rosen said it was able to fully pass on higher costs in the second quarter.  Deutsche Post also sent more express shipments with a guaranteed delivery time — the most profitable category — driven by demand in Asia, where it generates about a fifth of group revenue.  The company has benefited from growth in emerging markets as its customers grew there, and finance chief Larry Rosen said on Tuesday he saw good growth prospects for regions such as China, India and Latin America in the second half of this year.

31,UPS,FedEx Freight raises some shipment rates 6.75 pct," * Follows UPS and other transport rate increases   * Applies in U.S., Canada; cross-border with Canada, Mexico   NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - FedEx Freight, a division of the No. 2 package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N), is raising its rates on some shipments by 6.75 percent while keeping its fuel surcharge unchanged.   FedEx is the latest transport company, including United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and truckers such as Con-way Freight, a division of Con-way Inc CNW.N, to raise delivery fees.   Shippers have been able to pass through rising costs to customers with minimal pushback despite tough economic conditions.   FedEx’s rate increases apply to shipments within the contiguous United States and within Canada, and between the United States and Canada. The higher rate also applies to the U.S. portion of shipments between the United States and Mexico.   The higher rates are effective Sept. 6.

32,UPS,Analysis: Wary retailers put holiday shipping boost in doubt,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The struggling U.S. economy is beginning to take its toll on shipping companies which should be seeing a big boost from their peak season but instead find retailers delaying decisions about how much to import.  Retailers that had to discount sharply in 2008 because they had too much product on their shelves when the economy tanked are delaying orders for the holiday season as a series of weak economic reports and a plunging stock market ignite fears of a double-dip recession.  “They may be waiting as long as possible to ship ... They want to make sure the economy is on solid footing and that the consumer is OK,” BB&T Capital Markets analyst Kevin Sterling said. “If we get to the middle of September or even the end of September and we don’t see anything, that’s a red flag.  “By the middle to the end of September, you’ve got to make a decision as a purchasing manager: Do I believe in Santa Claus this year? If you think he’s not coming, you’re going to ship a lot less, and if you think he is, you’ll ship more.”  The delay by retailers in finalizing orders for the all-important holiday season, and even a back-to-school shopping season that has moved more into September in recent years, makes it harder for container vessels to impose peak surcharges on goods coming from China and other parts of Asia. Some carriers also face a compressed-but-intensified peak period.  “(Carriers) are concerned. They are trying to get the freight rates back up. The lack of demand is really hindering them and they aren’t being successful with that,” said Ben Hackett, founder of Hackett Associates, which tracks trade every month at each of the biggest U.S. seaports for the National Retail Federation.  Hackett now expects West Coast imports to be up only about 2.4 percent this year. Last year, they rose 17 percent.  U.S. ports followed by Global Port Tracker handled 5 percent less freight in June than they did a year earlier.  Fears of uncertainty in the world’s largest economy are trickling down to the rest of the supply chain, as Standard & Poor’s cut the United States’s debt rating. and the Federal Reserve said that U.S. economic growth was weaker than it had expected.  “The question for us going forward is what happens to consumer confidence over the next few weeks based on the national discourse,” said Todd Peters, vice chairman of logistics company GENCO ATC.  In just the past few weeks, U.S. data showed the economy grew at a meager 0.4 percent annual pace in the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second quarter, while unemployment ticked lower but was still over 9 percent.  “In North America, usually, prior to the Thanksgiving sales (and) back-to-school sales, you have what they call peak season when volumes increase — usually late July, early August. The carriers have been trying to introduce a peak season surcharge ... Currently it is delayed to the 15th of August. Even that looks doubtful.” Hackett said.  The Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, which includes 15 Transpacific Lines, said its members plan to implement peak season surcharges in mid-August, later than normal, Wells Fargo analyst Michael Webber pointed out in a report.  Several lines have attempted to implement higher charges without success, he said.  “Ocean shipping from Asia would normally be entering its peak in the summer and that doesn’t appear to be happening just yet. So it doesn’t look like retailers are building inventories for the holidays right now,” United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), spokesman Norman Black said on Tuesday.  Jim Young, chief executive of No. 1 U.S. publicly held railroad company Union Pacific (UNP.N), told analysts last month that he expected a compressed but intensified peak season.  “We still expect a peak season, though later and more compressed than last year, when we saw it begin toward the latter part of the second quarter,” Union Pacific spokesman Thomas Lange told Reuters on Tuesday.  For U.S. retailers, the back-to-school season is the second-biggest selling period of the year, after the December holiday season. Both have important implications, as consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, which barely grew in the first half of 2011.  “While it is early in the back-to-school season, we have seen softer traffic trends versus the prior year,” OfficeMax Inc OMX.N Chief Executive Ravi Saligram said last week.  Retailers still remember the lessons from the last recession.  “Shippers are going to wait until the last minute. The last thing they want to do is build a massive inventory position, then have to massively discount during the holiday season,” Sterling said.

33,UPS,Analysis: Infrastructure woes - a roadblock to growth,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Long famous for its top-notch highways and passion for cars, the United States is letting bridges rust as traffic chokes overburdened roads, threatening a pillar of its economic strength.  A prime example of this neglect is the Brent Spence Bridge over the Ohio River. It worked well when it opened in 1963. Now it handles twice the traffic it was designed to support. Gridlock often stretches for a mile beneath a thick haze of smog.  “As you’re coming across the bridge into Cincinnati you can tell when traffic has slowed because you can see the cloud,” said Margaret Drury, an engineer at United Parcel Service.  UPS trucks avoid the bridge as much as possible but that adds time to its routes, pushing up costs, Drury said.  Two interstate highways come together at the river crossing, with a UPS distribution center to the north and the company’s global air shipping hub to the south.  The bottleneck illustrates the decline of American infrastructure that is already hurting the U.S. economy. The trend shows little sign of being reversed.  The United States has fallen sharply in the World Economic Forum’s ranking of national infrastructure systems. In the forum’s 2007-2008 report, American infrastructure was ranked 6th best in the world.  The 2011-2012 report due in September will show America at No. 16, with South Korea overtaking the United States during the last year, according to a copy of the rankings obtained by Reuters.  The quality of American roads is about on par with those of Malaysia. They lag Hong Kong, whose infrastructure tops the overall list.  It’s not just roads and bridges. The country’s freight rail network and ports also strain to handle demand.  American miners can pay four times what their Australian counterparts do to get coal to port and loaded on a ship, said Jonathan Turnbull, a managing director at investment bank Lazard’s infrastructure group in New York.  That makes it harder to compete in the lucrative Chinese market and highlights the long-term challenge America faces in boosting exports. The United States also lags Europe and many developing nations in measures of cellphone penetration.  “It’s like we’re trying to grow this country’s economy in a headwind,” said Turnbull.  Weak transport infrastructure alone will shave 0.2 percentage points off economic growth this year, said Steven Landau, a researcher in Boston at the Economic Development Research Group.  America spends roughly 2 percent of GDP on infrastructure, about half what it did 50 years ago, according to a U.S. government report from October. Europe spends around 5 percent and China 9 percent.  Because American spending is falling, the drag on growth will grow to 1.3 percentage points in 2020, Landau said.  Washington’s new taste for fiscal austerity — as well as the nation’s rising health care and pension bills — make it unlikely government will come to the rescue any time soon.  Lawmakers are currently discussing a bill to fund highway and rail spending over the next few years.  “It’s hard. There’s not an appetite to increase the funding,” said a Senate aide. Some Republican lawmakers are aiming to cut transportation spending.  Even a proposed infrastructure bank that would marshal private money into big projects would amount to just a fraction of the funds needed to keep the economy humming, the aide said.  At the Ohio River, engineers are working on a project to build a new crossing that would replace the Brent Spence Bridge but don’t have funding for construction, said Stefan Spinosa, an engineer with the Ohio Department of Transportation.  The bridge’s emergency lanes were painted over in the 1980s to make more room for traffic. In June, a man fell to his death after he ran out of gas and was hit by a car while pushing his Camaro over the bridge.  President Barack Obama hopes an infrastructure push could create jobs and help him get reelected next year.  “America used to have the best stuff — best roads, best airports, best seaports,” he said on Thursday. “We’re slipping behind.”",8122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-infrastructure/analysis-infrastructure-woes-a-roadblock-to-growth-idUSTRE77B55920110812

37,UPS,EBay shares slip on concern over U.S. Postal Service closures,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc (EBAY.O) shares dropped more than six percent on Friday on concern the company may be among the most exposed e-commerce players affected by the massive post office closures at the U.S. Postal Service.  The move by the USPS will impact e-commerce because when consumers buy a physical product online it has to be shipped, and often in the U.S. that’s carried out by the USPS.  The USPS is losing billions of dollars a year and Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe told Congress this week that it may default on a $5.5 billion payment due to a retiree health program at the end of September.  Donahoe wants to cut more than 100,000 workers, close thousands of post offices and end Saturday mail delivery.  “Any changes with any of the carriers that impact service are a big deal for e-commerce,” said Dan Weiss, vice president of operations at Shipwire, which stores and ships products for online merchants.  E-commerce has exploded and has taken market share from brick and mortar retailers. Part of that success has been fueled by efforts to make online shopping much like an in-store experience, while offering very cheap and fast delivery.  “Turmoil at the U.S. Postal Service will make it harder to do that,” Weiss told Reuters.  Big Internet retailers, like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), tend to use FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service (UPS.N) rather than the U.S. Postal Service, according to Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, a software provider that helps merchants sell more online.  However, if thousands of post offices close, that will make it harder and more expensive for small and medium-sized online sellers, known as SMB sellers, to ship products, Wingo explained.  “That means eBay has the most exposure,” Wingo added. “That’s where those SMBs live and thrive mostly.”  About 30 percent of eBay sales come from SMB sellers, Wingo estimated.  All the smaller online sellers on eBay’s main marketplace will find it tougher to ship items. They will have to travel further to post offices, or pay more to ship using FedEx or UPS.  EBay shares closed down 6.7 percent at $28.46 on Friday, while Amazon.com declined 2.7 percent to $211.39. The Nasdaq Composite index shed 2.4 percent.  “EBay has historically relied more on small and medium sized businesses, as well as individual proprietors, as a source of activity, listings and transaction revenue,” said Scott Kessler, an Internet analyst Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “It would definitely be one of the companies adversely affected by some type of restructuring involving the U.S. Postal Service.”  Spokeswomen at eBay and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment about the impact of U.S. Postal Service changes.

39,UPS,"UPS offers consumers more options as ""etail"" grows","LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (Reuters) - United Parcel Service is launching a new service in time for the peak holiday shipping season that gives residential consumers — a growing portion of its business — more control over when and how their packages are delivered.  The flexible shipments are a response to consumer frustration with missed packages as “e-tailing,” or purchases made by consumers on the Internet for home delivery, is escalating.  UPS My Choice, a free service, as well as a premium membership, increase chances of successful first-time delivery as consumers get alerts and details on the specific timeframe for a shipment.  Chief Executive Scott Davis declined to estimate likely revenue from the new service, which he said will “make the missed delivery notice extinct, a fossil from the past.”  The world’s largest package delivery company, citing figures from research firm comScore, noted a record $32.6 billion in retail online holiday spending last year.  E-tailing sales could be even bigger this year despite the overall sluggishness of the economy and is a growth segment for UPS, said Alan Gershenhorn, the company’s chief marketing officer.  Davis and Gershenhorn made the announcement in New York on Wednesday, and other UPS executives met with reporters in Louisville, where the company began its first investor meeting in more than three years.  UPS notes an estimate of nearly $279 billion in U.S. online retail sales in 2015, up sharply from $176 billion in 2010, citing a Forrester forecast.  UPS delivers to more than 100 million U.S. residential addresses annually. Residential deliveries driven by e-commerce account for 35 percent of the company’s total domestic shipments.  Fifteen years ago, just 10 percent of the company’s U.S. shipments were to residential customers. UPS averaged 13.3 million package deliveries daily domestically in 2010, of a total global 15.6 million daily average.  The new steps are being taken largely in response to feedback on customer frustration over missed residential shipments, or missing shipments when packages were left without requiring signatures., UPS executives said.

The services, available October 3, will debut in the U.S. and could be expanded globally.  Tim Borrell, senior director of marketing at UPS, said the new services are unique to UPS.  The free My Choice option gives consumers a day’s notice via phone, e-mail or text alerts, giving a four-hour delivery window. Consumers can electronically authorize release of a package that needs a signature, or for a $5 fee they can reroute the package to another address or deliver it to a UPS Store.  UPS My Choice Premium Membership, for a $40 annual fee, adds an online delivery calendar that shows status of the shipment as well as a two-hour delivery window.

41,UPS,"UPS expects record profit, ""slow-growth economy""","LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) Chief Executive Scott Davis said the world’s largest package delivery company is on track for record results this year in the face of the economy’s “bumpy ride” and expectations for sluggish economic growth.  Analysts were concerned that package delivery companies such as UPS and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) would fall short because of the economy and plummeting consumer sentiment. Even as the company repeated its expectations, concerns about near-term economic growth appear to be clouding the reaction of investors.

The company’s outlook, in spite of an unsettled global economy, follows similarly bullish comments by diesel engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) on Tuesday.

Two expected UPS growth drivers are global trade that creates jobs and healthcare logistics, which the company is investing in heavily and which Davis said is in the “early innings of outsourcing.”  “America is fed up and I am hopeful, maybe naively, that we will start seeing some policy decisions” shortly, particularly on global trade policies, Davis said, adding that one UPS job is created for every 22 packages that cross international borders.  “Consumer confidence, consumer trust in Washington, can’t get much lower than it is right now,” Davis said.

Immelt spoke to reporters in New York on Thursday ahead of an event at which the largest U.S. conglomerate announced new investments in cancer research.  Asked whether he was worried about recession, Immelt answered, “No. Just because I see good, decent economic growth everywhere. Decent in the U.S., fairly good outside the U.S.”  Immelt, a top adviser to the Obama administration on the economy and jobs, said the president’s jobs council, which he chairs, would next present proposals that focus on small businesses and entrepreneurs.  He also addressed GE’s plans to buy back the preferred shares it sold to investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) during the financial crisis. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company on Tuesday said it would redeem the shares for $3.3 billion, plus unpaid dividends, on October 17.  “It was good when we did it, it was good when we exited,” Immelt said of the shares, which GE issued at a time when it needed to raise cash to protect its GE Capital finance arm.  GE shares, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were up 2.7 percent in afternoon trading at $16.07.  Though Immelt did not elaborate why he felt U.S. economic growth was decent, his comments square with those from other U.S. business leaders in recent days.  United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Thursday it was on track for record earnings this year. Its chief financial officer, Kurt Kuehn, said the U.S. economy would return to pre-recession growth levels within a year to 18 months.  Engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) said this week North American construction markets are still weak but that the truck market is recovering, and said it would more than double its overall sales from 2010 to 2015.  The confidence of executives at major U.S. industrial and transportation companies may indicate companies are becoming more comfortable managing in times of volatile markets and muted investor confidence.  Speaking to investors in New York on Tuesday, Cummins Chief Operating Officer Tom Linebarger said the company “has demonstrated increased resilience to volatility.”  UPS shares were down 0.2 percent in afternoon trading at $66.02 while Cummins shares were up 3.6 percent at $97.55, both on the New York Stock Exchange.  Immelt spoke at an event to unveil a pair of investments in cancer research. GE said it would invest $1 billion over five years in research and development for cancer detection and treatment technology, with an initial emphasis on breast cancer.  “Competitively it’s very important,” said GE Healthcare Chief Executive John Dineen, who added that GE has used acquisitions to move into new areas of medical diagnostics.  “The world of diagnostics is going beyond traditional radiology into molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine, particularly in the case of cancer. It’s a very heterogenous disease, it’s a very personal disease.”  Dineen also said healthcare institutions in the United States and in emerging markets continue to buy GE’s technology but said, “Europe is more challenged because they’re public healthcare systems.”  The conglomerate will also contribute $50 million to an open innovation challenge, with another initial $50 million coming from venture capital partners. The program aims to identify and market new ideas for diagnosing breast cancer.  GE’s venture capital partners include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Venrock, Mohr Davidow and MPM Capital.

45,UPS,UPDATE 2-Obama's Postal Service plan would cut Saturday mail," * Ends Saturday mail, restructures huge upcoming payment   * Some proposals criticized by key Republican   * Postmaster general thanks president, offers no opinion  (Updates with business impact, lawmaker, USPS reaction)   By Emily Stephenson   WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The Obama administration’s plan to rescue the U.S. Postal Service would allow the agency to end Saturday mail delivery and sell non-postal products, according to documents released on Monday.   The plan, introduced alongside a deficit-reduction package, also would restructure a massive annual payment to prefund retiree health benefits and refund $6.9 billion the mail carrier says it overpaid into a federal retirement fund.   The White House says its plan would save the Postal Service more than $20 billion in the next few years.   “The administration recognizes the enormous value of the U.S. Postal Service to the nation’s commerce and communications, as well as the urgent need for reform to ensure its future viability,” the White House document said.   (View the document here: r.reuters.com/wed83s)   The Postal Service has watched its core business of delivering mail erode as consumers send email and pay bills online. The agency has said it needs to downsize drastically or it will be unable to deliver mail by the end of next summer.   The agency has said it needs to reduce payrolls by about 220,000 by 2015 and is studying thousands of post offices and about 300 processing facilities for possible closure. [ID:nS1E78E16D]   Analysts have said the move to five-day mail delivery could hurt e-commerce businesses that rely on the Postal Service to carry their products to consumers. [ID:nN1E7881QF]   Shares of eBay Inc (EBAY.O) fell more than 6 percent this month on concerns that proposed cuts could raise costs for the site’s small sellers.   The Postal Service contends that weekend mail traffic is too light to support Saturday delivery.   “The president’s proposal would help the Postal Service update its business model to reflect Americans’ changing communications habits,” said Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat.   Many lawmakers in Congress back five-day mail delivery, but little consensus has emerged on how to overhaul the agency. Republican Darrell Issa has refused to consider revamping the prepayment or returning retirement fund money, which the White House plan and several Democratic lawmakers’ bills would do.   Issa, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, offered an amendment on Monday that he says brings the savings in his USPS bill to more than $10 billion per year through cuts and restructuring.   His bill would end Saturday mail and set up groups to close facilities and cut costs if the agency misses payments. The amendment doubles the amount the agency would have to save by closing processing facilities and phases out delivery to front-door mail slots.   Issa’s plan, which allows USPS to override contracts and cut the workforce, could spark arguments in Congress when a subcommittee takes up the bill on Wednesday.   Obama administration officials said their plan supports retirement incentives but not layoffs, which postal unions and many Democratic lawmakers fiercely oppose.   The Postal Service relies on revenue from stamps, packages and other services, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. The agency lost more than $3 billion last quarter.   The agency expects to default on the $5.5 billion retiree health payment due at the end of September unless Congress provides relief. Lawmakers have indicated they want to extend the due date for the payment.

Issa, who is chairman of the powerful House of Representatives Oversight Committee, will announce the amendment on Monday, when the Obama administration is expected to unveil its own strategy for saving the mail carrier.   The Postal Service has watched its core business of delivering mail erode as consumers send email and pay bills online. The agency has said it needs to downsize drastically or it will be unable to deliver mail by the end of next summer.   A draft version of the Issa amendment viewed by Reuters doubles the amount the agency would have to save by closing mail processing facilities, phases out delivery to front-door mail slots, and reduces the postal workforce starting with retirement-eligible workers before laying off other employees.   This adds more than $4 billion in savings, but some provisions contradict USPS policies or could anger lawmakers. A subcommittee will debate and amend, or “mark up,” Issa’s bill on Wednesday.   “Finding greater savings will ultimately give Postal Service leaders greater flexibility to protect core services that are critical for long-term success,” Issa said.   Several bills in Congress take different overhaul approaches. Plans include ending Saturday delivery, allowing the Postal Service to tap into an estimated retirement fund surplus and raising its borrowing limit.   The White House is expected to offer its proposal alongside a deficit reduction package, and at least one House Democrat has said he is thinking about offering a new bill. [ID:nN1E78520T]   The Postal Service relies on revenue from stamps, packages and other services, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. The agency lost more than $3 billion last quarter.   Issa’s bill would end Saturday mail and set up groups to close facilities and cut costs if the agency misses payments to the federal government. He has refused to consider fixes many lawmakers support, such as returning the retirement fund surplus or restructuring a payment to pre-fund retiree health benefits.   “I’m not going to go along with a fictitious story about taxpayers owing the Postal Service money when the facts show that’s simply not the reality,” Issa said.   His amendment could spark new arguments in Congress.   A spokeswoman for the Postal Service said some of the proposals have been discussed before but were not possible under current law.   The boost in required savings from facility closings follows a new Postal Service plan to close processing sites. Some lawmakers supported the proposal, but many have fought planned closings in their districts or states in the past.   Issa’s plan to end mail delivery to front doors matches recommendations of the Postal Service inspector general, who reported potential savings by sticking to curbside mail boxes or “cluster” boxes — multiple receptacles in a common area.   But USPS management said the inspector general’s proposals were unrealistic.   (Read the inspector general's report here: here)   The amendment also would require Alaska to pay for costs incurred delivering to residents in remote parts of the state. The plan likely will see pushback from Alaska lawmakers, who already this year criticized the USPS for considering closing some post offices in rural Alaska.   A reimbursement requirement also could be seen to violate the Postal Service’s ‘universal service’ mandate, the USPS spokeswoman said.   A spokesman for Issa said the bill puts all the possible cuts on the table regardless of expected popularity.   Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe last week told reporters he would continue working with Congress to shape an overhaul.   “I’m glad everybody has a plan because they’re interested. If nobody had a plan I’d be sweating it out,” Donahoe said. “It’s key for all of us to work together to craft up long-term legislation that puts us on good financial footing.”  ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-postalservice-amendment/amendment-seeks-to-save-us-postal-service-10-bln-idUSS1E78H06N20110919
47,UPS,"FedEx pares 2012 outlook, shares hit 2-year low","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the world’s No. 2 package delivery company, cut its full-year profit outlook, citing high fuel costs and a weak global economy, sending its shares down as much as 11 percent to a two-year low.  Chief Executive Fred Smith said he did not expect economic conditions to improve much any time soon, although he did not expect the United States to slip back into recession.  “We expect sluggish economic growth will continue, largely due to a lack of confidence that U.S. and European policy makers will effectively address current economic challenges,” Smith said on a conference call to discuss quarterly results.  The sour mood of the consumer, which is compelling companies around the world to squeeze costs and hold down inventories, remains the biggest drag on the economic growth that FedEx needs to give its business a boost, company executives said on the call on Thursday.  With inventories low, FedEx expects to benefit if there is an uptick in demand in the run-up to the holiday shopping season and retailers needed fast delivery. Much is also riding on robust online orders. But for now, things remain subdued.  “Our customers’ hair is not on fire,” said FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf. “They’re just saying, you know, we’re going to be steady as she goes, so it just feels completely different than it did back in 2008.”  The sheer volume of goods moved by FedEx makes its shipment trends a bellwether for consumer demand and economic growth. The value of packages handled by FedEx’s trucks and planes every year is equivalent to about 4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 1.5 percent of global GDP.  FedEx shares closed down 8.2 percent at $66.58, their biggest one-day fall in about 2-1/2 years and well below their year-high of $98.66 in July.  “The stock price action is clearly telling me that the market doesn’t believe that FedEx can even do the low end of its guidance. They think it’s that bad,” said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.  Donald Porter, an analyst at Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co, said the stock was cheap, and that it would be a good buy if the economy was just going through a slow patch.  But if there’s a recession “I would say you wouldn’t want to own it,” said Porter, whose firm holds shares in rival United Parcel Service (UPS.N).  FedEx, which is also being hurt by a slowdown in international trade reported earnings of $1.46 per share, just beating the average analyst estimate of $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. (For a graphic, see r.reuters.com/kys83s )  To help counter falling volumes in the Express division, its biggest, FedEx said it would raise shipping rates by a net 3.9 percent on average for U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services from January 2.  The company so far has had little resistance to rate increases, the latest of which went into effect this month.  Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx reiterated its $4.2 billion capital expenditure plan for the year ending next May. The company is considering buying about 50 wide-body freighters from Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus EAD.PA to update its fleet to more fuel-efficient models.  At FedEx Express, which represents more than 60 percent of total revenue, domestic revenue per package rose 13 percent in the three months ended August 31, mainly due to higher fuel surcharges and increased weight per package. Average daily package volume dropped 3 percent.  Volume fell 4 percent in the division’s international unit, mainly due to a decline in traffic from Asia. Revenue per package grew 16 percent, helped by favorable exchange rates.  FedEx is the world’s biggest air cargo carrier, a fact that Fred Labatt, director of equity research at South Texas Money Management, said made it more vulnerable than UPS to weakness in international trade.  “The stock is going to be more sensitive than UPS, which has a lot more ground and less air,” he said. “On the other hand, the yields were better pretty much across the board in all the segments, which means they’re getting pricing and the company’s doing a really good job of managing their costs,” said Labatt, whose firm holds FedEx shares.  FedEx said fiscal first-quarter profit, which slightly beat forecasts, rose to $464 million, or $1.46 per share, from $380 million, or $1.20 per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.45 per share.  The company cut its forecast for earnings for the year to May 2012 to $6.25 to $6.75 per share from its June estimate of between $6.35 and $6.85.  Revenue rose 11 percent to $10.52 billion from $9.46 billion a year earlier. That was above the average forecast of $10.32 billion.  With the stock down about 30 percent this year, FedEx said it planned to buy back 5.7 million shares under its existing repurchase authorization.  The Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT has dropped about 19 percent this year while UPS shares have fallen about 14 percent.  UPS, the world’s biggest package delivery company, last week affirmed its call for record earnings in 2011, downplaying the likelihood of a double-dip recession.

Donald Porter, an analyst at Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co, said the stock was cheap, and that it would be a good buy if the economy was just going through a slow patch.   But if there’s a recession “I would say you wouldn’t want to own it,” said Porter, whose firm holds shares in rival United Parcel Service (UPS.N).   FedEx, which is also being hurt by a slowdown in international trade reported earnings of $1.46 per share, just beating the average analyst estimate of $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.

The company so far has had little resistance to rate increases, the latest of which went into effect this month.   Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx reiterated its $4.2 billion capital expenditure plan for the year ending next May.

[ID:nN1E7870CJ]   At FedEx Express, which represents more than 60 percent of total revenue, domestic revenue per package rose 13 percent in the three months ended Aug. 31, mainly due to higher fuel surcharges and increased weight per package. Average daily package volume dropped 3 percent.   Volume fell 4 percent in the division’s international unit, mainly due to a decline in traffic from Asia. Revenue per package grew 16 percent, helped by favorable exchange rates.   FedEx is the world’s biggest air cargo carrier, a fact that Fred Labatt, director of equity research at South Texas Money Management, said made it more vulnerable than UPS to weakness in international trade.   “The stock is going to be more sensitive than UPS, which has a lot more ground and less air,” he said. “On the other hand, the yields were better pretty much across the board in all the segments, which means they’re getting pricing and the company’s doing a really good job of managing their costs,” said Labatt, whose firm holds FedEx shares.   FedEx said fiscal first-quarter profit, which slightly beat forecasts, rose to $464 million, or $1.46 per share, from $380 million, or $1.20 per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.45 per share.   The company cut its forecast for earnings for the year to May 2012 to $6.25 to $6.75 per share from its June estimate of between $6.35 and $6.85.   Revenue rose 11 percent to $10.52 billion from $9.46 billion a year earlier. That was above the average forecast of $10.32 billion.   With the stock down about 30 percent this year, FedEx said it planned to buy back 5.7 million shares under its existing repurchase authorization.   The Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT has dropped about 19 percent this year while UPS shares have fallen about 14 percent.

Chief Executive Fred Smith said he did not expect economic conditions to improve much any time soon, although he did not expect the United States to dip back into recession.   “We expect sluggish economic growth will continue, largely due to a lack of confidence that U.S. and European policy makers will effectively address current economic challenges,” Smith said on a conference call to discuss quarterly results.   The sour mood of the consumer, which is compelling companies around the world to squeeze costs and hold down inventories, remains the biggest drag on the economic growth that FedEx needs to give its business a boost, company executives said on the call on Thursday.   With inventories low, FedEx expects to benefit if there is an uptick in demand in the run-up to the holiday shopping season and retailers needed fast delivery. Much is also riding on robust online orders. But for now, things remain subdued.   “Our customers’ hair is not on fire,” said FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf. “They’re just saying, you know, we’re going to be steady as she goes, so it just feels completely different than it did back in 2008.”   The sheer volume of goods moved by FedEx makes its shipment trends a bellwether for consumer demand and economic growth. The value of packages handled by FedEx’s trucks and planes every year is equivalent to about 4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 1.5 percent of global GDP.   FedEx, which is also being hurt by a slowdown in international trade, reported earnings of $1.46 per share, just beating the average analyst estimate of $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. (For a graphic, see r.reuters.com/kys83s )   FedEx shares were down 8.9 percent at $66.04 in afternoon trading, well below their year-high of $98.66 in July.   “It’s a cheap stock, and if this is a slowdown it’s probably an opportunity to buy.

51,UPS,"Senator McCain offers postal bill, mirrors House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain unveiled a bill on Friday to revamp the U.S. Postal Service, including an end to Saturday mail delivery, the latest of a series of legislative proposals to shore up the financially shaky mail service.  The proposal, which would also create advisory groups to reduce the number of post offices and cut costs, is based on Republican Representative Darrell Issa’s bill in the House of Representatives, a McCain spokesman said.  A Republican-controlled subcommittee advanced the bill Wednesday in a party-line vote.  Mail volumes have plummeted as Americans send email and pay bills online. The Postal Service says it must downsize or it will have to stop delivering mail by the end of next summer.  “Congress can no longer enact temporary fixes that avert financial crisis for only a brief period,” McCain, a Republican, said in a statement. “Congress, the Postal Service, labor unions and the mailing community must be willing to lay everything on the table and make hard choices.”  McCain’s bill leaves out some of Issa’s less popular ideas, such as phasing out delivery to front-door mail slots, requiring Alaska to pay the agency to deliver in rural areas, and boosting the USPS borrowing limit by $10 billion.  Democrats have balked at the idea of allowing the agency to break contracts with unions, and some lawmakers from both parties oppose ending Saturday mail delivery.  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is hammering out a bill its backers say will earn bipartisan support. Moving to five-day mail has been contentious, and a Senate staffer said lawmakers from rural states were particularly concerned about the proposed change.  The Issa and McCain bills do not include proposals favored by lawmakers in both parties to return a $6.9 billion surplus in a Postal Service retirement fund and to restructure a massive annual payment for pre-fund retiree health benefits.  The Postal Service, which receives no taxpayer revenue to fund daily operations, says it will default on a $5.5 billion retiree health payment due on September 30.  A report issued on Thursday by the agency’s regulator argued Congress should adjust the amount of the pre-payments to a level the service can afford.

After touring the United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) hub in Louisville, hometown of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Geithner said infrastructure spending in the $447 billion jobs plan will help relieve transportation bottlenecks that cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars a year.   “It makes companies more competitive,” he said. “It lowers their costs. It’s like a tax cut.”   On Thursday, President Obama paid a visit to nearby Cincinnati in the backyard of Republican House Speaker John Boehner to ratchet up pressure for congressional approval of the jobs plan, using an aging bridge as a prop.   Clogged U.S. roads cost the economy $80 billion a year in lost productivity and wasted fuel, the Treasury Department said in a statement. Flight delays cost another $33 billion in lost productivity.   UPS estimates the package deliverer loses $100 million for every five minutes its fleet of trucks is stuck in traffic.   “The business of America is business but there’ll be less business for the country as a whole unless we do a better job of fixing American infrastructure,” Geithner said.   UPS Chairman Scott Davis, who accompanied Geithner on his tour through the maze of conveyors, chutes and bar-code scanners inside the air hub, urged the president and Congressional leaders to reach bipartisan solutions to put people back to work.   Davis said UPS had invested $2 billion in its Louisville air hub in recent years based on a belief that there will be more growth in the world economy during the next decade than there was during the last decade.   “So we need capacity,” he said. “The same goes for our country.”   “Infrastructure repair — repairing of roads and airports — does not make the government bigger,” Geithner said. “It just makes the economy work better for business.”   In an ABC World News interview, Geithner said there is a very good chance Obama’s jobs plan will win Congressional approval. “If you listen carefully, beneath all the political rhetoric, I think you see very broad support for the tax measures the president proposed,” Geithner said.   “There’s no reason not to do them. They’ve been bipartisan in the past. There’s no reason not to do them except for politics, Geithner said.   During his visit to Kentucky, Geithner also reiterated his hope that the European Union move quickly to resolve its debt crisis.   “We’ve got a very simple message for Europe and I think they are moving — they are certainly trying to signal — more commitment to put more force behind their efforts to try to deal with the financial crisis they are facing,” he said.

56,UPS,U.S. to print stamps with images of living people," * Postal Service asking for names of people to be honored   * In past, people on stamps had to have been dead 5 years   * Move comes as USPS faces financial trouble   By Molly O’Toole   WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Americans will soon be stamping their mail with the faces of living figures, the United States Postal Service said on Monday.   The new rule for honoring individuals on stamps replaces a former policy requiring a person to be dead at least five years before being memorialized on postage, reduced from 10 years in 2007.   “The rule is changed as of today,” Stephen Kearney, USPS executive director of stamp services, told Reuters on Monday. “And we hope to have at least the first living subject on a stamp in 2012.”   Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said in a statement: “This change will enable us to pay tribute to individuals for their achievements while they are still alive to enjoy the honor.”   Last year USPS sold 12.5 billion stamps, 700 million of which were commemorative, according to Kearney.   He said USPS thinks the move “will take stamps, which are already important and relevant to a lot of people ... and get more people involved, particularly young people.”   The Postal Service is inviting members of the public to submit their top five choices for living individuals they would like to see on a stamp via social media sites Facebook and Twitter — and, “as always,” according to the USPS website, by mail.   The new stamp policy comes as personal mail use declines and budgetary obstacles mount for the Postal Service.   Republican Senator John McCain unveiled a bill on Friday to revamp USPS, including an end to Saturday mail delivery.   The Postal Service, which receives no taxpayer revenue to fund daily operations, says it faces default on a $5.5 billion retiree health payment due on Sept. 30.   Kearney said the Postal Service makes over $200 million a year from stamp collecting.   “But it’s not the main reason to do it,” Kearney said. “(It’s) serious money, but a fairly small proportion of the financial situation we’re in.”  (Editing by Jerry Norton and Eric Beech)   ",9262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stamps/u-s-to-print-stamps-with-images-of-living-people-idUSS1E78P14820110926

58,UPS,DEALTALK-Brad Jacobs: a U.S. transport 'serial acquirer'," * Jacobs aims to build $4-$5 bln business in a few years   * XPO Logistics to be his acquisition platform   * Jacobs to make small buys initially, then build scale    By A. Ananthalakshmi	   Oct 6 (Reuters) - Bradley Jacobs sees a pioneering role in the U.S. transport business: to be an acquisition juggernaut and create a multi-billion dollar company in a $3 trillion global industry.	   To narrow that down, the 55-year-old entrepreneur and investor wants to transform a $158 million company, XPO Logistics , into a $4-$5 billion business in just a few years, mostly through acquisitions.	   Ambitious? Yes. 	   But industry experts think Jacobs’ “serial acquirer” approach will get him there — just as it did with United Rentals and United Waste Systems, companies he founded and swiftly built into market leaders.	   “It’s going to be a little bit of a snowball effect,” said Ken Novotny, an industry banker at Morgan Keegan.	   “He’s going to start with something that’s a nice core and then as he rolls it down the hill, it’s going to continue to pick up momentum both in quality and size.”	   Jacobs already has the platform. 	   In June, he invested some $150 million in XPO Logistics and took over as chief executive of the third-party logistics provider.	   XPO has about $72 million in cash on its balance sheet, and a $10 million credit line from its bankers.	   Speaking to Reuters, Jacobs said deals he does in the near term would be similar in size to his XPO investment, and most likely involve buying private companies.	   “The first step is to double the size of the company. We can do that with the financial means we have right now, without raising another dollar,” he said, adding banks are willing to raise XPO’s credit line.	   Jacobs is targeting four areas in the transport business: truck brokerage, freight forwarding, expedited and intermodal. XPO is already present in the first three.	   The transportation industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of thousands of companies offering a variety of services — and more opportunity for consolidation.	   The U.S. truck brokerage business, for example, is worth $50 billion a year and has more than 10,000 operators — but only 25 have revenue above $200 million.	   The transport industry’s big guns are UPS and FedEx  , with annual revenues of $50 billion and $40 billion respectively. The vast majority of firms have just a few million dollars in revenue.	   XPO’s large-cap rivals include CH Robinson Worldwide  and Expeditors International of Washington .	   Bankers and analysts expect Jacobs to start with small acquisitions, and then pick up scale. Novotny said the sweet spot for Jacobs initially would be $30-$75 million. 	   Jacobs dropped out of university in the late-1970s — he was studying music and math — to start an oil brokerage business.	   In 1989, he founded United Waste Systems and, largely through buying some 200 companies in 8 years, turned it into one of the top garbage collectors in the United States. He sold the business, now Waste Management , for about $2.5 billion in 1997.	   That year, he founded United Rentals and, within a year, transformed it into the world’s largest equipment rental firm in a year — sometimes averaging two acquisitions a week.	   By 1999, Jacobs was worth an estimated $590 million, and missed making it on to the Fortune 400 list by a whisker.	   Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management offered $6.6 billion for United Rentals in 2007, but later withdrew the bid. 	   Michael Jesselson, who has worked with Jacobs for about 30 years and sits on XPO’s board, is confident Jacobs will expand the business dramatically in a short time. He reckons Jacobs can hit the $4-$5 billion target within 5 years, or 7 if the current market uncertainty drags on.	   Jesselson, who also invested early in United Waste Systems, said Jacobs studies his industries thoroughly before putting up the money. He took a long, hard look at waste management over two years before investing, he said.  	   Regulatory filings show Jacobs and his private equity firm met with XPO in late-2010. A deal was announced only in June 2011.	   Potential roadblocks, though, include raising capital quickly, and the fragmented nature of the transport industry — which Jacobs chose ahead of government services, healthcare and education.	   “You’re not going to be able to pick up a whole bunch of small companies immediately and get large. You have to make bigger acquisitions,” said Morgan Keegan’s Novotny.	   “If I had $1 billion in cash, I could spend it on good acquisitions within a few months. However, I expect our pace will be more measured,” Jacobs told XPO shareholders recently.	  (Reporting by A.

59,UPS,UPDATE 2-TNT Express warns on profits as demand sags," * Aims for 2011 EMEA underlying EBIT margin of 8-9 pct   * Targets H2 EBIT result in Asia in line with H1   * Plans value assessment for Brazilian operations in Q4   * Shares down 4.6 percent to record low   (Adds analyst comment, details, shares)	   By Greg Roumeliotis	   AMSTERDAM, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Dutch freight and delivery firm TNT Express issued a profit warning on Thursday as the global economic slowdown led more customers to snub air transport in favour of cheaper shipping.	   TNT Express, which listed in May after it split from Dutch mail group PostNL , cut its 2011 outlook and said it saw revenue pressure in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in the third quarter as well as weaker demand in Asia.	   The news came in an unscheduled trading update, knocking the shares down 4.6 percent to 4.63 euros by 0954 GMT, the worst performers in Amsterdam’s bluechip index , which was up 1.4 percent. The stock first traded at 8.9 euros on May 26.	   Shares in PostNL, which still owns a 29.9 percent stake in TNT Express, gained 1.2 percent.	   Just last week TNT Express Chief Executive Marie-Christine Lombard, who also issued a profit warning in April, told a Dutch newspaper that economic woes had not hit the firm in Europe.  	   “Clearly a highly negative statement, things just seem to keep getting worse for this company,” Royal Bank of Scotland analysts wrote in a note.	   The company, which is relying on cost cuts to cushion the downturn, revised its 2011 outlook for the EMEA region to muted revenue growth with an underlying operating margin of 8 to 9 percent. In August it had guided for modest growth with an underlying operating margin of at least 9 percent, in line with last year.	   In Asia Pacific, weak demand weighed on the firm’s pricing and left spare aircraft capacity. It now expects the second-half operating result there to be in line with the first half, which saw a loss. In August, it had guided for a partial recovery.	   It also warned that other regions, excluding the Americas, would perform somewhat below the prior year.	   ASIA-EUROPE ROUTES	   TNT Express acquired Chinese freight firm Hoau in 2007 and has expanded in Asia by following its European customers. But the latest financial downturn has hit volumes and competitor FedEx last month also flagged lower traffic in Asia.  	   The International Air Transport Association said last month that Asia Pacific was the region that had seen the most dramatic downturn compared to 2010 and that, on a global scale, air freight had stagnated since the start of 2011. 	   But some carriers have fine-tuned capacity better than others. TNT Express’s main European rival Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) nudged up its 2011 outlook in August while UPS  has guided for a record profit this year.  	   Apart from the unwillingness of its clients to pay for pricey air transport, TNT Express has been grappling with operational issues in Brazil, where a botched integration of acquired businesses has led to a loss of clients and a drag on earnings.	   Lombard has set a second-half 2012 deadline to turn the Brazilian operations around. On Thursday the company said that a value assessment would take place in the fourth quarter of 2011.	   TNT Express reiterated that its planned cost savings for the year of about 50 million euros were under way and that it expected related charges and write-offs of 45-65 million euros. It is due to publish third-quarter earnings on Oct. 31.

60,UPS,UPS sees higher profits in slow-growing economy,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service (UPS.N) reported a higher quarterly profit as increased pricing, cost cutting and technology improvements helped compensate for domestic shipping volume dulled by a sluggish economy, and it affirmed its outlook for record 2011 results. The company’s shares slid more than 2 percent in midday trading, giving back some of a more than 15 percent rally from this month’s lows, with the pace of consumer holiday demand still in question. The U.S. economy appears to have stabilized and is growing slowly, after concern about a possible double-dip recession stifled consumer demand earlier this year, UPS said. U.S. consumer confidence sank to a 2-1/2-year low in October on worries about jobs and income. “Their tone was clearly more positive than it was last quarter, but ... there’s still some uncertainty,” said analyst Kevin Sterling of BB&T; Capital Markets in Richmond, Virginia. “Given the run in the stock price in October, there’s probably some profit-taking today,” he said. “They didn’t come out and say, hey, things are great and we’re raising our guidance. They said things are OK, we’re UPS and we’re weathering the storm.” The company is well-positioned to handle a run-up in volume from customers with lean inventories ahead of the peak holiday season, analysts agree. The final two weeks before Christmas could have a “meaningful” effect on fourth-quarter results if consumer demand picks up and retailers low on inventory need fast shipment of goods, Chief Executive Officer Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call. “Over the last month or so, we are starting to see better economic numbers, so there is more optimism out there, and that could turn things around,” Davis said. “We are still expecting a slow-growth economy, but I don’t think it is as negative as people were thinking two and three months ago.” The company’s shares were down 1.7 percent at $69.66 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT fell 1.8 percent. (For a graphic on UPS earnings, click link.reuters.com/qup64s ) UPS has forecast record earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.40 this year as it cut costs and raised shipping rates in the face of a slowly expanding global economy. UPS and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are considered economic bellwethers because of the volume of packages they handle. The value of packages handled by UPS’s trucks and planes each year is equivalent to about 6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 2 percent of global GDP. NAIL-BITER Domestic shipping volume averaged 12.74 million packages a day, little changed from 12.73 million a year ago. Operating margins improved on higher yields, or revenue per package, as well as on more efficient networks, the company said. Core pricing, excluding fuel surcharge, rose by an average of 3 percent domestically in the quarter, UPS said. “Domestic margins coming in better than expected, especially given further uncertainty in terms of volumes, underscores the investment opportunity here,” said Peter Nesvold, Jefferies & Co. analyst. If the company can keep raising prices around this pace, “that little bit of pricing goes a long way in terms of earnings over the next several years,” he added. Most transport companies have been reporting freight volume at or slightly above very low expectations, analysts said. Holiday shipping season is “more of a nail-biter than it used to be,” UPS’s Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said in an interview. Many consumers now wait until the final days to order online, making it harder for the company to gauge aircraft and other transport needs. E-commerce accounts for more than one-third of UPS’s total domestic shipments. FedEx on Monday forecast record holiday shipments, due mainly to online shopping, and said it plans to add 20,000 seasonal workers to help handle the extra volume. In September, FedEx cut its full-year profit forecast and called for ongoing sluggish economic growth. Responding to slow exports from Asia to the United States, UPS said it had cut capacity there by 10 percent. But it expects volume to pick up in the fourth quarter, boosted by shipments of new technology product launches. International shipping volume averaged 2.34 million a day, up from 2.24 million. “Asia reflected kind of the chaos we felt we were in during August in the U.S.,” Kuehn said. “Given the absolute stalemate in D.C., the concerns about perhaps a double dip, it really did slow down demand. Our aircraft reflected that coming out of Asia.” UPS has also been pushing for trade agreements that it says will open the way for more exports. Davis, who is on U.S. President Barack Obama’s Export Council, has said that one UPS job is created for every 22 packages that cross international borders. On October 21, Obama signed free trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia that are estimated to boost exports by around $13 billion annually. The world’s largest package delivery company said third-quarter net income rose to $1.04 billion, or $1.06 per share, from $991 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.05 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 18 percent to $13.17 billion, matching the analysts’ average forecast.

63,UPS,"Life credits put a price tag on experience, help older workers","(Reuters) - Jeff Gentz, a pilot for United Parcel Service, wanted to get his college diploma if he was going to keep lecturing his teenage daughter about the importance of a university degree. So Gentz, a 42-year-old father of four in Neenah, Wisconsin, joined a growing number of mid-career students who are seizing new opportunities from universities and employers to receive college credit for their experience outside the classroom. The Obama administration is pressuring universities to offer more help to these adult students in order to boost graduation rates and to improve the quality of the nation’s workforce amid persistently high unemployment. More schools are embracing these “life credits” for competitive reasons, too, since adult students are projected to make up a growing share of undergraduate enrollment in the coming years. The number of colleges that award credit for life experience has increased 35 percent since 2004 to more than 2,000 schools last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. And a growing number of employers, such as Verizon and Starbucks, are offering to pay for workers’ prior learning assessments in order to make their tuition reimbursement dollars go further. ""This saves students time and money, and it allows employers to save money by not having to pay for courses their workers don't need,"" says Mark Campbell, vice president of learningcounts.org, a credit-advisory site launched by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) in March. The idea of getting college credit from prior learning has been around since the 1970s, and it’s a staple at many community colleges, state universities and for-profit schools. Still, only half of colleges offer some form of prior-learning assessment, according to CAEL, and many of those are limited to certain programs or difficult to access. These life credits cover a wide range of work experience, corporate training, military service, volunteer activities and even travel. Many programs require students to compile lengthy portfolios, including essays on what they learned, letters from bosses and co-workers and other supporting documentation that professors then evaluate. Students should do their homework on prior learning because rules and procedures vary widely as do the costs involved. And keep in mind there’s no guarantee a school will grant these credits even if students assemble the evidence. The first step is to contact a specific college to see what type of assessment they provide. For instance, LaGuardia Community College, part of the City University of New York, offers a one-credit, 13-week course on how to build a portfolio that costs $150. It’s no additional cost to submit a portfolio for evaluation for students already enrolled. At the University of Wisconsin in Superior, students are charged $350 for a similar, one-credit class and they pay $75 for every three credits that are requested. CAEL’s Learning Counts charges $500 for a six-week, online course and then an additional $250 per portfolio submitted. Each portfolio for a specific subject area can earn one to six credits. So far, 130 students have taken the CAEL course and 75 percent have earned college credit, Campbell says. Students should also explore whether their employer will cover these upfront costs through a tuition-assistance program. Next, students should determine if a school caps how many prior-learning credits can be used. Some schools limit it to as few as 10 credits while others allow up to 30 or 40 credits from prior experience. Most universities require a minimum number of courses be taken at the school in order to graduate. Some bigger-name institutions are starting to acknowledge the skills workers bring to campus and grant them another form of credit — course waivers. Prashanthi Sylada, a human resources manager in College Park, Maryland, earned waivers on three courses as she completed her master’s of business administration last year at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. To qualify, she got a letter from her manager attesting to her experience and training, and she wrote an essay summarizing what she had already learned. Gentz, the UPS pilot, dropped out of the University of North Dakota in 1988. By 2004, it was rare for UPS to hire pilots without a four-year degree, and Gentz worried about his job prospects if he lost his pilot’s license due to a medical problem. He went back for his bachelor’s degree at the University of Wisconsin at Superior and earned 42 credits from previous experience. He turned in a 97-page portfolio to support his credit request. “It was very time-consuming, but it was well worth it,” says Gentz, who graduated in 2007. “I wanted my kids to see their old man walk across the stage and get his diploma.” —- The author is a Reuters contributor.

64,UPS,"UPS profit tops forecasts, sees 2012 growth","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service (UPS.N) posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast 9 percent to 15 percent growth this year as solid U.S. demand and growing e-commerce shipments offset an uneven global economy. The flood of shopping on-line and by using a mobile device will keep shipping demand elevated this year at UPS, which has adapted technology to cut costs and curbed capacity in regions where trade flows are slower, analysts said. Share prices fell on profit-taking, and the company said it remained “guarded” about Asia exports to the United States, while expecting “euro headwinds” to challenge first-quarter results. UPS shares have risen 6.5 percent over the last three months, about triple the advance in the S&P; 500 index. The world’s largest package delivery company on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter profit down sharply as the result of a change in how it accounts for pension expenses. But factoring out that change, profit would have risen, helped by strong growth in the company’s consumer business — driven by online shopping during the recent holiday season — which overshadowed less-robust growth outside the United States, analysts said. “The main driver is the U.S. economy and the ground business, with e-commerce performing especially well,” said Matt Collins, an Edward Jones analyst in St. Louis, noting that at the same time the company managed capacity to keep profitable as Asia exports stayed slow. “They’ve done a nice job adjusting to a slower growth environment. Whether it’s new product offerings or cost controls, they’ve been able to deliver,” he said. Internet and catalog orders propelled UPS shipments during its record peak holiday season to nearly 500 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, even as sales for traditional bricks-and-mortar stores were mixed, the company’s Chief Executive Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call. The company delivered 1.13 billion packages in the quarter, 3.6 percent from the same period a year ago. “Clearly we saw a strengthening economy and a strong holiday season and frankly it stayed fairly strong into January,” Davis said. “The U.S., while I wouldn’t call it a robust economy right now, I do think a small package market is performing better than we would have thought four or five months ago. Meanwhile, a measure of consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in January on job market concerns. Collins, who noted that revenue was slightly below estimates, said cyclical shares are down on Tuesday with another batch of soft economic reports. “Chicago PMI, consumer confidence and housing were all underwhelming today, so that certainly didn’t help. “The stock has had a really strong run, as has the market,” added Donald Porter, sector specialist at Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co, which holds UPS shares. “From an absolute basis, UPS is expensive. If I was an absolute investor, with the run it has had, I don’t know if I would be piling in,” he said. “For a long-term holder, though, it’s a great well-run company with very high barriers to entry (for competition), that participates in international growth and deserves a premium multiple.” Atlanta-based UPS set an initial 2012 profit target of $4.75 to $5 per share for 2012, which would represent 9 percent to 15 percent growth over 2011 levels and at its midpoint is above the $4.80 per share analysts had expected. Davis said UPS expects continued strong demand in its home market. “The U.S. is one of the few economies where expectations are greater than last year,” he said. UPS said it cut capacity 10 percent in the second half of the year in Asia from the early part of the year. Asia exports were flat in the quarter, driven by intra-Asia and Asia-to-Europe activity that offset lower exports to the United States. UPS said it plans to spend $2.2 billion this year on capital improvements — about 4 percent of revenue — including the expansion of its European hub in Germany that will make it UPS’s largest facility investment outside of the United States. “We’re continuing to show good growth in Europe, up by mid- to upper single-digits on shipments within Europe,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said in an interview. UPS delivered 15.7 million domestic packages per day, on average, up from 15.1 million in the fourth quarter 2010, and 2.6 million international packages, up from 2.54 million. “Better-than-expected margins in both domestic and supply chain offset margin weakness in international(segments). But international volume growth, export volumes, were consistent with expectations,” said Benjamin Hartford, a senior research associate at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. In December, smaller rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) reported above-forecast quarterly profits on on-line sales, cost curbs, fuel surcharges and other higher rates paid by shippers. It also announced a fleet upgrade meant to shave fuel costs. UPS said fourth-quarter net income fell to $725 million, or 74 cents a share, from $1.025 billion, or $1.02 a share, a year ago. Its results for the just-ended quarter included a $527 million charge related to a change in how it accounts for pension expenses. After adjusting for the pension-accounting shift, profit came to $1.28 a share, above the $1.26 analysts, on average, had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UPS’s decision to adopt “mark to market” pension accounting brings its practices in line with other major U.S. employers, including Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N). The shift can give companies a quick boost by removing billions of dollars in old pension losses from operating results, and bring companies closer to international accounting standards for pensions that become effective in 2013. Fourth-quarter revenue at UPS rose 6 percent to $14.2 billion, compared with the $14.4 billion expected by analysts. UPS shares are off 1 percent at $75.36 in midday trading on Tuesday, with Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT off 0.3 percent and FedEx down 1 percent. The value of packages that UPS handles in its trucks and planes is equivalent to 6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 2 percent of global GDP, making it an economic bellwether.

67,UPS,TNT rejects bid from UPS; talks continue,"AMSTERDAM/NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) is in talks to acquire Dutch delivery company TNT Express NV TNTE.AS, which has already rejected a 4.9 billion euro ($6.45 billion) bid worth 42 percent more than its current market value. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, has long been rumored to have an interest in TNT, which would help it expand in Europe, especially Britain, France and Germany in addition to the Netherlands. About two-thirds of TNT’s revenue is from European customers, but it also has been steadily growing in China, Brazil and India. UPS would also be taking out a European rival that has shown a willingness to undercut competitors on price. TNT’s revenue has declined as the weak global economy spurred customers to seek cheaper shipping options and some analysts said it is not big enough to compete with the world’s major delivery companies. “We are open to advancing the talks, and we continue to be in discussions,” TNT spokesman Ernst Moeksis said on Friday. UPS offered 9 euros per share for all outstanding TNT stock, the two companies said on Friday after the Dutch company’s shares ended the day at 6.343 euros. The total price is close to the 5 billion euros analysts recently assigned to TNT. The bid from UPS came about nine months after TNT split from delivery company PostNL and as shareholders pressure TNT to shake up its board and boost shareholder value, including pursuing a potential takeover. Some analysts said the UPS proposal sets the price floor for a company that could also be attractive to others, including U.S. rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), which has a smaller presence in Europe. “This thing just bled and bled, and UPS and FedEx are just sitting back licking their chops,” said Kevin Sterling, a transportation analyst at BB&T; Capital Markets. “UPS is now the first to show their hand.” FedEx officials declined to comment on Friday. FedEx shares fell 2.12 percent to close at $92.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. UPS shares ended flat at $76.76. Andre Mulder, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, said FedEx’s European market share of 2 percent is much lower than key rivals, so he had expected FedEx to move in on TNT. FedEx “has zero debt and could easily cough up this amount if it could find the banks to lend it the money,” Mulder said, noting TNT is the market share leader in Europe with 18 percent. UPS has 10 percent, the analyst said. Some analysts were not convinced TNT could fetch a significantly higher price than UPS offered. “I find it difficult to believe that there’s going to be a significant bidding war for these assets,” said Art Hatfield, managing director in equity research at Morgan Keegan & Co, based in Memphis. “It’s a good offer.” UPS officials made it clear the company has discussed more than one offer already with TNT. UPS said the 4.9 billion euro bid was a “revised, increased and comprehensive proposal to acquire the entire issued share capital of TNT.” It cautioned there was no certainty any agreement will be reached. Europe is UPS’s largest market outside of the United States, accounting for $6 billion or half of the company’s annual international revenue. Total revenue for UPS last year was $53 billion. UPS is in the midst of a $200 million expansion of its Cologne hub, and has recently grown through acquisitions. Earlier this week, UPS announced the purchase of Brussels-based Kiala in a bid to boost European e-commerce capabilities. Other purchases on the continent include the 2005 acquisition of parcel carrier Lynx Express Ltd in Britain and messenger service Stolica in Poland. A TNT purchase would dwarf those deals. Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services raised concerns on Friday, saying it could dent UPS’s AA- corporate credit rating. “UPS has provided no details on how it would finance such a transaction,” the ratings agency said. “We have placed our ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications because of concerns that if the transaction goes forward, UPS’ credit metrics could deteriorate.” UPS carries about $11 billion in debt on its balance sheet and could tap credit lines for $12 billion in additional debt. The company has $4.1 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in marketable securities. The Atlanta-based UPS is swooping in as TNT faces mounting pressure from investors to shift gears. Its shares have fallen about 38 percent from a high of 10.20 euros on May 10, 2011, when TNT split from PostNL. Bowing to pressure from activist shareholders, TNT Express agreed this month to appoint several new members to its supervisory board, including two candidates proposed by American investor Jana Partners. Jana and Canada’s Alberta Investment Management Corp (AIMCO) have a combined stake in TNT Express of just over 5 percent. Jana called for an overhaul of the TNT Express supervisory board in December, including replacing the chairman, and urged the company to explore a sale. PostNL is the largest shareholder in TNT Express - with 29.9 percent - and has taken impairments of more than 700 million euros on its stake in recent months. The company declined to comment on the UPS bid, but it has already indicated it would support a possible takeover. One TNT shareholder who declined to be identified said: “My reading of it is that UPS is prepared to offer more. That’s why they are still in talks with TNT’s management.” ",2182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tntexpress-ups/tnt-rejects-bid-from-ups-talks-continue-idUSTRE81G1UJ20120218
68,UPS,UPDATE 5-TNT rejects bid from UPS; talks continue,"* UPS offered 4.9 billion euros ($6.45 billion * Bid of 9 euros per share represented a 42 pct premium * UPS shares little changed By Roberta Cowan and Lynn Adler AMSTERDAM/NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc is in talks to acquire Dutch delivery company TNT Express NV, which has already rejected a 4.9 billion euro ($6.45 billion) bid worth 42 percent more than its current market value. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, has long been rumored to have an interest in TNT, which would help it expand in Europe, especially Britain, France and Germany in addition to the Netherlands. About two-thirds of TNT’s revenue is from European customers, but it also has been steadily growing in China, Brazil and India. UPS would also be taking out a European rival that has shown a willingness to undercut competitors on price. TNT’s revenue has declined as the weak global economy spurred customers to seek cheaper shipping options and some analysts said it is not big enough to compete with the world’s major delivery companies. “We are open to advancing the talks, and we continue to be in discussions,” TNT spokesman Ernst Moeksis said on Friday. UPS offered 9 euros per share for all outstanding TNT stock, the two companies said on Friday after the Dutch company’s shares ended the day at 6.343 euros. The total price is close to the 5 billion euros analysts recently assigned to TNT. The bid from UPS came about nine months after TNT split from delivery company PostNL and as shareholders pressure TNT to shake up its board and boost shareholder value, including  pursuing a potential takeover. Some analysts said the UPS proposal sets the price floor for a company that could also be attractive to others, including U.S. rival FedEx Corp, which has a smaller presence in Europe. “This thing just bled and bled, and UPS and FedEx are just sitting back licking their chops,” said Kevin Sterling, a transportation analyst at BB&T; Capital Markets. “UPS is now the first to show their hand.” FedEx officials declined to comment on Friday. FedEx shares fell 2.12 percent to close at $92.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. UPS shares ended flat at $76.76. Andre Mulder, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, said FedEx’s European market share of 2 percent is much lower than key rivals, so he had expected FedEx to move in on TNT. FedEx “has zero debt and could easily cough up this amount if it could find the banks to lend it the money,” Mulder said, noting TNT is the market share leader in Europe with 18 percent. UPS has 10 percent, the analyst said. Some analysts were not convinced TNT could fetch a significantly higher price than UPS offered. “I find it difficult to believe that there’s going to be a significant bidding war for these assets,” said Art Hatfield, managing director in equity research at Morgan Keegan & Co, based in Memphis. “It’s a good offer.” UPS officials made it clear the company has discussed more than one offer already with TNT. UPS said the 4.9 billion euro bid was a “revised, increased and comprehensive proposal to acquire the entire issued share capital of TNT.” It cautioned  there was no certainty any agreement will be reached. Europe is UPS’s largest market outside of the United States, accounting for $6 billion or half of the company’s annual international revenue. Total revenue for UPS last year was $53 billion. UPS is in the midst of a $200 million expansion of its Cologne hub, and has recently grown through acquisitions. Earlier this week, UPS announced the purchase of Brussels-based Kiala in a bid to boost European e-commerce capabilities. Other purchases on the continent include the 2005 acquisition of parcel carrier Lynx Express Ltd in Britain and messenger service Stolica in Poland. A TNT purchase would dwarf those deals.

TNT said it took an impairment charge of 104 million euros on its business in Brazil, where it has struggled to integrate acquisitions, and a 45 million euro impairment on aircraft. “We will reduce our exposure to fixed intercontinental capacity through cooperation agreements with leading airlines and we will explore partnership opportunities for our domestic activities in Brazil and China,” Chief Executive Marie-Christine Lombard said in a statement.

72,UPS,TNT Express not expecting bid from FedEx-source,"* FedEx has not signaled intent to make a counterbid-source * FedEx sees strategic value in TNT, but price high-source * Analysts say FedEx could scoop up divested assets By Sophie Sassard and Soyoung Kim LONDON/NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Dutch delivery firm TNT Express is not expecting U.S. rival FedEx  to trump a 4.9 billion euros ($6.5 billion) takeover bid from United Parcel Services, a source close to TNT said on Thursday. TNT last week rejected a 9 euros per share cash offer from UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, but is still in talks with its U.S. suitor. TNT’s shares jumped to an all-time high of 10.24 euros this week partly on hopes that FedEx, which has flirted with the idea of buying TNT for years, might trigger a bidding war. “The last discussion we had with them (FedEx) didn’t give us the impression that they were ready to make a move”, the source said, adding he had sounded out FedEx’s intentions very recently. While FedEx sees strategic value in combining with TNT, it feels the price has become too expensive to do a deal at this point, another source close to the situation said. The sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media. FedEx and TNT declined to comment. Some analysts said FedEx could be better off scooping up assets that competition regulators might require UPS to sell if it succeeds in winning over its Dutch target. Sources close to the talks between UPS and TNT said a combined firm would need to make significant asset sales in Europe - the Netherlands, Britain and Germany in particular - to win regulatory approval. “You could see some assets that are displaced or some market share opportunities that come from the deal as well that could benefit FedEx,” said Benjamin Hartford, senior research associate at Robert W. Baird. FedEx has the financial wherewithal to make a counter bid for TNT. But its lower valuation than UPS could make a deal more difficult to sell to its shareholders, a banker familiar with FedEx’s thinking said. Its smaller presence in Europe also means it may not be able to make as many cost savings. UPS shares trade at 9.8 times current-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), while FedEx trades at just above 6 times, Reuters Starmine data shows. With a market capitalisation of $28.5 billion, FedEx also has a weaker balance sheet than the $73 billion UPS. FedEx has a negligible 3 percent market share in European delivery, a third of what UPS claims, making it harder for FedEx to make savings from a deal. TNT is the market leader in Europe with an 18 percent share, followed by Deutsche Posts’ DHL at 15 percent. “It’s hard for FedEx. UPS has been watching this for a really long time, and they’re pretty well positioned to buy this,” said one sector banker who is not directly involved in the situation. “You could argue that FedEx gets involved only to make it more expensive for UPS, but I don’t think FedEx will make a proposal if they don’t have the intent to really buy that.” The source close to TNT thought the most likely scenario was that UPS would eventually sweeten its offer to win over TNT. Deutsche Bank analysts said FedEx could focus instead on making several smaller acquisitions in select markets or explore a joint venture with DHL, where FedEx would leverage DHL’s presence in Europe and DHL could leverage FedEx’s strength in the United States. FedEx has said in the past it plans to grow in Europe organically and with small “tuck-in” purchases. Its focus over the next 10 and 20 years has been and will continue to be developing in Asia, according to analysts. “We really think the company has been more focused on trying to find higher growth regions than Europe, which we would expect to grow at a pace no greater than what the U.S. would grow,” said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker.",2232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/tnt-fedex/tnt-express-not-expecting-bid-from-fedex-source-idUSL5E8DN3P120120223
73,UPS,Dutch mail firm PostNL in spotlight over TNT,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - When Dutch mail firm PostNL NV (PTNL.AS) reports results on Monday it will be its comments on a multi-billion euro bid situation that are most likely to grab investors’ attention. PostNL is the biggest single investor in freight and delivery firm TNT Express NV TNTE.AS, subject of a 9 euros per share approach from United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N). TNT on February 17 rejected UPS’s offer, worth a total of 4.9 billion euros ($6.5 billion), but the two are still in takeover talks and some investors are hoping UPS will sweeten its offer. PostNL, which owns 29.9 percent of TNT, has good reason to welcome a suitor. After it hived off TNT in May last year, TNT shares fell from a high of 10.2 euros to as low as 4.46 euros, forcing PostNL to write down the value of its stake by more than 700 million euros ($932 million). The six-month lock-up period that prevented PostNL from selling its TNT stake ended in December and the Dutch postal group had already made clear it would sell the stake when “advantageous and appropriate. So when activist shareholders including U.S.-based Jana Partners and Canada’s Alberta Investment Management Corp (AIMCO)started agitating for TNT to shake up its management, appoint new supervisory board members, improve its performance and consider a possible sale, PostNL also stood to gain. Its stock jumped on news of the talks with UPS and has surged more than 40 percent from a February 17 close of 3.31 euros. A sale of TNT or turnaround in its performance is all the more critical because of the tough environment PostNL faces. According to the average forecast of analysts in a poll commissioned by Reuters, PostNL is expected to report fourth-quarter underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 130 million euros, down 29.3 percent from a year before, driven by a sharp decline in profit from domestic mail service. PostNL, the former state monopoly, is the main provider of postal services in the Netherlands, where it faces intense price competition and where traditional mail services are in decline as more people and companies switch to email. It has already warned it would pay its dividends in shares, not cash, from 2012 and would struggle to pay out in cash for a few years because of shortfalls in its pension funds and the declining value of its stake in TNT.

United Parcel Service Inc. earlier this month offered 9 euros a share, valuing TNT Express at 4.9 billion euros ($6.56 billion). PostNL owns 29.9 percent of TNT.

Investors hope UPS will sweeten its cash bid for TNT, which was spliced off from PostNL last year to try to ringfence the more attractive express delivery operations from a traditional post business that is in decline in the age of electronic mail. TNT has been under fire from activist shareholders to improve its performance. Last week, it said it had swung to a fourth-quarter operating loss of 104 million euros from a profit of 24 million in the 2010 period, due to impairment charges, mainly on its business in Brazil.

79,UPS,TNT Express-UPS deal to come after Friday: sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and TNT Express TNTE.AS are unlikely to announce a deal on Friday when they need to update the market about the status of their merger talks, but a deal could come soon after that, sources close to the talks said. The companies need more time to hammer out final details, but they are getting closer to an agreement and will say on Friday that they remain in discussions, the sources said. “I don’t think it will take several more weeks”, one of the sources said. UPS had four weeks after it approached Dutch-based TNT Express to clarify its intentions under Dutch takeover law. “Lots of concessions were made on the social front”, said a second source, who is close to UPS. “TNT performance is a big issue”, the same source added. Dutch unions sent a letter to TNT Express’s board after consulting employees on their concerns regarding an acquisition by UPS. Job protection, employment contracts and the location of the future company were among the main concerns, said Marc van Kerkhoff, who represents TNT Express employees. Price discussions were put on hold after the Dutch parcel-delivery firm rejected a 4.9 billion-euro ($6.38 billion) proposal from UPS last month, and have yet to resume, the first and the second source said. UPS is confident that its bid for TNT Express will not meet significant anti-trust hurdles and would be approved by the European watchdog in phase 1, the second source said. Some shareholders are still hoping for an improved offer, but UPS is seen as unlikely to improve by much its last offer of 9 euros a share, given TNT’s poor results and the absence of a counter bidder. Both parties have ruled out a potential counter bid from FedEx Corp (FDX.N) at this point, the sources said.

Rating Action	 On March 19, 2012, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services kept its ratings on 	 United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) on CreditWatch with negative implications, 	 following UPS’ announcement that it has reached an agreement to acquire TNT 	 Express N.V. for an estimated $6.77 billion. 	 	 Rationale	 The ratings on United Parcel Service Inc.

We 	 originally placed our UPS ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications on 	 Feb. 17, 2012, after UPS acknowledged that it had made a proposal to acquire 	 TNT Express for EUR9 per share in cash. TNT Express rejected the initial 	 proposal but has now agreed to the sweetened deal.	 	 UPS plans to finance the acquisition with $3 billion of cash and to use bank 	 debt to finance the rest. It expects EUR400 million-EUR550 million ($525 	 million-$725 million) in annual run rate savings after year four but will 	 spend EUR1 billion ($1.31 billion) to achieve those synergies. 	 	 We believe the transaction will enhance UPS’ business profile by bolstering 	 its position in Europe and providing it with growth opportunities in other 	 international markets where it currently has limited presence. However, we are 	 concerned that the transaction will result in credit metrics that no longer 	 support our current ratings. We have said that we could lower ratings if funds 	 from operations (FFO) to debt falls to less than 50% on an extended basis. FFO 	 to debt was 53% at the end of 2011. 	 	 UPS is the world’s largest package delivery company, with a significant 	 presence in all major global markets. TNT Express is a smaller package 	 delivery company that generates the majority of its revenues in Europe. TNT 	 Express was spun off from TNT N.V. (now PostNL N.V.) in June 2011. The 	 combined entity would generate annual revenues of more than $60 billion. The 	 deal is subject to various approvals, including regulatory approval and 	 shareholder approval. PostNL N.V. holds approximately 29.8% of the shares of 	 TNT Express and has committed to supporting the transaction. 	 	 CreditWatch	 Standard & Poor’s will monitor the regulatory and shareholder approval process 	 and will assess the impact of the transaction on UPS’ credit metrics to 	 resolve the CreditWatch. Although UPS does not expect the deal to close until 	 the third quarter of 2012, we may provide indicative ratings before then, 	 based on an assumption that the transaction goes forward as proposed.

UPS will become the market leader in Europe and also gain access to TNT’s stronger networks in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets, increasing the U.S. company’s global revenue to more than $60 billion (45 billion euros) from $53 billion in 2011 and leaving it with 477,000 employees. “TNT Express fits into UPS’s long-term network plan,” UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis told investors. “This broadens UPS’s global footprint.” The deal will expand UPS’s revenue outside the United States to 36 percent of its total, from 26 percent today, and increase its presence in Brazil and Australia, executives said. The acquisition is the largest by far in UPS’s 104-year history. The move sharply widens the gap between UPS and No. 2 FedEx Corp (FDX.N), which has a market share of about 3 percent in Europe. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Reuters Insider-Market Pulse: A 5.2 billion-euro bowl of alphabet soup in euro stocks: link.reuters.com/dyr27s BREAKINGVIEWS-Activists land rare European win with TNT ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> TNT said on Monday its executive and supervisory boards unanimously supported UPS’s offer of 9.5 euros per share, a premium of nearly 54 percent, up from a bid of 9 euros per share last month. “At the price they’re paying, we’re not going to be jumping up and down for it, but it’s not a bad deal and it’s going to be a long-term positive,” said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz Inc in Toledo, Ohio, which holds UPS shares. “It’s consistent with what we expect with management as far as trying to broaden out the global scale and keep costs low.” A deeper European economic slump than expected could dull the benefits, he said. “The downside would be a longer economic slowdown than what’s already anticipated and a lot more anemic recovery when recovery does occur,” Lancz said. “But I think that’s semi-priced-in as far as the purchase price.” TNT Express shares were up 1.1 percent at 9.44 euros in European trading at 1635 GMT. UPS shares were up 4.2 percent at $81.70, a six-year-high, in midafternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. UPS will invest 1 billion euros beyond the purchase price over a four-year period to integrate TNT, and the company “intends to stay very high-quality on (credit) ratings,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told analysts. The company expects strong European exports and is committed to investing in the region despite current economic concerns. “Is it the time to be shopping in Europe? It’s a pretty cloudy environment,” said Jeffrey Kauffman, managing director at Sterne Agee in New York. “Strategically, you want to buy assets when things are cheap, not when you’ve got to pay up, so strategically I think this makes a lot of sense.” Kauffman said Europe will be the biggest revenue stream from a TNT merger, but the potential footprint growth is global. “This really isn’t just an investment in Europe, it’s an investment in the Middle East, in Brazil, Australia, China — there’s so much more to this than Europe.” Wall Street had been watching for a deal after TNT in mid-February rejected UPS’s initial $6.45 billion (4.9 billion euro) bid. The companies remained in talks. The bid from UPS came about nine months after TNT split from delivery company PostNL, with shareholders pressuring TNT to shake up its board and boost shareholder value. The deal has raised concerns that smaller companies will find it harder to compete. Germany’s Deutsche Post DHL (DPWGn.DE), the closest rival in Europe, said the European Commission should examine the proposed takeover thoroughly. TNT’s biggest shareholder, PostNL (PTNL.AS), which owns a 29.8 percent stake, also said it backed the offer, which UPS said it would finance through a combination of $3 billion in available cash and new debt. “The combination of the two companies ... will be enhanced and really deliver the global leader that will be unequalled,” said TNT Express head Marie-Christine Lombard. With falling profit and a poor outlook for 2012, TNT’s management had come under intense pressure from activist shareholders, including Jana Partners and Alberta Investment Management Corp, to seek a buyer. “There will be a great degree of execution risk inherent in a deal of this size and scope, with implementation expected over an approximately four-year time frame,” Morgan Keegan equity research analysts said in a client note. “That being said, we project accretion of $0.21 per share in 2013 and with these higher projections our target price is increasing to $124 from $116 per share and we maintain our outperform rating.” UPS has long looked at TNT as a way to help it expand in Europe, especially Britain, France and Germany. It said it was confident the European antitrust watchdog would clear the offer without undertaking a prolonged investigation. Analysts said the company might need to sell some assets to ensure the deal wins approval. “We expect some divestments will be needed for the competition clearances,” DZ Bank analyst Robert Czerwensky said. FedEx was perceived as a potential suitor at one point, and one that might offer a higher bid than UPS. But with less overlap, there were less savings to be gained in a TNT merger. And most analysts expect FedEx to follow through on its stated focus of expanding in Asia and possibly growing in Europe by buying some assets divested in this merger. “As a matter of policy, we do not comment regarding corporate development matters,” FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn said. FedEx may discuss its plans further on Thursday after it reports third-quarter earnings. UPS’s Davis said it was “too early” to tell if European regulators would require the companies to sell off any operations but said he expects the deal to be approved. “We’re quite confident that all the necessary approvals will be obtained,” Davis said. A spokesman for Deutsche Post said the acquisition would further strengthen the power of a significant player in a market with limited participants. Trade unions said UPS had agreed to continue collective labor agreements. The unions said they had not heard of any plans for job cuts, but analysts said the deal could affect thousands of employees. “With TNT about two times as large as UPS in Europe, this could affect more than 20,000 jobs at TNT in Europe alone,” said Kelper Capital Markets analyst Andre Mulder. The businesses have overlap, but UPS’s Davis said it was “way too early” to talk about job cuts. The deal will bring annual cost savings of 400 million to 550 million euros ($527 million to $724 million) in four years, UPS said. It said it will first spend a pretax $1.71 billion (1.3 billion euros) on “implementation costs” to achieve those synergies, adding that the deal would boost UPS’s earnings this year. UPS expects the takeover to close in the third quarter. The acquisition will be financed with an equal mix of cash and debt, it said. About two-thirds of TNT’s revenue is from European customers, but it also has been steadily growing in China, India and Brazil, where it struggled to integrate its acquisitions. UPS is in the midst of a $200 million expansion of its Cologne hub, and has recently grown through acquisitions. The company carries about $11 billion in debt on its balance sheet and could tap credit lines for $12 billion in additional debt. The company has $4.1 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in marketable securities.

88,UPS,TNT Express agrees to UPS's new 5.2 bln euro offer,"AMSTERDAM, March 19 (Reuters) - TNT Express has accepted a higher cash offer of 9.5 euro per share from U.S. rival United Parcel Service, which values the Dutch freight and delivery group at 5.2 billion euros ($6.9 billion). TNT said on Monday the executive and supervisory boards of TNT Express unanimously intend to support and recommend UPS’s offer, while its biggest shareholder PostNL also said it supports the deal. In a joint statement on Monday, the firms said UPS’s increased offer was a 53.7 percent premium to TNT Express’share price on February 16, 2012 of 6.18 euros, the day before TNT Express and UPS announced that they were in talks. UPS, already the world’s largest package delivery company, has long eyed TNT as a way to expand in Europe, especially Britain, France and Germany in addition to the Netherlands. On Friday, UPS had said it was still in “constructive” talks with TNT, four weeks after the Dutch firm rejected UPS’s original bid of 9 euros per share, or a 42 percent premium, valuing TNT at 4.9 billion.",3192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/tnt-ups/tnt-express-agrees-to-upss-new-5-2-bln-euro-offer-idUSWEA577020120319
89,UPS,TEXT-S&P; puts PostNL on creditwatch positive,"Rationale The CreditWatch placement follows an announcement that PostNL has committed to tender its 29.8% share in TNT Express N.V. (BBB+/Watch Pos/A-2) to United Parcel Service Inc. (AA-/Watch Neg/A-1+) for a cash consideration of about EUR1.54 billion. This is in support of UPS’s offer to acquire TNT Express N.V. The transaction is subject to certain approvals and competition clearances. We understand that PostNL’s management will put EUR700 million of the proceeds in an escrow account upon completion of the sale to be subsequently used for debt repayment. We note this is consistent with PostNL’s previously stated intention to reduce its net debt to EUR300 million-EUR500 million with the proceeds from disposals of financial assets. Accordingly, we anticipate an improvement in the company’s credit ratios and, thus, its financial profile, with adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt potentially rising to 35% or more, depending on the final amount of net debt reduction. We have previously stated that all else being equal, we could raise the rating if PostNL were to comfortably sustain an “intermediate” financial risk profile, translating into adjusted FFO to debt of about 35%. Any decision to raise the rating would, however, depend on management’s financial policy commitment and medium-term plans for capital spending, dividends, and possible bolt-on acquisitions. For example, we understand PostNL’s capital spending might rise to EUR240 million in 2012 which, combined with large cash outlays for restructuring and pension contributions, would result in negative free operating cash flow under our base-case assumptions. In 2011, PostNL’s revenues remained flat year on year at EUR4.3 billion and its underlying operating income (after nonrecurring items) was down to EUR426 million as compared with EUR580 million in 2010. This was mainly due to organic volume decrease in the Mail in the Netherlands segment that was only partly counterbalanced by operating improvements in the International and Parcel segments. As of Dec. 31, 2011, PostNL’s adjusted debt stood at about EUR1.37 billion and the ratio of adjusted FFO to debt at about 25%, which is commensurate with a “significant” financial risk profile. The ratings continue to reflect our view of PostNL’s “strong” business risk profile, which is supported by the company’s good track record of maintaining better operating efficiency in its core Dutch mail business than its other European postal peers, as well as improving its parcel business. In our view, these strengths are partially offset by PostNL’s participation in a European mail industry subject to a structural volume decline. This decline will place pressure on profitability along with increasing substitution by new media (digitization), competitive pressure, and relatively high labor costs. Liquidity The short-term rating on PostNL is ‘A-2’. We view PostNL’s liquidity as “strong” reflecting the company’s sources of liquidity, which exceed its uses by 1.5x or more over the next 24 months. We also expect net liquidity sources to remain positive, even if EBITDA were to decline by 30%. PostNL’s credit facilities and bonds do not contain financial covenants and are not subject to rating triggers. We understand that the company has well-established, solid relationships with banks and high standing in credit markets. As of Dec. 31, 2011, PostNL had EUR668 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which about EUR39 million were restricted. We understand that the company also had access to a EUR570 million undrawn committed revolving credit facility due May 2016. This, together with our base-case forecast of FFO of EUR50 million-EUR100 million in 2012, should enable PostNL to comfortably service its upcoming financial obligations. Uses of liquidity in 2012 include about EUR60 million of debt maturities, our forecast of working capital needs of EUR50 million-EUR80 million, and capital expenditures of a maximum of EUR240 million. We note that debt maturities in 2013 and 2014 are immaterial. PostNL’s next significant maturity falls due in 2015 when a EUR400 million bond matures. CreditWatch The CreditWatch placement with positive implications indicates the potential for an upgrade of up to two notches, subject to a positive review of PostNL’s financial risk profile. The review will focus in particular on PostNL’s intention to use the proceeds and its future financial policies. In addition, we will seek to update our views on the company’s business risk profile and its near- to medium-term operating performance given the structurally declining mail business in The Netherlands. We expect to resolve the CreditWatch placement once the sale is completed.

105,UPS,FedEx risks losing $1 billion-plus Post Office contract to UPS,"(Reuters) - Package-delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) risks losing its business with the U.S. Postal Service, worth more than $1 billion a year, when the beleaguered postal service puts the contract up for bid next year. The postal service alerted FedEx that it will seek bids for the contract after it expires in September 2013, FedEx said in a regulatory filing late on Monday. That clears the way for larger competitor United Parcel Service (UPS.N) to grab the business - domestic air transportation for first-class, priority and express mail - that FedEx has had since 2000. FedEx, the No. 2 package delivery company, signed its first contract in 2000 and started providing postal service in April 2001. In 2006, it signed an extension through September 2013. “By flying some of the fastest growing and most successful postal products, FedEx Express continues to provide the Postal Service and postal customers important services,” FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn said on Tuesday. “We look forward to continuing our excellent relationship.” FedEx is the postal service’s top contractor, earning an estimated $1.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2011 from this business, according to Husch Blackwell LLP’s postal service contracting practice group. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, earned about $100 million in revenue during that period. “UPS has informed the U.S. Postal Service that it definitely intends to bid on this work,” said UPS spokesman Norman Black. Dahlman Rose analyst Helane Becker said the contract loss would be small compared FedEx’s $42.7 billion in revenue, but disruptive. “We believe the probability of FedEx losing the USPS contract is relatively small, but until we hear confirmation otherwise, the contract renewal will cast an overhang on the stock,” she wrote in a note. “UPS’s current contract is dwarfed by FedEx’s and would give the company a solid boost to earnings,” she said. Shares of Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx were down 0.9 percent in midafternoon trading at $91.04 on the New York Stock Exchange and up 9 percent so far this year. FedEx is focused on cost-cutting to boost profit margins with sluggish economic growth curbing shipping volumes and leading customers to demand lower-priced delivery options. Chief Executive Fred Smith in June said the company would provide greater detail of its planned Express division restructuring at its October analyst meetings. “The timing of contract expiration — a year following FedEx’s expected restructuring announcement — provides FedEx visibility to plan for any potential loss of business and resulting impact to network utilization,” Robert W. Baird analysts led by Benjamin Hartford wrote in a note.

106,UPS,"EU regulators broaden probe into UPS, TNT deal","BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators stepped up their investigation into United Parcel Service’s (UPS.N) 5.2 billion euro ($6.4 billion) bid for Dutch peer TNT Express TNTE.AS on Friday, saying they were concerned about the combined company’s large market share. UPS, the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, said last week that it expected the European Commission to open a lengthy investigation into the deal. The EU watchdog launched a preliminary review in June. The Commission said it was worried about potential competition issues in the small package delivery sector, particularly international express services in some European Union countries where the combined company would have very high market shares. “The small package delivery sector is of strategic importance for various other industries in Europe,” Joaquín Almunia, Commission vice president in charge of competition policy, said in a statement. “The proposed acquisition could in particular reduce competition for the provision of the fastest express delivery services, to the detriment of direct customers and ultimately of European consumers.” The EU executive said it would decide by November 28 whether to clear the deal. “We remain confident that we will receive clearance within the fourth quarter,” a spokesman for TNT told Reuters, adding that UPS and TNT were still talking to the Commission. “Over the next few weeks, UPS will continue the dialogue with the Commission,” Atlanta-based UPS spokesman Norman Black told Reuters. “UPS remains confident it will receive clearance for the proposed acquisition within the fourth quarter.” The acquisition of TNT will reinforce UPS’ global market share and give it access to the Dutch company’s stronger networks in fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets. Analysts had already warned that the deal would give UPS a dominant position in some markets, such as Britain, and that as a result it would have to sell assets to soothe regulatory concerns about its largest ever deal. TNT declined to comment on whether such sales are being discussed. German rival Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) has already highlighted that the deal would create a powerful group in a limited market. TNT is the domestic market leader in Europe with an 18 percent share, while Deutsche Post DHL is second at 15 percent, and UPS has 10 percent. Analysts have estimated that in the UK, TNT and UPS have a combined market share of about 35 percent, while in Germany and France their share is about 30 percent, and in the Netherlands it is below 30 percent.

109,UPS,Europe worries temper companies' profit outlook,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Worries about a slowing global economy crimped corporate spending in the second quarter, leaving the chief executives of top U.S. companies including United Parcel Service Inc and DuPont Co more guarded on their growth prospects for the rest of the year. UPS, along with chip maker Texas Instruments Inc and printer maker Lexmark International Inc, said it would not increase profit as quickly as expected through the rest of the year, as the corporate customers that generate most of its volume hold the line on spending. “Economies around the world are showing signs of weakening and our customers are increasingly nervous,” said Scott Davis, chief executive of the world’s largest package-delivery company. “In the U.S., uncertainty stemming from this year’s elections and the looming fiscal cliff, constrains the ability of businesses to make important decisions such as hiring new employees, making capital investments, and restocking inventories. This will further restrict economic growth.” UPS said it now expects profit to rise about 3 to 8 percent this year, about half its prior forecast growth rate. AT&T; Inc cited a similar murky corporate spending outlook, saying it no longer expects its business services business to return to expanding revenue this year. Of 26 U.S. companies that have revised third-quarter profit forecasts since mid-June, 19 have cut them, with the average forecast being pulled down 2.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Even companies that beat Wall Street’s expectations in the second quarter — including DuPont, Illinois Tool Works Inc and Paccar Inc — sounded a note of caution on the next six months. “We need to all be cautious as we look at these markets in the second half of the year,” said DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman. “The expectations in Europe are very low and they’re kind of bumping along the bottom in a recessionary mode.” The chemical and seed maker told investors its full-year profit could come in at the low end of its guidance range, which would represent growth of about 7 percent in earnings per share. On Tuesday afternoon, UPS shares were down 4.5 percent at $74.48, DuPont was down 2 percent at $47.72, AT&T; was down 2.9 percent at $34.34 and ITW stock was down 3 percent at $51.98. Europe, where governments are considering slashing spending in the face of a sovereign debt crisis, remained the biggest worry for top U.S. companies with the strengthening U.S. dollar adding to their woes by reducing the value of their exports. Outside those common problems, many U.S. companies that have reported results so far this season said demand at home has held fairly steady and that sales in Asia continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate than over the past few years. “It’s the same story all around,” said Catherine Avery, who runs asset management firm CAIM LLC. “It’s all pointing to the same malaise and weakness on the international side. Even though all the big multinationals are getting hit by currency, these are the places you want to be.” Pentair Inc, which makes water-filtration systems, and heavy truck maker Paccar were two companies that managed to assuage Wall Street’s worries, posting better-than-expected results. Pentair held its full-year profit forecast virtually unchanged, while Paccar said it was increasing market share in the face of declining U.S. and Canadian demand for tractor trailers. Pentair shares were up 4.9 percent at $41.54 on Tuesday afternoon, well above the level they had been trading at earlier this month before the company warned that U.S. truck demand was softening. “They’re squeaking by, which is great in this environment,” said Avery, referring to industrial earnings. “What we really need to happen next is to get the revenue numbers up, and that’s only going to happen once we get on a path to better global growth.” Pentair said it expected Europe’s slump to moderate in the second half. “The rate of decline in volumes appears to be moderating in Europe,” CEO Randall Hogan told investors on a conference call. The company said it expected European sales to fall by 6 to 7 percent in the second half of the year, compared with an 8 percent first-half decline. It said the strengthening dollar was hurting its sales growth. More than half of the dollar’s year-to-date gains have come in July, according to Standard & Poor’s. The dollar is up 6.2 percent against the euro this year, which reduces the value of European sales when they are translated into U.S. currency. “Currency is a little worse than expected” this earnings season, said industrial analyst Jeff Windau of Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Recessionary forces in Europe will probably weigh on industrial growth over the next couple of quarters, but there are good opportunities with bigger markets like China. It’s always a challenge to predict when either these economies to turn around, or when the market starts anticipating a turnaround.” Whirlpool Corp missed Wall Street’s targets for sales and earnings in the quarter, blaming weakness in Europe and the strong dollar, and its shares were down 7.8 percent at $62.03. The world’s largest U.S. appliance maker even warned of weakness in its home market, with Marc Bitzer, who heads the company’s North American operations, saying “demand is at recessionary low levels.” That assessment was somewhat at odds with what rival General Electric Co had to say about the state of the appliance industry when it reported second-quarter results last week. It said the U.S. appliance market had grown by 1 percent in the quarter, with its retail sales up 11 percent. ITW CEO David Speer said on Tuesday, after the company reported better-than-expected profit, that he believed the long-stagnant U.S. housing market was picking up, which could boost demand for its building materials. “We continue to be more optimistic about additional recovery in housing starts in 2013 and beyond,” Speer said. Recent economic data has suggested overseas demand is tempering the U.S. industrial outlook, but U.S. manufacturing continues to expand. Financial information firm Markit said on Tuesday its U.S. “flash” manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for July fell to 51.8 from 52.5 in June. July marked the fourth consecutive month of slower growth and the sector’s weakest showing since December 2010. But the index remained above 50, indicating factory activity is increasing, only less rapidly. Earnings growth among multi-industry companies is coming in well ahead of forecasts, Barclays analysts said in a research note. Instead of the expected 5 percent profit increases, the average pace is closer to 7 or 8 percent, a minimal deceleration from the two prior quarters. “The world is sluggish, but the cycle remains on track,” the analysts said. “China appears to be finding a bottom but not turning up yet, other emerging markets as well, Europe is very weak but not sequentially worse, the U.S. remains the main industrial growth driver and has slowed less than we thought.” ",7242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-manufacturing-results/europe-worries-temper-companies-profit-outlook-idUSBRE86N1AN20120724
110,UPS,UPS lowers 2012 view on slowing global economy,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service (UPS.N) lowered its 2012 outlook, citing global economic uncertainty, and the world’s largest package delivery company said it would cut capacity in Asia after exports from that region slowed. UPS, which on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit that missed estimates, said it is considering other capacity adjustments and spending controls as more customers favor less-expensive delivery options. “Economies around the world are showing signs of weakening and our customers are increasingly nervous,” UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis said. Double-digit declines in high-yielding shipments from Asia to Europe and the United States were a drag on profitability in the quarter, UPS executives told analysts on a conference call. “In the U.S., uncertainty stemming from this year’s elections and the looming fiscal cliff constrain the ability of businesses to make important decisions such as hiring new employees, making capital investments and restocking inventories,” said Davis. UPS forecast that U.S. gross domestic product will grow by 1 percent in the second half of the year, a slower rate than the general consensus. UPS said it plans to reduce its service network in Asia by 10 percent because of the slowing export traffic. Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said the company expects to record a lower third-quarter profit than a year ago but that the fourth quarter should show “solid improvement.” “With Europe having so much uncertainty, we’ve heard some anecdotes that in August, some (European) businesses may shut down rather than just taking a couple of weeks holiday,” Kuehn said in an interview. “We think there is some risk that Europe will have a more dramatic slowing in August.” But as technology companies launch new products in the fourth quarter, demand for UPS shipping services out of Asia should increase, he said. In the United States, deliveries in the second quarter rose 3.5 percent, driven by e-commerce shipping to residential customers. International exports were up about 1 percent. The company does not expect major network restructuring in the United States but is looking to reduce spending. “We will be looking at a typical range of costs ... initiatives, discretionary spending, really just making sure we’ve recalibrated the network,” Kuehn said. UPS lowered its full-year outlook to $4.50 to $4.70 a share, from its prior earnings estimate of $4.75 to $5.00 per share, citing growing customer concerns about the economy. The revised full-year outlook would represent an increase of between 3 percent and 8 percent over 2011 adjusted results. “International is week, but we’ve known that and it appears to be manageable,” said Benjamin Hartford, a senior research associate at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “But we’ve seen a weakening in domestic freight trends over the past two to three months and that appears to be the biggest near-term headwind for UPS, and they’re taking cost actions to adjust to lower assumed growth,” he added. UPS shares fell 5.2 percent to $73.80 in midday trading, wiping out most of this year’s gain. The stock is up 1 percent so far this year. Atlanta-based UPS’s adjusted profit rose 7.5 percent from a year ago to $1.15 per share, shy of the $1.17 per share average estimate according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $13.35 billion, below the $13.7 billion estimated by analysts on average. Raymond James & Associates has a strong buy recommendation on UPS. The election and uncertain global economy “create earnings uncertainty for a couple of quarters, but beyond that we should see re-accelerated growth on pent-up demand,” said Art Hatfield, managing director of equity research. UPS and No. 2 parcel delivery company FedEx (FDX.N) are viewed as economic bellwethers because of the volume of goods they handle. FedEx said in June it was stepping up cost-cutting measures, such as upgrading its fleet to more fuel-efficient aircraft, to boost profits as a sluggish global economy curbs shipping volume and demand for premium-priced delivery options. UPS expects to close on the purchase of Dutch company TNT Express TNTE.AS, the biggest takeover in its 105-year history, in the fourth quarter.

The company lowered its full-year outlook to $4.50 to $4.70 a share, from its prior earnings estimate of $4.75 to $5.00 per share, and said customers are more concerned about the economy in the second half of the year. “Increasing uncertainty in the United States, continuing weakness in Asia exports and the debt crisis in Europe are impacting projections of economic expansion,” Scott Davis, UPS chief executive officer, said in a statement. The revised full-year outlook would represent an increase of between 3 percent and 8 percent over 2011 adjusted results. “The ongoing international weakness, particularly on the air freight side, and the ongoing Euro zone crisis, is really what drove the shortfall this quarter and I suspect is weighing on the full-year outlook,” said Benjamin Hartford, senior research associate at Robert W.

Adjusted profit rose 7.5 percent to $1.15 per share compared with $1.07 per share a year earlier, when the company recorded two real estate transactions. The estimate was for $1.17 per share.

120,UPS,TEXT-S&P;: UPS Inc. 'AA-' And 'A-1+' Rtgs Remain On Watch Negative,"— United Parcel Service (UPS) recently announced that the regulatory authorities in Europe are moving to a phase two review of its proposed acquisition of TNT Express N.V. — UPS also announced that it has reached an agreement with the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund (NETTI) to restructure the withdrawal liability related to that plan. — We are evaluating the company’s exposure to multiemployer pension plans as part of our review. — We are keeping our ‘AA-‘ long-term and ‘A-1+’ short-term ratings for UPS on CreditWatch with negative implications, where we had placed them after UPS first announced its plan to acquire TNT. — Based on UPS’ publicly disclosed plans to finance its planned acquisition of TNT, we could lower the rating one notch if the merger proceeds. Even if that does not occur, we could lower ratings if we believe that potential liability under MEPPs will prevent the company from achieving credit measures that we judge as acceptable for the current ratings. WASHINGTON D.C. (Standard & Poor’s) Aug. 28, 2012—Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that its ratings on United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), including the ‘AA-‘ long-term and ‘A-1+’ short-term corporate credit ratings, remain on CreditWatch with negative implications, where we had placed them on Feb. 17, 2012. UPS announced on March 19, 2012, that it had reached an agreement to acquire TNT Express N.V. (BBB+/Watch Pos/A-2) for EUR9.50 per share in cash, or an estimated $6.77 billion. On May 3, 2012, UPS announced that it plans to finance the TNT Express transaction with $5 billion of cash and $1.8 billion of debt. It also announced that it plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares in both 2012 and 2013. We originally placed our UPS ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications on Feb. 17, 2012, after UPS acknowledged that it had made a proposal to acquire TNT Express for EUR9 per share in cash. TNT Express rejected the initial proposal but subsequently agreed to the sweetened deal. Initially, UPS had hoped to close the transaction in the third quarter of 2012. However, the European regulatory authorities have moved to a phase two review, which means that the transaction, if approved, would likely not close until late this year. “We believe the transaction will enhance UPS’ business profile by bolstering its position in Europe and providing it with growth opportunities in other international markets where it currently has limited presence,” said Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Lisa Jenkins. “However, the transaction will initially cause a deterioration in credit metrics.” UPS’ financial profile has also been weakened by increased potential liabilities related to multiemployer pension plans. We view the withdrawal liability related to these plans to be a debt equivalent. The withdrawal liability has increased due to record low interest rates and low asset returns. In 2007, UPS withdrew from the troubled Central States pension plan by paying $6.1 billion (pretax). Last week, the company announced an agreement with NETTI to restructure its plan, which will enable it to pay a $2.1 billion withdrawal liability over 50 years, so that the present value of its payments is only $896 million. Although this is a favorable development from a credit perspective, we note that UPS multiemployer pension plan (MEPP) exposure remains significant and will be an important factor in our analysis when we resolve the CreditWatch. UPS is the world’s largest package delivery company, with a significant presence in all major global markets. TNT Express is a smaller package delivery company that generates the majority of its revenues in Europe. TNT Express was spun off from TNT N.V. (now PostNL N.V.) in June 2011. The combined entity would generate annual revenues of more than $60 billion. The deal is subject to various approvals, including regulatory approval and shareholder approval. PostNL N.V. holds approximately 29.8% of the shares of TNT Express and has committed to supporting the transaction. Standard & Poor’s will monitor the regulatory and shareholder approval process related to the TNT transaction and will resolve the CreditWatch following the completion of the regulatory review in Europe. As part of our review, we will assess UPS’ current operating outlook and the effect of the company’s exposure to MEPPs. Based on UPS’ publicly disclosed plans to finance its planned acquisition of TNT, we could lower the rating one notch if the merger proceeds. In addition, even if that does not occur, we could lower the company’s rating if we believe that its potential liability under MEPPs, which has increased in recent years because of low interest rates and subpar asset returns, will prevent the company from achieving credit measures that we judge as acceptable for the current rating. — United Parcel Service Inc.

132,UPS,"EU to detail objections to UPS, TNT deal: sources","AMSTERDAM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will next week tell United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) that its bid for TNT Express TNTE.AS will hurt competition, two sources close to the matter said, forcing the U.S. company to offer concessions or risk a veto. The European Commission, which is examining the 5.2-billion-euro ($6.71 billion) deal, will set out its concerns at a meeting with UPS officials on Tuesday before sending a statement of objections or charge sheet, the people said on Wednesday. One of the sources said UPS had not offered any concessions to date, preferring to wait until the EU watchdog detailed the potential problems. Shares in Dutch delivery group TNT Express TNTE.AS ended unchanged at 8.15 euros on Wednesday. The stock fell as much as 2.5 percent in early trading after the Financial Times reported that the EU watchdog would object to the deal. TNT Express shares have been trading below 9 euros since the end of July, compared with UPS’ bid of 9.50 euros per share. UPS may find it difficult to make concessions to soothe regulatory concerns about the deal, the biggest in its 105-year history, said Andre Mulder, an analyst with brokerage Kepler. “We think the likelihood of the takeover being cancelled has increased a bit further,” he wrote in a note. UPS said it would continue to work with the Commission. “We are confident the deal will go through,” a UPS spokesman said. The Commission is worried that the proposed merger will reduce the number of players, leaving the combined entity to compete with only Deutsche Post’s DHL (DPWGn.DE) and U.S. peer FedEx (FDX.N). UPS is arguing that it faces competition from national postal companies such as French mail company DPD and Royal Mail’s GBPO.UL European express parcel service GLS, as well as freight forwarders like Swiss companies Kuehne & Nagel KNIN.VX and Panalpina (PWTN.S). Analysts said the merged company’s strong market share in Britain, Italy and the Netherlands and TNT’s dominance in the intra-Europe express market may mean it has to make concessions in these areas.

142,UPS,"UPS profit drops, shares rise on outlook","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported lower quarterly profit on Tuesday, citing slowing global trade, and said there was “some uncertainty” about the strength of the coming holiday season. The share price rose 2.7 percent after UPS slightly revised its 2012 forecast, signaling to Wall Street it would top the consensus estimate for the fourth quarter, which includes the important holiday shipping season. Third-quarter earnings per share at the world’s largest package delivery group, matched estimates, but quarterly revenue fell from a year ago and missed the Wall Street view. UPS and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are viewed as economic bellwethers because of the volume of goods they handle. The value of packages that UPS moves on its trucks and planes is equivalent to about 6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 2 percent of global GDP. “We’re seeing a slower growth environment and customers continuing to shift to slower modes of transport,” said Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk. “Freight still moves, but on a cheaper mode of transport that affects revenues and therefore profitability.” Purk put a “hold” rating on the stock, citing the pending 5.2 billion euro ($6.7 billion) takeover of Dutch peer TNT Express TNTE.AS - the biggest purchase in UPS’s 105-year history - as well as the slowing economy and cautious customers. The year-end “fiscal cliff” drama in Washington over steep spending cuts and expiring tax breaks worried UPS executives. “The lack of clear direction on future tax and spending policy has (slowed) and will continue to slow business investment,” Chief Executive Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call. “The lack of political will to fix our debt problem adds to the uncertainty in our economy. Just what we don’t need.” UPS sees adjusted full-year earnings at between $4.55 and $4.65 per share, which would be 5 percent to 7 percent above the 2011 figure. Its prior forecast ranged from $4.50 to $4.70. Analysts estimated $4.56 a share For the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “That guidance implies $1.34 to $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter, compared with the $1.34 Wall Street consensus, and that’s what’s driving the optimism,” Purk said. UPS said it expects to handle more than 500 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and said it would release more estimates and holiday hiring plans within a few weeks. FedEx said on Monday it expects to handle more than 280 million shipments in the period and intends to add 20,000 seasonal workers. “While there is some uncertainty around the magnitude of the holiday shopping season, we are confident in UPS’s ability to deliver,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said. The stock rose 2.7 percent to $73.50 in late-morning trade. The company will be more exposed to problems in Europe with its planned TNT purchase, but the deal will make UPS the market leader on the continent and broaden its reach in Asian and Latin American markets. UPS and TNT will respond within a couple of weeks to objections to the deal from the European Commission. The European Union’s antitrust chief has said UPS will have to make concessions to get approval. Davis, the CEO, said UPS is confident the deal will close in early 2013. U.S. domestic revenue rose $94 million from the year-ago third quarter, with daily package delivery volume up 3.7 percent on e-commerce shipments. The biggest percentage rise was in deferred deliveries, a cheaper option. International package revenue declined 3.7 percent as lower fuel surcharges to customers and the impact from foreign currency more than offset 1.2 percent growth in daily export volume. For the first time in several quarters, Asia showed growth in export package volume, largely benefiting from technology product launches, the company said. This year, UPS has adjusted its network to cope with slowing shipments from Asia and higher demand for cheaper shipping. Third-quarter earnings declined to $469 million or 48 cents share, from $1.07 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. In August, the company said it would restructure pension liabilities and record an after-tax, non-cash charge of $559 million in the quarter.

143,UPS,"UPDATE 3-UPS profit drops, shares rise on outlook","By Lynn Adler Oct 23 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc  reported lower quarterly profit on Tuesday, citing slowing global trade, and said there was “some uncertainty” about the strength of the coming holiday season. The share price rose 2.7 percent after UPS slightly revised its 2012 forecast, signaling to Wall Street it would top the consensus estimate for the fourth quarter, which includes the important holiday shipping season. Third-quarter earnings per share at the world’s largest package delivery group, matched estimates, but quarterly revenue fell from a year ago and missed the Wall Street view. UPS and rival FedEx Corp are viewed as economic bellwethers because of the volume of goods they handle. The value of packages that UPS moves on its trucks and planes is equivalent to about 6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product and 2 percent of global GDP. “We’re seeing a slower growth environment and customers  continuing to shift to slower modes of transport,” said Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk. “Freight still moves, but on a cheaper mode of transport that  affects revenues and therefore profitability.” Purk put a “hold” rating on the stock, citing the pending 5.2 billion euro ($6.7 billion) takeover of Dutch peer TNT Express - the biggest purchase in UPS’s 105-year history - as well as the slowing economy and cautious customers. The year-end “fiscal cliff” drama in Washington over steep spending cuts and expiring tax breaks worried UPS executives. “The lack of clear direction on future tax and spending policy has (slowed) and will continue to slow business investment,” Chief Executive Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call. “The lack of political will to fix our debt problem adds to the uncertainty in our economy. Just what we don’t need.” UPS sees adjusted full-year earnings at between $4.55 and $4.65 per share, which would be 5 percent to 7 percent above the 2011 figure. Its prior forecast ranged from $4.50 to $4.70. Analysts estimated $4.56 a share For the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “That guidance implies $1.34 to $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter, compared with the $1.34 Wall Street consensus, and that’s what’s driving the optimism,” Purk said. UPS said it expects to handle more than 500 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and said it would release more estimates and holiday hiring plans within a few weeks. FedEx said on Monday it expects to handle more than 280 million shipments in the period and intends to add 20,000 seasonal workers. “While there is some uncertainty around the magnitude of the holiday shopping season, we are confident in UPS’s ability to deliver,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said. The stock rose 2.7 percent to $73.50 in late-morning trade. The company will be more exposed to problems in Europe with its planned TNT purchase, but the deal will make UPS the market leader on the continent and broaden its reach in Asian and Latin American markets. UPS and TNT will respond within a couple of weeks to objections to the deal from the European Commission. The European Union’s antitrust chief has said UPS will have to make concessions to get approval. Davis, the CEO, said UPS is confident the deal will close in early 2013. U.S. domestic revenue rose $94 million from the year-ago  third quarter, with daily package delivery volume up 3.7 percent on e-commerce shipments. The biggest percentage rise was in deferred deliveries, a cheaper option. International package revenue declined 3.7 percent as lower fuel surcharges to customers and the impact from foreign currency more than offset 1.2 percent growth in daily export volume. For the first time in several quarters, Asia showed growth in export package volume, largely benefiting from technology product launches, the company said. This year, UPS has adjusted its network to cope with slowing shipments from Asia and higher demand for cheaper shipping. Third-quarter earnings declined to $469 million or 48 cents share, from $1.07 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. In August, the company said it would restructure pension liabilities and record an aftertax, non-cash charge of $559 million in the quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.06 per share, matching analysts’ estimates, compared with $1.09 a year ago. UPS revenue totaled $13.07 billion in the quarter, down from $13.17 billion a year ago and below the $13.3 billion forecast.

147,UPS,"UPS sees 10 percent rise in holiday shipping, to hire 55,000 workers","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) expects shipments during the upcoming holiday season to hit record levels this year, up 10 percent from last year, and plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers to handle the added volume. UPS added the same amount of workers in 2011 to keep pace with a similar increase in holiday shipments. The world’s largest package delivery company, and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), are closely watched for indications of consumer demand, the health of retailers and the state of the economy. The company estimates it will deliver 527 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which would top last year’s record of 480 million, driven by e-commerce. As shoppers buy more of their holiday gifts over the Internet, this means more shipping volume for FedEx and UPS, which each have delivery contracts with most of the biggest e-tailers. Large chain stores including Toys R Us <TOY.UL}, Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Macy’s Inc (M.N) plan on adding more holiday workers than last year, based on the view that consumers will spend modestly more this year as the economy mends gradually. Improved technology and productivity will help UPS handle the increased shipping volume with the same amount of seasonal hires as last year, said spokesman Susan Rosenberg. UPS said its busiest day of the year will be December 20, with an estimated 28 million packages delivered. That would be up from 27 million on its busiest days last year. Typically, it handles 15.8 million packages daily. “Once again, the popularity of e-commerce and mobile accessibility are likely to delay online shopping and compress deliveries into the final two weeks before Christmas,” UPS said in a statement. This year, global economic weakening and concerns about expiring U.S. tax cuts could also keep more consumers waiting until the last minute and searching for discounts before ordering holiday gifts. Retailers are keeping inventory fairly lean, so a bigger-than expected jump in demand could boost demand for the quick deliveries offered by UPS and FedEx. UPS last week reported lower quarterly profit and “some uncertainty” about the strength of the coming holiday season. FedEx, the No. 2 package delivery company, has said it plans to keep this year’s seasonal hires at 20,000, the same as last year, to handle volume that it expects will be 13 percent higher than last year. Analysts said that while shipping volume is increasing, delivery companies face revenue constraints as frugal customers opt for cheaper shipping methods.

148,UPS,TNT Express quarterly profit down 12 percent,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - TNT Express TNTE.AS, the Dutch mail delivery group being bought by UPS (UPS.N) said third-quarter profit fell 12 percent. The company also repeated that it expected EU Commission approval for the deal. UPS, or United Parcel Service, is not expected to complete the 5.2 billion euro acquisition until early next year after the European Commission expressed objections. TNT Express reported operating profit at the low end of expectations in the third quarter, down 12 percent to 38 million euros ($49.1 million) on sales of 1.8 billion euros. Forecasts were in a range of 30 million to 91 million euros, with most at the lower end of that range, giving an average of 62 million euros in a Reuters poll of six analysts. TNT said it booked 51 million euros in provisions in the quarter, 19 million of which was for claims in Brazil. Operating losses in the Americas eased from 30 million euros a year earlier to 23 million. The European Union’s antitrust chief has said UPS and TNT would have to offer concessions to secure regulatory approval for the deal. A merged UPS and TNT would have a quarter of the European express services market, ahead of DHL Worldwide Express BV DHL.UL with 19 percent, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. The Commission is scheduled to decide on the proposed merger by January 15 next year. Analysts had already warned that the deal would give UPS a dominant position in some markets, such as Britain, and that as a result it would have to sell assets to soothe regulatory concerns.

149,UPS,"EU's Almunia wants substantial UPS, Hutchison concessions","BRUSSELS, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The EU antitrust chief called on United Parcel Service Inc on Friday to come up with significant concessions to allay concerns that its 5.2 billion-euro ($6.68 billion) bid for Dutch peer TNT Express  may hurt rivals and consumers. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia also expressed similar concerns about telecoms operator Hutchison 3G’s  planned 1.3 billion-euro takeover of France Telecom’s  Orange Austria, saying he wanted sizeable concessions. The European Commission, charged with ensuring that mergers in the 27-country European Union do not harm competition, has been examining both deals for several months. “Our preliminary view is that serious competition concerns would arise in both cases, and substantial remedies are needed,” Almunia said, according to an advanced copy of a speech to be delivered at a competition conference in Cernobbio, Italy. He did not provide details of the kind of remedies he was looking for. The EU watchdog typically prefers asset sales to licensing or network access concessions. UPS has yet to offer any remedies to the EU executive. The TNT bid, the biggest in its 105-year history, wil reinforce it as the world No. 1 package delivery company. Hutchison is willing to divest 2.6 GHz spectrum to try to win EU approval for its planned purchase of Orange Austria, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. That offer comes on top of an earlier proposal to open up its network in Austria to rivals. The EU executive has set a Dec. 21 deadline for a decision on the Hutchison deal and Jan. 15 for UPS.

153,UPS,UPDATE 1-UPS raising delivery rates by up to 4.9 pct in 2013,"By Lynn Adler Nov 16 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service is raising net shipping rates by up to 4.9 percent in 2013, with smaller increases on air express services as it caters to customer demand for slower and cheaper shipping options. The world’s largest package delivery company also said on Friday that the slowest freight shipment rate will increase after being unchanged this year. UPS, like No. 2 package delivery company FedEx, is viewed as an economic bellwether because of the volume of goods it handles. Slowing global trade has pushed many customers to choose cheaper, less profitable shipping options, which pressured the company’s profits in the third quarter. UPS suggested that its fourth-quarter profits would top estimates. UPS has forecast a 10 percent jump in holiday shipments this year from last year, driven by growing e-commerce. Average net delivery rates will increase 4.5 percent on UPS air and U.S.-originated international services, compared with 4.9 percent in 2012. Ground deliveries will rise by a net 4.9 percent next year, matching this year’s increase, the company said. UPS next-day and 2nd day air freight rates within and between the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico will also rise 4.9 percent, down from 5.9 percent in 2012. The air freight segment handles packages weighing 150 pounds or more, or that do not fit inside of a box. UPS’s 3-day freight rates, unchanged this year, will go up 4.9 percent next year. “People are still looking for cost-effective options, and the 3-day option is more cost-effective than a 2nd-day option,”  UPS spokesman Tyre Sperling said.

The flight operations’ sale depends on the completion of the merger of UPS and TNT Express, the Dutch company said in a statement on Friday.

157,UPS,TEXT-S&P; keeps TNT Express ratings on creditwatch positive,"Nov 28 - Overview — Netherlands-based courier, express, and parcels company TNT Express  N.V. and U.S.-based United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) announced that the  Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets has granted an exemption to  extend UPS’ offer period for the outstanding shares of TNT Express. — The offer period has been extended to allow for the appropriate  clearances from the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,  but no later than Feb. 28, 2013. — We are keeping our ‘BBB+/A-2’ long- and short-term corporate credit  ratings on TNT Express on CreditWatch positive. — The ongoing CreditWatch reflects the possibility of an upgrade if we  believe that the merger enhances TNT Express’ credit quality. Rating Action On Nov. 28, 2012, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services kept on CreditWatch with  positive implications its ‘BBB+/A-2’ long- and short-term corporate credit  ratings on Netherlands-based courier, express, and parcels company TNT Express  N.V. We originally placed the ratings on CreditWatch on Feb. 24, 2012. Rationale The ongoing CreditWatch placement follows the announcement, by TNT Express and  U.S.-based package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS;  A+/Negative/A-1), that the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets has  granted an exemption for UPS to extend its offer period for the outstanding  shares of TNT Express. We understand that the offer period ends one week after  clearance from the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce  has been received, but no later than Feb. 28, 2013. In addition, since our  last update, TNT Express and UPS have received a statement of objections from  the European Commission. We understand that the statement of objections is a  normal step in the second phase of merger procedure. In our view, TNT Express could benefit from ownership by UPS, which we would  view as the stronger entity in the context of this acquisition. As per our  criteria, a weaker entity owned by a stronger parent will usually—although  not always—have a higher rating than it would on a stand-alone basis. (For  further details, see “Corporate Criteria—Parent/Subsidiary Links; General  Principles; Subsidiaries/Joint Ventures/Nonrecourse Projects; Finance  Subsidiaries; Rating Link to Parent,” published Oct. 28, 2004, on  RatingsDirect on the Global Credit Portal.) If UPS were to fully integrate TNT Express, we could equalize our ratings on  TNT Express with our ratings on its parent company. If the integration was  only partial, we would still upgrade TNT Express, with the scale of the  upgrade depending on our view of UPS’ willingness to provide financial support  to TNT Express in the event of distress. TNT Express offers domestic, regional, and intercontinental delivery services,  mainly for business-to-business customers. Its service entails picking up,  transporting, and delivering documents, parcels, and freight around the world.  TNT Express was spun off from TNT N.V. (now PostNL N.V. ) in June 2011. The ratings on TNT Express reflect our view of its “satisfactory” business  risk profile, which is supported by TNT Express’ position as a leading  European and international courier, express, and parcels delivery services  integrator. The ratings also reflect our assessment of TNT Express’ “modest”  financial risk profile. In our view, these strengths are partially offset by TNT Express’  participation in a market that is competitive (especially in Europe) and  highly fragmented, its high level of operational leverage, and exposure to  economic cyclicality. On a stand-alone basis (excluding any implications of the UPS offer), we  forecast that Standard & Poor’s-adjusted debt will be about EUR1 billion at  year-end 2012. We anticipate that this will contribute to an adjusted ratio of  debt to EBITDA of about 2x at year-end 2012, which is the same as in 2011.  Based on our forecast of adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of about EUR450  million-EUR485 million in 2012, we project that the ratio of adjusted FFO to  debt will improve to 45% by the end of 2012, from 42% in 2011. Liquidity The short-term rating on TNT Express is ‘A-2’. We view TNT Express’ liquidity  as “strong” under our criteria. As of Sept. 30, 2012, we estimate the ratio of liquidity sources to uses to be  about 3.5x-4.0x. Sources include our forecasts of: — Centralized cash and equivalents of about EUR250 million; — About EUR570 million available under a committed credit line that  expires in March 2016; and — FFO of EUR350 million-EUR375 million (excluding adjustments). We estimate TNT Express’ liquidity needs over the 12 months as: — Short-term borrowings of EUR43 million; — Capital expenditure of about EUR220 million, or about 3% of estimated  revenues; and — Our estimation of the cash element of the dividend for 2012 of about  EUR25 million-EUR50 million, in line with TNT Express’ stated dividend policy. The  cash element has historically varied as the company offers dividends to be  paid either in cash or shares. There are no financial covenant triggers with liquidity implications in the  documentation for the undrawn credit line. TNT Express has no debt maturities  of more than EUR50 million per year until 2015. CreditWatch We aim to resolve the CreditWatch placement after the completion of the  acquisition. We will assess the effect of the acquisition on TNT Express’  business and financial risk profiles. We could raise our ratings on TNT  Express if we believe that the acquisition has enhanced its credit quality. If UPS were to fully integrate TNT Express, we could equalize our ratings on  TNT Express with our ratings on its parent company. If the integration was  only partial, we would still upgrade TNT Express, with the scale of the  upgrade depending on our view of UPS’ willingness to provide financial support  to TNT Express in the event of distress. In the event that the acquisition does not conclude, we could affirm our  ratings on TNT Express and assign a stable outlook if the company’s credit  standing remains in line with our forecasts. This would be consistent with the  company maintaining its current financial policy, with adjusted FFO to debt of  at least 45% and debt to EBITDA of no more than 2x on a sustainable basis.

158,UPS,"UPS, TNT plan asset sales to clear EU antitrust hurdle","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) (UPS.N) and its Dutch takeover target TNT Express NV TNTE.AS have submitted plans to meet European anti-trust concerns as they battle to keep the acquisition on track. The two companies said they planned to sell assets and open up their air flight operations, but gave no details, leaving TNT Express shares languishing some 20 percent below the 9.50 euros offer price as many investors took the view that the deal was unlikely to happen. Andre Mulder, analyst at brokerage Kepler Capital, said it was unclear how any proposed concessions would work in practice, in particular the opening up of their airline networks, as this would require some competitors to change their overall logistics strategies. “We however doubt whether that is sufficient to please the EC. We remain negative on the chance of success,” Mulder said. TNT Express shares rose just over 1 percent in early trade to 7.65 euros. The European Commission (EC), Europe’s competition watchdog, is worried the 5.2 billion euros ($6.8 billion) takeover by UPS, the world’s No. 1 package delivery firm, would leave only two other big players, Deutsche Post AG’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL and U.S.-based FedEx Corp (FDX.N). The EC last month warned UPS about the combined companies’ high market share and said it would seek concessions before it could approve the deal. The two companies did not say on Friday which operations and assets could be sold and did not name any possible buyers or users of their air flight operations. But they said the terms of the offer would not change due to their proposed concessions. “The proposed remedies aim to address the EC’s concerns regarding the competitive effects of the intended merger on the international express small package market in Europe,” the two said in a joint statement. UPS has argued that in addition to FedEx and DHL, its competitors also include national postal companies such as French mail group DPD and Royal Mail’s GBPO.UL European express parcel service GLS, as well as freight forwarders like Swiss companies Kuehne & Nagel KNIN.VX and Panalpina (PWTN.S). But divestments were widely expected for the deal to go ahead. Analysts had said UPS might need to sell some assets and restructure operations, based on the overlap with TNT Express’s network, as well as regulatory restrictions, and had flagged the UK business as one area that could be sold. TNT Express is the market leader in Europe with an 18 percent share, while Deutsche Post DHL is second at 15 percent and UPS has 10 percent. Analysts have estimated that in the UK, TNT Express and UPS have a combined market share of about 35 percent, while in Germany and France their share is about 30 percent and in the Netherlands it is below 30 percent. TNT Express has conditionally sold its airlines operations to Dublin-based ASL Aviation Group, the Dutch company said two weeks ago. UPS, under European law, cannot own TNT’s airline operations as it is an American company. UPS has talked to FedEx and subsidiaries of France’s La Poste LAPST.UL and Britain’s Royal Mail to sell assets or open its network to rivals, news agency Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

The world No. 1 package delivery company is seeking to buy Dutch peer and European market leader TNT TNTE.AS to gain access to TNT’s network in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets. UPS submitted its latest offer to the European Commission on Monday, one of the sources said. “The remedies are substantially improved,” the second person said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the matter. A UPS spokeswoman said the Atlanta-based company was working on ways of tweaking its TNT deal to win European approval but declined to comment on any specific actions it was contemplating. “As we move through this process, remedies can change,” said spokeswoman Peggy Gardner. The EU antitrust authority, which will decide by February 5 whether to clear or block the deal, has told UPS rivals and customers to provide feedback on the latest concessions by Wednesday, one of the people said. The Commission declined to comment. TNT shares added gains after Reuters reported the latest UPS concessions and were up 3 percent to 8.18 euros in mid-session. UPS’ earlier offer was aimed at boosting French mail group DPD as a viable third European competitor able to offer both road and air freight services. The EU watchdog is concerned UPS’s takeover of TNT would result in the merged entity competing mainly with just Deutsche Post’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL unit in Europe. The German package delivery company has a 15 percent share of the European market, behind TNT’s 18 percent. UPS also competes with U.S. rival FedEx (FDX.N).

164,UPS,FedEx rejects UPS offer of TNT Express assets-FT,"LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Informal approaches by United Parcel Service to FedEx to sell a package of TNT Express assets have been rebuffed by its U.S. rival, making it potentially harder for UPS to win approval for its takeover of the Dutch delivery group, the Financial Times reported. FedEx is refusing to engage in serious talks unless they cover a bigger slice of the TNT business, the newspaper said on Tuesday. The European Commission (EC), Europe’s competition watchdog, is worried that the 5.2 billion euros ($6.8 billion) takeover by UPS, the world’s no. 1 package delivery company, would leave only two other big players, Deutsche Post AG’s DHL and U.S.-based FedEx. In November, UPS and TNT said they planned to sell assets in order to meet European anti-trust concerns. Analysts and investors have said that FedEx wants the takeover to be blocked. French mail group DPD is currently the sole contender to buy the assets, which cover TNT subsidiaries in at least 16 European Union countries including Spain, the FT cited several people familiar involved with the clearance talks as saying. Joaquin Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, is however cautious about a sale to DPD as it does not have an air network and would rely on buying space in aircraft from its rival, which  has raised doubts about its future commitment to compete with UPS, the FT said. A TNT spokesman declined to comment on the FT report but said UPS and TNT were fully committed to the deal and were working closely with the EC. Fedex declined to comment while the EC and UPS were not immediately available to comment.",1072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex-ups-tntexpress/fedex-rejects-ups-offer-of-tnt-express-assets-ft-idUSL5E9C7BAX20130107

Upon such an outcome, UPS would end its offer to buy TNT and  pay a termination fee of EUR200 million.  Standard & Poor’s does not expect the European regulators’ decision to have  any impact on our ratings on UPS. On Sept. 21, 2012, we downgraded UPS,  removed ratings from CreditWatch, and assigned a negative outlook. Our rating  action reflected weakened credit metrics because of UPS’ increased exposure to  multiemployer pension plan contingent liabilities in recent years. We also  factored into our downgrade the company’s plans to continue to make  significant shareholder rewards. Although we now no longer expect UPS to  complete the acquisition of TNT, we believe the current ratings and outlook  remain appropriate because of UPS’ weakened credit metrics and the potential  for higher-than-expected shareholder rewards and increased pension contingent  liabilities.",1142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNB002EO20130114
170,UPS,Hedge funds nurse heavy losses after UPS-TNT deal collapses,"LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service’s decision  to abandon its 5.2 billion euro ($6.9 billion) bid for TNT Express has left hedge funds nursing potential losses of more than $700 million, as the Dutch delivery firm’s shares slid. So-called merger arbitrage funds - which make money betting on the outcomes of corporate events including takeovers - are estimated to have owned around 30 percent of TNT shares before Monday’s news European anti-trust regulators would veto it, several sources familiar with the sector said. With TNT shares losing half their value when the market opened and ending the day down 41 percent, funds collectively could have lost more than 540 million euros ($722 million). “This was one of the only large, liquid, all-cash deals in Europe right now. It’s going to have been really painful across the street,” one merger arbitrage manager who owned TNT shares before selling them on Monday morning told Reuters. Funds had been buying shares in TNT ever since UPS made a 5.2 billion euro ($6.9 billion) play for the company last February. But UPS and TNT said on Monday European Union officials had told it that the EU executive Commission would veto the deal, leaving them no choice but to drop it. It is impossible to calculate exactly how many shares were held in the hands of hedge fund because Dutch regulations stipulate that investors must only detail a stake larger than 5 percent in a company. Among the biggest hedge fund holdings in TNT was Water Island Capital’s. According to Thomson Reuters data, the $3 billion U.S.-based firm owned almost 14 million shares, or 2.56 percent of TNT, in September, making it the Dutch firm’s fifth biggest shareholder. Merger arbitrage funds have struggled in recent years amid a sharp slowdown in the deals they thrive on, as companies hold off from spending their cash until the euro zone debt crisis eases and the economic recovery looks to be on firmer ground. The UPS-TNT deal was among the top five biggest plays for merger arbitrage funds in the last six months, along with commodities trader Glencore’s $33 billion takeover of miner Xstrata. Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week that UPS would need to create an equivalent rival to TNT before he would approve the deal. In the end, the U.S. firm seemed not to have done enough to help France’s DPD expand its challenge. Funds were convinced that because the Commission was remedy testing DPD as a third rival in the market, the deal would most likely go ahead, resulting in some hedge funds switching out of short bets in the last month or so, one source told Reuters. This week’s losses also highlight the risk for merger arbitrage funds in betting on deals subject to huge regulatory and political risks for which managers are often unprepared. “In what has been a time of very few deals, funds have been driven towards this one,” one London-based prime broker said, asking not to be named. Last year the average merger arb fund gained less than 3 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research, less than half the average fund’s 6.16 percent. Several merger arbitrage funds said that while losses were big, some funds had mitigated the damage by reducing their positions in TNT late last year amid growing worries Brussels would intervene in the deal. A common way to hedge against the risk of a failing deal was to short - bet on a falling price - shares in PostNL, which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay investors a dividend and is TNT’s biggest shareholder. PostNL shares closed down a whopping 36 percent, but this was less than TNT’s and means even hedge funds who hedged their position are likely to have lost money.",1142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/ups-tntexpress-hedgefunds/hedge-funds-nurse-heavy-losses-after-ups-tnt-deal-collapses-idUSL6N0AJAPI20130114
171,UPS,TNT slumps as UPS pulls bid on EU veto,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - UPS (UPS.N) is dropping its $7 billion bid for Dutch delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS after European anti-trust regulators said they would veto it, leaving TNT’s future in doubt and almost halving the value of its shares. Shares in U.S.-based United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) gained 1.2 percent on Monday after the world leader in the sector said in a statement that European Union officials told it the EU executive Commission would veto the deal. An EU source confirmed that and said the decision could be made public as early as next week. UPS wanted to buy the smaller firm for its European network and assets in fast-growing Asia and Latin America. While the collapse of the 5.2 billion euro takeover means a rethink at UPS, the impact is far greater on TNT, which is struggling in a weak European market and lacks a strategy for developing on its own after nearly a year of negotiations on the merger. Investors wiped nearly 2 billion euros off its value as the share price dived 42 percent to 4.750 euros. The two companies offered to sell some operations to ease concerns about competition in Europe, where rivals FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and DHL had lobbied the Commission to block the deal, a banking source said. But UPS and TNT failed to find buyers and planned asset sales were not enough to satisfy EU officials. “It’s more than a minor setback” for UPS, said Kurt Hoefer, research analyst at portfolio manager Golub Group in San Mateo, California, which holds UPS shares. “It would have been a nice addition to have TNT’s domestic routes as part of the UPS system.” Having been blocked in its attempt at a large takeover, UPS will likely return to its prior strategy of pursuing strings of small deals on the continent, Hoefer said, adding, “I don’t think they have any alternative but to grow it organically.” UPS will pay TNT a termination fee of 200 million euros. Shares in U.S.-based FedEx were slightly firmer, up 0.3 percent, while those of DHL’s German parent Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) were down by a similar margin. Deutsche Post’s finance chief told Reuters the company had no interest in buying TNT nor any other express delivery business. TNT faces an uncertain future. It has had to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in Brazil and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer in March. TNT had been partially split from Dutch postal operator PostNL (PTNL.AS) in May 2011 in an attempt to profit from express operations as traditional mail business declines. But its weak performance quickly prompted activist shareholders to push for a management shake-up or an outright sale. “Now TNT will have to continue alone,” said Philip Scholte, an analyst at Rabobank. “TNT’s management will have to roll up their sleeves, come up with a plan and get down to work.” TNT, which reports annual results on February 18, said it would update investors on its strategy in due course. Shares in PostNL, its biggest shareholder, plunged by over a third. A new merger proposal for TNT seems unlikely, at least in the short term. Its closest European rival, DHL, is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get EU competition approval. “FedEx is the only other option,” said analyst Maarten Bakker at ABN Amro. “And they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid.” Others suggested TNT would be a poor fit with FedEx. “They seem to be committed to faster-growing regions, and adding a thoroughly unionized European Union entity to the FedEx mix would certainly be a shock to that culture,” said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker, who noted that few FedEx employees are unionized. A FedEx spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would pursue a bid for TNT. Any bid from an existing operator will face questions from an EU Commission concerned about prices being pushed up and wary of mergers that shrink any market to three players from four, as would have happened had UPS faced only FedEx and DHL. Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week that UPS would need to create an equivalent rival to TNT before he would approve the deal. In the end, the U.S. firm seemed not to have done enough to help France’s DPD expand its challenge. UPS had offered to sell warehouses and customer bases in 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe, and discussed divesting other assets, including some to FedEx, according to media reports. But FedEx and DPD did not take up offers of assets. “FedEx’s heavy lobbying against the deal didn’t help either, and more generally the lack of bidders was a problem,” said a source familiar with the deal. “FedEx didn’t offer to buy any of the assets on the block. La Poste-DPD were very close to buying the international express unit but it didn’t happen in the end.” UPS CEO Scott Davis voiced his disappointment: “We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC’s concerns with the transaction,” he said in a statement. The European Commission, however, was left unimpressed. In other anti-trust rulings recently, Almunia vetoed a $7.4 billion financial exchange merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse in February, saying the deal would have given the new company a lock on European futures trading. This month Hutchison Whampoa 0013.HK overcame his concerns that its purchase of Orange Austria would reduce competition in the Austrian telecoms market only by agreeing to help other companies break into the market. Universal Music Group staved off an EU veto on its $1.9-billion plan to buy EMI’s recorded music unit in September only after promising to sell some of the British firm’s most valuable labels, to get its market share below 40 percent.

172,UPS,UPDATE 3-UPS to drop TNT Express bid after European Commission veto,"By Sara Webb and Anthony Deutsch AMSTERDAM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc  said it would drop its 5.2 billion euro ($7 billion) bid for Dutch delivery firm TNT Express on the expectation of an EU veto, a sharp blow that halved the value of TNT’s shares within minutes. U.S.-based UPS, the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, had sought to buy the Dutch firm to gain access to its European network and business in fast-growing Asia and Latin America. The collapse of the deal is particularly damaging for TNT Express, which has struggled to turn around in a weak European market and will have trouble regaining market share, believed to have been eroded during the talks with UPS. The plunge in its share price wiped more than 2 billion euros off its value. UPS would also have to adjust to the loss of opportunity, said Philip Scholte at Rabobank: “This is going to make it hard for UPS to increase its position in Europe on its own.” UPS and TNT Express said the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, had told the two firms it was working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition, leaving them no choice but to abandon it. “UPS will pay TNT a termination fee in the amount of 200 million euros and will withdraw the offer,” once the formal decision is taken, UPS said on Monday. The European Commission declined to comment. EC competition policy spokesman Antoine Colombani said the decision would be taken in “due time” with a deadline of Feb. 5. TNT Express has been forced to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in Brazil, and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer. TNT Express shares fell to 4.051 euro, compared with the UPS offer price of 9.50 euro per share. “This is a big disappointment of course. The market had discounted the shares slightly below the offer price, but everyone had thought they would be able to work something out in the end,” said Rabobank’s Scholte. After focusing on the deal for nearly a year, TNT Express will have to find a new chief executive and set out a new business strategy. The deal had initially been expected to close in the third quarter of 2012. “Now TNT will have to continue alone. TNT’s management will have to roll up their sleeves, come up with a plan and get down to work,” Scholte said. TNT Express said it would give an update on its strategy in due course. A new merger seems unlikely, at least in the short term. Its closest European rival, Deutsche Post’s DHL is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get European approval for an acquisition. “America’s FedEX is the only other option and they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid,” said analyst Maarten Bakker of ABN Amro. The U.S. delivery company had offered various concessions in a bid to win EU regulatory approval for its bid, including a proposal to sell warehouses and customer bases in about 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe. “We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC’s concerns with the transaction,” Scott Davis, UPS chairman and chief executive said in a statement, expressing disappointment at the decision after months of talks. “The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular,” Davis added.

178,UPS,RPT-Hedge funds nurse heavy losses after UPS-TNT deal collapses,"By Tommy Wilkes and Anjuli Davies LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service’s decision  to abandon its 5.2 billion euro ($6.9 billion) bid for TNT Express has left hedge funds nursing potential losses of more than $700 million, as the Dutch delivery firm’s shares slid. So-called merger arbitrage funds - which make money betting on the outcomes of corporate events including takeovers - are estimated to have owned around 30 percent of TNT shares before Monday’s news European anti-trust regulators would veto it, several sources familiar with the sector said. With TNT shares losing half their value when the market opened and ending the day down 41 percent, funds collectively could have lost more than 540 million euros ($722 million). “This was one of the only large, liquid, all-cash deals in Europe right now. It’s going to have been really painful across the street,” one merger arbitrage manager who owned TNT shares before selling them on Monday morning told Reuters. Funds had been buying shares in TNT ever since UPS made a 5.2 billion euro ($6.9 billion) play for the company last February. But UPS and TNT said on Monday European Union officials had told it that the EU executive Commission would veto the deal, leaving them no choice but to drop it. It is impossible to calculate exactly how many shares were held in the hands of hedge fund because Dutch regulations stipulate that investors must only detail a stake larger than 5 percent in a company. Among the biggest hedge fund holdings in TNT was Water Island Capital’s. According to Thomson Reuters data, the $3 billion U.S.-based firm owned almost 14 million shares, or 2.56 percent of TNT, in September, making it the Dutch firm’s fifth biggest shareholder. Merger arbitrage funds have struggled in recent years amid a sharp slowdown in the deals they thrive on, as companies hold off from spending their cash until the euro zone debt crisis eases and the economic recovery looks to be on firmer ground. The UPS-TNT deal was among the top five biggest plays for merger arbitrage funds in the last six months, along with commodities trader Glencore’s $33 billion takeover of miner Xstrata. Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week that UPS would need to create an equivalent rival to TNT before he would approve the deal. In the end, the U.S. firm seemed not to have done enough to help France’s DPD expand its challenge. Funds were convinced that because the Commission was remedy testing DPD as a third rival in the market, the deal would most likely go ahead, resulting in some hedge funds switching out of short bets in the last month or so, one source told Reuters. This week’s losses also highlight the risk for merger arbitrage funds in betting on deals subject to huge regulatory and political risks for which managers are often unprepared. “In what has been a time of very few deals, funds have been driven towards this one,” one London-based prime broker said, asking not to be named. Last year the average merger arb fund gained less than 3 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research, less than half the average fund’s 6.16 percent. Several merger arbitrage funds said that while losses were big, some funds had mitigated the damage by reducing their positions in TNT late last year amid growing worries Brussels would intervene in the deal. A common way to hedge against the risk of a failing deal was to short - bet on a falling price - shares in PostNL, which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay investors a dividend and is TNT’s biggest shareholder.

179,UPS,"TEXT-S&P; removes TNT Express from watch pos, affrms rtgs;otlk stbl","Jan 16 - Overview — The Netherlands-based courier, express, and parcels company TNT Express N.V.  has announced that U.S.-based United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) sees no realistic prospect of obtaining European Commission clearance for the companies’ proposed merger and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on revised terms. — We anticipate that UPS will terminate the proposed merger on receiving formal confirmation that the European Commission will not grant regulatory approval, which is due before Feb. 5, 2013. — We are therefore removing from CreditWatch positive and affirming our ‘BBB+/A-2’ long- and short-term corporate credit ratings on TNT Express. — The stable outlook reflects our view that TNT Express will be able to improve its operating margins in the medium term through a sustained focus on its European business and cost-control initiatives. Rating Action On Jan. 16, 2013, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services removed from CreditWatch with positive implications and affirmed its ‘BBB+/A-2’ long- and short-term corporate credit ratings on The Netherlands-based courier, express, and parcels company TNT Express N.V. We originally placed the ratings on CreditWatch positive on Feb. 24, 2012. The outlook is stable. Rationale The removal of the ratings from CreditWatch positive follows the announcement by TNT Express that U.S.-based United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS; A+/Negative/A-1) sees no realistic prospect of obtaining European Commission clearance for its merger with TNT Express. The European Commission has informed TNT Express that it is likely to prohibit the proposed merger on the current terms. TNT Express has also announced that UPS will not pursue the transaction on revised terms. As such, we anticipate that UPS will withdraw the merger proposal on receiving formal confirmation that the European Commission will not grant regulatory approval, which is due by Feb. 5, 2013. On termination, UPS will pay TNT Express a EUR200 million termination fee. The CreditWatch positive placement reflected our view that a successful merger with UPS could have improved our assessment of TNT Express’ credit quality. The ratings on TNT Express reflect our view of its “satisfactory” business risk profile, which is supported by TNT Express’ position as a leading European and international courier, express, and parcels delivery services integrator. The ratings also reflect our assessment of TNT Express’ “modest” financial risk profile. In our view, these strengths are partially offset by TNT Express’ participation in a market that is competitive (especially in Europe) and highly fragmented, its high level of operational leverage, and its exposure to economic cyclicality. We forecast that TNT Express’ Standard & Poor’s-adjusted debt will be about EUR1 billion at year-end 2012. We anticipate that this will contribute to an adjusted ratio of debt to EBITDA of about 2x at year-end 2012, which is the same as in 2011. Based on our forecast of adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of about EUR450 million-EUR485 million in 2012, we project that the ratio of adjusted FFO to debt will improve to 45% by the end of 2012, from 42% in 2011. Liquidity The short-term rating on TNT Express is ‘A-2’. We view TNT Express’ liquidity as “strong” under our criteria. For the 12 months to Sept. 30, 2013, we estimate TNT Express’ ratio of liquidity sources to uses to be about 3.5x-4.0x. Sources include our forecasts of: — Centralized cash and equivalents of about EUR250 million; — About EUR570 million available under a committed credit line that expires in March 2016; and — FFO of EUR350 million-EUR375 million (excluding our adjustments). We estimate TNT Express’ liquidity needs over the 12 months as: — Short-term borrowings of EUR43 million; — Capital expenditure of about EUR220 million, or about 3% of estimated revenues; and — Our estimation of the cash element of the dividend for 2012 of about EUR25 million-EUR50 million, in line with TNT Express’ stated dividend policy. The cash element has historically varied as the company offers dividends to be paid either in cash or shares. There are no financial covenant triggers with liquidity implications in the documentation for the undrawn credit line. TNT Express has no debt maturities of more than EUR50 million per year until 2016. Outlook The stable outlook reflects our view that TNT Express will be able to improve its operating margins in the medium term through a sustained focus on its European business and cost-control initiatives. The ratings could come under pressure in the event that TNT Express’ financial performance weakens substantially. This could occur if, for example, TNT Express is unable to improve its EBITDA margin as a result of loss of market share or cost pressures. We might consider lowering the ratings if adjusted FFO to debt falls below 45%, debt to EBITDA increases above 2x, or if TNT Express is unable to maintain positive discretionary cash flow. In addition, shareholder-friendly actions could weigh negatively on our ratings assessment. We view the prospect of an upgrade as remote at this stage, given the industry constraints and uncertainties around TNT Express’ strategy following the recent announcement. We understand that management will provide a strategic update shortly, and we will review this as well as the year-end 2012 results. In addition, we do not see the financial risk profile improving over the near term because we anticipate that any significant outperformance would be reinvested or returned to shareholders in some form.

180,UPS,TEXT-S&P; removes PostNL 'BBB' rating from watch pos; outlook neg,"Rationale The rating actions reflect the announcement, by Netherlands-based courier,  express, and parcels company TNT Express N.V., that U.S.-based United Parcel  Service Inc. (UPS) sees no realistic prospect that the sale of PostNL’s share  in TNT Express to UPS will gain European Commission clearance on the current  terms, and that UPS will not pursue the sale on revised terms. Consequently,  UPS plans to withdraw its offer to buy PostNL’s share in TNT Express when the  European Commission delivers its anticipated formal decision to prohibit the  sale, which is due by Feb. 5, 2013. PostNL was planning to sell the 29.8% share it owns in TNT Express to UPS for  a cash consideration of EUR1.54 billion. It was also planning to use part of the  proceeds to reduce its net debt to EUR300 million-EUR500 million. Since the sale  is unlikely to proceed, we no longer see any potential for PostNL to improve  its financial risk profile from our current assessment of “significant” in the  short term. Such improvement would have depended on PostNL achieving Standard  & Poor’s-adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 45%, on a sustainable  basis. While this no longer appears feasible, we understand that PostNL still  plans to monetize its stake in TNT Express in the medium term, although we  have no visibility on whether it would be able to achieve a comparable offer  to that from UPS. Furthermore, we consider that PostNL’s business risk profile is under  persistent pressure from the weak economic environment in The Netherlands and  from the company’s participation in the European mail industry, which  continues to be subject to a structural volume decline. This decline, along  with fierce competition and relatively high labor costs, has placed pressure  on PostNL’s profitability and has led the company to restructure its mail  business in The Netherlands. We note that this is a complex program of change  and that the effects of reorganization have been more extensive than we  originally anticipated. In addition, we note that the volumes of addressed  mail in The Netherlands declined more in the third quarter of 2012 than we  previously anticipated, and we forecast a continued decrease in mail volumes.  If a rate of decline similar to that in the third quarter persists, and the  pressure on the company’s profitability continues, this could weigh negatively  on our current assessment of the company’s business risk profile as “strong”. Liquidity The short-term rating on PostNL is ‘A-2’. We view PostNL’s liquidity as  “strong” under our criteria, reflecting our calculation that the company’s  sources of liquidity exceed its uses by 1.5x or more over the next 24 months.  We anticipate that net liquidity sources would remain positive even if EBITDA  were to decline by 30%. We understand that PostNL has well-established, solid  relationships with banks, and a high standing in the credit markets. Liquidity sources to September 2013 are: — About EUR398 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30, 2012,  of which about EUR50 million are restricted; — A EUR570 million undrawn committed revolving credit facility due May  2016. Uses of liquidity to September 2013 include: — About EUR50 million of negative unadjusted FFO under our base-case  forecast for 2012, including EUR84 million in top-up payments to pension funds,  to be paid in December 2012; — Our forecast of working capital needs of about EUR45 million; — Capital expenditures of about EUR200 million; and — About EUR60 million of debt maturities. We note that debt maturities in 2013 and 2014 are immaterial. PostNL’s next  significant maturity falls due in 2015 when a EUR400 million bond matures. Outlook The negative outlook reflects our view that PostNL might be not able to  maintain its ratings-commensurate business risk profile amid difficult  operating conditions stemming from the weak economic outlook, the structural  volume decline in The Netherlands’ mail market, and the resulting pressure on  the company’s profitability. Moreover, negative rating pressure could arise if PostNL adopts a more  aggressive financial policy, thereby weakening its credit metrics to levels  below those we consider commensurate with a “significant” financial risk  profile. We consider a ratio of adjusted FFO to debt of more than 25%, on a  sustainable basis, as commensurate with the current rating. We will look to update our views after PostNL’s release of its year-end 2012  results and our review of its business and financial strategies—in  particular, the aggressiveness of its discretionary spending, and its earnings  and cash flow prospects.

181,UPS,"EU antitrust regulators block 5.2 billion euro UPS, TNT deal","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators blocked a 5.2 billion euro ($7 billion) bid by United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) for TNT Express TNTE.AS, denting the world No. 1 package delivery company’s hopes of expanding its presence in Asia and Latin America. The EU regulatory veto means the world’s No. 1 package delivery company may now have to grow via smaller acquisitions or organically, while TNT could come under pressure to change management or revise its business strategy to deflect activist shareholders. The European Commission said UPS had not offered adequate concessions to ensure the deal would not hurt consumers. UPS had flagged the negative decision on January 14, saying it would withdraw its bid because of opposition from the EU regulator. The deal, its biggest ever, would have given it access to Dutch peer TNT’s stronger networks in fast-growing Asian markets and Latin America and increased its non-U.S. revenues to 36 percent of total sales from the current 26 percent. The European Commission, the EU competition watchdog, said the proposed merger would have reduced competition in 15 EU countries. “(The deal) would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. “We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified.” UPS had offered to sell TNT’s operations in 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe, with the principal potential buyer France’s DPD LAPST.UL, but failed to convince the Commission of the merits of its proposal. TNT is the leading postal delivery company in Europe, with an 18 percent market share against the 10 percent of UPS. Deutsche Post’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL unit has 15 percent while FedEx (FDX.N) is a distant fourth player. TNT shares extended losses after the Commission’s decision and were down 2.5 percent to 5.56 euros by 5.39 a.m ET. The decision is Almunia’s third veto of a takeover deal in as many years.

183,UPS,"UPS posts loss after pension costs, outlook misses view","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc reported a fourth-quarter net loss after taking a large pension-related charge and forecast weaker-than-expected 2013 profit due to an uneven global economy. UPS (UPS.N) on Thursday followed a stream of other big U.S. companies such as Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) that were also weighed down by pension-related charges. A prolonged period of low interest rates is driving up companies’ pension costs. Even factoring out the $3 billion noncash pension charge, UPS, the world’s largest package-delivery company, reported a fourth-quarter profit that still missed Wall Street’s expectations. UPS said it faces a $225 million rise in pension costs this year. “This will be a significant drag in 2013,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told investors on a conference call. UPS expects earnings to rise 6 percent to 12 percent in 2013 to $4.80 to $5.06 per share, below the average Wall Street target of $5.11. “It’s going to come down to worldwide economic growth,” said Helane Becker, an Dahlman Rose analyst, adding that she believed the company would be in a position to raise its dividend this year. A rise in interest rates could ease the pension headwind, but Wednesday’s report of an unexpected fourth-quarter contraction in the U.S. economy could leave the U.S. Federal Reserve inclined to hold rates low. The Fed has kept interest rates for overnight loans between banks steady at near zero for four years now. That has driven down the rates companies use to calculate if they have enough money to pay pension benefits due to millions of U.S. workers when they retire. “Interest rates will not stay that way forever. Clearly we don’t think they will remain that low for the duration of our pension obligations,” Kuehn said in an interview. “That’s why we characterize this as an effect that could just as easily turn around.” UPS officials said their pension plan remained fully funded, adding that the company’s required contributions are forecast to decline over the next three years. Shares of the Atlanta-based company were down 2 percent at $79.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $1.75 billion, or $1.83 per share, after the pension charge. A year earlier, it had earnings of $725 million, or 74 cents per share. UPS said costs related to Superstorm Sandy, which pounded the New York metropolitan area in late October, sliced profit by 5 cents per share in the quarter. Factoring out one-time, noncash items, profit came to $1.32 per share, below the analysts’ average estimate of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We remain in a cycle of mixed growth and mixed signals,” Chief Executive Scott Davis told investors on a conference call. “Fiscal uncertainty continues to erode business confidence and growth prospects. This will continue until Washington starts to compromise.” The final weeks of the fourth quarter saw a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over the “fiscal cliff,” which had threatened higher taxes and large spending cuts. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said one good sign in the quarter was the 7.7 percent rise in U.S. next-day air shipments. “We need to cut through the pension clutter and look at economic results,” Schoonmaker said. “This is a company that has tremendous operating capability, so when you feed them a little bit more volume into their system, this company is able to make hay with that.” UPS’ largest U.S. rival, FedEx Corp (FDX.N) has been struggling with falling profits as customers increasingly send goods by ground, which is less costly and less profitable than by air. Because of the huge volume of packages they handle each day, UPS and FedEx are viewed as barometers of economic activity. Revenue rose 2.9 percent to $14.57 billion from $14.17 billion. Earlier this month, UPS dropped its $7 billion bid for Dutch delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS after European regulators said they would veto the deal, citing antitrust concerns. UPS, which had sought to expand quickly in Europe, will now likely have to grow on its own to avoid running afoul of the European Commission again. “It would be an understatement to say that we are disappointed by the decision of the European Commission to block the acquisition,” Davis said. “While we viewed the TNT acquisition as a compelling growth platform and it consumed a lot of internal resources, we are moving on.” UPS plans to buy back about $4 billion worth of stock this year, roughly 5 percent of its current market capitalization and more than the $1.5 billion it had previously said. The company warned its forecast for 2013 did not include any costs related to the failure of the TNT deal. At Wednesday's close, UPS shares were up about 7 percent over the past year, trailing the 14 percent rise of the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX.

190,UPS,UPDATE 3-TNT Express plans disposals after further losses,"By Sara Webb AMSTERDAM, Feb 18 (Reuters) - TNT Express, whose $7 billion takeover by United Parcel Service was blocked last month, reported a further loss on Monday, saying it would sell units in Brazil and China and cut costs as it prepares for a future alone. The Dutch package delivery firm does not expect offers from other rivals given regulators’ concerns about competition in Europe, and is not a break-up target, its interim chief executive said on Monday. “We’ve cleansed ourselves of all that speculation, all this is now behind us,” Bernard Bot told reporters on a conference call, adding the company envisioned a “standalone future.” “We are keenly aware that further urgent improvements are required,” he said, adding that the company would announce its strategy on March 25. TNT Express faces an uncertain future. It has cut capacity in Europe because of weak demand while continuing to struggle  with problems in its Brazilian and Chinese businesses. And its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer in March 2012. The takeover by UPS was intended to create a global express delivery group with a strong market position in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. The smallest of the four world leaders in the express delivery of goods and documents around the globe - after UPS, FedEx, and Deutsche Post DHL - the Dutch firm had come under pressure from shareholders to improve on its financial performance. But with the collapse of the UPS deal, TNT Express now has to confront a weak European market on its own, and has dusted off some of the moves it had proposed before UPS made its offer and which were put on hold during the year of negotations. “There are many positive actions we can take to improve profitability and we look forward to providing a full update on 25 March,” Bot said in a statement. The firm is also looking at cutting jobs and overheads, Bot said, stressing that the outlook in Europe where TNT Express has the bulk of its business, remains tough. Many of its customers are switching to cheaper delivery options, and a major customer in the UK fashion business did not renew its contract when it expired recently. The company reported a net loss for the final quarter of 2012 of 148 million euros ($198 million), down from a loss of 173 million euros a year ago on flat revenue of 1.86 billion euros. Analysts had on average forecast a net profit of 32.2 million euros on revenue of 1.886 billion euros but the company said it had lost 120 million euros in one-off charges and impairments, mainly on its domestic China and India businesses, and on the value of its freight aircraft. For the full year the company reported a net attributable loss of 83 million euros, down from a 270 million deficit in 2011. The company has now revived plans to sell some of its long-haul aircraft in order to cut capacity on international routes - a plan which was mothballed when UPS made its offer a year ago and which is likely to net less money now because the market for such aircraft has deteriorated since then, it said. However, Bot said the company also plans to sell its domestic operations in Brazil and China, with the outcome of the China deal expected soon, while a sale of the Brazilian business is expected by year-end. The shares, which initially fell 2 percent, later rebounded and traded up more than 4 percent, with analysts saying investors were encouraged by the plan to bale out of the problematic local businesses. TNT Express declined to give financial details of the two businesses but analysts have said in the past that its Chinese business is too small to compete effectively. The Brazilian business has been a burden for TNT Express for several years, making an operating loss of 73 million euros last year and a loss of 332 million euros in 2011, when the company took impairment and restructuring charges on the business of 236 million euros. “They intend to divest the domestic Chinese activities and are looking at what to do with Brazil,” said Dieter Furniere, an analyst at KBC in Brussels. “Since both of these are loss-making, a potential sale could really improve the underlying results whereas if they keep the domestic Chinese business they will have to really invest in it,” he said. TNT Express proposed a dividend of 3 euro cents and said its dividend policy, paying out about 40 percent of normalised income, was sustainable. But it said shareholders, which include Dutch mail firm PostNL with a near 30 percent stake, should not expect a special dividend after UPS paid a 200 million euro break-up fee this month. TNT Express was split off from PostNL in May 2011 in an attempt to better profit from development of the express operations while the traditional mail business declined. But TNT’s ensuing weak performance quickly prompted other shareholders to call for a management shake-up or an outright sale, pushing it into the arms of UPS last year, only to have the EU competition regulator block the marriage 12 months later.

191,UPS,EU offers banks chance to cut fines in rate-fixing probe: sources,"PARIS (Reuters) - The European Commission wants to conclude its investigation into the fixing of lending benchmarks Euribor and Libor this year and has offered several banks under suspicion the possibility of a settlement to reduce hefty fines, sources said. If the banks were to agree to such a settlement, it would allow the EU’s antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia to wrap up his investigation as soon as this year and before his term as antitrust commissioner draws to a close in late 2014. “Almunia wants decisions on the cases by the end of the year,” said one of the sources familiar with the investigation. The offer comes almost 18 months after the Commission raided a number of banks suspected of Euribor rate rigging. It later widened its investigation to other benchmarks. The move signals that there is a prospect of reduced fines from Brussels in return for ending any activities that could lead price-fixing of Euribor, the euro interbank-offered rate, and its larger counterpart the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor). Many banks are reluctant, however, to settle with the Commission because they believe the charges are unfounded, they said. If they resist and the Commission later finds them guilty of manipulation, they would face a fine equivalent to 10 percent of their annual revenue. That could rise to three times as much if individual banks are prosecuted for rigging three benchmarks. By settling, the fines would be reduced. A spokesman for Almunia declined to comment on the prospect of any settlement. Heavy penalties already loom in other regions. The United States and Britain will by mid-year levy more fines against those alleged to have been involved in interest rate rigging, sources close to the probe said. U.S. and UK regulators have fined three banks to date - RBS, Britain’s Barclays and Switzerland’s UBS - a total of $2.6 billion for allowing traders to game Libor interbank rates in a global scam. Earlier on Friday, Almunia said he had widened his investigation of suspected unfair fixing of lending benchmarks such as Euribor and Libor to interest rate products for the Swiss franc. Euribor and Libor are the key gauges of how much banks pay to borrow from each other, and are used as reference points for swathes of financial products from Spanish mortgages to derivatives contracts sealed in London. Both are set using interbank borrowing rates submitted by banks.

202,UPS,International deliveries seen boosting UPS in near term,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, said its international package business will drive results in the near term and that it expects the small-package market to grow faster than the U.S. economy in 2013. UPS shares were up 2.7 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday after the company reported a higher quarterly profit on strong post-holiday season sales and increased business from online retailers. The company, which like rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) is viewed as an economic bellwether because of the volume of goods it handles, said it expects international shipments of packages weighing up to 40 kg (88 pounds) to boost profit in the second quarter. UPS gets about 20 percent of its business from international deliveries. “The first quarter was particularly challenging for (international) ... but we feel that the business is prospering and global trade, especially within Europe and Asia, will continue to grow,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters. “So that’s probably the area that we’ll see the most improvement year over year (in the second quarter).” However, UPS said it expects shipments of heavier goods — most of which form a part of the supply chain service it offers businesses — to remain subdued through 2013. UPS is coming off a particularly difficult year, when customers cut back on air courier services. But as consumers shift from air express to cheaper but slower modes of shipping, UPS’s stronger North American domestic ground network puts it in a better position than FedEx, which focuses more on international air shipments. FedEx cut its full-year forecast last month after a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would step-up restructuring efforts and cut capacity in Asia. UPS said deliveries for online retailers played a big part in its better-than-expected quarterly profit. “Increased focus by traditional retailers on using their brick-and-mortar locations as distribution sites is creating more pickups at retail locations for ultimate residential delivery,” Kuehn said on a post-earnings conference call. The company’s daily package volume in the United States increased 4.4 percent in the first quarter, led by UPS Ground, which delivered 531,000 more packages per day. “E-commerce has a greater-than-one-shipment-per-purchase benefit because (UPS) puts a few things in the same box, (and) sometimes things are returned using UPS as well,” Morningstar Inc analyst Keith Schoonmaker said. The company also got a jump start of more than a year over its rival on a service to let customers select from a range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. FedEx only introduced the service on Tuesday. UPS’s international package revenue was flat in the quarter ended March 31, while sales in the United States rose 3.4 percent. Total revenue rose 2.2 percent to $13.43 billion. Net income rose to $1.04 billion, or $1.08 per share, from $970 million, or $1 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, UPS earned $1.04 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.01 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $13.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast of $4.80-$5.06 per share. UPS also said on Thursday it would buy Hungarian pharmaceutical logistics company, CEMELOG Zrt, to strengthen its healthcare reach in Europe.

205,UPS,TNT Express to see impact of cost cuts in second half,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch delivery group TNT Express TNTE.AS, the target of a failed $7 billion takeover by United Parcel Service (UPS.N), said the impact of cost-cutting measures would show up in the second half. The collapse of the UPS bid forced TNT Express to come up with job cuts, divestments and other measures last month to turn around its performance as a standalone delivery firm. It said it would cut 4,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of the workforce, over the next three years and create cost savings of 220 million euros a year by 2015 by improving efficiency. It is also looking for a buyer for its troubled Brazilian unit, where it said it expects to reduce losses further, after agreeing to sell its Chinese domestic business last month. Bernard Bot, interim chief executive, said trading conditions this year would continue to be difficult, especially in Europe, and that the restructuring measures would start to deliver results in the second half. First-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations fell 16 percent to 38 million euros ($49.5 million), while revenue fell 4.5 percent to 1.67 billion euros.

206,UPS,UPDATE 1-TNT Express to see impact of cost cuts in second half,"AMSTERDAM, April 29 (Reuters) - Dutch delivery group TNT Express, the target of a failed $7 billion takeover by United Parcel Service, said the impact of cost-cutting measures would show up in the second half. The collapse of the UPS bid forced TNT Express to come up with job cuts, divestments and other measures last month to turn around its performance as a standalone delivery firm. It said it would cut 4,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of the workforce, over the next three years and create cost savings of 220 million euros a year by 2015 by improving efficiency. It is also looking for a buyer for its troubled Brazilian unit, where it said it expects to reduce losses further, after agreeing to sell its Chinese domestic business last month. Bernard Bot, interim chief executive, said trading conditions this year would continue to be difficult, especially in Europe, and that the restructuring measures would start to deliver results in the second half. First-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations fell 16 percent to 38 million euros ($49.5 million), while revenue fell 4.5 percent to 1.67 billion euros.

208,UPS,Wall St. rises on banks' results; S&P;'s best week since January,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks advanced on Friday, supported by banks’ strong earnings, but Boeing limited the Dow’s gain after an airplane fire in London. Both the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI and the S&P; 500 index .SPX ended Friday's session at record closing highs, even though the point and percentage gains for the day were slim. The Nasdaq closed at a 52-week high. The S&P; 500 scored its best weekly performance since January and a third consecutive week of gains. Financial stocks were the day’s biggest gainers, with the S&P; 500 financial sector index .SPSY up 0.8 percent. “The momentum has been incredibly strong ... At some point, a breather or some sort of consolidation makes sense,” said Joe Bell, senior equity strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. Over the past three weeks, the benchmark S&P; 500 has erased the losses of nearly 6 percent from the selloff triggered by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in late May, when he first raised the prospect of trimming the central bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. Since then, the market has been getting reassurance from Bernanke and other Fed officials that the U.S. central bank will keep monetary policy loose for some time. “For now, it seems like some of the comments made this past week have settled the market back into place,” Bell said. “Hopefully we’ll be back to paying more attention to the earnings reports,” which will probably take the spotlight in the next few weeks, he added. Shares of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, jumped 1.8 percent to $42.63 after the company posted quarterly results that topped expectations. [ID:nL4N0FI2UA] [ID:nL4N0FI31A] Citigroup (C.N) rose 1.5 percent to $50.81. Bank of America (BAC.N) climbed 2 percent to $13.78 and ranked among the most actively traded stocks in both the Dow and the S&P; 500. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank by assets, reported a 31 percent jump in quarterly profits. The stock, however, slipped 0.3 percent to close at $54.97, giving up an earlier gain of more than 1 percent. The stock had traded higher for most of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI edged up 3.38 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 15,464.30, a record closing high. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 5.17 points, or 0.31 percent, to finish at 1,680.19, also a closing high. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 21.78 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 3,600.08, a 52-week high. For the week, the Dow rose 2.2 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 3 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 3.5 percent. In Friday’s session, Boeing (BA.N) was the Dow’s biggest decliner. Boeing (BA.N) shares fell 4.7 percent to $101.87 after a Dreamliner operated by Ethiopian Airlines caught fire at Britain’s Heathrow airport on Friday. Shares of Dreamliner component manufacturers also slipped, including Honeywell International (HON.N), off 0.2 percent at $82.37, and Spirit Aerosystems (SPR.N), down 2.3 percent at $22.61. United Parcel Service (UPS.N) was among the biggest losers in the S&P; 500, sliding 5.8 percent to $86.12, after the world’s No.1 package delivery company said second-quarter profit would fall short of expectations. Shares of rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) fell 2 percent to $102.29. UPS weighed on the S&P; industrial sector index .SPLRCI, which fell 0.6 percent. Analysts expect S&P; 500 companies’ second-quarter earnings to have grown 2.8 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up 1.5 percent, data from Thomson Reuters showed. U.S.-listed shares of Infosys (INFY.N) jumped 4.8 percent to $46.17 after the company reported quarterly results and maintained its revenue growth forecast. On the economic front, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading for July on the consumer sentiment index was 83.9, down from 84.1 in June and shy of forecasts for 85. About 5.4 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the 6.4 billion daily average so far this year. On the NYSE, advancers narrowly beat decliners with 1,488 stocks rising and 1,478 shares falling. On the Nasdaq, nearly 14 stocks rose for every 11 that fell.

209,UPS,"UPS warns on profits, cites weak economy","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, on Friday forecast second-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations, signaling that the global economic recovery still has a ways to go. UPS, an economic bellwether along with rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) because of the high volume of goods they move around the world, blamed a weak U.S. industrial economy, customers’ trading down to slower but cheaper shipping services, and overcapacity in the global air freight market. The earnings warning sent UPS shares down more than 5 percent in midday trading, while FedEx fell 2.4 percent. Globally, manufacturers are dealing with a number of headwinds, including a weak economic recovery in the United States, slowing growth in China and recession in Europe. The Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey of global purchasing managers, a gauge of economic activity, has been essentially flat for seven months, suggesting companies are not aggressively restocking their inventories. Last month, Terex Corp (TEX.N), a top maker of construction and mining equipment, slashed its full-year earnings forecast, citing deceleration in the economic recovery in North America and continued weakness in Europe. “A lot of companies are being smarter about managing their supply chain and deferring their shipping wherever they can to save money,” said analyst Joshua Herrity of New York-based Telsey Advisory Group. Analyst Helane Becker of Cowen & Co said many UPS customers have been focused on cost-cutting. “We do not expect to see a significant uptick in next-day priority services until we see a global recovery, and not just a U.S. recovery,” she said. Still, UPS’s large ground shipment network in North America puts it in a better position than FedEx, which focuses more on international air shipments. FedEx said in June it was raising shipping rates and cutting jobs and costs as excess capacity in the air freight market had more than offset increased shipments. UPS said on Friday it expected second-quarter earnings of $1.13 per share. Analysts on average expected $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UPS cut its full-year earnings forecast to $4.65-$4.85 per share from $4.80-$5.06. The company said package volume growth had also been hurt by labor issues. Last month it said its Teamsters union workers had approved a five-year contract covering about 235,000 employees, but contracts for freight workers and 17 local supplemental contracts had not been settled. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said the risk of a strike had passed and that the company still had advantages over its rivals. “Slightly lower growth this year does not move the needle significantly on our fair-value estimate,” he said.

214,UPS,UPS profit falls as global customers use cheaper shipping,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on Tuesday posted a smaller quarterly profit as customers, especially on international routes, chose slower, cheaper shipping services. Earlier in the month, UPS said it expected to report a quarterly profit below analysts’ expectations due to a weak U.S. industrial economy, customers switching to less expensive shipping options and overcapacity in the global air freight market. UPS is considered an economic bellwether, along with rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), because of the high volume and variety of goods they move around the world. For the second quarter, UPS, the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, said export shipments rose 5 percent, but because customers used more normal delivery services instead of express options, export revenue fell 3.4 percent. In the domestic market, daily package volume improved 1.9 percent from the same period last year as more customers shopped online. Total U.S. domestic revenue per piece was up 0.3 percent. Globally, manufacturers are dealing with a number of headwinds, including a weak U.S. economic recovery, slowing growth in China and recession in Europe. Manufacturers and retailers have also become more savvy with their supply chains, planning shipments strategically to cut back on express shipping. This reduces costs for manufacturers, but hurts courier companies like UPS, which make more money on faster shipping. For the quarter, UPS earned $1.07 billion, or $1.13 a share, in the second quarter, compared with $1.12 billion, or $1.15 a share a year before. Total revenue increased 1.2 percent to $13.51 billion.

UPS, which delivered more than one billion packages worldwide during the quarter, also reconfirmed its profit view for the year. Shipment volume and forecasts at UPS, along with rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), are closely watched by Wall Street and considered an indication of overall economic health because of the vast amount of goods they transport.

Earlier in the week, rival FedEx forecast an 11 percent rise for the same day, the Monday after Thanksgiving that is traditionally a big day for online holiday sales. For the third quarter, UPS said daily ground shipping volumes rose 3 percent, while next-day shipping fell 3.3 percent. Clients have been trading down from pricey next-day air deliveries to more affordable shipping ways that take more time, to save money. Also, manufacturers and retailers have become more savvy with their supply chains, planning shipments strategically to cut back on express shipping. This reduces costs for manufacturers, but hurts courier companies like UPS, which make more money on faster shipping. UPS said some shippers have moved their distribution facilities closer to their customers, which slowed air shipment growth but led to a greater use of UPS Ground facilities. For the third quarter, the Atlanta-based company earned $1.10 billion, or $1.16 a share, compared with $469 million or 48 cents a share a year earlier.

218,UPS,REFILE-UPDATE 5-FedEx 2nd-qtr profit misses estimate; offers holiday optimism,"By Nivedita Bhattacharjee Dec 18 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp posted a 14 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday on stronger margins and cost cuts, but results missed Wall Street estimates, which overshadowed the company’s confident forecast for the holiday shopping season. Wall Street analysts expressed disappointment at the slight dip in revenue at the express delivery business, FedEx’s biggest unit. They also noted softening volume growth for ground deliveries. Average daily volume at FedEx Ground rose 8 percent in the fiscal second quarter, slowing from the 11 and 10 percent growth in the previous two quarters, and below the 10 percent expected by Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. A 3 percent rise in overall revenue to $11.4 billion and success in ongoing cost cutting efforts helped offset some of the volume weakness. FedEx earned $500 million, or $1.57 a share, in the second quarter ended Nov. 30, versus $438 million, or $1.39, in the same quarter last year. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.64 as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the global shipping company slid as much as 3 percent in premarket action. By mid-morning, the stock dipped 0.1 percent at $138.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. FedEx predicted a strong holiday season and forecast full-year earnings per share growth between 8 percent and 14 percent above last year. Previously, its outlook was for growth between 7 percent and 13 percent. While part of that boot to earnings per share will be attributed to the company’s repurchase of 10 million shares year to date, FedEx has also said it expects shipping volumes to pick up during the holiday season. In October, the company forecast more than 85 million shipments during Cyber Monday week, up 13 percent from last year. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said seasonal increases in volume, revenue, and operating income related to cyber Monday week will come in the third quarter this year, not the second quarter as it was last year. “More than a quarter of the volume that we see in peak comes in Cyber Week. And if you think about it, that volume and revenue and profit was all shifted to the third quarter,” added FedEx Ground chief executive Henry Maier. Cyber Monday comes right after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday as employees return to work and many make purchases on their office computers. The holiday shopping season is the biggest selling period for retailers. Retailers use services like FedEx and United Parcel Service Inc when customers buy online. Last year, FedEx outlined a multi-year plan to reign in costs, which the company said would boost profits by $1.7 billion. The company, seen as a bellwether because its results reflect economic activity, has been revamping routes and trimming capacity to Asia and other international markets to cut costs and stem a decline in its express division. The unit has suffered as clients choose slower, cheaper delivery options. For the second quarter, revenue at its express delivery segment dipped to $6.84 billion from $6.86 billion last year. CFO Graf said fuel costs decreased 8 percent in the quarter, due to a six percent lower jet fuel prices and fewer flight hours. Dave Bronczek,  chief executive of the company’s express division said FedEx has been using high reliability, low fuel planes like the 777s in its international network, and replacing older planes as a part of being cost effective. running cost effectiveness.",12182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fedex-earns/refile-update-5-fedex-2nd-qtr-profit-misses-estimate-offers-holiday-optimism-idUSL3N0JX2T520131218
219,UPS,UPS profit hit by cost of surge in Christmas online orders,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Friday its fourth-quarter earnings will fall well short of market estimates due to a surge in online shopping just before Christmas that caught the company off guard and led to late deliveries and higher costs. Typically, a rise in online sales is good news for companies such as UPS and competitor FedEx Corp (FDX.N) because it translates into brisker demand. But UPS said it had been overwhelmed by the volume of holiday packages, delaying the arrival of Christmas presents around the globe and spurring angry customers to take to social websites to complain. UPS said it delivered more than 31 million packages on December 23, the most in its history. Moreover, that highest-volume delivery day came six days later than the company had expected and volume was 7.5 percent higher than it had planned for. That, coupled with ice storms and heavy snow that snarled roads and airports [ID:nL6N0K1049], added to shipping bottlenecks. UPS did not say how many packages were delayed, but said it had to hire 30,000 extra workers to try to get all the parcels delivered on time. That was more than 50 percent more temporary staff than it had planned to hire. Extra equipment was also used to try to get gifts delivered on time. The world’s No. 1 package delivery company’s shares fell as much as 3.5 percent early on Friday before retracing some of that loss later in the day. While U.S. retailers and shipping companies were aware the 2013 holiday-shopping season would be shorter - there were six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas - many were overwhelmed by the change in customer buying patterns. Yvonne Roeske, for instance, owner of a home furnishing store in Park Ridge, Illinois, who uses UPS ground shipping, said she did not see a 25 percent rise in online volume coming. She said that due to their experience with Amazon.com (AMZN.O), shoppers are getting more comfortable waiting until the last minute before making online purchases and still getting delivery in one or two days. This past season, shoppers got direct mail from Amazon guaranteeing Christmas Day delivery on orders placed as late as December 22. But while bigger shippers like Amazon are able to fulfill last-minute demands, many others cannot. UPS estimated fourth-quarter diluted earnings of $1.25 per share, well short of the $1.43 per share expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company estimated full-year earnings of $4.57 per share, below its previous forecast of $4.65-$4.85. The average market expectation had been for a profit of $4.75 a share. “If there’s ever a ‘good’ miss, this is one,” said Benjamin Hartford, a logistics analyst at Baird Equity Research. Like Hartford, most analysts on Wall Street said that though UPS’s fourth quarter will be affected, the jump in traffic bodes well for the company’s future, especially since UPS said it was confident in its 2014 outlook. UPS said it expects full-year diluted earnings to rise by 10-15 percent this year, implying a profit of $5.02-$5.26 per share. Analysts had expected $5.48. “This glitch causes short-term costs like overtime and extra employees, but shows really strong online fulfillment demand. It bodes really well for UPS in the long term,” said Keith Schoonmaker, analyst at Morningstar. UPS’s shipment volumes and forecasts, along with those of rival FedEx, are closely watched by Wall Street and considered an indication of overall economic health because of the vast amount of goods they transport. Shares in UPS, due to report results on January 30, fell to as low as $97 on the New York Stock Exchange before rebounding to $98.90 in the afternoon.

222,UPS,UPS sees no rerun of glitch-marred December: CFO,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc has vowed to avoid a repeat of last year’s Christmas holiday season when unexpectedly high volume and huge delays frustrated customers who wanted their packages delivered on time. The No. 1 U.S. courier company is investing in new technology and expanded capacity so that the 2014 holiday season should go smoothly, Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said on Thursday. “We’ll be absolutely prepared to have a great peak season this December,” he said in an interview. “We will be very prepared this coming December. I’m not worried about that.” Last month, the company known for its brown trucks was overwhelmed by the volume of holiday packages, delaying the arrival of gifts around the world and prompting customers to vent their frustrations on social websites. Kuehn said an increase in last-minute shipping by retailers was also partly responsible for the glitches, and also made it difficult for the company to forecast volumes. Retailers such as Amazon.com Inc guaranteed deliveries by Christmas Day on orders placed as late as December 22. The unexpected rise in online shopping, combined with bad weather and a shorter holiday shopping season than in 2012, added to the bottlenecks. There were six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2013 than in the previous year. “In years past retailers had a Web presence but it wasn’t this critical a part of their market strategy,” Kuehn said. “There was a big focus this year, with incentives that drove increased and late demand.” UPS warned on January 17 of fourth-quarter earnings well below market expectations due to the surge in online shopping that caught the company off-guard and increased its costs. It said on Thursday that it expects full-year 2014 earnings to increase by 11 to 16 percent over last year. UPS shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $95.78 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Kuehn said the rise in last-minute shipping also made it more difficult for UPS to forecast volumes near Christmas. UPS said global daily deliveries during the 2013 holiday period topped expectations by surpassing 29 million packages on five days, with peak volume exceeding 31 million on December 23. “We did have a good strong cyber week,” he said, referring to the week after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. “Typically the week after that tapers off but this year (2013) the numbers just kept going up till a point where we saw eight days during December U.S. delivery volume exceeded our previous company high which was set in 2012.” Cyber Monday, or the Monday after Thanksgiving, is traditionally the busiest day for online shopping as workers go back to offices but continue their holiday shopping on personal computers and other devices. Once it became evident that demand was not going to slow down after Cyber Monday, UPS had to hire 30,000 more seasonal workers than expected, but package volumes had already built up by then, Kuehn said. UPS has increased investments in capacity expansion by $500 million, a large part of which is a direct reaction to the recent holiday season’s glitches, Kuehn said. Total capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to reach $2.5 billion. The company is also going to focus on improving communications with key customers as part of the new strategy, while adding technology that makes it easier to estimate volumes. Kuehn said UPS will implement systems that can track packages on the way from retailers — whereas at present it sometimes has no status updates on packages until they arrive at the UPS sorting lot. “In some cases the customers hadn’t given us details of how many packages were in certain loads. That was a frustration,” he said. ",1302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-glitches/ups-sees-no-rerun-of-glitch-marred-december-cfo-idUSBREA0T1VU20140130

227,UPS,Ex-UPS exec's son faces fraud charges in scheme over Maxim magazine,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged the son of a former United Parcel Service Inc executive with impersonating his father to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars that was intended to finance the purchase of Maxim magazine last year. Calvin Darden Jr., 39, faces two counts of wire fraud for his role in an elaborate scheme involving fake emails and bank statements to obtain more than $8 million and attempt to secure another $20 million, the prosecutors said. Darden was arrested Wednesday after what a prosecutor described as a manhunt. He is the son of Calvin Darden Sr., a former vice president of U.S. operations at UPS. A lawyer for Darden, Xavier Donaldson, declined to comment. His father did not respond to requests for comment. In September, Alpha Media Group Inc, which is partially owned by Cerberus Capital Management, announced an agreement to sell Maxim to Darden Media Group, a company headed by Calvin Darden Sr. It was unclear from court documents whether Darden Jr. was involved in that deal, which did not go through. According to a criminal complaint, the younger Darden last year provided a fake bank account statement to an unidentified lender that showed stock holdings by his father in at least three companies for which the senior Darden served as a director. Darden’s father serves on the board of directors of Target Corp, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc and Cardinal Health Inc. After the lender put $5.5 million in escrow, Darden sent a fake email to the law firm holding the money authorizing the release of the funds, according to the complaint. As a result, the law firm, which was also unidentified, released $4.9 million of the funds, which was to be used toward the purchase of the men’s magazine company, the complaint said. A second lender provided $3 million on the belief its loan was secured by the same stock after also receiving a bogus account statement, according to charging documents. Darden attempted to get $20 million from a third lender, which by December 2013 had agreed to be involved in the possible transaction as long as a cable channel was created based on Maxim’s content, the complaint said. Darden, from the New York City borough of Staten Island, also tricked a Taiwanese company into paying him $500,000 after falsely claiming he would arrange an exhibition match by the New York Knicks basketball team, authorities said. “Everyone deserves the right to make an honest living, but not by lying, cheating, or at the expense of others,” FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said in a statement. James Pastore, an assistant U.S. attorney, called the case “an audacious fraud. A search of Darden’s home uncovered documents that appeared related to “other similar frauds,” he added. “We have the possibility of more victims,” Pastore said. U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck set bail at $1 million and ordered home detention. Prosecutors had argued that Darden should be held in jail as a flight risk and danger to the community. Pastore said that Darden led the FBI on a manhunt on Wednesday, a day after authorities contacted his wife. Darden wasn’t at home when the FBI went to arrest him shortly after 6 a.m., then lied by claiming he was in Long Island when he was in a New Jersey hotel, Pastore said. Agents who arrived at the hotel found Darden’s car abandoned, Pastore said. Darden later surrendered. Darden faces a maximum of 40 years in prison if convicted. This is not the first time Darden has faced criminal charges. In 2005, the former stock broker pleaded guilty to New York state charges that he stole almost $6 million from 11 people. Darden was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison. He was released in September 2008 and returned to jail in August 2010 for less than two months due to a parole violation, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Corrections said.

James Pastore, an assistant U.S. attorney, called the case “an audacious fraud. A search of Darden’s home uncovered documents that appeared related to “other similar frauds,” he added. “We have the possibility of more victims,” Pastore said. U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck set bail at $1 million and ordered home detention. Prosecutors had argued that Darden should be held in jail as a flight risk and danger to the community. Pastore said that Darden led federal agents on a manhunt on Wednesday, a day after authorities contacted his wife. Darden wasn’t at home when federal agents went to arrest him shortly after 6 a.m., then lied by claiming he was in Long Island when he was in a New Jersey hotel, Pastore said. Agents who arrived at the hotel found Darden’s car abandoned, Pastore said. Darden later surrendered to the Secret Service. Darden faces a maximum of 40 years in prison if convicted. This is not the first time Darden has faced criminal charges. In 2005, the former stock broker pleaded guilty to New York state charges that he stole almost $6 million from 11 people. Darden was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison. He was released in September 2008 and returned to jail in August 2010 for less than two months due to a parole violation, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Corrections said. (This version of the story was corrected to say in paragraph 18 that Darden surrendered to the Secret Service, not the FBI.)

231,UPS,"UPDATE 2-UPS to buy 1,000 propane-fueled delivery trucks for U.S. fleet","* Biggest purchase yet of propane vehicles * U.S. propane output at all-time high * Concerns have arisen about propane supply network March 5 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc is spending $70 million to add 1,000 propane trucks to its delivery fleet, the biggest bulk purchase of propane-fired vehicles yet as output of the fuel in the United States hits record highs. The fleet, which UPS is buying from Daimler AG’s  Freightliner Custom Chassis Corp, will replace gasoline and diesel vehicles in Louisiana and Oklahoma, UPS said in a statement on Wednesday. The investment will include 50 new fueling stations. The transition is expected to begin in the middle of this year and be completed early next year, UPS said. It also plans to introduce propane-fueled vehicles in other U.S. states. The fleet, which adds to 900 propane trucks the courier company already runs in Canada, is expected to displace about 3.5 million gallons of gasoline and diesel per year, UPS said. UPS, known for its brown delivery trucks, already has a fleet of about 3,150 alternative-fuel vehicles running on compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, biomethane and electricity. Propane is “a clean-burning fuel that lowers operating costs and is readily accessible, especially on rural routes in the United States,” said UPS Chief Operating Officer David Abney. Output of propane, which is produced alongside oil and gas and is traditionally used for heating, it at all-time highs in the United States thanks to a drilling boom. Propane is on average between $1.25 and $1.50 per gallon cheaper than gasoline at the pump, a UPS spokeswoman said. The cheap abundance has made propane a viable alternative to gasoline in recent years, rivaling natural gas and other niche fuels. There are currently about 200,000 propane-powered vehicles on U.S. roads. Last year, Home Satellite TV provider DISH Network Corp signed a deal to run 200 of its trucks on propane. Despite higher output, however, the delivery network came under severe strain as cold weather drove heating demand higher this winter. Propane suppliers struggled to deliver enough fuel to millions of homes and businesses leading to supply rationing which caused prices to spike higher. A lack of pipelines led to an over reliance on trucks and trains to ship the fuel amid some of the coldest weather in decades “We have identified some improvements that can be made in our infrastructure,” said Roy Willis, president of the nonprofit Propane Education and Research Council, which expects 244,000 propane vehicles in the United States by 2020. “But this (UPS deal) is a good sign of confidence that the challenges we experienced this winter were a short-term, weather-driven phenomenon.” ",3052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/ups-fleet-propane/update-2-ups-to-buy-1000-propane-fueled-delivery-trucks-for-u-s-fleet-idUSL3N0M240720140305

Chief Operating Officer David Abney, 58, named on Friday to succeed Chief Executive Scott Davis on Sept. 1, also said the company would make acquisitions to build its capabilities overseas, and didn’t rule out large deals. Expansion in emerging markets is “our number one priority,” Abney said in a telephone interview. Trade among emerging markets is growing rapidly and UPS expects that eventually 95 percent of consumers will be outside the United States. “We’re going to continue to focus on making those (emerging market) investments,” Abney said. “Growing internationally and diversifying our customer base are extremely important to us.” Davis and Abney said Davis’s retirement and succession planning had been in the works for several years, signaling no abrupt strategy changes for the Atlanta-based company, which reported $55.4 billion in revenue last year. Even as it builds international capacity, especially in Asia and Latin America, the company’s international package revenue has remained steady at just over $12 billion since 2011. Capital expenditures were about $2 billion last year. Rising demand for drugs and medical devices will create a large revenue opportunity for UPS, the executives said, as aging populations and rising income fuel demand for home delivery of healthcare products. Pharmacists at UPS’s hub in Louisville, Kentucky, for example, fill orders for pharmaceutical companies, medical device makers and wholesalers. “We’re in the early innings on healthcare,” said Davis.

247,UPS,COLUMN-U.S. transportation stocks for the long haul,"(The opinions expressed are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By John Wasik CHICAGO, July 7 (Reuters) - As North Americans hit the highways, airports and rails for vacations this summer, it’s not hard to believe that some of the most robust stocks are in the transportation industry - particularly in an improving economy. Transportation stocks have proven to be long-haul winners and essential cogs in any growth portfolio. Transportation company performance is generally a bellwether of an economy’s health. When consumer and industrial demand is rising, the greater the need to ship raw materials and finished products from various points of the globe. On the retail side, a combination of higher demand and the conflict in Iraq ratcheted up U.S. gasoline prices to the highest level in six years this past Fourth of July weekend, according to the American Automobile Association. Despite the higher prices, some 35 million Americans hit the road during the holiday weekend for trips of 50 miles or more. In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, transportation as a sector has been a solid performer. The S&P; Transportation Select Industry Index has averaged an annualized return of nearly 29 percent over the past half-decade through July 4, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices. That trounces the performance of the S&P; 500 Index, which posted a 19 percent return over that period, by nearly 10 percentage points. For the 12-month period that ended July 4, the transportation index has been even stronger - up nearly 44 percent, compared with about 25 percent for the broad S&P; 500 Index. The best way to capture returns from this vibrant sector is through a passive index fund like the iShares Transportation Average ETF, which holds transportation leaders including Union Pacific Corp, FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc. The ETF has its largest holdings in air freight, logistics and trucking. The iShares fund is up 36 percent for the past 12 months through July 4, compared with 24 percent for the S&P; Industrials index. The fund has averaged growth of nearly 23 percent a year for the past half-decade and charges 0.46 percent in annual expenses. A smaller though less-expensive and better-performing index fund in this sector is the SPDR S&P; Transportation ETF, which charges 0.35 percent annually. It is up nearly 43 percent for the 12 months through July 4. It holds a broader group of transportation companies including Avis Budget Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc and Con-way Inc. This ETF has a higher stake in airlines and trucking than the iShares fund. LONG-TERM SUPPORT To understand the sector, you need to consider its separate moving parts: logistics, shipping, trucking and rail. Airlines are a big part of the retail side of the industry. And there are companies including FedEx and UPS that straddle nearly every mode of transportation. All of these companies have one thing in common - when the economy is growing, their business improves. “The valuations of many logistics companies are likely to expand on improved investor sentiment should signs emerge that the U.S. and global economies are improving,” said Jim Corridore, head of industrial equity research for S&P; Capital IQ, in a recent commentary. Although the U.S. GDP shrank by 3 percent in the first quarter due to the awful winter in two-thirds of North America, growth is expected to pick up through the rest of this year. Most pundits predict the overall economy will expand about 2 percent this year. After a strong employment report last week, analysts are even dallying with the idea of a 4 percent rise in U.S. economic growth. The market has responded heartily to this optimism, with the Dow Jones Industrials Index closing above 17,000 last Thursday. The general mood of the market will depend upon earnings growth, which many analysts predict could reach into double digits in the second half of this year. Yet don't assume that transportation is going to be a smooth ride indefinitely. The sector is particularly sensitive to oil and fuel prices. With the ongoing turmoil in Iraq - and resulting spike in oil prices - it will be a good idea to keep a close eye on this sector.

248,UPS,"UPS cuts forecast, to spend more on holiday shipping","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s biggest courier company, slashed its earnings forecast for the year as it spends to boost capacity ahead of the busy holiday shopping season. UPS’s shares fell as much as 3.7 percent, their biggest intraday percentage decline in a year, after the company also reported a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter profit. The company faced criticism last Christmas when a surge in online shopping and a harsh winter caught the company off guard, leading to huge delays that frustrated customers. UPS said on Tuesday it would invest $175 million to beef up capacity and technology to ensure timely deliveries during the peak shopping season beginning around Thanksgiving. The company had earlier estimated that it would spend $100 million to improve its stretched delivery network. “... It clearly is the most pressing issue in the near-term,” Cowen & Co analysts Helane Becker said. However, the increased spending, which includes opening 50 new sorting hubs in existing locations, could weigh on earnings at a time of high fuel costs. “The lowered outlook and elevated business investments will raise questions as when the payoff from such investments will be realized by investors,” Baird Equity Research analyst Benjamin  Hartford said. UPS, like closest rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), has been increasing prices and cutting costs. The company said it expects capital expenditure to increase by 4-4.5 percent over the next two years. UPS said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $4.90-$5.00 per share. The company said in April it expected earnings to come in at the lower end of its previous forecast of $5.05-$5.30 per share. Analysts on average expect 2014 earnings of $5.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UPS’s net income fell to $454 million, or 49 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.07 billion, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier.  Net income included a charge of $665 million for post-retirement liabilities for some union employees. Excluding the charge, UPS earned $1.21 per share, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $1.25 per share. Total operating expenses rose 15 percent to $13.5 billion as the company bought additional capacity at a premium from local service partners in Europe to handle growth in shipments. Global package shipments rose 7.2 percent in the quarter, driven by online shopping in the United States and strong international shipments. Total revenue rose 6 percent to $14.27 billion. Analysts on average had expected $14.11 billion. UPS’s shares were down 3.5 percent at $99.07 in late morning trading.

251,UPS,"UPS, Fedex get approval for express services in more Chinese cities","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - After years of waiting, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) have received licenses in China to extend domestic express package services to Beijing and other cities without needing joint-venture partners. The U.S. companies had been waiting for permission to independently courier packages from businesses to consumers (B2C) via their entire Chinese networks, since a 2009 postal law largely restricted foreign firms to delivering packages from abroad. The licenses increase access to a market second in size only to the United States. Thanks to online shopping, the Chinese market is growing 60 percent annually and next year could be worth 280 billion yuan ($46 billion), said consultancy Deloitte. “We now have 33 licenses,” UPS President of Global Public Affairs Laura Lane told Reuters. “The government just approved them in May,” Lane said, referring to UPS’s latest 14 licenses for cities including Beijing, Wuhan and Hefei. “We’re really looking at developing those capabilities in those 33 cities, expanding our investment,” Lane said. “But we haven’t developed a concrete plan yet in terms of where we want to go beyond those 33 cities.” FedEx received 21 licenses in May, returning its total to the 58 it held before the 2009 law, a spokesman told Reuters. Each license permits the holder to operate B2C domestic express package services within a single city and between cities for which a license is also held. “We have been working closely with the relevant authorities to obtain the express delivery services permits for our business,” the spokesman said. “So far we have received all the permits for our domestic business.” Neither company has disclosed the size of their businesses in China, where since 2009 they have mainly handled documents and packages to and from overseas. But both companies have cited China as one of their fastest-growing markets. UPS and FedEx had to reapply for licenses to offer domestic B2C services after the law changed. In 2012, the pair were granted their first five and eight respectively. FedEx was able to continue offering services by entering joint ventures with local peers. But even at full strength, UPS and FedEx still face daunting competition in state-backed China Post and large, privately run rivals such as Shentong Express and S.F. Express.  Seeming willingness among private services to cut margins to win customers also constitutes a challenge. Deutsche Post AG’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL courier service pulled out of its money-losing China domestic delivery business in 2011 citing a lack of cost advantage.

There was no evidence of fraud arising from the incident, the company said. UPS Store said customers who used a credit or debit card at the stores between Jan. 20 and Aug. 11 may have been exposed to a malware identified in the company’s systems at the locations. The company said the customer information that may have been exposed includes names, postal addresses, email addresses and payment card information. The UPS Store network is a franchise system of retail shipping, postal, print and business service centers in the Unites States. UPS Store has about 4,470 franchised center locations in the United States. UPS Store said the period of exposure to the malware began after March 26 at most of the locations. The malware was eliminated as of Aug. 11 and customers can shop securely at the company’s locations, UPS Store said. The malware intrusion was notified by the U.S. government, the company said, adding it was among many other retailers alerted by the government. The malware was not present on the computing systems of any other UPS business entities, UPS Store said. UPS shares were unchanged in extended trading.

258,UPS,FedEx warehouse workers in Canada join union in N. America first,"VANCOUVER, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Workers at a FedEx Corp  warehouse in western Canada have successfully unionized, the first employees besides pilots at the package delivery company to organize in North America, a local Teamsters union said on Wednesday. The majority of dock associates at FedEx Freight Canada in Surrey, British Columbia, signed cards with the Teamsters stating they wish to be represented by the union. The Teamsters already represent Canadian workers at rival shippers United Parcel Service Inc and Purolator, a Canadian courier majority owned by Canadian Post Corp. The Teamsters were certified by the Canada Industrial Relations Board on Monday, the union said. A spokesman for FedEx Canada was not immediately available for comment. The 14 laborers, who load and unload trucks, are the first FedEx ground workers to unionize in North America, joining the parcel shipper’s U.S.-based pilots, who are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. The union touted the victory as an organizing inroad into the Memphis-based company. FedEx on Wednesday forecast a record holiday season due to the continued rise of online consumer sales and said it would add more than 50,000 seasonal workers to handle the anticipated spike in shipping. “FedEx is the largest non-union company in North America,” said Stan Hennessy, president of Teamsters Local 31. “With this small success up here in B.C, this will encourage more warehousemen and truck drivers throughout Canada and the U.S. to certify with the union.” Hennessy said the FedEx workers unionized because of issues with work hours, wages and benefits, which the group will look to address in a first contract. Negotiations could get underway within the next 30 days. The Teamsters local represents roughly 7,000 private and public sector employees in British Columbia and the Yukon territory.

261,UPS,REFILE-Israel turns self-defence into industry boom for cyber techs,"(Refiled to correct fault in text formatting) * Cyber security start-ups raised $140.9 mln in 2013 * Israel accounts for 13 pct of new global R&D; in cyber security * Seven Israeli cyber-security firms acquired in 2014 By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Israel’s dedication to developing its defence capabilities has been extended to cyberspace in recent years, spawning an industry which has attracted a near four-fold increase in venture capital investment since 2010 as a growing overseas market for cyber security experts beckons. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accused Iran last week of being behind most of the online attacks on Israel, allocated 2 billion shekels ($549 million) in 2012 to set up a cyber security agency within his office. The country has since created a cyber threat research cluster in the desert city of Beersheba, where academia, the military and private firms come together with international companies to work. Beersheba has become a hub for security research as Israel’s military moves its headquarters to the southern city. Meanwhile, Israeli firms have attracted growing foreign investment over the past two years to develop cutting-edge tools for detecting and preventing cyberattacks, challenging U.S. and European giants who have long specialised in selling defensive tools which fall short in an age of military-grade attacks. Some Israeli start-up firms have already been acquired by top security companies and this year the pace of initial public share offerings has begun to pick up, the latest being Cyber-Ark Software, which is set to debut on Nasdaq on Wednesday. “The big drama within this space is the shifting of budgets,” Gadi Tirosh, a partner with Cyber-Ark investor Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), said of the move away from perimeter defences such as firewalls to focus on detecting and preventing attacks before they can reach inside organisations. BATTLE-HARDENED START-UPS IBM, Cisco Systems and EMC have all snapped up local firms and set up research and development centres here, with Cisco’s $5 billion purchase in 2012 of NDS, whose software enables TV companies to deliver encrypted content, the largest ever acquisition of an Israeli company. And since 2010 there has also been a large increase in the number of Israeli cyber security start-ups that have raised capital privately. Many of these firms focus on emerging threats to mobile phone users and the need to secure the dizzying array of interconnected devices, appliance, vehicles and sensor-laden equipment that have become known as the Internet of Things. “It’s a market that’s here to stay,” the government’s chief scientist, Avi Hasson, told Reuters. “It’s touching ever more aspects of our lives,” he said. In 2013 35 companies raised $140.9 million, compared with 18 firms that raised $35.8 million in 2010, according to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, and in total cyber security firms have raised $388 million in the last four years. While for most of this period the majority of capital was invested by Israeli funds, in 2013 the trend shifted, with foreign and other investors accounting for 58 percent of private investment, according to IVC. A handful of start-ups have managed to go public so far, following in the footsteps of 21-year-old Check Point Software Technologies, now Israel’s biggest tech firm with a market value of $13.5 billion. Check Point’s shares have risen 70 percent in less than two years, hitting a 13-year high of $72.78 earlier this month as it sees growing demand for security products and wins market share from competitors. Imperva, founded by Shlomo Kramer, a co-founder of Check Point, went public in late 2011, while this year Varonis Systems has listed on Nasdaq and SafeCharge on London’s junior AIM market. The latest market debutante, Cyber-Ark, is looking to raise about $80 million on Nasdaq in an offering expected to value the company at up to $500 million. Meanwhile the number of Israeli companies being acquired has also accelerated since the big purchases of NDS and Trusteer in 2012 and 2013. According to IVC’s database there have already been seven acquisitions of cyber security software firms in 2014, the largest being Palo Alto Networks’ purchase of Cyvera for $200 million. JVP, which owns 46 percent of Cyber-Ark, has also been wooed by 250 security firms seeking to raise money the past two years. That has unnerved some investors who believe there is a danger of a market bubble developing, while others say the sector remains in its infancy and demand will only grow as the world becomes increasingly connected via the Internet, facing more complex security threats as a result. Isaac Ben-Israel, the country’s former top military scientist and now head of Tel Aviv University’s cyber research centre and Netanyahu’s adviser on the subject, said Israel’s goal is to become one of the five leading cyber powers and already ranks among the top three in terms of cyber readiness, along with Finland and Sweden. “In a normal day we have 100,000 to 200,000 attacks per day. In times of emergency ... this goes up to 2 million a day. This drives us to develop protection technology,” he said. The country now accounts for 7 percent of the $60 billion a year global cyber-security market and as much as 13 percent of new R&D; in the sector. Four years ago these numbers were only a third of what they are now. A crucial factor behind the growth is Israel’s compulsory military service with local firms benefiting from close cooperation with the defence forces and the talent that has emerged from elite military units. Technology units such as 8200, the army’s surveillance arm, are given priority when recruiting the country’s brightest high school graduates. Industry pioneer Gil Shwed, founder and CEO of Check Point, served in the 8200 unit. JVP, which has a third of its portfolio in cyber security, established its Cyber Labs for young start-ups in Beersheba, where several multinationals, including EMC and defence contractor Lockheed Martin, also have operations. “Israel is a desired location to establish a footprint and grow,” said Haden Land, vice president for R&D; at Lockheed Martin, which last month set up a separate subsidiary in Israel focused on technology and is working with EMC and Ben-Gurion University on joint cyber security research projects. “You have very good human capital in this discipline ... that can think the right way and can architect the right way to address these new areas,” said Orna Berry, a top executive at EMC, which has invested over $2 billion in Israel since 2006.

262,UPS,"Mass shootings on the rise in United States, FBI report finds","(Reuters) - Mass shootings have occurred in the United States with increasing frequency over the past 14 years, with 486 people killed in 160 incidents, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation analysis released on Wednesday. There were an average of 16.4 active-shooter incidents from 2007 through 2013, more than double the 6.4 average from 2000 to 2006, the report found. Active shootings, which the report defined as incidents not directly linked to gang violence or drugs and where police and citizens had the time to influence the outcome, occurred most frequently in places of business, which saw 46 percent of the incidents, followed by schools, where 24 percent occurred. The report was released a day after a man who had recently been fired from his job at a United Parcel Service Inc distribution center in Birmingham, Alabama, shot dead two supervisors at the site before turning the gun on himself.  That ending, the gunman taking his own life, was a common one in the events the FBI analyzed, with 40 percent of the shooters turning their guns on themselves. Police shot and killed the attacker in 13 percent of the cases analyzed. The deadliest incidents were the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech University, where 32 people were killed, and the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where 27 died excluding the gunman. FBI officials noted that many shooters had studied past incidents, particularly prominent ones like Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook or the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, where two gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher. That incident was not included in the 160 counted by the FBI. “Many offenders look to past offenses, particularly notable ones such as Columbine and Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook, and they study and they research those attacks,” Andre Simons, an FBI supervisory special agent, told a briefing in Washington. “They look back to these past offenses and they oftentimes find inspiration and they oftentimes seek to emulate or copycat those particular offenses. So the copycat phenomenon is real,” he said. In 13 percent of the cases, unarmed bystanders or school staffers confronted the gunman, ending the shooting by subduing the attacker until police could arrive. The FBI said that suggests both police and civilians would benefit from training on how to handle shooting incidents. “It is important, too, that training and exercises include not only an understanding of the threats faced but also the risks and options available in active shooter incidents,” the report found. Richard Parker, a lecturer at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, noted the numbers of mass shootings are minimal compared with the roughly 14,000 murders and 1.15 million violent crimes reported in the United States per year. “They get more attention than they statistically represent because they are so rare,” Parker said. “You have to ask where are the bulk of murders taking place, and this doesn’t even qualify as a significant minority. This is a tiny, tiny fraction.” ",9242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shooting-fbi/mass-shootings-on-the-rise-in-united-states-fbi-report-finds-idUSKCN0HJ2E820140924

265,UPS,UPS sets up access points for U.S. deliveries to cut costs,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) has started allowing U.S. customers to collect packages from neighborhood stores or lockers to lower failed deliveries of online purchases and costs associated with them, ahead of the busy holiday shopping season. Courier companies face higher delivery costs on online purchases by shoppers as per-package volume is lower than bulk deliveries to businesses. Repeat deliveries to buyers not available to receive their parcels adds to the costs in terms of handling, fuel and labor. “If we save one minute per driver, it results in a multi-million dollar savings,” UPS spokesman Steve Gaut told Reuters, estimating global annual savings of about $15 million. UPS also offers customers an option to reroute or reschedule deliveries for a $5 fee under its “UPS My Choice” service. UPS said in July that it would invest $175 million to strengthen capacity to ensure timely deliveries during the holiday shopping season, which begins with Thanksgiving.  The company faced criticism from customers last year, when severe winter and heavy orders led to delayed shipments during the holiday season. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said access points in the United States were critical for courier companies “because (business-to-consumer) is increasing its portion of total parcel mix for not only UPS but also for” rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N). UPS, the world’s largest courier company, gets about 62 percent of its revenue from the U.S. market.  Worldwide e-commerce sales are estimated to reach $2 trillion in 2015 from about $1 trillion in 2012, according to Bigcommerce, which provides an e-commerce platform to businesses.  FedEx uses about 1,800 of its U.S. offices as pickup points, according to its website. The company set up lockers at 15 locations in Dallas and Memphis this year.  UPS said on Wednesday that nearly 300 outlets, including dry cleaners, convenience stores and pharmacies, in New York and Chicago would serve as access or pickup points. This includes nine unstaffed lockers in Chicago. Online retailer Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) offers a similar service. It began setting up lockers in several U.S. cities in 2011, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) started testing locker services at 10 stores in Washington, DC last year. UPS said its 4,400 U.S. store franchises would also serve as pickup points from January. The company has more than 12,000 access points in Europe.

268,UPS,"UPS, FedEx seek ways to manage massive peak season package bulge","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are investing heavily in new infrastructure - but the continued dynamic growth of e-commerce will test those efforts.  The world’s two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam.  Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes.  Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. “There is only so much capacity in the network.” A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies.  Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx.   This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages. During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said “these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014” but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS’s next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday.   FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year’s capital investments would not affect the company’s earnings forecast. The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages.  Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year.  The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said.  “The e-commerce shipping model isn’t sustainable in its current form,” said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). “You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas.”  In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders.  “We now have the kind of visibility we didn’t before on what to expect from our largest customers,” said UPS’s Wallace. FedEx’s Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. “If we don’t have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle” a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said.   In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if “deemed at risk” of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski. Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company.   FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. “They can’t keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,” she said.  Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers.   “When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,” said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. “Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It’s about protecting that core business.” Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur.   “What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn’t apply,” said MIT’s Sheffi. “And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.” Amazon declined specific comment. “We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,” the company said in a statement.  FedEx’s Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase “at this point.” A UPS spokesman said the company has focused on fixing last year’s problems instead of pricing.

UPS (UPS.N) and main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), both considered U.S. economic bellwethers, are approaching their busiest time. Last year a last-minute surge in online consumer promotions left an estimated 2 million express packages stranded on Christmas Eve. “If it (a late surge) creates challenges and adds costs we would charge a premium,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters. “If it puts our service at risk, we would have to deny (the business).”  Kuehn spoke after UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, posted higher-than-expected third-quarter profit, driven by rising U.S. consumer and business demand plus strong growth in Asia. Kuehn said UPS remained concerned about U.S. railroad service problems - UPS is a major rail customer - saying “they need to improve their service metrics.” The major railroad have struggled this year to meet demand due to a growing economy, rising oil-by-rail freight and a record harvest. The problems especially affected UPS, which has invested $500 million to boost its infrastructure to handle the coming holiday season. Like Memphis-based FedEx, UPS has worked with major retailers this year to get a clearer forecast for package volumes and online promotions to avoid a repeat of last year’s debacle. FedEx has said if a major retailer decides to offer a last-minute online promotion without notifying the company, which threatens its service, the company won’t be able to handle the business.  UPS reported earnings per share of $1.32, up 14 percent from $1.16 a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.28 per share. UPS shares rose 1.1 percent to $101.57. Atlanta-based UPS confirmed its full-year profit outlook, predicting earnings per share of between $4.90 to $5.00. Analyst expected $4.95 per share. UPS said annual package shipments should increase 11 percent year over year in December.  The National Retail Federation predicted U.S. holiday retail sales will rise 4.1 percent this year to $616.9 billion. Other forecasts are less rosy.

The world’s two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam. Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes. Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. “There is only so much capacity in the network.” A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies.  Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx. This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages. During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said “these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014” but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS’s next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday. FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year’s capital investments would not affect the company’s earnings forecast. The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages. Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year. The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said. “The e-commerce shipping model isn’t sustainable in its current form,” said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). “You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas.” In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders. “We now have the kind of visibility we didn’t before on what to expect from our largest customers,” said UPS’s Wallace. FedEx’s Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. “If we don’t have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle” a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said. In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if “deemed at risk” of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski. Nordstrom Inc has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company. FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. “They can’t keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,” she said. Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers. “When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,” said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. “Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It’s about protecting that core business.” Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur. “What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn’t apply,” said MIT’s Sheffi. “And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.” Amazon declined specific comment. “We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,” the company said in a statement. FedEx’s Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase “at this point.” A UPS spokesman said the company has focused on fixing last year’s problems instead of pricing.

274,UPS,Ex-UPS exec's son pleads guilty to fraud scheme over Maxim magazine,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The son of a former United Parcel Service Inc vice president pleaded guilty to a scheme in which he impersonated his father to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars intended to finance the purchase of Maxim magazine.  Calvin Darden Jr., 40, pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud on Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York, less than two weeks before his criminal trial was scheduled to begin. Prosecutors had accused Darden of an elaborate scheme using fake emails and bank statements to secure more than $8 million to buy the men’s magazine. He was also accused of a separate fraud in which he tricked a Taiwanese company into paying him $500,000 after falsely claiming he would arrange a New York Knicks exhibition basketball game in Taiwan. Darden’s father, also named Calvin, is the former vice president of U.S. operations for package delivery company UPS. The younger Darden is scheduled to be sentenced in April. In September 2013, then-Maxim owner Alpha Media Group Inc [QUADGM.UL] - partly owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP [CBS.UL] - announced it had agreed to sell the magazine to Darden Media Group, headed by the elder Calvin Darden. The $31 million deal did not go through. Prosecutors said the younger Darden last year provided a fake bank account statement to an unidentified lender that listed stock holdings by his father in at least three companies for which the senior Darden served as a director. Darden’s father is on the corporate boards of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc, Target Corp and Cardinal Health Inc.  Once the lender placed $5.5 million in escrow, Darden sent a fake email to the law firm holding the money that authorized the release of the funds, according to a criminal complaint. The firm released $4.9 million of the money, which was purportedly to help finance the Maxim deal, to him. He secured an additional $3 million from a second lender using another bogus account statement, prosecutors said. The younger Darden also unsuccessfully attempted to raise $20 million from a third lender, according to prosecutors. A former stock broker, he previously pleaded guilty in 2005 to New York state charges that he stole almost $6 million from 11 people and served several years in prison. Attorneys for both Dardens did not respond to requests for comment. Alpha Media eventually sold Maxim in February to Biglari Holdings Inc. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The Memphis-based company has made it clear that if a late, unplanned holiday sale threatened to derail its system, it could decline that business.  Peak day package volumes at UPS and FedEx in the run-up to Christmas have jumped 40 percent and 57 percent, respectively, since 2009.  Those volumes are roughly double the average daily number of packages the companies haul. Deloitte LLP predicts U.S. e-commerce sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and robust online growth is expected to continue. Abney said the company’s brick-and-mortar and e-commerce retail customers are holding “Black Friday” sales earlier than normal this year and that UPS believes it is part of an effort by retailers to find ways to smooth out the pre-Christmas online ordering bulge.  If a late e-commerce surge raises costs for UPS this year, Abney said, “We certainly in 2015 and beyond will look very closely at what we need to do” to offset those costs, including the possibility of holiday season price increases.  The actual delivery of a package is the most cost- and labor-intensive part of what companies like UPS and FedEx do. Delivering to residential addresses is more expensive than to businesses, since businesses tend to receive multiple packages.  Managing those costs as e-commerce continues to grow is a priority, Abney said. E-commerce accounts for about 45 percent of UPS’ business, and should reach 50 percent within five years. “I think anybody that’s delivering directly to consumers is certainly going to be looking at those costs,” he said.

281,UPS,"UPS, FedEx cap air express deliveries: WSJ","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) started limiting air express deliveries after a last-minute increase in shipped packages caused some retailers to exceed agreed-upon limits, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people briefed on the situation. This year, both UPS and FedEx held some retailers to their volume commitments during the final shopping days before Christmas, aiming to avoid a repeat of a fiasco last year, the Journal reported. (on.wsj.com/1xJrn4h) “As we’ve moved through the peak season there have been some shifts in demand and customer needs as a result of slowdowns at the West Coast ports,” said Bonny Harrison, a spokeswoman for FedEx. Harrison added that these changes resulted in some caps on volume. A UPS spokeswoman said that company’s operations were going as planned.

282,UPS,U.S. Postal Service eyes e-commerce to offset declining mail,"CHICAGO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Facing a slump in the mail it had been delivering since the days of America’s Revolutionary War, in 2012 the U.S. Postal Service began aggressively targeting e-commerce and lapsed customers as the way to salvage its declining business. “Really it started almost at the level of cold-calling, talking to people who really hadn’t spoken to us in a long time,” said Nagisa Manabe, who joined the USPS in May 2012 as chief marketing and sales officer from Coca-Cola Co after a career in the private sector. “And really trying to persuade them to consider us as a very viable alternative in the shipping market.” With further drops in its traditional bread-and-butter products ahead, the USPS wants to capitalize on e-commerce, which consulting firm Detroit LLP has predicted should grow 14 percent this holiday season alone. But industry experts question whether the USPS has enough space in its delivery vans and whether its unionized work force can handle a greater proportion of the e-commerce market. Over the past two years the USPS has rolled out real-time scanning for packages, a vital tool for online retailers and consumers alike to track their packages. It is also upgrading all of its delivery workers’ handheld scanners. The rise of the Internet has taken a heavy toll on first-class mail, the USPS’s most profitable product. That falling business played a significant role in the USPS’s fiscal 2014 loss of $5.5 billion, its eighth consecutive year in the red. From 2009 to 2013, the volume of first-class mail deliveries dropped more than 20 percent. In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, USPS deliveries declined to 155.4 billion pieces from 158.2 billion. First-class deliveries accounted for 2.2 billion pieces of that decline. But package deliveries rose to more than 4 billion pieces from 3.7 billion, accounting for $1.1 billion of the USPS’s revenue growth of $1.9 billion. In the run-up to Christmas, the USPS has been doing Sunday deliveries for Amazon.com Inc  in a number of cities. Manabe adds that the agency will handle the online retailer’s push into same-day and next-day deliveries “in many markets.” EBay Inc is another major customer and Manabe says “pretty much anyone who’s in the e-commerce space at least does some volume with us.” Many in the delivery industry are waiting to see how the USPS has handled surging e-commerce volumes in the days before Christmas. The USPS’s competitive advantage lies in the fact that it already delivers to every house in America and analysts estimate it can do so for around a quarter of the cost charged by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, which are both competitors and customers of the USPS. “The U.S. Postal Service has the ultimate last-mile delivery network, so it has a real opportunity here,” said Vinnie DeAngelis, vice president of postal relations at Neopost USA, which provides tracking and other software for e-commerce retailers and delivery companies. According to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc, in 2013 the USPS accounted for 59.2 percent of e-commerce deliveries, while UPS accounted for 31.9 percent and FedEx 8.9 percent. The USPS has predicted holiday package volume growth of around 12 percent this year from Nov. 17 to Christmas. In the years ahead, the USPS expects 80 percent of U.S. ZIP codes will see “significantly more business,” Manabe said. But many of the USPS’s current delivery vehicles are more than 25 years old and built for mail instead of larger packages. “They (the USPS) tend to operate smaller vehicles that really cube out (fill up) pretty quickly as opposed to the network we have in place,” FedEx Executive Vice President Michael Glenn said during a Dec. 17 earnings conference call with analysts. Delivery companies measure their vehicles’ three-dimensional space in cubes. The USPS plans to spend more than $10 billion over the next four years on a new fleet of vehicles. Manabe said that could mean three or four different sizes of vehicles to handle different package volumes in urban and rural areas. Some industry experts are concerned that the USPS, whose operations are dictated by Congress, may have trouble handling e-commerce growth due to its quasi-government unionized workers. “When I think about the USPS business model, I don’t believe they are ever going to get the productivity of FedEx or UPS,” said Brian Hancock, a board member of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals. But Manabe insists the unionized work force is on board and recognizes the importance of e-commerce. The last few delivery days before Christmas have been a test for the USPS. After struggling with a late surge in online orders last year that left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve, UPS and FedEx both made it clear this year that they would reject a last-minute flood of packages if it threatened their systems. Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight, says that for many retailers this holiday season, the USPS may have become the carrier of last resort. “The question is whether their smaller vehicles, which are designed for mail rather than packages, could handle the extra volume,” he said.

283,UPS,U.S. retailers miss fewer Christmas deadlines -early surveys,"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers missed fewer Christmas deliveries this year, according to two small, early surveys released on Friday, partly reflecting a year’s worth of investments made to avoid 2013’s last-minute shipping debacle. This year, 7 percent of packages ordered online did not arrive by their promised delivery date, compared with 12 percent in 2013, according to a survey of 160 orders placed by retail-intelligence firm StellaService. Separately, management consulting firm Kurt Salmon said 13 percent of the nearly 100 e-commerce orders it surveyed did not make it in time for Christmas, down from 15 percent in 2013. In 2013, some 2 million express packages were left stranded on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. The reasons given were, in part, a surge in demand triggered by last-minute online promotions and bad weather. This year, retailers pushed back the cut-off date for Christmas delivery by one day, but most were still able to hit the mark because of improvements to their logistics infrastructure, better weather and fewer last-minute deals. “We saw a lot less of the 11th-hour promotions,” said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain for Kurt Salmon. “They may have extended their deadline by about a day, but they were a little less aggressive about pushing those promotions.” Retailers set a Christmas cut-off delivery date between Dec. 19 and Dec. 20 this year, he said. The four retailers with the most aggressive cutoff date of Dec. 23 - Apple Inc, Dell Inc, Nordstrom Inc and Zappos, a unit of Amazon.com Inc - all made their deadlines, StellaService said. The better results also stemmed from the heavy investments by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, the world’s two largest shipping companies. UPS allocated $500 million to expand and improve its 2014 holiday operations. Both built new facilities, added more temporary workers and pushed retailers for clearer estimates and earlier deadlines to avoid last year’s missteps. The level of communication between carriers and retailers was “significantly higher” this year, Osburn said, pointing to a retail client who, in the run-up to Christmas, heard from one carrier two to three times a day. But both surveys found that some retailers still fell short of their promises, reflecting the difficulty of accurately calculating holiday demand as e-commerce orders grow rapidly. StellaService found nine of the top 40 retailers it tested missed delivery dates: Best Buy Co Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp, Crate & Barrel, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Kohl’s Corp , Macy’s Inc, Staples Inc, Toys ‘R Us and Wayfair Inc. Best Buy declined to comment. The other retailers were not immediately available for comment. Both Staples and Toys ‘R Us missed deliveries in multiple regions in the United States, and in one case, Staples canceled an order without notifying the shopper, StellaService said. Osburn found one case where a retailer fell behind on orders and attempted to upgrade shipping on packages to make the Christmas deadline. But the volume was three to four times higher than its previous estimates, and the retailer missed the Christmas deadline, Osburn said, declining to name the company.

284,UPS,"Small U.S. firms may struggle with new UPS, FedEx dimensional prices","CHICAGO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc  and FedEx Corp are rolling out new pricing systems to curb online retailers’ large package sizes, but industry experts warn many small firms are unprepared and could pay up to 50 percent more for shipping. Starting Monday, UPS will no longer charge for U.S. ground packages under 3 cubic feet by weight but by their “dimensional weight.” Memphis-based FedEx will roll out the same change on Jan 5. Instead of simply weighing a box, retailers must multiply its length by its height and width, and then divide that by 166 to reach its dimensional weight. “We believe this (dimensional weight pricing) will encourage customers to reduce their package sizes,” Bill Smith, UPS vice president of marketing, told Reuters. UPS and FedEx announced the change in May and have worked to help customers adjust. But some small firms lack the resources to change packaging and may switch to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), said Amine Khechfe, general manager of Endicia, which offers shipping solutions for e-commerce vendors. Under the new systems, according to Endicia, a woman’s shoulder bag weighing 2 pounds - shipped in a box measuring 19 by 15 by 5 inches - will have a dimensional weight of 9 pounds and cost 45 percent more to ship. Atlanta-based UPS says retailers are shipping lighter goods, but have not shrunk the size of their packaging materials. “We need to charge a fair value for use of our asset, which in this case is space,” FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn told Reuters. Online retailers such as Amazon are expected to be prepared. But smaller firms like Oregon-based Natura Health Products would struggle: It expects to pay 36 percent more for shipping many packages. Natura sells nutritional supplement products, many for cancer patients, and spends about $180,000 a year on shipping through FedEx and USPS, said logistics manager Chris Thorsen. To avoid such increases, the company will shift more shipping business in 2015 to USPS. The share shipped by USPS will rise to about 50 percent from 40 percent in 2014. The USPS still charges by weight. In July, it announced some price cuts to target e-commerce. Research firm Morningstar estimates e-commerce will grow at least 10 percent annually over the next five years. Analyst Keith Schoonmaker said such growth and the new pricing model will allow UPS and FedEx to let some of this low-yield business to USPS.   (Reporting By Nick Carey in Chicago. Editing by P.J.

289,UPS,"UPS hurt by disappointing holiday season, eyes costs, pricing","CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on Friday said its fourth-quarter performance was hurt as lackluster holiday demand pushed up costs, and that it will likely raise prices for this year’s peak season. The world’s largest package delivery company, citing a disappointing performance in U.S. domestic ground shipments,  said its fourth-quarter earnings per share would come in below market expectations.  The comments sent UPS shares down 9.2 percent to $103.73 at midday. “Clearly, our financial performance during the quarter was disappointing,” UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney said in a regulatory filing. “Going forward, we will reduce operating costs and implement new pricing strategies during peak season.” UPS also said 2015 earnings-per-share growth would be slightly below its long-term target ranging from 9 percent to 13 percent. In a separate announcement, main rival FedEx reaffirmed its earnings outlook for its fiscal 2015 year ending May 31. During the 2013 peak season UPS and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) were hit by a late surge in online orders that left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve. Both companies worked last year to avoid a repeat. UPS spent $500 million on network improvements to handle anticipated growth in e-commerce shipments. The Atlanta-based company expects earnings of approximately $1.25 per share for the fourth quarter. Analysts estimated $1.47.  Its international business was also hurt by one-time charges and negative foreign exchange comparisons. UPS also said it will take a noncash, aftertax charge of $670 million related to its pension plans. The company said it prepared its network to handle a spike in package volumes on Cyber Monday and on its peak day, Dec. 22. But demand was less than expected on those days. As a result, UPS was hurt by a decline in productivity and extra costs it incurred on those days. “I think UPS was so concerned about the horrible 2013 they over-planned for 2014, and voila, they spent too much money and hired too many people to handle what wound up being a muddled peak,” said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Company. Becker said the peak season was also affected by the slowdown at West Coast ports, a problem FedEx highlighted in a Dec. 17 earnings conference call.   She said raising peak prices was a smart move under the circumstances, but added some large customers will push back.

294,UPS,UPS to apply surcharges to residential packages after costs surge,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Tuesday it will start applying surcharges for residential packages this year after its costs soared during the recent disappointing holiday season.  UPS also reported that fourth-quarter profit fell from a year ago but forecast earnings within the range of estimates. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, warned in late January it would report a fourth-quarter profit below its forecast and market expectations. The Atlanta-based company had mobilized more workers and equipment for an anticipated surge in holiday packages, but the extra business failed to materialize. The additional costs primarily affected the company’s domestic ground package unit. As a result of the poor quarter, UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney said on a conference call that the company would apply surcharges for residential packages in particular. The additional charges will be applied over several years as contracts with major customers are renegotiated. “These pricing strategies will be designed to ensure we are properly compensated for the value we provide,” Abney said.  UPS went through a second consecutive challenging peak season. In 2013, the company was caught off-guard by a late rush of online packages that left an estimated 1.3 million parcels undelivered on Christmas Eve.  UPS spent $500 million last year on network improvements and worked closely with retail customers to prevent a repeat of the miscues in late 2013, but the rising popularity of e-commerce made forecasting volumes a moving target. UPS forecast full-year 2015 earnings in a range of $5.05 to $5.30 per share. Analysts estimated $5.15 a share this year. UPS reported fourth-quarter net profit of $1.15 billion, down nearly 2 percent from $1.17 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share came in at $1.25, unchanged from a year earlier and matching the expectations of analysts.  Quarterly revenue rose 6 percent to $15.9 billion from $15 billion a year earlier, including a 7.5 percent increase in revenue from its domestic ground package business.  Operating expenses jumped more than 20 percent to $9.2 billion from $7.65 billion, which caused a more than 60 percent drop in operating profit at the domestic ground package unit. On a GAAP basis, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents due to pension-related charges.   In early trading, UPS shares were up 1.2 percent at $101.47.

295,UPS,"UPS warns e-commerce volume hard to forecast, to add surcharge","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on Tuesday reported a disappointing peak holiday season and warned that U.S. online shopping habits are hard to predict and getting it wrong will slice into profits. “It (forecasting E-commerce) is both hard for our customers and for us,” Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters on Tuesday after UPS reported that fourth-quarter profit fell but forecast earnings within the range of estimates.   Aside from two major peaks around Black Friday, the biggest U.S. shopping day in terms of sales, and just before Christmas, UPS ended up with what Kuehn called a “U-shaped peak season,” as demand fell off between those spikes. The troughs meant higher costs for UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, which mobilized more workers and equipment for a more evenly spread holiday season. This year UPS plans to “right size” operations on a daily basis to react to short-term forecasts and reduce costs, Kuehn said.  The Atlanta-based company will also begin applying surcharges to deliver residential packages. UPS said it costs three times as much to deliver packages to a home than to a business, which receive more packages in a single stop. UPS’ poor 2014 holiday season followed a disastrous peak season in 2013, when a late surge in online shopping demand caught UPS and main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) off guard. According to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc, some 1.3 million packages were left undelivered by UPS on Christmas Eve and more than 600,000 by FedEx.  After that bad Christmas, 2014 was all about what UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney described as “protecting the brand” on a conference call on Tuesday.  Both UPS and FedEx worked closely with retailers last year to forecast holiday season volumes.  While UPS preannounced in January that its fourth-quarter profit would be lower than expected, FedEx reaffirmed its earnings outlook for fiscal 2015 ending May 31. John Haber, CEO of Spend Management Experts, which helps clients manage logistics costs, said UPS’ planned surcharges  will make it harder for e-commerce companies to offer free shipping - a feature U.S. consumers have come to expect.  “Companies need to continue to explore all viable options from a carrier standpoint and should be evaluating them now,” Haber said. “It’s clear that cost increases are on the horizon in 2015.” ",2032015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-results-ecommerce/ups-warns-e-commerce-volume-hard-to-forecast-to-add-surcharge-idUSKBN0L721U20150203

The troughs meant higher costs for UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, which mobilized more workers and equipment for a more evenly spread holiday season. This year UPS plans to “right size” operations on a daily basis to react to short-term forecasts and reduce costs, Kuehn said. The Atlanta-based company will also begin applying surcharges to deliver residential packages. UPS said it costs three times as much to deliver packages to a home than to a business, which receive more packages in a single stop. UPS’ poor 2014 holiday season followed a disastrous peak season in 2013, when a late surge in online shopping demand caught UPS and main rival FedEx Corp off guard. According to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc, some 1.3 million packages were left undelivered by UPS on Christmas Eve and more than 600,000 by FedEx. After that bad Christmas, 2014 was all about what UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney described as “protecting the brand” on a conference call on Tuesday. Both UPS and FedEx worked closely with retailers last year to forecast holiday season volumes. While UPS preannounced in January that its fourth-quarter profit would be lower than expected, FedEx reaffirmed its earnings outlook for fiscal 2015 ending May 31. John Haber, CEO of Spend Management Experts, which helps clients manage logistics costs, said UPS’ planned surcharges  will make it harder for e-commerce companies to offer free shipping - a feature U.S. consumers have come to expect. “Companies need to continue to explore all viable options from a carrier standpoint and should be evaluating them now,” Haber said. “It’s clear that cost increases are on the horizon in 2015.”   (Reporting by Nick Carey in Detroit; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",2032015,http://www.reuters.com/article/ups-results-ecommerce/ups-warns-e-commerce-volume-hard-to-forecast-to-add-surcharge-idUSL1N0VD1M220150203
297,UPS,UPDATE 2-UPS to apply surcharges to residential packages after costs surge,"(Adds details of results, updates stock price to open) Feb 3 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc said on Tuesday it will start applying surcharges for residential packages this year after its costs soared during the recent disappointing holiday season. UPS also reported that fourth-quarter profit fell from a year ago but forecast earnings within the range of estimates. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, warned in late January it would report a fourth-quarter profit below its forecast and market expectations. The Atlanta-based company had mobilized more workers and equipment for an anticipated surge in holiday packages, but the extra business failed to materialize. The additional costs primarily affected the company’s domestic ground package unit. As a result of the poor quarter, UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney said on a conference call that the company would apply surcharges for residential packages in particular. The additional charges will be applied over several years as contracts with major customers are renegotiated. “These pricing strategies will be designed to ensure we are properly compensated for the value we provide,” Abney said. UPS went through a second consecutive challenging peak season. In 2013, the company was caught off-guard by a late rush of online packages that left an estimated 1.3 million parcels undelivered on Christmas Eve. UPS spent $500 million last year on network improvements and worked closely with retail customers to prevent a repeat of the miscues in late 2013, but the rising popularity of e-commerce made forecasting volumes a moving target. UPS forecast full-year 2015 earnings in a range of $5.05 to $5.30 per share. Analysts estimated $5.15 a share this year. UPS reported fourth-quarter net profit of $1.15 billion, down nearly 2 percent from $1.17 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share came in at $1.25, unchanged from a year earlier and matching the expectations of analysts. Quarterly revenue rose 6 percent to $15.9 billion from $15 billion a year earlier, including a 7.5 percent increase in revenue from its domestic ground package business. Operating expenses jumped more than 20 percent to $9.2 billion from $7.65 billion, which caused a more than 60 percent drop in operating profit at the domestic ground package unit. On a GAAP basis, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents due to to pension-related charges. In early trading, UPS shares were up 1.2 percent at $101.47.

299,UPS,NYC and state sue UPS for illegally shipping cigarettes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City and New York state sued United Parcel Service Inc. on Wednesday, seeking over $180 million in damages and penalties against the shipping company for allegedly delivering nearly 700,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes across the state. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, accuses UPS of cheating the state and city of $29.7 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in tax revenue, according to a statement from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The deliveries mostly originated from smoke shops on Indian reservations in New York state and were shipped to unlicensed wholesalers and retailers as well as residences in New York and nationwide, according to the lawsuit. The deliveries, which violated both federal and state laws,  were made despite a 2005 agreement between UPS and the state in which the company agreed to stop cigarette shipments to individual consumers and unlicensed dealers, Schneiderman said. In an emailed statement, Atlanta, Georgia-based UPS denied the company knowingly shipped cigarettes to consumers and said it would “vigorously defend” its position. It said UPS went beyond federal and state law requirements in 2005 when it agreed to stop delivering cigarettes to consumers nationwide. Last year, Schneiderman joined a similar lawsuit filed by the city in 2013 against FedEx Corp. That suit seeks at least $239 million in damages and penalties. According to Schneiderman, UPS made more than 78,500 illegal shipments to consumers and other unauthorized recipients in New York state from 2010 to 2014. The state wants UPS to pay $1,000 per violation, or penalties of $78.5 million, for violating the 2005 agreement.  It also seeks $89.1 million in treble damages for the state and $14.1 million for the city under the federal racketeering statute for the loss of tax revenue. The company “cost the state millions in revenue and is helping to make illegal, low-cost cigarettes available to our young people,” Schneiderman said.	 The case is State of New York, et al v.

303,UPS,"CORRECTED--Weather-battered US consumers skip mall, order in and head south","(Corrects 4th paragraph to say the size of GrubHub orders rose 45 percent. Also adds graphic) By Jilian Mincer NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. consumers battered by the wretched winter weather still afflicting much of the eastern half of the country have responded by ordering in rather than eating out, flying more frequently to Florida and cutting out trips to the mall, according to a Reuters review of company data. Cities ranging from Chicago to Bangor, Maine, set all time records for the lowest February temperatures. Boston got more than 100 inches of snow, crippling mass transit and prompting the system’s head to quit. Lexington, Kentucky, is covered in more than 20 inches of snow, the result of the biggest snowstorm since 1943. In Miami, it was 83 under sunny skies on Thursday. Still, it’s not all misery, all the time. While the relentless weather has dented traffic and sales for restaurants and mall retailers and frustrated delivery firms like United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, it’s increased sales of snow shovels and rock salt from local hardware stores as well as Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Cos . “Cold is like gold,” said Matthew Maloney, the chief executive of online meal delivery service GrubHub Inc , based in Chicago and New York and affiliated with about 30,000 restaurants. In the afternoon before winter storm Juno hit the Northeast at the end of January, the size of GrubHub’s orders rose 45 percent, with cheese pizza and hot chocolate orders more than doubling, according to company data provided to Reuters. If and when the weather gets nicer, the home improvement stores will look forward to customers looking to fix damaged lawns, gardens and siding. Carmakers, who posted disappointing February sales, could rebound if consumers opt to replace less reliable or damaged vehicles. Clothing stores may languish further if temperatures don’t rise soon enough to persuade shoppers it’s time to buy spring apparel. “If people look outside and see walls of snow, they’re not going to buy a t-shirt,” said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura. February shopper traffic in the U.S. fell 12.5 percent compared with same month last year, and sales overall fell 10.4 percent, according to RetailNext, a research firm. The decline could have been worse if more of the storms occurred on the weekends because that’s when shoppers restock groceries and visit the malls, analysts said. At Amazon.com, the top sellers on Thursday included humidifiers, snow melt products and a $19.99 device called the Paw Plunger, used to clean Fido’s paws, the company said. Some restaurants will make up for lost sales through deliveries, but not everyone offers those services, and employees working from home because of the weather won’t eat out either, said Chris G. Christopher, a global economist at IHS Consumer Markets in Boston. “People are also skipping dates and family dining at restaurants,” he said. Some Americans sought warmer surroundings.

305,UPS,U.S. Supreme Court revives pregnant worker’s case against UPS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with a former driver for UPS Inc by giving her another chance to argue that the package delivery company discriminated against her when it refused to lighten her work duties while she was pregnant. In a 6-3 decision, the justices revived Peggy Young’s  discrimination claim against the company by sending the case back to a lower court. A federal district court judge and an appeals court had earlier ruled in favor of UPS, which was backed by business groups in the case. “This is a big win for Peggy Young and other women in the workplace,” said Sam Bagenstos, Young’s lawyer. The case focused on whether, under a federal law called the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, employers must provide accommodations for pregnant workers who may have physical limitations on tasks they can perform.  Young, who worked at a Maryland facility, became pregnant in 2006. She made her request for an accommodation after a midwife advised that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg). Writing for the majority, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of UPS policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities, injuries or otherwise might need accommodations. Breyer said there is a “genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Young’s.” Bagenstos said the court “made clear that employers may not refuse to accommodate pregnant workers based on considerations of cost or convenience when they accommodate other workers.” UPS said it was confident it would ultimately win the case. “UPS is pleased that the Supreme Court rejected the argument that UPS’s pregnancy-neutral policy was inherently discriminatory,” a company statement said. Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, wrote a dissenting opinion accusing the court majority of coming up with “an interpretation that is as dubious in principle as it is senseless in practice.” UPS said last October that starting this past January it would begin providing accommodations for pregnant women.  The impact of the ruling could be limited in part because a 2008 amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act could now protect women in Young’s situation. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said employees must offer accommodations to pregnant women just as they do for other workers with similar physical limitations. The case is Young v. UPS, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-1226.

The proposed deal became public in 2013 when then-Maxim owner Alpha Media Group Inc - partly owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP - announced it would sell the magazine to Darden Media Group, headed by the elder Darden. The $31 million deal did not go through and Alpha Media eventually sold Maxim to Biglari Holdings Inc.

311,UPS,FedEx to buy TNT for $4.8 billion to take on rivals in Europe,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) is to buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS for an agreed 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion), stepping up the challenge to rivals United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) in Europe. European regulators blocked a 2013 takeover of TNT by UPS due to concerns it would stifle competition, but analysts and executives said on Tuesday FedEx, with its strong air fleet, would complement TNT’s sizeable European road network. “Europe, despite the fact that there has been low growth, is still an enormous market both for import and export,” FedEx Corp. (FDX.N) Chief Executive Fred Smith told analysts. TNT gives FedEx access to pan-European service and the domestic UK and French markets, areas where it is not yet a big player, Smith said, while TNT customers will get access to FedEx’s global distribution platform. ING analysts estimate Deutsche Post’s DHL currently has a 19 percent market share in Europe, followed by UPS with 16 percent, TNT with 12 percent and FedEx at 5 percent — meaning the deal could catapult FedEx to second place. FedEx will offer 8 euros in cash per ordinary TNT share — a 33 percent premium on last week’s close, though below UPS’s 2013 offer of 9.5 euros.  Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx is financing the deal with debt, the latest company to take advantage of low interest rates. TNT shares were up nearly 30 percent on Tuesday, close to FedEx’s bid price, while FedEx stock rose 3.6 percent. “FedEx has laid on the table an attractive offer price,” said ABN Amro analyst Maarten Bakker, who has a “hold” rating on TNT shares.  “With FedEx having always been the most logical predator of TNT Express, we see the chances of a competing offer as slim.” FedEx finance chief Alan Graf said the company would “be very aggressive on spending on integration in the first year,” and the deal would create unspecified cost synergies. The deal has been unanimously recommended by TNT’s supervisory board. TNT’s largest shareholder, PostNL (PTNL.AS), also said it would tender its 14.7 percent stake to FedEx. PostNL shares rose 17 percent. European regulators’ decision to block UPS’s bid for TNT dealt a blow to the Dutch firm, which had been counting on adopting much of UPS’s logistics backbone.  TNT, whose European market share has slumped by as much as 5 percentage points since that deal fell apart, has cut costs, sold operations and invested in its road network in an effort to hold on to customers in a weak European market for business package deliveries. “There is no regulatory risk whatsoever,” said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Andre Mulder of the proposed FedEx deal, calling the offer fair in view of TNT’s weaker market position. “FedEx made a smart move and their rivals can do virtually nothing,” he added. FedEx’s decision to bid followed a 17 percent drop in TNT shares over the past year, versus a 21 percent rise in the benchmark Dutch AEX index. A stronger U.S. dollar against the euro will also have worked in the U.S. firm’s favor.  TNT warned in February it expected tough trading to continue in its main western European markets.

312,UPS,"In TNT, FedEx may get last major package target UPS once sought","CHICAGO (Reuters) - FedEx Corp’s $4.8 billion bid Tuesday for TNT Express took the world’s last large potential package delivery acquisition target off the table, marking a victory in FedEx’s battle to gain market share from rival United Parcel Service Inc. If FedEx wins regulatory approval for the proposed acquisition, it would pull into the No. 2 spot among package delivery services in Europe with a 17 percent market share. That would put it ahead of UPS in Europe, but leave Deutsche Post’s DHL with the lead at 19 percent of the market. For FedEx, this is a case where being No. 2 could be an advantage. In 2013, European regulators blocked a $6.9 billion bid from Atlanta-based UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, for TNT on grounds that the combined companies would have more than 30 percent of the European market. FedEx has a better shot at getting regulatory approval, analysts say, in part because TNT has lost share since the UPS bid.  “It looks like FedEx came in and got something that UPS couldn’t,” said John Haber, chief executive of Spend Management Experts, which helps clients reduce supply chain spending. “It looks like FedEx paid a lot less and it puts them in a sweet position.” UPS has said it will not renew its bid for TNT and last year said it would invest $1 billion over four years in expansion projects to grow its business organically.      FedEx has had a good run recently against UPS. UPS had a second consecutive poor peak season in 2014, as it overspent to compensate for being stuck with a glut of packages on Christmas Eve 2013. FedEx experienced no such problems. “FedEx is currently better positioned and is doing a better job of executing,” said Jim Corridore, an equity research director at S&P; Capital IQ. If regulators give FedEx’s TNT offer the nod, it would leave no other major package delivery firm as targets for DHL, UPS or FedEx, which have global market shares of 41 percent, 25 percent and up to 22 percent, including TNT, respectively. “There’s really nothing juicy left out there to buy,” said Helane Becker, a Cowen & Co analyst. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said acquisitions by the two package delivery firms from now on may focus on growing other parts of their business, such as contract logistics, logistics or freight forwarding.  “Unless a large package business develops independently in Asia, all that’s left out there are small, regional players,” Schoonmaker said.  The barriers to entry for a major new package delivery company are high. A potential rival to the three global leaders would need to own an airline, a prohibitive obstacle for most firms.

318,UPS,UPS CFO - Europe plans unchanged by possible TNT deal,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery giant UPS does not expect to change its current expansion plan in Europe despite a recent acquisition bid by main rival FedEx that would knock the firm into third place on the continent, a top executive said on Tuesday. Last year UPS announced a four-year, $1 billion investment to grow its European network.  Earlier this month, its main rival, FedEx Corp (FDX.N), announced it would buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS. A 2013 UPS bid to buy TNT was blocked by European regulators. If FedEx’s acquisition of TNT is approved, it would become the second-largest package delivery firm in Europe behind Deutsche Post’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL but ahead of UPS. Speaking after UPS posted a better-than-expected quarterly net profit and reaffirmed its 2015 earnings outlook, chief financial officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters that FedEx’s bid for TNT had not changed UPS’ plans. “We’re continuing at full speed with our expansions plans,” said Kuehn, who is due to retire this summer. “Actually Europe was one of the stars of the show in the (first) quarter.” Export volumes in Europe at UPS rose over 9 percent in the quarter and Kuehn said the company’s compound annual growth over the past decade has also been around 9 percent.  “We’re going to keep on doing what we can to compete in that environment,” he said. While many publicly traded companies have complained about the impact of the strong dollar as overseas sales in foreign currencies translate into lower revenue at home, UPS said it had hedges in place on major currencies that should protect it until the end of 2016.  But Kuehn said that UPS is unprotected in minor currencies, which should be a slight drag for the company this year. At the start of 2015 UPS expected that would affect revenue by $50 million this year, but it now puts that figure at $70 million. What UPS is more concerned about moving forward is the impact of the strong dollar on U.S. exports, Kuehn said. Although he said it was hard to predict exactly how much its U.S. customers would be affected, the strength of the dollar would continue to act as a headwind for exports, he said.

319,UPS,"UPS profit lifted by pricing, maintains 2015 earnings outlook","CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on Tuesday reported higher first-quarter net profit due to price increases and productivity improvements, and reaffirmed its earnings outlook for 2015. Atlanta-based UPS said profitability improved across all business segments, though revenue growth in its supply chain and freight business was slowed by a strong U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharges. UPS shares rose 2 percent to $99.34. The world’s largest package delivery company posted a first-quarter net profit of $1.03 billion, or $1.12 per share, up 10 percent from $911 million, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.09 for the quarter. UPS posted revenue of $14 billion, below Wall Street analysts’ expectations of $14.3 billion.  The company said it continues to expect earnings per share of between $5.05 and $5.30 for 2015. Analysts have predicted earnings per share of $5.15 for the year. UPS said it was on track to achieve long-term financial goals, previously stated as annual earnings per share growth between 9 percent to 13 percent. UPS’ first-quarter profit beat came after a difficult fourth quarter in which the company overspent preparing for a holiday peak season package surge that failed to materialize. After that disappointing result, UPS said it would apply peak season surcharges. During an analyst call on Tuesday, the company said surcharges would apply to residential packages and were included in its full-year earnings guidance.   Earlier this month, its main rival, FedEx Corp (FDX.N), announced it would buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS. A 2013 UPS bid to buy TNT was blocked by regulators. If FedEx’s acquisition of TNT is approved, it would become the second largest package delivery firm in Europe after Deutsche Post’s (DPWGn.DE) DHL, knocking UPS into third place.  UPS said revenue at its key domestic U.S. package service rose to $8.8 billion in the first quarter, up 3.8 percent from $8.5 billion in the year-ago period. Revenue per package rose 1.3 percent, aided by a change in “dimensional weight pricing.” The new pricing system, which FedEx has introduced, punishes e-commerce vendors for using excessive packaging for small items and taking up too much space on package delivery vehicles. Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn, who will retire in July, told analysts U.S. package volumes should grow 3 percent this year.

325,UPS,Many big companies live in fear for their future in digital age,"FRANKFURT, June 25 (Reuters) - The top executives of many a corporate giant must feel like the fictional character Gulliver, waking up to find themselves under attack from modern-day Lilliputians, small start-up companies which overwhelm their established rivals with new technologies. The old powers of market incumbents - massive scale, control over distribution, brand power, millions of customer relationships - are no longer seen as the obstacles they once were to agile rivals with innovative business models. A new survey finds business leaders believe four out of 10 top-ranked companies in their industries worldwide won’t survive the next five years. They blame the accelerating change in technology, shifting business models and a need to merge to cut costs in order to ensure they don’t become footnotes in someone else’s corporate history. “Not just lone companies, but entire industries are being side-swiped by these effects,” said James Macaulay, co-author of the study, which polled 941 business leaders from a dozen industries in the world’s 13 biggest economies. ""Digital disruption now has the potential to overturn incumbents and reshape markets faster than perhaps any force in history,"" the survey states. The report can be found at bit.ly/1IyV1cK The survey was conducted by a research centre at top-ranked Swiss business school IMD, the International Institute for Management Development, with backing from Internet equipment maker Cisco, where Macaulay works as a consultant. Industries with the highest number of top-rated companies at risk were hospitality/travel, media and entertainment, retail, financial services and consumer goods/manufacturing, in that order, the survey showed. Meanwhile, industries which still largely deliver physical products or services such as pharmaceuticals, utilities and the oil and gas sectors were rated the least likely to be disrupted. Michael Wade, another co-author of the survey, said there were some things software could not replace. “Consumers are still unlikely to take an app if they get a headache,” joked Wade, a professor of strategy at the Lausanne-based IMD business school. But even for industries such as pharmaceuticals, where regulatory protections, high capital costs and complex production processes still rule, Wade said new threats are coming from start-ups analysing “big data” to offer a personalised approach  to medicine, for example. Meanwhile in travel e-commerce aggregators have taken millions of customers from direct bookings with hotels and airlines already struggling with a decade of decline in business travel amid the economic and structural challenges. “Disruptive players are coming from out of nowhere,” says Macaulay. “Now it’s individuals who want to rent their homes and vehicles,” he said, referring to home rental service Airbnb, office-sharing firm LiquidSpace and similar “sharing economy” start-ups. Karl Ulrich Garnadt, chief executive of the German Airlines division of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, told venture investors in Berlin this month that his industry still spends too much time worrying about direct competitors in Asia or the Mideast. He noted how the industry missed the rise of mobile travel apps, the top dozen of which now collectively have a valuation around 88 billion euros ($99 billion), while the market capitalisation of Lufthansa, Europe’s largest airline group, has shrunk to 5.5 billion euros from double that a decade ago. “Today we are too limited in our thinking. We need to widen our horizon, we need to think like the customer,” the airline industry veteran said. Towards that end, Lufthansa is seeking ways to woo back customers who expect them to deliver more than boarding passes to their mobile phones. With free on-board Wi-Fi soon to be available on every plane, he wants flight attendants to use new apps to help frequent travellers make new travel bookings in mid-air. In banking big lenders are now all at giving board-level attention to the rapid growth of “fintech” start-ups in markets from mortgage-lending to wealth management to small business loans. In an era of cloud computing and services delivered to smartphones, fintech start-ups have no need to duplicate the retail branch networks that tied customers to banks. And new players aren’t saddled with making heavy investments in creaky,  decades-old back-office banking systems. “Lending remains pretty much an archaic process for banks, largely based on paper forms that are designed to give customers a poor experience,” said Martin McPhee, a senior vice president at Cisco who heads the company’s consulting arm. “Research shows that four out of five banking customers will happily leave their banks for a better customer experience,” he said. In corporate circles, the most common sobriquet for these digital threats is Google or, less frequently, Amazon . But, depending on the industry, the big threat goes by different names: for automakers and transport companies, it is Tesla, the luxury electric car company, or Uber, the online taxi service. For hotels and airlines, it’s Airbnb or Trivago, now majority owned by Expedia. Tesla has also hit the radar of utilities with its announcement in April on its “energy storage” business, which aims to produce batteries capable of solving the elusive problem of storing electrical energy produced at optimum times for use at other times. “Everyone thought (Tesla founder) Elon Musk was building a car company, but now we find he is building an alternative energy company,” McPhee said. There is also mounting wave of digitally inspired, cross-border mergers, stepped-up corporate venture funding and a willingness to place bigger bets on risky business models that can undermine a company’s existing activities. BMW-owned British carmaker Mini said this week customers would in the future be able to offer their private vehicles for car-sharing, mindful of a trend amongst younger drivers to not have their own cars. The challengers offer massive improvements in how customers use the products or services of established businesses. They combine that with finding ways to slash costs and enter markets without investing heavily to own physical assets or distribution infrastructure, says McPhee. Uber, the online taxi-hailing service is now applying similar strategies to sign up drivers to deliver everything from groceries to heavy equipment, in a challenge to logistics giants like FedEx and UPS. McPhee notes the historical parallel to what occurred after the advent of the Web in the mid 1990s: Just 25 percent of the Fortune 100 top U.S. companies were still in existence 15 years later.

326,UPS,EEOC sues UPS for religious bias against bearded men,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued United Parcel Service Inc, accusing the world’s largest package delivery company of discriminating against male workers and job applicants who wore beards or long hair because of their religion. In a complaint filed on Wednesday in the Brooklyn, New York, federal court, the EEOC said UPS has failed since at least 2004 to hire, promote and accommodate Muslim, Rastafarian, Christian and other men whose grooming practices it found objectionable. The EEOC said the Atlanta-based company forbids male supervisors, as well as male employees including drivers who deal face-to-face with customers, from wearing beards or growing their hair below collar length. While UPS has faced individual lawsuits alleging religious bias, the EEOC said Wednesday’s lawsuit is its first alleging a systemic, nationwide problem that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. “No one in this country should have to choose between a job and their religious beliefs and practices,” said EEOC lawyer Elizabeth Fox-Solomon in an interview. “UPS has persistently failed to accommodate its employees and job applicants.” The lawsuit offered several examples of UPS’ alleged bias. It said a UPS hiring official told Bilal Abdullah, a Muslim, that “God would understand” if he shaved his beard to get a driver helper job in Rochester, New York in 2005, and could instead seek a package handler job that required no customer contact. UPS hired him for neither position. The EEOC also said a Rastafarian part-time load supervisor in Fort Lauderdale, Florida was told by his manager to cut his dreadlocks because he “didn’t want any employees looking like women” on his management team. UPS defended its practices. “UPS respects religious differences and is confident in the legality of its employment practices,” spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said. “The company will review this case, and defend its practices that demonstrate a proven track record for accommodation.” The lawsuit was filed after the U.S. Supreme Court on June 1 revived a discrimination lawsuit accusing Abercrombie & Fitch Inc of refusing to hire a Muslim woman for a store sales job because she wore a head scarf. Abercrombie claimed that the scarf did not comply with its dress code, but the court said the clothing retailer may have been motivated by a desire not to accommodate the woman’s religion.

333,UPS,UPS second-quarter profit tops estimates; sees sluggish U.S. economy,"(Reuters) - Package delivery company UPS (UPS.N) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit on improved margins, and said U.S. economic growth was being hampered by a strong dollar and an expected interest rate hike. Shares in Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc rose more than 2 percent.  “The continued strength of the U.S. dollar and I think this impending rate hike by the Fed appears to be holding back some U.S. growth,” Chief Executive Officer David Abney said on a conference call.  Abney said UPS remained “a little bit cautious about the U.S. economy.” Like main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), UPS is often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic health. An interest rate hike is widely expected this year. UPS revenue fell 1.2 percent from a year ago to about $14.1 billion in the quarter. UPS said the strong U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharges hurt growth. When reporting quarterly results in June, Memphis-based FedEx said lower fuel surcharges had cut into revenue. UPS reported second-quarter net income of $1.23 billion, or $1.35 per share, up nearly 10 percent from $1.12 billion, or $1.21, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings per share of $1.26. The company forecast full-year 2015 earnings per share in a range from $5.05 to $5.30, unchanged from April, though the company added that it would be at the high end of its outlook. Analysts, on average, expect full-year earnings per share of $5.19. Despite the second-quarter earnings beat, analysts and investors were waiting to see how the company performs in the fourth-quarter holiday season. In 2014 the company overspent for package volumes that failed to materialize after underestimating demand in 2013, when hundreds of thousands of packages were stranded on Christmas Eve. “UPS must still focus on overcoming the previous year’s problems in peak shipping to hit their (earnings) targets for the year,” Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker wrote in a client note. Volume growth and price increases boosted margins at its international package business.

Coyote Logistics connects customers to its network of more than 35,000 trucking operators in North America and caters to the food and beverage, consumer goods, paper and packaging, industrial as well as retail markets. Brokers such as Coyote Logistics and XPO Logistics Inc (XPO.N) have reported rapid revenue growth in the past few quarters as the demand for trucks jumped due to widespread bottlenecks on rail networks. “This deal shouldn’t move the needle at UPS, but could support shares of smaller brokers near-term by driving further consolidation speculation,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Bascome Majors wrote in a note on July 22, when Bloomberg reported of a possible UPS-Coyote Logistics deal. The U.S. freight market is estimated to be worth $300 billion, with full-truckload shipping accounting for just over half of that, according to logistics company G-Force Shipping. Third-party logistics providers have recently been snapped up in a series of deals, including XPO Logistics’ purchase of France-based Norbert Dentressangle SA and Goldman Sachs’ (GS.N) acquisition of Neovia Logistics LLC. PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a recent report it was optimistic about the M&A; outlook for the U.S. transportation and logistics industry this year.  “The brokered full-truckload freight segment is a high growth market and we expect it will continue to outpace other transportation segments,” UPS Chief Executive David Abney said. UPS, whose full-truckload business is smaller than its less-than-truckload services, said on Friday it has worked with Coyote Logistics in the past to add capacity during peak holiday shipping seasons. Chicago-based Coyote Logistics, which reported revenue of $2.1 billion last year, is the sixth-largest U.S. truckload services provider, according to research firm Armstrong & Associates Inc. C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc (CHRW.O) is the largest, followed by XPO Logistics. UPS said it expects the deal to close within 30 days and add to its earnings in 2016. The company’s shares rose 1.2 percent to $102.63 in morning trading on Friday. BofA Merrill Lynch and UBS were financial advisers to UPS, while Goldman Sachs & Co, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities advised Coyote.

(pwc.to/1MXwNwv) “The brokered full-truckload freight segment is a high growth market and we expect it will continue to outpace other transportation segments,” UPS Chief Executive David Abney said. UPS, whose full-truckload business is smaller than its less-than-truckload services, said on Friday it has worked with Coyote Logistics in the past to add capacity during peak holiday shipping seasons. Chicago-based Coyote Logistics, which reported revenue of $2.1 billion last year, is the sixth-largest U.S. truckload services provider, according to research firm Armstrong & Associates Inc. C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc is the largest, followed by XPO Logistics. UPS said it expects the deal to close within 30 days and add to its earnings in 2016. The company’s shares rose 1.2 percent to $102.63 in morning trading on Friday. BofA Merrill Lynch and UBS were financial advisers to UPS, while Goldman Sachs & Co, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities advised Coyote.

339,UPS,France's Geodis nears $800 mln deal for OHL -sources,"Aug 14 (Reuters) - French shipping and transit company Geodis SA is near a deal to pay close to $800 million for U.S. contract shipping provider Ozburn-Hessey Logistics, LLC in what would be the latest in a string of logistics tie-ups this year, people familiar with the deal said. Private equity firms Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Hyde Park Holdings LLC are selling the U.S. logistics company. The rise of e-commerce has increased companies’ demand for shipping, making logistics companies more valuable. Private equity firms have recently been cashing in on that trend. The price in this deal represents a multiple of about 10 times Ozburn-Hessey Logistics’ $80 million of annual earnings, the people said. The deal is slated to be announced in the coming weeks according to a person familiar with the matter. The people asked not to be named because the deliberations were private. Geodis and Ozburn-Hessey Logistics did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither of the New York-based private equity firms responded to requests for comment. Founded in 1951 and based in Brentwood, Tennessee, Ozburn-Hessey Logistics has more than 120 distribution centers. It has customers in the apparel, electronics, healthcare, food and beverage, and consumer packaged goods industries. Clients include Starbucks Corp, Apple Inc, Red Bull and General Motors Co. In April, France’s Norbert Dentressangle SA agreed to sell itself to Stamford Connecticut-based XPO Logistics Inc  in a deal valued at $3.53 billion, including debt, making XPO one of the top 10 logistics companies in the world. Also in April, FedEx Corp announced a deal to buy Dutch delivery service company TNT Express for 4.4 billion euro ($4.9 billion). FedEx’s main rival, package delivery company, United Parcel Service Inc agreed to pay $1.8 billion for Chicago-based  Coyote Logistics from private equity firm Warburg Pincus to expand its full-truckload services in July.

340,UPS,Union urges UPS pilots to vote on authorizing strike,"(Reuters) - The union representing pilots at package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said it had urged them to vote to authorize a strike.   The Independent Pilots Association said on Wednesday that if the pilots voted in favor of authorizing a strike, its board would have the authority to request a release from federally mediated negotiations with UPS. The National Mediation Board has been mediating since early 2014 in contract negotiations between UPS and its pilots union on issues related to compensation, pension and benefits. Rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and its pilots tentatively agreed last month on an amended collective bargaining agreement after nearly a year of mediation from the National Mediation Board. “UPS has stalled and delayed, unnecessarily prolonging our negotiations,” Independent Pilots Association President Robert Travis said in a statement. “UPS management has created a bitter standoff with its pilot employees.” The contract is under the Railway Labor Act, the U.S. labor law that governs railroads and airlines, and it became amendable towards the end of 2011. If the National Mediation Board grants a release from the mediation, a strike or lockout could follow after a 30-day countdown. UPS said it continued to negotiate “in good faith” for a contract and it was confident that the talks would be completed without disruption in its services. “Despite the (union’s) announcement, there is no real threat of a strike. Such authorization votes are routine during negotiations in the airline industry, but they are legally irrelevant under the Railway Labor Act,” UPS spokesman Mike Mangeot said in an emailed statement. Even if the National Mediation Board grants the union a release from the talks, there are a “series of fail-safes, including presidential and congressional intervention, designed to prevent an interruption in operations,” Mangeot said.

345,UPS,UPS must face New York lawsuit over illegal cigarette shipments,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge said New York State and New York City may pursue a lawsuit accusing United Parcel Service Inc of illegally delivering more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes in the state, depriving them of millions of dollars in taxes. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan rejected UPS’ argument that the lawsuit, which sought more than $181 million of damages and penalties, did not properly allege that it delivered contraband cigarettes to unauthorized recipients, or did so deliberately. “The amended complaint alleges that UPS knowingly delivered enormous quantities of unstamped, untaxed cigarettes to persons throughout the United States, including the State and the City,” Forrest wrote on Wednesday. “That is sufficient.” UPS was accused of having since 2010 illegally shipped unstamped cartons of cigarettes to unlicensed wholesalers, unlicensed retailers and residences, often from smoke shops on Indian reservations within New York. The lawsuit claimed that this violated UPS’ October 2005 agreement with the state not to ship cigarettes to unlicensed dealers and individual consumers. It also alleged violations of the federal Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act, a federal racketeering law, and various state laws. In a statement, UPS said it will continue to defend vigorously against charges it knowingly shipped cigarettes to unlicensed dealers or consumers and “will terminate service when it appears that a shipper is violating UPS policy.” Another Manhattan federal judge, Edgardo Ramos, in March said the state and city may pursue a similar lawsuit against UPS rival FedEx Corp over the shipment of nearly 400,000 cartons of cigarettes. A carton of cigarettes usually contains 10 packs. In seeking a dismissal, UPS had also argued that many of the suspect deliveries may have contained other tobacco products, such as cigars. Forrest, however, said this would not absolve it of liability for delivering unstamped cigarettes. The judge did dismiss claims under the federal Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act, and a state public health law. A spokesman for New York City’s Law Department said the city is pleased that it can pursue its “most significant claims” against UPS, as “part of a comprehensive city effort to halt illegal shipments of cigarettes into the city.” Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said that office is also pleased with the decision, which advances the state’s effort to address “the public health catastrophe caused by cigarette smoking.” The case is New York et al v.

348,UPS,UPS counting on small retailers to save Christmas,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - After two years of disappointing profits from the holiday season, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) is hoping a network of mom-and-pop retailers will help it avoid a third blue Christmas. Investors will be watching closely. The coming weeks will be a referendum on the expansion of UPS’s Access Point network earlier this year to 8,000 locations in 100 cities from a few large test markets.  The network, including 4,400 UPS stores and thousands of small retailers, is meant to give the company’s drivers more places to leave packages for customers to pick up, avoiding multiple delivery attempts.  UPS says it costs three times as much to deliver to a home as to a business.   In densely populated areas, Access Point will “have a dramatic impact” on UPS’s ability to operate during the peak season, said Geoff Light, U.S. president of product development.  UPS is also levying surcharges on packages delivered to homes.  Handling holiday shipping profitably and effectively is critical to UPS, which has delivered underwhelming results for the past two Christmas seasons.  In 2013, a last-minute pre-Christmas surge in e-commerce packages caught the company off-guard, and last year it overestimated demand and hired too many workers. Last year’s fourth-quarter results underscored the hit from residential packages. UPS reported its lowest net income as a percentage of revenue for the quarter since the Great Recession in 2008. With e-commerce activity still unpredictable, it is not certain whether the solution lies in an expanded Access Point network.   It is clear, though, that if the world’s largest package delivery company slips for the third consecutive holiday season, Wall Street will not take it well. “Heads would roll,” said Greg Donaldson, founder of Donaldson Capital Management. Donaldson, whose Evansville, Indiana, firm holds UPS shares, said he was confident the company would do better this year.      Kent Winegar, portfolio manager of Austin, Texas-based asset manager Terry McDaniel & Co, which also owns the stock, stressed the importance of protecting the UPS brand. “They need to ... make sure that every single package gets where it needs to go,” he said. In particular, the quarter is a test for UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney, who was chief operating officer before taking the top post in 2014. If a driver cannot deliver a package in one trip, he or she drops it off at an Access Point for consumers to pick up, executives said. Retailers receive undisclosed “nominal” fees per package. UPS’s Light said tests in markets like New York and Chicago during the 2014 peak were highly successful and that only a “very small number” of retailers since left the network. At Access Point store Fruit Paradise in Chicago, people who collect packages often buy its Mexican ice cream treats and snacks, said owner Gabriela Ortiz. “I’m not going to make money off the packages,” Ortiz said. “This is about getting people to come in and know we are here.” Elizabeth Milito, senior executive counsel at the National Federation of Independent Business, said that while increased foot traffic should help small retailers, they could suffer if it distracts them from their regular customers. And if people are unhappy about waiting for packages, it could hurt the reputation of the company that sold them their goods. David Beets is a case in point. The owner of Dell Cove Spice Co in Chicago was notified in July that a package from a vendor was at a local retailer listed as an Access Point.  During two lengthy visits, the retailer could not find his package. During the third, Beets was told it had been returned to the vendor because he had not picked it up. “If a customer of mine had that kind of experience, they’d never order from me again,” Beets said. John Haber, CEO of logistics management firm Spend Management Experts, said he was looking at how UPS handles e-commerce volumes across its entire network.  Last year, for instance, the company delivered 35 million packages on its peak day, almost double the 2014 daily average of 18 million. “To me, Access Point is just a smokescreen,” Haber said. “The real question is, can they execute through peak season? “If they can’t get it right this year, they’re going to be in the hot seat.” ",10262015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-accesspoint/ups-counting-on-small-retailers-to-save-christmas-idUSKCN0SK2KG20151026

351,UPS,UPS CFO: We're ready for peak season and we will deliver,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - After having difficulties getting its holiday peak season right for the past two years running, this year executives at United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) insist they have a winning formula.  “We are ready for peak season and we will deliver,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz told Reuters. Peretz spoke to Reuters after the world’s largest package delivery company posted a better-than-expected quarterly net profit despite the impact of a strong U.S. dollar.  The company’s CFO said closer collaboration with an increasing number of retailers will allow UPS to better manage demand, and by staggering its seasonal workers it should be able to better manager costs associated with ecommerce packages in the run-up to the holidays. In 2013, a late surge of online packages hit both UPS and main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) leaving an estimated 2 million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve - the majority in UPS’s network. Last year, the company over compensated and spent too much planning for packages that never materialized, hurting fourth-quarter earnings.  As UPS tries to come up with a winning formula for Christmas, it has rolled out a network of small retailers who can hold packages for consumers in busy urban areas. This year UPS said it expects holiday volumes between Black Friday - traditionally the busiest U.S. shopping day of the year - and New Year’s Eve to rise 10 percent to 630 million packages. On its expected peak day of Dec 22, UPS expects to deliver 36 million packages, or double its daily average of 18 million.  Memphis-based FedEx said on Monday it expects volumes to rise 12.4 percent to 317 million packages from Black Friday to Christmas Eve.  Handling rising ecommerce volumes is a challenge for the industry, as UPS says it costs three times as much to deliver to a home as to a business. The National Retail Federation says 2015 online holiday sales could rise up to 8 percent.  UPS CFO Peretz said by working more closely with a larger number of retailers the company will have a clearer picture of pending package volumes, augmented with “some ad hoc decision making.” He said UPS will “help to shape demand” by working with retailers to stagger volumes wherever possible rather than have them all enter its network at the same time.  Peretz also said the 95,000 seasonal workers UPS plans to hire this year will be hired in waves to match the increase in demand as the holidays near.

352,UPS,UPDATE 2-UPS profit tops estimates as dollar weighs on revenue,"(Adds comments, company predictions for peak holiday season) By Nick Carey CHICAGO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, despite its revenue being hurt by the strong U.S. dollar, and reiterated its full-year earnings outlook. During a conference call with analysts, executives at the Atlanta-based company said that package volumes during this year’s key holiday peak season between Thanksgiving and New Year’s should rise 10 percent. UPS said that on Dec. 22, its anticipated peak day, it expects to ship 36 million packages, or around double its daily average. After two years of disappointing fourth-quarter results, UPS is under pressure to deliver this Christmas. Chief Executive David Abney told analysts that thanks to additional capacity in its network and selective price increases to “provide excellent service at an appropriate cost.” The world’s largest package delivery company is often seen as a barometer of U.S. economic health. Abney said the company has seen some softness in the U.S. economy and that the strength of the U.S. dollar would continue to impact exports, as would soft global demand. UPS said that without the impact of the U.S. currency on its results, third-quarter revenue would have been up for the quarter. UPS also said that lower fuel surcharge revenue had weighed on results. UPS reported third-quarter net profit of $1.26 billion, or $1.39 per share, up 4 percent from $1.21 billion, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings per share of $1.37. UPS said that it expects full-year earnings per share to come in at the high end of its previously-announced forecast of a range from $5.05 to $5.30. The company said earnings per share should rise in the “low double digits” in the fourth quarter versus the previous year. Revenue for the quarter fell slightly to $14.24 billion from $14.29 a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue for the quarter of $14.43 billion. The company said on a currency-neutral basis, its revenue would have been up 1.8 percent. The strong U.S. dollar means that sales overseas are lower when translated into dollars. In pre-market trading, UPS shares were down 3 percent at $103.

354,UPS,U.S. seek N.Y. lawyer's conviction over Maxim magazine deal fraud,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York lawyer “lied over and over” to lenders and others to help a felon fraudulently raise money to buy Maxim magazine, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Wednesday at the close of a trial. As part of the scheme, lawyer Harvey Newkirk assisted convicted con man Calvin Darden Jr in impersonating his father, a retired senior executive with United Parcel Service Inc, to secure financing for the $31 million deal, prosecutor Sarah Paul said in Manhattan federal court. In her closing argument, Paul asked jurors to reject claims that Newkirk, formerly a counsel at the law firm Bryan Cave LLP,  was oblivious to the fraud or Darden’s impersonation of his father, Calvin Darden Sr. “The defendant was not a dupe or a victim,” she said. “Instead, he knew what Junior was doing.” Priya Chaudhry, Newkirk’s lawyer, countered that her client had fallen prey to Darden, a “master con artist.” She said Newkirk was an “innocent man caught in a Greek tragedy” involving the father and son, who were seeking to pin blame on Newkirk to minimize the elder’s liability to lenders and the younger’s potential sentence. “Like the other victims, Junior ran his con on Harvey too,” Chaudhry said. Newkirk, 39, was charged in April with wire fraud and other offenses, five months after Darden pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges related to the deal to buy the men’s magazine. Prosecutors said Darden and Newkirk provided fake bank account statements and emails to lenders to borrow more than $8 million and were attempting to secure a further $20 million to buy Maxim. Newkirk also allegedly helped Darden forge documents saying Calvin Darden Sr, a board member at Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc and Target Corp and ex-senior vice president for operations at UPS, would provide collateral. The scheme led to the 2013 announcement that Maxim’s then-owner, Alpha Media Group Inc [QUADGM.UL], partly owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP [CBS.UL], would sell the magazine to a company headed by the elder Darden. The $31 million deal did not go through and Alpha Media eventually sold Maxim to Biglari Holdings Inc.

358,UPS,FEATURE-Online holiday package tsunami swamping U.S. apartment buildings,"WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - As the holiday shopping season peaks, U.S. apartment complexes are being flooded with packages, from HD televisions to children’s scooters, inundating lobbies and forcing building managers to take measures to extremes. With online shopping expected to reach a record this year, overwhelmed property managers are starting to put a cap on the size of the boxes they will accept, installing storage lockers or banning deliveries outright. Online purchases have spiked during this holiday season, with Americans buying $3.07 billion of goods on “Cyber Monday,” the first workday after the Thanksgiving holiday, a 16 percent increase year on year, according to the Adobe Digital Index Report. The Boston House, a 1950s-era apartment building in Washington that saw package deliveries grow from a couple of dozen to hundreds a week in a few years, has limited the size of boxes, said Liz Cullison, the building’s general manager. “The packages got larger and larger and larger,” Cullison said. “That all overflowed out into the lobby. Now the lobby is overrun with packages.” Apartment buildings and complexes, home to about one in eight Americans, are being buffeted by the surge in online U.S. retail sales, which rose on an adjusted basis to $87.5 billion in the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. Apartment managers “are looking at the future, and they are only seeing more packages,” said Rick Haughey, vice president of industry technology initiatives at the National Multifamily Housing Council, an industry group. “You’ve got old systems in place that don’t really reflect the structural changes that we’ve seen in retail,” he said. The number of U.S. packages shipped is soaring in tandem with online sales. United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx Corp  and the U.S. Postal Service all estimate an increase in the low double digits this year, in part because of one extra day in the holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas. UPS is forecasting 630 million deliveries during the holiday  season, up 43 percent from 2010. Deliveries for all carriers are expected to peak around Dec. 21, four days before Christmas. Boston House, where staff were already coping with deliveries of beds, furniture and other bulky items, reached its breaking point when a tenant who was moving across the country had his possessions delivered by UPS, with 40 of the carrier’s biggest boxes piling up in the lobby, Cullison said. The building has limited the size of packages it will accept to 70 pounds (32 kg) and 120 inches (3.05 meters) in length and girth combined. It also has set up an overflow storage room in its basement, Cullison said. A 2014 survey of 2,768 apartment managers by the National Multifamily Housing Council found that the typical building or complex receives up to 100 packages a week and they take up to five hours a week of staff time to handle. Jose Vega, the assistant director of the 424-unit Elan City Lights, a Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC complex in Dallas, said packages were a significant burden on staff, especially during holidays. “It’s extremely time-consuming just because (of) the quantity,” he said. “The age that we live in, you know, folks prefer to shop online and have something come to their front door.” Fed up with packages flooding its offices, Camden Property Trust, the 13th-biggest U.S. apartment owner, decided this year to refuse deliveries at its front desks. Carriers now must deliver to the customer’s door. “We think this is a better customer service experience and the right decision long term,” Julie Keel, a Camden marketing director, said in an email.

359,UPS,"Third time's a charm for UPS at Christmas, but FedEx stumbles","CHICAGO (Reuters) - After two consecutive years of problems during its holiday peak package season, UPS delivered on time at Christmas this year while its main rival FedEx had a last-minute stumble that left some gifts undelivered until after the holiday. “It seems like the third time’s a charm for UPS,” said Kent Winegar, portfolio manager at Austin, Texas-based Terry McDaniel & Co, which manages assets of around $900 million and holds nearly $15 million in UPS stock. “But if e-commerce keeps growing at such a rapid rate we’ll see how they do next year.” A late surge in e-commerce orders and bad weather in 2013 left an estimated 2 million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve, mostly stranded in Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc’s (UPS.N) package network. Arch rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) experienced problems on a smaller scale.    Last year, UPS spent $500 million, boosted seasonal hiring and worked with retailers to forecast package volumes that failed to materialize and overspending hurt fourth-quarter earnings. FedEx did not experience problems that year. This year UPS focused on what spokesman Steve Gaut described as a “disciplined approach” to peak season, that included pulling delivery dates forward on days when it had excess capacity in its network and informing retailers of hard cutoff dates for packages to make it by Christmas using UPS’ cheaper ground delivery service.  As a result, many retailers informed customers free shipping would end the week before Christmas - as shipping by air would be too expensive. Noelle Sadler, chief marketing officer at online clothing retailer LuLu’s, said the firm stopped free shipping over a week before the holidays because it was “hamstrung by UPS and have to follow their rules.”  UPS network was snarled up for about a week after Black Friday particularly in California, Texas and the Northeast, but focused its resources to catch up, spokesman Gaut said.  In the week running up to Dec. 24, UPS had an on-time delivery rate of between 97 percent and 98 percent, he said. The company’s on-time rate on a normal day, when daily package volumes are around half those during peak, is between 98 percent and 99 percent.  FedEx, on the other hand, struggled and said in a statement this was because of a “surge of last-minute e-commerce shipments.”   The company said late packages were delivered Dec. 26, but did not provide any details on the number of packages that were late or in what parts of the United States.

361,UPS,"UPS profit jumps on better margins, gives robust outlook","CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on Tuesday reported a significantly higher quarterly net profit on a strong performance during the crucial holiday season and gave a solid 2016 earnings outlook despite warning of uncertain economic conditions. The company’s shares rose 1.6 percent in early trading to $95.60. Often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, UPS showed improved margins in all three of its business units.  The Atlanta-based company was under pressure to deliver in the fourth quarter after two disappointing peak seasons in a row. In 2013, UPS was caught by a late surge in e-commerce packages, leaving many stranded on Christmas Eve. In 2014, the company overspent for a package surge that did not materialize.  In the run-up to Christmas 2015, UPS worked to manage package flows, but to control its costs it also made clear to retail customers that if they missed key deadlines ahead of the holiday for ground deliveries, they would be charged more for moving those packages by air.  UPS posted fourth-quarter net income of $1.33 billion or $1.48 per share, nearly triple the $453 million or 49 cents per share it reported a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.42. Revenue in the quarter rose 1 percent to $16.1 billion from $15.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of nearly $16.3 billion. Excluding a $79 million non-cash, after-tax, mark-to-market pension charge, UPS reported earnings per share for the quarter of $1.57. Revenue at the company’s core U.S. domestic package service rose 2.6 percent to $10.3 billion. Average daily shipments rose 2.4 percent on strong demand in the quarter from online retailers. Packages sent by air saw double-digit growth. The company’s international package unit was more profitable in the quarter, thanks largely to a strong performance in Europe. “Disciplined pricing, favorable customer and product mix, combined with improved operational performance” to boost profitability, the company said.  UPS said it expects full-year earnings per share for 2016 between $5.70 and $5.90. Analysts predicted earnings per share for the year of $5.73. “While we face uncertain macro-economic conditions, we are continuing to invest for profitable growth,” chief financial officer Richard Peretz said in a statement.

362,UPS,"Online sales, internal fixes to lift UPS despite U.S. economy: CFO","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Despite signs of slowing growth and increasing pessimism from many in the corporate world about where the U.S. economy is headed, package delivery company UPS should continue to see growth in 2016 thanks to rising e-commerce sales and a continued focus on improving operations, a top executive said on Tuesday. “If you look at most economic forecasts ... they’ve come down from October to January,” United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) chief financial officer Richard Peretz said in a phone interview. “But online sales are still growing very substantially, so there’s a lot of runway there and we think that’s one of the things that fits our model very well.” “That moves us away from what’s happening out in the broader macroeconomic environment,” he added.  U.S. retail ecommerce sales reached $340.61 billion in 2015, up 14.2 percent from 2014, research firm eMarketer estimates.  Peretz spoke after Atlanta-based UPS posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, boosted by e-commerce sales and improving margins as the company worked to smooth out network problems of the previous two peak holiday seasons. The prospects for the U.S. economy are unclear. Some areas are already struggling. U.S. railroads are talking loudly of a freight recession, driven primarily by plunging commodity prices. There have also been warnings that North American manufacturers face a possible industrial recession. But Peretz said UPS will build on its efforts to get its peak holiday season spending and package flows under control during the critical yet wildly unpredictable run-up to Christmas. On their busiest days, package volumes at UPS and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) tend to be double the average day and both companies have sought ways to better anticipate and manage spikes in traffic.  “What we learned (in the fourth quarter) was no one’s going to be a perfect forecaster,” Peretz said. “Let’s face it, when you decide to get online and buy, is when you decide to get online and buy.” UPS spoke to retail customers “early and often” in 2015 and throughout peak season, pulling packages into its network sooner from retailers when it had extra capacity to avoid clogging the works. The company is now upgrading parts of its network for future volumes, which Peretz said would build on the company’s performance improvements in 2015. “Even if growth isn’t quite as strong on the industrial production side,” Peretz said, “we make up the economics, if you will, from the initiatives inside UPS.” ",2022016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-economy/online-sales-internal-fixes-to-lift-ups-despite-u-s-economy-cfo-idUSKCN0VB1X0

Deliv is an Uber-like startup that uses a fleet of contract drivers, thus avoiding healthcare and other costs, to pick up online orders from stores and malls for a fee.  The company has raised $40.5 million from investors including Upfront Ventures, RPM Ventures and mall operators like General Growth Properties.  The company is in 100 U.S. cities and handles last-mile delivery for malls and retailers like Macy’s Inc, Kohl’s Corp and Best Buy Co Inc.  “We are solving a different problem in the last mile,” Deliv Chief Executive Daphne Carmeli said in a phone interview, “and they (UPS) are looking to learn that model and looking to learn about growth in same-day delivery as we are interested to learn from their success.”  Traditional retailers use Deliv’s crowdsourced same-day delivery services as part of a strategy referred to as “omnichannel.” That means retailers increasingly see stores also as distribution centers for e-commerce sales to local customers.  That allows traditional retailers to compete with the likes of Amazon, which is pushing faster same-day delivery services through its Prime Now package. Satish Jindel, a logistics consultant and president of SJ Consulting Group, described it as a “smart move” for UPS. “For what is a few nickels and dimes for them, they get to see how this model works, and if there’s any validity to it they can apply it in their own business,” Jindel said. “But for Deliv, this is like letting the fox in the henhouse by allowing UPS to see how their model works.”  ",2242016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-deliv/with-deliv-investment-ups-hopes-to-study-same-day-delivery-market-idUSKCN0VX2U4

367,UPS,UPDATE 3-Amazon to start air delivery network with leasing deal,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States. The deal comes at a time when the world’s biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders. Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year. In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders. But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies. “This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,” RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note. UPS, the world’s No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent. FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer. “We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,” said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.  The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email. Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service. The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said. As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG’s stock over five years at $9.73 per share. ATSG’s stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

368,UPS,UPS expands alternative fuels momentum with $100 million CNG investment,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on Tuesday announced a $100 million plan to buy hundreds of new trucks that will run on compressed natural gas, saying it did not want to lose momentum on alternative fuels even though diesel prices have tanked. The new program will fund 12 CNG fueling stations and add 380 CNG heavy duty trucks to the package delivery company’s fleet. The announcement comes as a sharp slide in the price of crude oil has hampered demand for alternative transportation fuels such as CNG. UPS said it has been encouraged by cost and technological improvements in natural gas vehicles in recent years, and did not want those advances to be shelved. “We’d like to see the momentum continue,” Mike Casteel, UPS’ director of fleet procurement, said in an interview. “As long as we are able to do this and still have it be economically feasible, we’re going to do it. If you have to stop and start again, it will be that much more difficult.”  Although the price of diesel fuel has dropped nearly 30 percent in the last year, CNG prices have been relatively stable and are still slightly lower than diesel. Diesel fuel averaged $2.23 a gallon in January, compared with $2.09 per gallon of gas equivalent of CNG, according to data from the U.S. Department of Energy. Natural gas futures NGc1 have fallen a quarter since January, while diesel futures HOc1 have risen 40 percent in the same period. Because UPS owns its own stations, its CNG costs are substantially lower than public pump prices, Casteel said. UPS said the CNG stations will be built by TruStar Energy of White Plains, New York, and the truck tractors will be supplied by Kenworth, a division of PACCAR Inc. (PCAR.O) UPS has steadily been increasing its use of alternative fuel vehicles, which now make up 6 percent of its 100,000-vehicle global fleet. Tuesday’s announcement came after UPS made an even larger expansion of its CNG fleet, adding about 1,400 vehicles and 15 fueling stations in 2015.

374,UPS,UPS asks EU court to annul EU veto of its 2013 TNT bid,"* Rare opportunity for EU court to rule on EU M&A; principles * UPS says EU antitrust regulators made manifest errors By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, April 6 - Thwarted in its bid to acquire Dutch peer TNT three years ago, U.S. package delivery company UPS took its case to court on Wednesday, asking judges to overturn the EU veto because of “manifest errors” made by antitrust regulators. While TNT has since moved on with its tie-up with FedEx , the UPS challenge is important because it allows Europe’s second-highest court to rule on key merger principles that could affect other problematic deals. The world’s biggest package delivery company wanted to expand its presence in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets through the 5.2-billion-euro ($5.90 billion) deal. But the takeover was blocked by the European Commission because it said UPS had not offered sufficient concessions to fend off competition concerns. The EU competition enforcer in January this year cleared the FedEx and TNT deal without setting any conditions. The Commission’s decision is riddled with mistakes and weak legal arguments, UPS is expected to tell the Luxembourg-based General Court. “The Commission committed an error of law and a manifest error of assessment when examining the likely price effects of the concentration,” the company said, according to a filing in the Commission’s Official Journal. “By setting an arbitrary standard for verifiability of efficiencies, the Commission erred in law and diverged from the standard set by the case law.” UPS also accused the Commission of not giving it access to relevant and exculpatory evidence. Such merger appeals are rare, said Tobias Caspary, a partner at London-based Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. “The merger would have resulted in a 4 to 3 (major industry players) scenario that often attracts substantial scrutiny by the EC (Commission). Interestingly, TNT’s subsequent acquisition by FedEx was cleared unconditionally. Comparing these two scenarios offers an interesting insight into which cases fall across the prohibition line and which don’t,” he said. The court is expected to rule in the coming months. The case is T-194/13 United Parcel Service v Commission. ",4062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/ups-tnt-eu-court/ups-asks-eu-court-to-annul-eu-veto-of-its-2013-tnt-bid-idUSL5N17925Y
375,UPS,Ecommerce gives UPS profit a lift despite mixed U.S. economy,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, as rising U.S. ecommerce and cost cutting helped the package delivery company shrug off a mixed economy and reiterate its full-year 2016 earnings outlook. But executives said that if the U.S. government approves a pension fund’s proposed benefit cuts for participants, UPS would have to record a charge of up to $3.8 billion this year. Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz told Reuters “not only is ecommerce helping our volumes” but services that UPS has introduced to manage residential deliveries have boosted package density and boosted labor productivity. Those are “important reasons we’re winning and expanding margins,” he said. Ecommerce poses a conundrum for package delivery firms because it costs more to deliver often just a single box to a home. Finding ways to bunch up deliveries reduces costs.  The Atlanta-based company said ecommerce pushed first-quarter revenue at the company’s crucial U.S. domestic business up 3.1 percent, while the cost per package fell 1.9 percent. “We see underlying demand as strong and think UPS did a good job controlling costs and getting improved revenue yields,” S&P; Global Market Intelligence equity analyst Jim Corridore wrote in a research note. Like its main rival, FedEx Corp (FDX.N), UPS is seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity. The world’s largest package delivery company also boosted profitability at its international package business, but revenue fell slightly because of the strong U.S. dollar.  Revenue at UPS’ supply chain and freight was up 10 percent, due mostly to its acquisition of Chicago-based truck broker Coyote Logistics in 2015.  The company reiterated its full-year earnings outlook of between $5.70 and $5.90 per share in 2016. Analysts on average expected full-year 2016 earnings per share of $5.78. Executives said UPS is challenging a plan by the Central States Pension Fund to cut benefits to its participants, including some UPS employees. UPS does not believe the proposed reduction complies with the law. CFO Peretz told analysts that if the government approves the proposed Central States pension reduction, UPS would have to record a charge of between $3.2 billion and $3.8 billion later this year.  UPS posted first-quarter net income of $1.13 billion or $1.27 per share, up 10 percent from $1.03 billion or $1.12 per share a year earlier.  Analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.22.  In trading UPS shares were down 15 cents at $106.31.

Concerns were rife last year that China’s economy was stalling after decades of roaring growth. Many western companies operating there insist growth would remain robust as the country’s rising middle class gradually replaces exports as an engine of economic growth. “It’s kind of stabilized to where we have a comfort level with the growth rate and what it’s going to do,” Peretz said after UPS, often seen as a U.S. economic bellwether, posted first-quarter net profit that beat expectations.

Deutsche Post AG’s (DPWGn.DE) is the market leader in Europe. Peretz said UPS is concerned that Britain’s possible exit from the European Union, often abbreviated to Brexit, would create confusion over the country’s import and export laws and basic functions such as how to clear customers. British voters will vote on the issue in a June 23 referendum. “If Britain exits it could create some barriers to trade. It could slow things down,” Peretz said. “The UK would have a tremendous amount of treaties that they’re going to have to negotiate,” he added. “We do feel the EU is a stronger bloc with the UK as a full member.” He added that a Brexit would likely bring back trade barriers plus customs and other fees not seen since the 1990s, noting that the EU made trading within the bloc easier.

399,UPS,Rising revenue boosts UPS profit; 2016 forecast confirmed,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported a higher quarterly net profit on Friday that met analyst expectations as revenue grew across its business units, and the company reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook despite global economic uncertainty. Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters UPS is adding capacity to its network and will work more closely with retailers ahead of this year’s crucial holiday peak season.  The company had put in a solid a performance during the 2015 peak season after two years of struggling to handle holiday demand and the costs associated with it. “We think it’s going to be a repeat of last year,” Abney said. “We just have more tools in our toolbox this year.” Often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, UPS revenue at its core U.S. domestic package business rose 2.4 percent on the year to just over $9 billion. Lower fuel costs and technology improvements helped UPS cut costs by 0.2 percent per package in the second quarter. Like other package delivery companies, UPS has benefited from a rapid rise in ecommerce, but has also struggled to bring down the extra costs associated with making stops at individual residential addresses rather than at businesses.  UPS, a long-standing proponent of free trade, reiterated concerns over anti-trade rhetoric in this year’s U.S. presidential election, arguing that U.S. businesses benefit from trade deals. “It’s not big companies that benefit; small and medium-sized enterprises need to compete and trade deals can make all the difference in the world to them,” Abney told Reuters. UPS said second-quarter margins at its more lucrative international package business were boosted by volume growth, strong pricing and improved network efficiency gains.  The package delivery company posted second-quarter net income of $1.27 billion, or $1.43 per share, up more than 3 percent from $1.23 billion, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts had, on average, expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.43.  Total revenue grew nearly 4 percent to $14.63 billion, from $14.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Analysts expected quarterly revenue of $14.62 billion.  UPS reiterated its 2016 full-year profit outlook, expecting  earnings per share in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. The company was optimistic of meeting that target despite continued softening of the U.S. economy, thanks to investments in improving network efficiency. UPS shares were down 1 percent at $107.69 in morning trading. ",7292016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-results/rising-revenue-boosts-ups-profit-2016-forecast-confirmed-idUSKCN1091EA

403,UPS,"REFILE-Spanish competition watchdog probes FedEx, UPS, DHL, Royal Mail","(Repeats to drop extraneous word from headline) Aug 5 (Reuters) - Spain’s competition watchdog said it was investigating logistics companies including United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx Corp, Deutsche Post’s DHL Group and Britain’s Royal Mail Plc for possible anti-competitive practices. The investigation, which is looking into practices that include forging pacts to not poach each others’ clients, could last 18 months and end in fines, the National Commission Markets and Competition (CNMC) said in a statement on Friday. The CNMC said its investigation was directed at the Spanish units of the international logistics companies. Royal Mail said in a statement that its GLS unit was under investigation, but did not elaborate on the allegations. FedEx said in an emailed statement that it has been notified by Spanish authorities of the investigation, but did not provide details. A UPS spokeswoman said the company was aware of the investigation but had no comment. Reuters was not immediately able to reach a Deutsche Post representative for comment, while DHL did not immediately respond to an emailed request. Royal Mail said it did not expect any fine to be material, based on the allegations and GLS’s annual turnover. “We have completed a compliance review of the GLS Group and we are not aware of any other matter which could be the subject of any other investigation by a relevant competition law authority,” Royal Mail said. Royal Mail agreed with the French competition authority in December to pay 40.2 million pounds (then $60.9 million) to settle a breach of antitrust laws by its French unit.

412,UPS,"UPS plans peak season hiring of 95,000 for third year straight","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Wednesday it plans to hire around 95,000 seasonal employees for its crucial peak holiday season this year, unchanged from the past two years as improvements to its network should help it handle rising ecommerce volumes. “We’re always looking for how we can improve efficiencies as a whole, and in doing that we tend to need less people in the long run,” UPS global director of recruitment strategies Paul Tanguay told Reuters. “So the flat number is not reflective of the volumes we have coming in.” Investors will be watching Atlanta-based UPS this peak season and will expect a repeat of last year’s solid performance following bad years in 2013 and 2014.  In 2013, the company was caught off guard by a last-minute surge in ecommerce packages. In 2014, UPS invested heavily for a wave of packages that failed to materialize.  Last year, the company worked closely with retailers to manage package flows and deliver a well-received peak season performance.  Peak season begins on Black Friday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday in November, and runs through to early January when there is a large wave of returns by package after Christmas. FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the main rival of UPS, has not yet announced its seasonal hiring numbers.  Most UPS seasonal employees tend to be drivers or package handlers. Tanguay said that over the past few years an average of 37 percent of seasonal hires becomes full-time employees.

414,UPS,"Sensing threat, UPS plans to expand its 3D printing operations","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - United Parcel Service plans to expand its 3D printing service to Asia and Europe, the U.S. shipping company has told Reuters, in a bid to fully embrace and get ahead of a trend that threatens to eat away a small but lucrative part of its business.  Aside from its main package delivery service, UPS gets an undisclosed portion of its revenue from storing and shipping parts for manufacturers. If those customers were to switch to 3D printing their own parts, that business would face a drastic reduction. To counter that threat, UPS has chosen to get on board the 3D revolution, and is now looking to offer a service in which UPS will print out plastic parts - anything from nozzles to brackets to prototype soap dispensers or multi-faceted moving parts - around the world and deliver them. “3D printing is a great opportunity for us, but it’s also a threat,” Alan Amling, UPS vice president for corporate strategy, told Reuters. The dynamic - welcoming rather than fighting a threatening new technology - is not unlike automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG teaming up with ride-hailing services Uber and Gett, respectively. Amling said UPS is looking at either Singapore or Japan for an Asian 3D printing factory. He did not say where the company might open a European facility, though UPS’s operational hub in Europe is in Cologne, Germany. UPS has already got into the business in its home market. In May, it launched a U.S.-based 3D printing service with Fast Radius, a 3D printing company based outside Atlanta, where UPS is headquartered. UPS bought an unspecified stake in Fast Radius, which has a 3D printing factory at UPS’s Louisville, Kentucky, hub.  There are also now 3D printers at 60 UPS stores in the United States that print parts using industrial grade thermoplastics. Customers can upload images for printing at the Fast Radius factory or at one of those UPS stores and have the printed products shipped to any location. A 3D printer works by laying down successive levels of material, mostly plastics at this point, to create an object. Quality printers that make metal parts cost over $500,000, while printers that use thermoplastics can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Prices are expected to come down as the technology advances. While 3D printing is still slow compared to high-speed production lines, the technology has progressed so it can be used effectively for prototypes or some components that are not needed in high volumes. Larger firms such as General Electric Co are incorporating 3D-printed parts into production. That progress is a mixed blessing for UPS. As the cost of 3D printers drops and processes improve, that could undermine UPS’s efforts to develop 3D printing as a service - because customers could buy just buy their own printers. “Why wait a day for a part to arrive (from UPS) when you’ll be able to innovate six times a day on your own?” said Richard D’Aveni, a professor of strategy at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. What Fast Radius calls its “digital manufacturing factory” is a quiet operation occupying space in a corner of the UPS building in Louisville, without any of the grime, noise or bustle associated with a standard factory.  Instead, a handful of machines work noiselessly, printing parts of varying sizes and shapes. During a recent visit to the operation by Reuters, Fast Radius CEO Rick Smith said that because of 3D printing, manufacturing is about to transform from “being about where it’s made to where it’s needed.”  One of the printers was close to completing a black plastic prototype hydraulic pump for a manufacturing customer in Germany - a process that takes about 72 hours. Smith said the job illustrates the need for UPS to expand its service beyond the United States.       Another customer, action camera maker GoPro Inc, is making use of Fast Radius’ printers, coupled with UPS’s ability to deliver a prototype the next day. Previously, if GoPro wanted to try out new designs, it would take weeks or even months to make a mock-up, senior GoPro product designer Ryan Harrison said. Now the company can innovate much quicker. “3D printing allows you to fail quicker or to stumble on moments of genius,” Harrison said.    UPS does not break out how much it makes from its supply chain services, including warehouse storage. But in 2015 it reported about $6 billion in “forwarding and logistics” revenue, or about 10 percent of its total sales. An unknown portion of that came from its warehousing operations. UPS’s biggest rival, FedEx Corp, is less focused on supply-chain services and has not dipped into 3D printing. But  if UPS succeeds, analysts said, FedEx could follow suit. The company declined to comment on 3D printing.   German competitor DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG, issued a report earlier this year warning the technology could upend traditional mass-production manufacturing, in which goods are shipped around the world.  UPS’s foray into 3D printing is not its first experiment in other disruptive industries. In October 2015, it invested in drone maker CyPhy Works, and this February bought a stake in same-day delivery company Deliv - in both instances to understand and harness potentially industry-shaking technologies. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said while 3D printing has not yet proved itself on a mass scale, it makes sense for UPS to incorporate a technology “that could supplement or replace its services.” ",9162016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-united-parcel-3dprint/sensing-threat-ups-plans-to-expand-its-3d-printing-operations-idUSKCN11M2AL

416,UPS,New York seeks $872 mln from UPS in cigarette shipments trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state and city authorities took United Parcel Service Inc to trial on Monday, urging a federal judge to make the company pay more than $872 million for making illegal deliveries of more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes. The non-jury trial before a federal judge in Manhattan came in a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and New York City as part of the state’s ongoing efforts to combat smuggling of cigarettes from lower-tax areas. Lilia Toson, a lawyer for the city, told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in her opening statement that UPS repeatedly ignored red flags that many of its shipments from American Indian reservations contained untaxed cartons of cigarettes. “The evidence will show a sufficiently large number of contraband shipments to suggest that UPS is turning a blind eye,” Toson said. She urged the judge to appoint a monitor to ensure UPS’s compliance with the law, and argued the world’s largest package delivery company should be forced to pay over $872 million in penalties and damages. The size of the potential penalties appeared to catch UPS’s lawyers off-guard. Carrie Cohen, an attorney for UPS, complained the state had given it no notice that was the potential figure, having only previously said damages could be $180 million. Cohen urged Forrest to reject the state and city’s “misleading” allegations, as the evidence would should it complied with the law and that authorities had mistaken cartons of legally shippable “little cigars” as cigarettes. “The plaintiffs’ case is devoid of evidence that UPS knew it was delivering cigarettes,” she said. Filed in February 2015, the lawsuit contends that since 2010, UPS illegally shipped over 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes mostly from smoke shops situated on Indian reservations throughout New York state. The deliveries to residences, unlicensed wholesalers and unlicensed retailers were made despite a 2005 agreement between UPS and New York in which the company agreed to stop cigarette shipments to consumers and unlicensed dealers, the lawsuit said.

417,UPS,New York seeks $872 million from UPS in cigarette shipments trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state and city authorities took United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to trial on Monday, urging a federal judge to make the company pay more than $872 million for making illegal deliveries of more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes. The non-jury trial before a federal judge in Manhattan came in a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and New York City as part of the state’s ongoing efforts to combat smuggling of cigarettes from lower-tax areas. Lilia Toson, a lawyer for the city, told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in her opening statement that UPS repeatedly ignored red flags that many of its shipments from American Indian reservations contained untaxed cartons of cigarettes. “The evidence will show a sufficiently large number of contraband shipments to suggest that UPS is turning a blind eye,” Toson said. She urged the judge to appoint a monitor to ensure UPS’s compliance with the law, and argued the world’s largest package delivery company should be forced to pay over $872 million in penalties and damages. The size of the potential penalties appeared to catch UPS’s lawyers off-guard. Carrie Cohen, an attorney for UPS, complained the state had given it no notice that was the potential figure, having only previously said damages could be $180 million. Cohen urged Forrest to reject the state and city’s “misleading” allegations, as the evidence would should it complied with the law and that authorities had mistaken cartons of legally shippable “little cigars” as cigarettes. “The plaintiffs’ case is devoid of evidence that UPS knew it was delivering cigarettes,” she said. Filed in February 2015, the lawsuit contends that since 2010, UPS illegally shipped over 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes mostly from smoke shops situated on Indian reservations throughout New York state. The deliveries to residences, unlicensed wholesalers and unlicensed retailers were made despite a 2005 agreement between UPS and New York in which the company agreed to stop cigarette shipments to consumers and unlicensed dealers, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit followed a similar case the state and city against FedEx Corp (FDX.N), accusing it of similarly illegally delivering contraband cigarettes to people’s homes. That lawsuit remains pending.

421,UPS,"RPT-Sensing threat, UPS plans to expand its 3D printing operations","(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text) By Nick Carey LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept 19 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service  plans to expand its 3D printing service to Asia and Europe, the U.S. shipping company has told Reuters, in a bid to fully embrace and get ahead of a trend that threatens to eat away a small but lucrative part of its business. Aside from its main package delivery service, UPS gets an undisclosed portion of its revenue from storing and shipping parts for manufacturers. If those customers were to switch to 3D printing their own parts, that business would face a drastic reduction. To counter that threat, UPS has chosen to get on board the 3D revolution, and is now looking to offer a service in which UPS will print out plastic parts - anything from nozzles to brackets to prototype soap dispensers or multi-faceted moving parts - around the world and deliver them. “3D printing is a great opportunity for us, but it’s also a threat,” Alan Amling, UPS vice president for corporate strategy, told Reuters. The dynamic - welcoming rather than fighting a threatening new technology - is not unlike automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG teaming up with ride-hailing services Uber and Gett, respectively. Amling said UPS is looking at either Singapore or Japan for an Asian 3D printing factory. He did not say where the company might open a European facility, though UPS’s operational hub in Europe is in Cologne, Germany. UPS has already got into the business in its home market. In May, it launched a U.S.-based 3D printing service with Fast Radius, a 3D printing company based outside Atlanta, where UPS is headquartered. UPS bought an unspecified stake in Fast Radius, which has a 3D printing factory at UPS’s Louisville, Kentucky, hub. There are also now 3D printers at 60 UPS stores in the United States that print parts using industrial grade thermoplastics. Customers can upload images for printing at the Fast Radius factory or at one of those UPS stores and have the printed products shipped to any location. A 3D printer works by laying down successive levels of material, mostly plastics at this point, to create an object. Quality printers that make metal parts cost over $500,000, while printers that use thermoplastics can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Prices are expected to come down as the technology advances. While 3D printing is still slow compared to high-speed production lines, the technology has progressed so it can be used effectively for prototypes or some components that are not needed in high volumes. Larger firms such as General Electric Co  are incorporating 3D-printed parts into production. That progress is a mixed blessing for UPS. As the cost of 3D printers drops and processes improve, that could undermine UPS’s efforts to develop 3D printing as a service - because customers could buy just buy their own printers. “Why wait a day for a part to arrive (from UPS) when you’ll be able to innovate six times a day on your own?” said Richard D’Aveni, a professor of strategy at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. What Fast Radius calls its “digital manufacturing factory” is a quiet operation occupying space in a corner of the UPS building in Louisville, without any of the grime, noise or bustle associated with a standard factory. Instead, a handful of machines work noiselessly, printing parts of varying sizes and shapes. During a recent visit to the operation by Reuters, Fast Radius CEO Rick Smith said that because of 3D printing, manufacturing is about to transform from “being about where it’s made to where it’s needed.” One of the printers was close to completing a black plastic prototype hydraulic pump for a manufacturing customer in Germany - a process that takes about 72 hours. Smith said the job illustrates the need for UPS to expand its service beyond the United States. Another customer, action camera maker GoPro Inc, is making use of Fast Radius’ printers, coupled with UPS’s ability to deliver a prototype the next day. Previously, if GoPro wanted to try out new designs, it would take weeks or even months to make a mock-up, senior GoPro product designer Ryan Harrison said. Now the company can innovate much quicker. “3D printing allows you to fail quicker or to stumble on moments of genius,” Harrison said. UPS does not break out how much it makes from its supply chain services, including warehouse storage. But in 2015 it reported about $6 billion in “forwarding and logistics” revenue, or about 10 percent of its total sales. An unknown portion of that came from its warehousing operations. UPS’s biggest rival, FedEx Corp, is less focused on supply-chain services and has not dipped into 3D printing. But  if UPS succeeds, analysts said, FedEx could follow suit. The company declined to comment on 3D printing. German competitor DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG , issued a report earlier this year warning the technology could upend traditional mass-production manufacturing, in which goods are shipped around the world. UPS’s foray into 3D printing is not its first experiment in other disruptive industries. In October 2015, it invested in drone maker CyPhy Works, and this February bought a stake in same-day delivery company Deliv - in both instances to understand and harness potentially industry-shaking technologies. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said while 3D printing has not yet proved itself on a mass scale, it makes sense for UPS to incorporate a technology “that could supplement or replace its services.”   (Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Eric Effron and Bill Rigby)",9192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/united-parcel-3dprint/rpt-sensing-threat-ups-plans-to-expand-its-3d-printing-operations-idUSL2N1BS1NV

423,UPS,"With U.S. drone rules set, firms race for flight data","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc’s launch this week of drone test flights simulating emergency medical-supply deliveries highlights a race for data to prove such deliveries can be performed safely.  UPS’s medical emergency at the Children’s Island summer camp off the Massachusetts coast was fictional. But gathering data about the drone’s flight and others like it is a vital part of a new effort to convince U.S. regulators to loosen the reins on using robotic aircraft for deliveries. UPS’s test flight was handled by drone maker CyPhy Works, in which it owns a stake.  “The technology for drones is there and it’s moving extremely fast,” said CyPhy founder Helen Greiner. “But it’s also true that we need to prove we can operate them safely and reliably.”      The UPS-CyPhy test comes amid a burst of U.S. drone activity, including companies focusing on package delivery. Amazon.com Inc is focusing on tests abroad, but UPS and others want to win over the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, whose primary concern is safety.  The Obama administration estimates the commercial drone industry could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy and support up to 100,000 new jobs by 2025. The FAA’s rules published on Aug. 29 dictate conditions for commercial drones. The aircraft must weigh under 55 pounds (25 kg), may not fly over people not involved in operations and must remain within the operator’s line of sight.  Drone makers, retailers and package delivery companies are now angling for waivers, largely to operate out of the line of sight, using small tests to collect data on everything from air speed to operating in bad weather and the frequency of accidents.  To obtain an FAA waiver exempting them from certain rules, companies must spell out a business case and use data to prove their drones are safe.  Some drone proponents have chafed at how slowly the FAA has moved to regulate drones, said Logan Campbell, CEO of drone consulting firm Aerotas.  “The only way things could move more quickly is if everyone were to share their data,” he said. “But ... no one wants to lose their competitive edge so that’s not going to happen.” An FAA spokeswoman said the agency grants waivers “if we find the proposed operation can be safely conducted using risk mitigation strategies.”  Ben Marcus, CEO of drone software provider AirMap, said the “big burden is being shifted from regulators ... to actual operators and developers” to demonstrate their technology can function safely.  The FAA’s cautious approach has encouraged some companies to test package delivery drones overseas. Amazon is testing deliveries in the United Kingdom, where it can fly drones out of the line of sight.  Since the FAA’s most recent guidance, more is happening in the U.S. market.  PrecisionHawk is developing a system enabling drones to detect objects in the air and on the ground to avoid collisions - technology that could help deliver packages. Vice President Tyler Collins said PrecisionHawk received an FAA waiver last month to operate out of the line of sight, based on years of data from crop inspections, as doing so would save farmers time and money.  Package delivery vehicles maker Workhorse Group has developed the HorseFly drone which launches from a vehicle’s roof.  In current testing, the driver must stand and watch the drone. CEO Steve Burns said Workhorse has applied for an FAA waiver in a few rural ZIP codes to allow the driver to continue his route while the drone is in the air. Once Workhorse proves its case, it will seek a waiver for more ZIP codes. Burns said the HorseFly costs only 2 cents per mile to operate versus package delivery vehicles, some of which get 5 miles to the gallon - making traditional vehicles far more expensive to run. “What we’re doing is of interest to people who deliver things - we have their attention,” Burns said.  UPS is using drones to manage inventory in warehouses, as is Walmart Mart Stores Inc, which can also gather data.  Adam Shaw, CEO of drone seller Maverick Drone Systems, has seen an uptick in company requests for drones to scan barcodes in warehouses. Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx Corp, UPS’s main rival, said this week FedEx has robotics programs under way including drones, but declined to provide details.

424,UPS,UPS launches U.S. drone test flights for urgent medical deliveries,"BEVERLY, Mass., Sept 23 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc said it began testing the use of drones for emergency deliveries of medical supplies this week with a flight in rural Massachusetts, which the company hopes will eventually lead to federal approval of drones as a regular delivery option. The test flight on Thursday was handled by CyPhy, a Danvers, Massachusetts-based drone maker in which UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, owns a stake. The drone delivered a small package from Beverly, located about 25 miles northeast of Boston, to Children’s Island, a summer camp for children three miles off the Atlantic coast. The drone, painted brown and with a UPS logo on the front, made the journey in about 8 minutes. “This demonstrates a drone is the best and most efficient way to deliver a package in a medical emergency in a remote location,” Helen Greiner, chief technology officer and founder of CyPhy, told Reuters. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last month published rules that restrict the use of drones to within the line of sight of the operator. Mark Wallace, UPS senior vice president of global engineering, said the company hopes to persuade the FAA to allow UPS to expand on its tests and eventually offer emergency deliveries by drone as part of its services. Earlier this year UPS announced it was backing a start-up using drones in Rwanda to transport life-saving blood supplies and vaccines. Drones are seen as having great potential to deliver packages, once FAA concerns over safety have been addressed. Online retailer Amazon.com Inc has been testing drones in the United Kingdom, Canada and Denmark, while Wal-Mart Stores has been using them to manage inventory at warehouses.

429,UPS,ZTO spurns huge China valuations for benefits of U.S. listing,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese logistics company ZTO Express is turning up the chance of a much more lucrative share listing at home in favor of an overseas IPO that lets its founder retain control and its investors cash out more easily. To steal a march on its rivals in the world’s largest express delivery market, it is taking the quicker U.S. route to raise $1.3 billion for new warehouses and long-haul trucks to ride breakneck growth fueled by China’s e-commerce boom. Its competitors SF Express, YTO Express, STO Express and Yunda Express all unveiled plans several months ago for backdoor listings in Shenzhen and Shanghai, but ZTO’s head start could prove crucial, analysts and investors said. “ZTO will have a clear, certain route to raise additional capital via U.S. markets, which their competitors, assuming they all end up quoted in China, will not,” said Peter Fuhrman, CEO of China-focused investment bank China First Capital. With a backlog of about 800 companies waiting for approval to go public in China and frequent changes to the listing rules by regulators, a New York listing is generally a quicker and more predictable way of raising funds and taps a broader mix of investors, bankers and investors said. “ZTO will have a built-in long-term competitive advantage - more reliable access to equity capital,” Fuhrman added. U.S. rules that allow founder Meisong Lai to retain control over the company and make it easier for ZTO’s private equity investors to sell their shares were some of the main reasons to go for an overseas listing, according to four people close to the company. U.S. markets allow a dual-class share structure that will give Lai 80 percent voting power in the company, even though he will only hold 28 percent of the stock after the IPO.  Most of Lai’s shares are Class B ordinary shares carrying 10 votes, while Class A shares, including the new U.S. shares, have one vote. China’s markets do not allow shares with different voting power. ZTO’s existing shareholders, including private equity firms Warburg Pincus, Hillhouse Capital and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital will also get much more leeway and flexibility to exit their investment under U.S. market rules. In China, they would be locked in for one to three years after the IPO. As concerns grow about a weakening Chinese currency, the New York IPO also gives it more stable dollar-denominated shares it can use for international acquisitions, the people close to the company said. Demand for the IPO, the biggest by a Chinese company in the United States since e-commerce giant Alibaba Group’s $25 billion record in 2014, already exceeds the shares on offer multiple times, two of the people said. That underscores the appeal of the fast-growing company to global investors, despite a valuation that places it above household names United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp. The shares will be priced on Oct. 26 and start trading the following day. ZTO is selling 72.1 million new American Depositary Shares (ADS), equivalent to about 10 percent of its outstanding stock, in the range $16.50 to $18.50 each. The range is equal to 23.4-26.3 times its expected 2017 earnings per share, according to people familiar with the matter. By comparison, Chinese rivals SF Express, YTO Express, STO Express and Yunda shares trade between 43 and 106 times earnings, according to Haitong Securities estimates. UPS and FedEx, which are growing at a much slower pace, trade at multiples of 17.8 and 13.4 times. “The A-share market (in China) does give you a higher valuation, but the U.S. market can help improve your transparency and corporate governance,” said one of the people close to ZTO. “Becoming a New York-listed company will also benefit the company in the long-term if it plans to conduct M&A; overseas and seek more capital from the international market.” China’s express delivery firms handled 20.7 billion parcels in 2015, shifting 1.5 times the volume in the United States, according to consulting firm iResearch data cited in the ZTO prospectus. The market will grow an average 23.7 percent a year through 2020 and reach 60 billion parcels, iResearch forecasts. Domestic rivals STO Express and YTO Express have unveiled plans to go public with reverse takeovers worth $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, while the country’s biggest player, SF Express, is working on a $6.4 billion deal and Yunda Express on a $2.7 billion listing. ZTO plans to use $720 million of the IPO proceeds to purchase land and invest in new facilities to expand its packaged sorting capacity, according to the listing prospectus. The rest will be used to expand its truck fleet, invest in new technology and for potential acquisitions. “It’s a competitive industry and you do need fresh capital for your expansion, in particular when all your rivals are doing so or plan to do so,” said one of the people close to the company.

UPS said it expects record peak volumes of more than 700 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve, with daily volumes expected to hit more than 30 million packages on 13 days leading up to Christmas. During a call with analysts, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said global economic growth remains modest and the company is seeing “mixed economic signals” from the world’s industrialized economies. In early trading, UPS shares down 1.2 percent at $107.34. Abney also told analysts UPS will purchase 14 747-8 jumbo freighters from Boeing Co (BA.N), with options to buy 14 more. The first two aircraft should be delivered by the end of 2017. Some 1,200 Teamsters-represented mechanics and other workers who service UPS’ fleet of jet aircraft are currently voting whether to authorize a strike against the company. After three years of talks, healthcare benefits are the main stumbling block for a new contract for workers at Teamsters Local 2727. Though federal law would make a strike extremely unlikely this year, Local 2727 president Tim Boyle said the situation could still impact UPS’ holiday season performance. “Our members are not real happy and whether or not it leads to a strike I think it’s going to affect the service going through peak season,” he said. “They’re overworked and morale is poor right now.”  Atlanta-based UPS reported third-quarter net income of $1.27 billion or $1.44 per share, an increase of less than 1 percent from $1.26 billion or $1.39 per share a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected earnings per share of $1.44. UPS posted revenue of $14.9 billion, versus $14.2 billion in the same period last year. Analysts expected revenue of $14.73 billion. Revenue at UPS’ cornerstone U.S. domestic package service rose 4.8 percent, with daily package volumes up 5.7 percent. Revenue per package at the unit was 0.9 percent higher than in the third quarter of 2015. UPS said it still expects full-year earnings per share within a range from $5.70 to $5.90, but warned a year-end pension accounting adjustment “could be material.” ",10272016,http://www.reuters.com/article/united-parcel-results/update-4-ups-expects-record-holiday-deliveries-flags-possible-pension-charge-idUSL1N1CX0IE

433,UPS,UPS CEO says $5.3 bln order for Boeing 747 freighters reflects demand,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Thursday it ordered 14 Boeing (BA.N) 747-8 cargo jets, a deal worth $5.3 billion at list prices that potentially breathes new life into an aircraft Boeing had warned it might cancel. The UPS order, which includes options for 14 more of the hump-backed planes, reflects growing demand the freight company is seeing for air cargo after years of anemic growth, Chief Executive Officer David Abney said in an interview. “We have the demand and these aircraft will allow us to handle the demand on a very scheduled basis,” he said as UPS reported third-quarter results.  The purchase adds significantly to Boeing’s order book at a time when it and rival Airbus (AIR.PA) have struggled to sell widebody aircraft. Slow sales of the 747-8, the latest version of the four-engine plane that first flew in 1969, prompted Boeing to recently cut production to six a year and to warn in July it might stop making the plane. Similar-sized two-engine planes that are more fuel efficient have largely eclipsed the 747’s passenger mission. Sales have also slowed for Airbus’ large four-engine A380 passenger jet. But the 747-8 freighter’s special hinged nose gives it a unique ability to carry large cargo. Boeing has said it expects 747 demand to recover when air cargo traffic growth resumes and when a wave of older 747s are retired beginning around 2019.  On Wednesday, Boeing predicted 4.2 percent annual growth in air cargo traffic over then next 20 years, driven largely by e-commerce traffic and express delivery in China. “Markets linked to Asia will lead all other international markets in average air cargo growth,” Boeing said, citing a need by 2035 for 550 large, 747-size freighters.  UPS plans to use its 747-8s on important “trunk routes... connecting Europe to Asia, Asia to the U.S.,” Abney said. It will use older 747s and other planes now flown on those routes to replace smaller planes on other routes, adding capacity. “It’s really a cascading effect that is more than the sum of its parts,” he said. “We may be adding only 14 at this time, but ... there’s going to be multiples of larger aircraft with more capacity and much more locations.” “What is important is this is net add,” he said. “In some places you’re buying just to replace aircraft. This is not. This is a growth strategy. This is about opportunity.... We’re going to put these planes to work as soon as we get them.” UPS shares were down 0.9 percent at $107.62 and Boeing shares were down 2 percent at $142.60 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

440,UPS,"New York, UPS spar over proposed $872 mln fine for cigarette shipments","(Reuters) - New York state and city authorities sparred with United Parcel Service Inc on Wednesday during closing arguments in a trial over whether the world’s largest package delivery company should be fined for allegedly delivering untaxed cigarettes from smoke shops on Native-American reservations. The closing arguments came in a lawsuit over whether UPS illegally shipped more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes, mostly from reservation smoke shops. The suit is part of a broader effort by the state to combat smuggling of cigarettes from lower-tax areas. John Oleske, a lawyer for New York state, urged U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan to impose an $872 million fine. He said such a steep penalty was justified because the company acted with an “entitled sense of disregard” in failing to vet shipments from entities with a history of dealing in contraband. Attorneys for UPS countered that no penalty was appropriate because the company had abided by a prior agreement with the state on compliance. Jamie Levitt, an attorney for UPS, said that if any fine were levied, it should be a small fraction of what the state had proposed. “The penalties that are sought here are excessive and unconstitutional,” Levitt said. UPS has denied the allegations. The company said in a statement it is “vigorously” fighting the case and believes the state and city are overreaching. In addition to financial damages, the lawsuit, which was filed in February 2015, seeks a court-appointed monitor to police compliance. On Wednesday, Forrest, who will decide the case, said she would consider such a measure cautiously. “I think a monitor on a corporation is a very big deal,” the judge said. Forrest also questioned the state’s and city’s arguments, including how to reconcile evidence that the bulk of some shipments were cigars instead of cigarettes. She also asked whether the authorities were “double-counting” by seeking damages for violations of both a 2005 agreement between the state and UPS governing its compliance with cigarette deliveries as well as a 2010 law creating new regulations for carriers of cigarettes. Oleske said that the law allowed for “stacking” of penalties. Levitt said that a penalty, if imposed, should at most be a single-digit percentage of the revenues of the shipments in question, estimated at about $1 million a year. Forrest said she would rule by Dec. 25.

Teamsters Local 2727 said 98 percent of those who took part in a mail-in ballot voted to authorize strike action. Eighty percent of the local’s 1,200 members participated in the ballot.  Contract talks have been ongoing for three years. If they remain deadlocked Monday, union representatives say they will begin the process that could lead to a strike within 60 days. The main sticking point has been healthcare benefits. The Teamsters say UPS is demanding major concessions, including a massive spike in retiree contributions for health-care costs.   “UPS wants huge concessions and our members are not willing to take them,” Local 2727 President Tim Boyle said. “We’re not asking for anything we don’t already have and this demonstrates our members are willing to strike.”The air maintenance staff work at hubs around the United States, with more than one-third in Louisville, Kentucky, which is UPS’ main hub.     “UPS continues to negotiate in good faith for a contract that is good for our employees, our customers and our company,” a UPS spokesman said. “We are confident talks will be completed successfully.” The company said it was also hopeful that contract talks can be concluded “without any disruption” to customers. A strike could ground UPS’ airplanes, affecting packages shipped by air. While it would not halt all deliveries, it would be a major disruption. The air maintenance workers are governed by the U.S. Railway Labor Act, which only permits strikes after negotiations and mediation have failed.  If talks remain deadlocked Monday, the Teamsters say they will ask the federal mediator overseeing negotiations to release the union from the bargaining table. If there is no resolution after a 30-day cooling-off period, a board appointed by the president would have to rule on a strike, which would take up to 30 days. A strike would be highly unlikely during UPS’ crucial holiday peak season this year. But it could go before the presidential board before President Barack Obama leaves office in January.  Kevin Gawlik, an air mechanic for 20 years who works at a UPS air hub in Rockford, Illinois, voted to strike. He said the work is tough and can result in health problems, including hearing loss from working around jet engines.  “That’s why I’m willing to walk out and strike to keep my benefits,” Gawlik, 49, said.

The Teamsters say UPS is demanding major concessions, including a massive spike in retiree contributions for health-care costs. “UPS wants huge concessions and our members are not willing to take them,” Local 2727 President Tim Boyle said. “We’re not asking for anything we don’t already have and this demonstrates our members are willing to strike.” The air maintenance staff work at hubs around the United States, with more than one-third in Louisville, Kentucky, which is UPS’ main hub. A strike could ground UPS’ airplanes, affecting packages shipped by air. While it would not halt all deliveries, it would be a major disruption. The air maintenance workers are governed by the U.S. Railway Labor Act, which only permits strikes after negotiations and mediation have failed. If talks remain deadlocked Monday, the Teamsters say they will ask the federal mediator overseeing negotiations to release the union from the bargaining table. If there is no resolution after a 30-day cooling-off period, a board appointed by the president would have to rule on a strike, which would take up to 30 days. A strike would be highly unlikely during UPS’ crucial holiday peak season this year. But it could go before the presidential board before President Barack Obama leaves office in January. Kevin Gawlik, an air mechanic for 20 years who works at a UPS air hub in Rockford, Illinois, voted to strike. He said the work is tough and can result in health problems, including hearing loss from working around jet engines. “That’s why I’m willing to walk out and strike to keep my benefits,” Gawlik, 49, said.

454,UPS,"Shippers, online retailers seek way around rising delivery costs","ADDISON, Ill. (Reuters) - In an unassuming building in the Chicago suburb of Addison, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) engineers design custom boxes for retailers as part of a joint effort to tackle a vexing issue: the high cost of delivering e-commerce packages.  Online retail sales are expected to reach $392.5 billion this year, according to research firm eMarketer, but with U.S. consumers now demanding free shipping on most packages, shippers and retailers are facing a squeeze.  Shippers’ margins are falling or stagnating, despite steady price increases, because homes are roughly three times as expensive to deliver to as business addresses. And retailers cannot pass along the cost, because they must offer free shipping in order to compete. The shared solution: design new, space-saving packages that can help improve package density on delivery trucks. This cuts costs for retailers and raises margins for shippers.  Up to 60 percent of requests handled by UPS’s package laboratory are for smaller packages to cut shipping rates, the company told Reuters. “In most cases we are able to get retailers a better rate,” says Quint Marini, who runs the lab. The average rate reduction is around 20 percent, he said. Main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) has a similar facility in Memphis. The UPS lab puts new packaging through rigorous tests, piling weights on boxes, then simulating the jolts of a delivery truck traversing a bumpy road. On a recent morning, the load was too much for a box containing a furniture shipment, spilling weights over the floor as it collapsed.  “If the box can’t hold the weights, we’ll have to fail this one,” said Jonathon McWherter, a UPS engineer conducting the test.  The stakes are growing. E-commerce shipments accounted for 46 percent of UPS’s total volume last year, up from 36 percent in 2009. UPS expects the e-commerce share to hit 51 percent by 2019.   To counter rising costs, UPS and FedEx have raised package rates by between 4.9 percent and 5.9 percent annually since 2009. They also have levied surcharges on retailers for residential addresses and rural deliveries.  Rates for a 5-pound (2.3-kg) box traveling up to 1,400 miles (2250 km) by UPS Ground or FedEx Home Delivery have nearly doubled since 2006, to $14.18, according to SJ Consulting Group. Despite the increases, profit margins at UPS and FedEx’s U.S. domestic business have stagnated or declined in recent years, in part because they have invested billions of dollars to handle rising volumes.  (See a graphic of UPS and FedEx's rates and margins here tmsnrt.rs/2h1ig9u) UPS and FedEx have sought new ways to cut costs, such as dropping batches of packages at urban retailers, where customers can retrieve them. Now they are focusing more on packaging, charging a fee for design services while also levying what they call ‘dimensional weight’ surcharges for boxes that take up too much room in relation their weight.   Retailers are hemmed in by their need to match Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The world’s largest online retailer offers free shipping to customers who pay a $99 annual fee to join its Amazon Prime program — a revenue stream most retailers have not been able to replicate.  “Amazon has forced everybody into free shipping,” said John Haber, head of logistics consultancy Spend Management Experts.  Amine Khechfe, co-founder of Endicia, which provides shipping services to e-commerce companies, said retailers are squeezed. “They’ve got the pressures of free shipping, which isn’t really free, and their costs are going up,” he said. Many retailers have responded by procuring ‘on-demand’ packaging machines, which custom-tailor shipping boxes. Hanko Kiessner, CEO of Packsize International, which makes such machines and the software that drives them, estimates 16 percent of U.S. retailers are using on-demand machines, and predicts a majority will do so within three years.  Packaging “is now front and center and a glaring opportunity for improvement,” Kiessner said. Packsize also collaborates on projects with UPS. Office supply retailer Staples Inc SPLS.O said it has cut the weight of corrugated cardboard it uses in packaging by 65 percent, but declined to detail the cost savings. Car accessory and electronics retailer Crutchfield Corp has saved several million dollars with on-demand packaging since August 2014, chief fulfillment officer Chris Groseclose said.  Companies like Monster Moto have worked with the UPS lab. The mini-bike maker has cut shipping costs up to 50 percent on bikes that sell for between $249 to $749, said CEO Alex Keechle. “That was a real expense to us, and because of free shipping, we had to eat it,” he said. SJ Consulting founder Satish Jindel said retailers need to seek cost savings while also finding ways to pass on costs, such as minimum orders or membership fees. “Any retailer who wants to be an e-commerce player and thinks consumers will have to recognize that shipping costs money and they need to pay for it, will be out of business,” Jindel said. “The consumer doesn’t care what it costs.” ",12152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ecommerce-freeshipping/shippers-online-retailers-seek-way-around-rising-delivery-costs-idUSKBN1432ZL

456,UPS,"Facing rising e-commerce, UPS looks to automation, higher prices","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Facing lower margins from its rising e-commerce business, package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Tuesday that it would pull forward investments in automation and technology and could raise prices to offset the reduced profits from delivering packages to consumers. Atlanta-based UPS posted a quarterly loss Tuesday caused by a pension charge and gave a full-year profit forecast below analysts’ expectations, helping push its shares down nearly 7 percent. Like rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), UPS has been struggling to figure out how to lower e-commerce-related costs. UPS and FedEx have raised package rates by between 4.9 percent and 5.9 percent annually since 2009.     “At the same time as we’re going to focus on the cost curve ... we’re also going to continue to focus on yield management,” Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters. “If (e-commerce) is going to continue to drive additional costs, then we have to make sure we pass on that cost to our customers.”  Delivering packages to residential addresses costs more than to businesses because businesses received more packages per stop than individual consumers.  UPS said fourth-quarter shipments to residential addresses from business rose 11.5 percent and a record-high 63 percent of deliveries in December were to homes. But while revenue at UPS’ flagship U.S. domestic package business rose 6.3 percent, revenue per package fell 6.1 percent. Abney said the company would increase its capital expenditures to around $4 billion in 2017 from $3 billion last year, further boosting automation and technology to handle e-commerce packages. He said UPS would examine how to pass on rising costs to customers. Stephens Inc analyst Jack Atkins said that investors are beginning to chafe at rising capital investments at UPS and FedEx that have not led to margin growth in recent years. “What’s got people troubled is they’re making all these investments just to keep margins where they are,” Atkins said. “Investors are beginning to ask when will we see returns on these investments?” In a client note, Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry said the additional spending “calls into question whether e-commerce is more capital intensive than previously understood, and it leaves less cash available for share buybacks.”  The package delivery company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $239 million, or 27 cents per share, compared with a net profit of $1.33 billion, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding the non-cash, after-tax pension charge of $1.90 per share, UPS reported earnings per share of $1.63. Analysts expected $1.69. The charge is related to the company’s defined benefit pension programs for employees. When UPS finds that its long-term obligations for the pensions are not fully funded, it sets aside extra cash to cover the shortfall. UPS said it expected full-year 2017 EPS in a range of $5.80 to $6.10, adding that the strong U.S. dollar should lower adjusted EPS by 30 cents.   Analysts have predicted earnings per share of $6.17 in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in the quarter rose to $16.93 billion from $16.05 billion a year earlier.

459,UPS,"Amazon to spend $1.49 billion on air cargo hub, fans talk of bigger ambitions","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc plans to invest $1.49 billion to build a large air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, state officials said on Tuesday, stoking expectations it may one day opt to directly compete with FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc. The world’s biggest online retailer has agreed to a 50-year lease for about 900 acres of property from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport - close in size to the global hubs of top cargo airlines. Amazon is handling more shipping in-house so it can deliver packages to customers faster, as well as cut costs and uncertainty associated with relying on third parties. It has said its moves are designed to supplement, not replace cargo carriers. Analysts suspect it has larger ambitions. “We estimate a $400 billion-plus market opportunity for Amazon in delivery, freight forwarding, and contract logistics,” Colin Sebastian, an analyst for Baird Equity Research, said in a note to clients.     Amazon, which has not announced a start date for the hub,  said it expects to create more than 2,000 jobs when the site opens. The northern Kentucky location - not far from UPS’s major hub - puts Amazon’s aircraft in shooting distance of top cities. The company said last year it would lease 40 Boeing Co 767 planes, 16 of which are currently in service. It also lets Amazon’s trucks reach 11 fulfillment centers in state. And a large operation of Deutsche Post DHL there lets Amazon transfer packages easily abroad, said Brian Clancy, managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital & Strategy LLC. As part of the investment, Amazon anticipates it will spend nearly $462 million on building and improvements over an unspecified number of years, according to a report by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. The authority’s board tentatively approved $40 million in tax incentives for Amazon over ten years if it meets hiring commitments, with average wages including benefits targeted at $26 per hour, the report said.      So far, Amazon has loaded its aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the United States. This has helped it dodge fees from cargo partners, which are increasingly pricing by volume rather than weight. Amazon’s new site compares with about 1,220 acres UPS has in Louisville. FedEx has more than 900 in its Memphis hub, a 2010 airport plan showed.

465,UPS,"UPS tests drone deliveries, eyes future price changes","(Reuters) - Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc said on Tuesday it will consider raising prices across the board in coming years to offset pressure on margins, particularly from the rising costs of delivering packages to e-commerce customers. “We... always have to be diligent about getting the right return,” particularly as costs rise, Richard Peretz, the company’s chief financial officer, said at an investor event. His comments came a day after the company tested home delivery by drone in Lithia, Florida, the first step in what it hopes will be more automated - and cheaper - deliveries in rural areas. UPS is grappling with lower margins for e-commerce, which have dented earnings. Businesses typically get more packages per stop than residences, making delivery to individual homes more expensive.  Drones could be one way to reduce those costs.  In Monday’s test, a drone launched from the roof of a UPS vehicle flew autonomously toward its destination, dropped a package and then returned to the vehicle as the driver continued on a delivery route. “We see this as an exploration into this new technology,” John Dodero, vice president of industrial engineering at UPS, said ahead of the test. The company is also considering how changes in global trade, particularly with Mexico, will impact its business as U.S. President Donald Trump vows to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in 1994. The U.S.-Mexico supply chain is “critical,” said David Abney, the company’s chief executive. NAFTA “is a little bit old. It’s not reflective of 21st century agreements,” he said. But Abney added that the company believes “global trade certainly drives jobs, and we think that southern border is very important to our customers and to the country.” UPS has tested drones before and is considering other uses for the technology, such as in inventory control and helping inspect planes and vehicles within hangars and warehouses. But UPS has no timeline for when drones might be put into wider use, Dodero said, partly because federal authorities are still developing regulations on how to use the technology. The company also said it will expand U.S. pickup and delivery to six days for ground shipments and offer Saturday delivery in the largest metropolitan areas.  UPS sees revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent over 2018 and 2019, Peretz said, with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 5 percent to 10 percent. It is planning $1 billion to $1.8 billion in annual share repurchases over the same time.

The European Commission rejected the 5.2 billion euro ($5.5 billion) deal in 2013, saying UPS had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns that the deal would hurt consumers. The deal would have expanded its presence in Asia and Latin America. While TNT has since been bought by FedEx (FDX.N) in a 4.4 billion euro deal approved by the Commission last year, the ruling by Europe’s second-highest court could affect other contentious deals. UPS subsequently challenged the EU decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court. Judges annulled the EU decision on Tuesday, citing a procedural irregularity. The court said the Commission had infringed UPS’s rights of defense by using a different econometric model in its analysis than that used in previous exchange of views and arguments. “UPS might have been better able to defend itself if it had at its disposal, before the adoption of the contested decision, the final version of the econometric model chosen by the Commission,” it said. While the ruling is not expected to have any impact on the package delivery market, it shows that regulators have to present and communicate their case clearly to merging companies, said James Killick, a partner at law firm White & Case. “I don’t think you can undo the two mergers. You can’t rewrite history. The ruling shows, however, the importance of due process especially in the merger process where time is short,” he said. UPS could potentially now sue for damages, he added. UPS said it was pleased with the court’s reasoning. “While the decision in UPS’s favor makes a number of points, the most significant of this decision is its impact in helping to preserve a competitive environment in Europe by clarifying the procedure and relevant criteria for merger approval,” it said. The Commission said it was studying the judgment.

477,UPS,Judge finds UPS liable to New York over cigarette shipments,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday held United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) liable for having illegally shipped hundreds of thousands of cartons of untaxed cigarettes in New York, depriving the state and New York City of millions of dollars of taxes. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said the state and city are entitled to compensatory damages and fines, and that UPS’ “high degree of culpability” meant “significant penalties” were appropriate. “UPS largely relied on its size and weak internal procedures to excuse blatantly culpable conduct,” she wrote. “But there were many, many people within UPS who consciously avoided the truth, for years.” The state and city had sought more than $872 million, and Forrest could determine the award as soon as next month. UPS was accused of having since 2010 shipped more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed “contraband” cigarettes to unlicensed wholesalers, unlicensed retailers and residences, often from smoke shops on Indian reservations. The plaintiffs said this violated the Atlanta-based company’s October 2005 agreement with the state not to ship cigarettes to unlicensed dealers and individual consumers. UPS was also accused of violating federal laws against racketeering and cigarette trafficking, as well as New York’s public health law. In her 218-page decision, which followed a non-jury trial in September, Forrest also declined the state’s and city’s request for injunctive relief and to appoint a monitor, saying UPS had taken many steps to avoid a recurrence. UPS said in a statement that it was evaluating the decision, but pleased that Forrest found its current tobacco compliance program “adequate.” Eric Schneiderman, the state’s attorney general, in a statement called the decision “a win for New York and a win for public health.” Zachary Carter, the New York City Corporation Counsel, said he was also pleased with the decision. Forrest also rejected UPS’ argument to cap any payout, after the company claimed it was blindsided at trial when the plaintiffs sought an award nearly five times the roughly $180 million it had been expecting. The state and city are pursuing a similar lawsuit against UPS rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), which is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan. Any trial in that case is unlikely to begin this year, court records show.

487,UPS,UPS first-quarter profit tops estimates as revenue rises,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly net profit on Thursday as revenue grew across its domestic and international package delivery segments and as well as freight and supply chain operations.  Often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, UPS said revenue increased to $15.315 billion in the first quarter from $14.418 billion in the year-ago period, above expectations of $15.17 billion in revenue. “We think of it as a good start, and we’re determined to have a good finish to the rest of the year,” Chief Executive Officer David Abney said in an interview with Reuters. During the quarter, UPS invested to expand its new Saturday deliveries, with $35 million in increased costs from facility construction and the Saturday initiative.  Revenue at its domestic segment rose 5 percent to $9.535 billion from $9.084 billion. For international, revenue was also up 5 percent to $3.058 billion, and in supply chain and freight, it jumped 12.5 percent to $2.722 billion.  “Overall we believe this was a positive report for UPS,” including the company’s reiteration of full-year earnings forecast of between $5.80 and $6.10 per share, Cowen analysts wrote.  The company said the domestic business was affected by one-time costs of $50 million from a lag in a fuel surcharge, poor weather and a facility fire. Abney said that he expected growth in revenue to outpace costs for the remainder of the year. UPS is also weighing surge pricing for some customers “if they need more capacity than we have,” Abney said. The company now picks up and delivers ground packages on Saturday in 15 U.S. metropolitan areas, with plans to expand to more than 4,700 U.S. cities by the peak 2017 holiday season. Operating expenses rose 7.4 percent to $13.531 billion from $12.595 billion in the year-ago quarter.      While e-commerce business has jumped, those packages often involve residences, which are costlier for UPS than businesses, because they involve fewer packages.  The Atlanta-based company posted first-quarter net income of $1.158 billion, or $1.32 per share, up 2.4 percent from $1.131 billion, or $1.27 per share, a year earlier.

494,UPS,UPS air maintenance workers threaten strike ahead of shareholders meeting,"(Reuters) - A union representing 1,200 U.S. air maintenance workers at United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) turned up pressure on the company on Sunday to settle a three-year contract dispute, saying it would seek clearance to strike. The union is taking its grievances directly to UPS shareholders, running as an advertisement an open letter to David Abney, the company’s chief executive, ahead of a Thursday shareholders meeting. The letter, which has been delivered to board members, was signed by nearly 78 percent of members of Local 2727 of the Teamsters union, asking the company to maintain air mechanics’ current health plan and not demand other concessions.  “We’re not willing to back off of this and we will strike over it,” said Tim Boyle, the local president.  The company said that it continues to negotiate in good faith with the union. “Talks continue under the control of the National Mediation Board, which has scheduled sessions several months out,” said Mike Mangeot, a spokesman for UPS Airlines, in a statement.  “The union’s talk about a job action is simply posturing and a common union tactic designed to pressure talks. Our mechanics are good people who do a good job of keeping our aircraft flying safely and reliably, and UPS continues to negotiate in good faith for an agreement that’s good for them, the company and our stakeholders.” Union members will also protest at the UPS shareholders’ meeting on Thursday in Wilmington, Delaware, with protests outside the meeting and, for union members who are also shareholders, questions to company officials inside.  The local plans additional protests on Tuesday in Atlanta, where the company is headquartered. The union already voted in November to strike, but saw that request denied by federal authorities. The air maintenance workers are governed by the U.S. Railway Labor Act, which only allows strikes after it finds negotiations and mediation have failed. But if the company does not agree to keep members’ health plans intact at the next bargaining session, on May 11 and May 12, Boyle said the union would ask again for permission to strike. Even if the board grants permission, though, a strike would take at least another 30 days because of other procedural hurdles. A strike could ground the package delivery company’s airplanes and disrupt packages sent by air, even as UPS and its rivals grapple with higher costs for surging e-commerce business.

Union members will also protest at the UPS shareholders’ meeting on Thursday in Wilmington, Delaware. That will include both protests outside the meeting and, for union members who are also shareholders, questions to company officials inside. The local plans additional protests on Tuesday in Atlanta, where the company is headquartered. The union already voted in November to strike, but saw that request denied by federal authorities. The air maintenance workers are governed by the U.S. Railway Labor Act, which only allows strikes after it finds negotiations and mediation have failed. But if the company does not agree to keep members’ health plans intact at the next bargaining session, on May 11 and May 12, Boyle said the union would ask again for permission to strike. “If the company doesn’t back off we’ll submit another request to the mediator to be released” to strike, Boyle said. Even if the board grants permission, though, a strike would take at least another 30 days because of other procedural hurdles. A strike could ground the package delivery company’s airplanes and disrupt packages sent by air, even as UPS and its rivals grapple with higher costs for surging e-commerce business.

507,UPS,U.S. court fines UPS $247 mln over illegal cigarette shipments,"(Reuters) - A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service Inc to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for “illegally shipping” large volumes of untaxed cigarettes in New York state and City, a court filing showed on Thursday. UPS said it was extremely disappointed with the court’s ruling and would appeal the decision. “The court’s monetary award is excessive and far out of the bounds of constitutional limits, particularly given that the shipments at issue generated around $1 million in revenue,” UPS said in an emailed statement. The ruling by District Judge Katherine Forrest of Manhattan justified the amount saying the court was convinced “modest penalties” will not make a “sufficient corporate impact” on UPS. In total, New York state is awarded $165.8 million and plaintiff New York City is awarded $81.2 million. The parties had to file certain required information to the court before April 7 in which UPS’ court submissions showed a “lack of cooperation” and “odd abrasiveness,” according to the court ruling. The ruling said the court was “troubled” by the UPS’ “consistent unwillingness to acknowledge its errors”. The federal judge in March held UPS liable for having illegally shipped hundreds of thousands of cartons of untaxed cigarettes in New York, depriving the state and New York City of millions of dollars of taxes. Judge Forrest then said the state and city were entitled to compensatory damages and fines, and that UPS’ “high degree of culpability” meant “significant penalties” were appropriate. The state and city had sought more than $872 million. “We are pleased that the award of nearly $247 million to the city and state reflects the serious nature of the offenses at issue. Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and the city and the state will continue in their efforts to protect the public health,” said New York City Corporation Counsel Zachary Carter. UPS was accused of having shipped since 2010 more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed “contraband” cigarettes to unlicensed wholesalers, unlicensed retailers and residences, often from smoke shops on Indian reservations.

Two people wounded by gunfire were taken to a hospital. Five other people suffered less serious injuries in a frantic exit from the building, San Francisco police said. The gunshot victims, like the killer, all were UPS drivers, and the attack unfolded as the workers gathered for their daily morning meeting before starting their delivery rounds, said Steve Gaut, head of investor relations at UPS. Authorities did not immediately identify the suspect or the victims. Assistant San Francisco Police Chief Toney Chaplin said the gunman shot himself in the head as he was confronted by officers swarming the building. The police never fired a shot. Authorities offered no possible motive for the violence and Chaplin said at a news conference it was not an act of terrorism. Police said they recovered two firearms, including the murder weapon, which they described as an assault pistol.  The UPS facility, a package-sorting and delivery hub that serves the greater San Francisco area and employs about 350 workers in the city’s Potrero Hill area, was placed under a security lockdown for six hours. “We are always saddened by the loss of life to gun violence,” San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said on Twitter. “Any shooting is one shooting too many.” The UPS shooting erupted hours after an unrelated mass shooting at a baseball practice session in the Virginia suburbs of the nation’s capital left a congressman and several others wounded before the assailant was killed by police. Former congresswoman and gun-safety advocate Gabrielle Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt in Arizona that claimed six lives, issued a statement lamenting the shootings in Virginia and California, calling them “a stark indication of the scope of gun violence epidemic we face as Americans.” UPS is providing trauma and grief counseling to employees at the San Francisco center.  Video footage from the scene showed a massive police presence near the facility, with workers being escorted outside and embracing one another on the sidewalk. One worker was found by police hiding inside the sprawling building after the shooting, unaware that the violence was over.  “It was a frightful scene,” Chaplin said. The San Francisco bloodshed came three years after a UPS employee shot and killed two of his supervisors before turning the gun on himself at a UPS distribution center in Birmingham, Alabama. That gunman had recently been fired from the facility. The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history occurred in June 2016 when a gunman claiming allegiance to the Islamic State militant group killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Gun laws in the United States rank among the most permissive of any developed country, with the right to “keep and bear arms” enshrined in the Constitution’s Second Amendment.

519,UPS,UPS to levy holiday surcharges to battle e-commerce costs,"DETROIT (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc said on Monday it will levy surcharges on U.S. residential packages during its crucial peak holiday season this year as it seeks to combat the spiraling costs of delivering e-commerce packages. Like its main rival FedEx Corp, UPS has struggled with the expense of “the last mile” associated with delivering to residential addresses. The cost per package to businesses is typically lower because they receive more deliveries. Atlanta-based UPS, the world’s largest shipping company, said residential packages, large packages and those exceeding system weight limits would face surcharges of up to 97 cents for two-day air services to residential addresses from Dec. 17-23. A 27 cent surcharge per package will apply to UPS’ ground service from Nov. 19 to Dec. 2 and between Dec. 17 and Dec. 23. “We’re focused on helping our customers achieve success during some of their most important selling seasons,” Alan Gershenhorn, UPS’ chief commercial officer, said in a statement.  UPS’s average daily volume exceeded 30 million packages on some days during its 2016 peak holiday season, far above its normal daily average of more than 19 million packages.  To meet that demand, UPS said it “acquires on a temporary basis and often at shorter-term premium rates, additional air and truck cargo capacity, temporary facilities, and additional sorting and delivery personnel.” UPS has worked closely with retailers to manage the peak season surge since struggling to do so in 2013 and 2014.  Both UPS and FedEx have spent billions of dollars in upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, leaving investors chafing over the expense.  It is unclear whether Memphis-based FedEx, which is due to report quarterly results after the close of trading on Tuesday, plans to adopt a similar peak season surcharge policy. Cutting delivery costs is a key priority in the e-commerce sector and was, according to industry experts, one of the reasons for Amazon Inc’s announcement last week that it was buying Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion. UPS shares were down 6 cents at $110.53 in late morning trading on Monday. FedEx was down 74 cents at $209.76 a share.

523,UPS,UPS selects Boeing to convert three 767 jets into freighters,"PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - Boeing will convert three second-hand 767 passenger planes to freighters on behalf of package delivery company United Parcel Service, the companies said on Monday. It is the first time UPS has converted 767 jetliners into freighters, rather than buying them as freighters directly off the production line, and it selected Boeing after a competition against other conversion providers. The deal, signed at the Paris Airshow, is also one of the first transactions by Boeing’s new global services division which aims to deepen Boeing’s involvement in the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. The new division officially starts work on July 1. Boeing aims to increase its annual services revenue to $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently.

532,UPS,"U.S. ecommerce, price hikes lift UPS profit but shares fall on outlook","SEATTLE/DETROIT (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc on Thursday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly net profit due to rising ecommerce deliveries but investors worried about the company’s performance in the back-half of the year and shares fell 4 percent. The world’s largest package delivery company said quarterly revenue at its core U.S. domestic package service rose 8 percent to $9.7 billion. Revenue per package in the domestic unit was up 3 percent, reflecting raised prices. Both UPS and its main rival, FedEx Corp, have spent billions of dollars in upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas, leaving investors frustrated over the expense. “As far as peak of this year, we have additional capacity that’s opening in several different spots throughout the country,” Chief Executive Officer David Abney told Reuters on Thursday. “We have healthy volume growth, so we are planning for that.”  Often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, the  Atlanta-based company posted second-quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up nearly 8 percent from $1.3 billion or $1.43 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.47, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Higher fuel surcharges and workers’ compensation contributed 10 cents per share to earnings in the quarter. Despite the beat, UPS kept its forecast unchanged.  The company expects full-year earnings per share in a range from $5.80 to $6.10. Analysts expect earnings per share for the year of $5.95.  “The back half of the year appears a little weaker than investors had expected and that’s the overhang on the stock,” said Ben Hartford, analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co in Milwaukee. “Investors are wrestling with the fact that they did not change the full-year guidance.”  The company said revenue in its international segment was up 2.8 percent because of export growth in Asia and Europe but operating profit fell nearly 5 percent. FedEx said it was experiencing a disruption in services in its Netherlands-based TNT Express unit following a cyber attack in June. Earlier this month, FedEx said the attack would hurt its full-year results. UPS executives told analysts the company has seen an uptick following the attack.  “Straight up, yes, we are seeing more business recently in Europe,” UPS Chief Information Officer Juan Perez said.

539,UPS,FedEx will not charge extra for most holiday home deliveries,"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said on Thursday it will not charge customers extra fees for most packages delivered to homes during the peak holiday shopping season this year, challenging rival United Parcel Service, which plans more widespread peak-season surcharges. FedEx’s holiday pricing strategy steps up the Memphis-based company’s battle with UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, for a greater share of e-commerce business driven by retailers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). UPS and FedEx have spent billions of dollars on upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas.  Atlanta-based UPS has charted a different course for pricing this holiday season. Parcels delivered to residences, as well as large packages and those exceeding system weight limits, would face surcharges of up to 97 cents for two-day air services to residential addresses from Dec. 17-23, UPS said. A 27-cent surcharge per package will apply to UPS’ ground service from Nov. 19 to Dec. 2 and between Dec. 17 and Dec. 23, UPS said. UPS declined to comment on FedEx’s surcharges, but said its own peak-season pricing makes sure its “appropriately compensated for the high value we provide at a time when the company must double daily delivery volume for six-to-seven consecutive weeks to meet customer demands.” Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said usually large shippers such as Amazon negotiate their own rates, so the impact from this would likely be limited.  A spokeswoman for Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment. FedEx and UPS shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday. FedEx Express and FedEx Ground in the U.S. and Canada will increase holiday surcharges for additional handling by $3 per package and for oversized goods by $25. FedEx will charge an extra $300 for parcels that exceed its maximum weight limit. FedEx said the new surcharges on oversize packages hit roughly 10 percent of its ground-shipping volume during the holiday rush and will be in place the week leading up to Black Friday through Christmas Eve. Amit Mehrotra, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, said UPS and FedEx “aren’t that far off from each other.” “FedEx will not be matching UPS as far as a blanket surcharge, but it is taking equal steps to manage its higher costs associated with oversized or extraordinary packages, things that are huge to push through their facilities.” ",8032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fedex-surcharge/fedex-will-not-charge-extra-for-most-holiday-home-deliveries-idUSKBN1AJ1V5

UPS (UPS.N), the world’s largest package delivery company, has restored service to more than 150 zip codes in Texas over the last 24 hours though operations remained at a standstill in storm-battered Houston and other Gulf Coast areas, UPS spokesman Matt O’Connor said. Trucks for both companies returned to deliveries on routes in Corpus Christi.  “The safety of our employees comes first and we will be resuming service as soon as it is safe to do so,” O’Connor said. “In Houston, that will come down to local areas that were impacted and how quickly water subsides.” The first UPS plane into Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport will land on Thursday afternoon and three flights were expected to depart Friday morning, O’Connor said. The airport was closed to commercial flight operations from Sunday and said limited flight operations were resuming Thursday afternoon. Memphis-based FedEx was also running some ramp operations at Bush and resumed limited delivery service in parts of Corpus Christi and Victoria, Texas, a spokeswoman said.  As of Thursday, FedEx Express service remained suspended in lake Charles and 22 cities in Louisiana, and more than 240 cities in Texas including Galveston, according to a company spreadsheet tracking disruptions. Harvey came ashore over the weekend as the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in a half-century. Days of heavy rains and flooding of streets, highways, and rail networks forced UPS (UPS.N) and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to shutter facilities and cease delivery to huge swaths of southeast Texas and Louisiana. UPS halted operations in Austin, northwest of Houston, and Corpus Christi, along the coast, before Harvey made landfall, O’Connor said. As of Thursday, package sorting facilities and deliveries resumed in Austin and in some areas of Corpus Christi. “Now that the weather is subsiding in communities in Corpus Christi, and our employees are able to come back home, we will continue to resume service as it is safe to do so,” O’Connor said. Two days ago, the storm stopped or sharply limited deliveries to more than 730 zip codes in Texas and Louisiana, he said.

Memphis-based FedEx was also running some ramp operations at Bush and resumed limited delivery service in parts of Corpus Christi and Victoria, Texas, a spokeswoman said.  As of Thursday, FedEx Express service remained suspended in lake Charles and 22 cities in Louisiana, and more than 240 cities in Texas including Galveston, according to a company spreadsheet tracking disruptions. Harvey came ashore over the weekend as the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in a half-century. Days of heavy rains and flooding of streets, highways, and rail networks forced UPS (UPS.N) and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to shutter facilities and cease delivery to huge swaths of southeast Texas and Louisiana. UPS halted operations in Austin, northwest of Houston, and Corpus Christi, along the coast, before Harvey made landfall, O’Connor said. As of Thursday, package sorting facilities and deliveries resumed in Austin and in some areas of Corpus Christi. “Now that the weather is subsiding in communities in Corpus Christi, and our employees are able to come back home, we will continue to resume service as it is safe to do so,” O’Connor said. Two days ago, the storm stopped or sharply limited deliveries to more than 730 zip codes in Texas and Louisiana, he said.

549,UPS,NY teamsters weigh pension cuts in groundbreaking vote,"WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Roughly 34,000 union members who work for United Parcel Service Inc and other logistics companies in New York will decide on Wednesday whether to accept deep pension cuts in what could be the start of a wave of benefit reductions to shore up union retirement plans. If approved, pensions for retired teamsters from nine New York local unions will be cut 29 percent, which the plan’s trustees have said will lower the typical monthly benefit for a retiree with 30 years service to $3,550 from $5,000.  The vote by New York teamsters comes as the Trump administration has appeared more willing to allow cuts to retiree payments to deal with a looming crisis facing millions of unionized workers, according to pension lawyers and consultants.  The vote is “probably the biggest pension event in my lifetime,” said John Bury of Bury and Associates Inc of Union, New Jersey, who advises pension plans. The New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund in August became the third multiemployer plan, and by far the largest, to receive U.S. Treasury approval for a rescue plan under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014. MPRA allows underfunded multiemployer plans to cut benefits, within certain limits, if the trustees can show it will prevent insolvency.     As many as 114 multiemployer pension plans covering 1.3 million workers are at risk of running out of money in 20 years, according to actuarial consulting firm Cheiron Inc. MPRA was adopted in part to shore up those plans without swamping the government’s pension insurer, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, which said in August its multiemployer insurance program could be broke by 2025. The trustees have said the teamsters fund will run out of money in less than 10 years if cuts are not made.  The teamsters plan covers workers employed by around 184 companies, including trucking companies ABF Freight Systems Inc and YRC Worldwide Inc.  United Parcel Service Inc, which contributes to the fund, is troubled by the proposed benefit cuts and is working on alternative rescue strategies, according to an emailed statement from UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara. Voting ends Wednesday, just before midnight.  The fund’s trustees have argued in plan documents that they have faced problems that have undermined many multiemployer pensions. Deregulation and automation have reduced the unionized workforce. Employers such as supermarket operator Penn Traffic Co liquidated after filing for bankruptcy, and others, including grocer Wegmans Food Markets Inc, withdrew from the plan. YRC was on the brink of bankruptcy in 2009 and cut a deal that lowered its contributions, according to plan documents.  As a result, healthy employers still in the plan are contributing more, which the trustees said in plan documents is unsustainable.   But union members say that the trustees are partly to blame for the fund’s financial woes. Led by UPS driver Mark Greene, some members funded a forensic investigation last year that alleged the trustees have relied on riskier investments, including allocating 64 percent of the fund’s portfolio to 170 alternative investment funds. The trustees have said alternative investments account for less than 45 percent of assets, which they said is customary for large plans. Greene and his allies face an uphill fight defeating the     proposed cuts, in part because “no” votes must outnumber not just votes in favor, but also non-votes.  Greene told Reuters that he and his allies have held discussions with lawyers and may sue to challenge the outcome if the proposal is approved.

550,UPS,"UPS expects to hire about 95,000 workers for holiday season","(Reuters) - U.S. package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Wednesday it expected to hire about 95,000 seasonal employees for the upcoming, crucial peak holiday season. These employees would support the expected increase in package volume that will begin in November and continue through January, UPS said. Peak season begins on Black Friday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday in November, and runs through early January when there is a large wave of returns. The number of seasonal workers UPS hires for the holiday season has not changed since 2014. The company has about 355,000 permanent employees in the United States. Up to 35 percent of seasonally hired employees over the last three years have become full-time employees, UPS said. UPS has been working closely with retailers to manage the holiday season surge in demand, since struggling with deliveries in 2013 and 2014. The company had grappled with bad weather and a late surge in e-commerce orders during the 2013 holiday season. On some days during last year’s holiday season, UPS’s average daily volume surpassed 30 million packages, far exceeding its normal daily average of more than 19 million. FedEx Corp (FDX.N), UPS’s main rival, is yet to announce its seasonal hiring plans. But both UPS and FedEx, often considered bellwethers for the U.S. economy, have spent billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, leaving investors chafing over the expense. UPS said in June it would levy surcharges on U.S. residential packages during the holiday season. U.S. retailers, such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Macy’s Inc (M.N), also announced holiday hiring to improve customer service on their sales floors and better handle the use of their stores to fulfill online orders.

566,UPS,UPS CEO says updated NAFTA better for economy than no trade treaty,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The top executive of United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Wednesday he is optimistic the U.S., Canadian and Mexican governments can successfully renegotiate NAFTA, and said not having a free trade agreement in place would not be good for the three countries’ economies.      “I’m still optimistic, but I think we’re going to have to go through some difficult times just because each of the countries has issues specific to them,” UPS CEO David Abney told Reuters. If a renegotiated treaty stimulates the economy, creates jobs and levels the playing field for the United States “then the North American market as a whole will be much stronger than without a free trade agreement,” he said. “Not having a free trade agreement would not be something we feel anyone would benefit from,” Abney added.  On Tuesday trade ministers from the United States, Canada and Mexico wrapped up a contentious round of talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement dominated by aggressive U.S. demands. They agreed to extend the talks into the first quarter of 2018.  Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, who made trade a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, has repeatedly threatened to terminate NAFTA if Mexico and Canada refuse major changes. UPS is the world’s largest package delivery company and favors modernizing NAFTA, including adding provisions for e-commerce and clarifying rules for small businesses to operate across borders.  “The supply chains are heavily intertwined between these three countries and I believe there’s a deal to be had that would be a win-win-win,” Abney said.      UPS would like tax reform proposals that Republicans plan to steer through Congress to focus on cutting the effective corporate tax rate to 20 percent, and eliminating loopholes and tax breaks. Atlanta-based UPS has had an effective tax rate of 34 percent for the last three years and has not benefited from loopholes or special preferences, Abney said. “If we’re talking about a 20 percent tax rate, then we wouldn’t have to hold our hands out looking for any kind of special benefit,” he said. “We would rather see that than a 25 percent rate with some loopholes in there that wouldn’t affect us much anyway.”  UPS would also like to be able to repatriate foreign earnings to invest in its network without paying a penalty, he said. Abney spoke to Reuters while attending a celebration for Detroit-based driver Tom Camp, who has driven 55 years without an accident, a UPS record. The 77-year-old former Marine has driven 1 million miles and delivered 5 million packages.

The rise of e-commerce and online retailers like Amazon (AMZN.O) has posed challenges for the shipping industry. The costs associated with delivering packages to residential addresses are higher than to businesses, which receive more packages and so bring more revenue per stop. Shipping firms are scrambling to reduce that extra cost. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, said its 4.9 percent increase would go into effect on Dec. 24 and apply to UPS Ground, UPS Air and International services, plus UPS Air Freight Rates in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.  The company’s main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said last month that rates at its FedEx Express unit will go up by an average of 4.9 percent for U.S. domestic, export and import services as of Jan. 1. Atlanta-based UPS also said it would raise surcharges for most residential packages for the 2018 peak season - the busy season leading up to the holidays in December - “by a few pennies.” For instance, the surcharge for UPS Next Day Air packages will rise to 84 cents in 2018 from 81 cents this year, while the peak surcharge for UPS Ground packages will increase to 28 cents from 27 cents.

569,UPS,UPS hit by hurricanes but rosy on holiday shipping,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported a slightly lower quarterly net profit on Thursday due to U.S. hurricanes and higher costs for Saturday delivery but lifted its full-year forecast, citing global shipping strength and expectations for the crucial holiday season. The world’s largest package delivery company, often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, expects to make about 750 million deliveries globally between the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and New Year’s Eve, about 40 million more than last year, it said. UPS CEO David Abney told analysts on a conference call his optimism for 2018 was growing on the strength of global trade, U.S. consumer spending, and proposed tax cuts. “Obviously the consumer is still driving the economy and especially for e-commerce we think that is just going to continue to grow,” Abney said. “There is also optimism about tax reform and what that can do to stimulate the economy.” The Atlanta-based company’s quarterly performance met Wall Street forecasts. Revenue at its core U.S. domestic package service rose 3.9 percent from a year ago to $9.65 billion, driven by deliveries of online purchases, it said. Shares were up 1 percent at $119.77 in early trading. UPS said it took a $50-million hit from hurricanes across the United States in August and September, and higher costs from Saturday delivery.  UPS’ international segment produced a record third-quarter operating profit of $627 million, up 8.9 percent, as a result of a strong global economy and new business following a June cyber attack on rival FedEx Corp’s (FDX.N) Dutch unit. UPS CFO Richard Peretz told analysts capital expenditures are likely to be around 8 percent of sales for 2018, higher than earlier forecasts of 6-7 percent, as the company adds 5 million square feet of capacity versus 1 million added in 2017. UPS and FedEx have spent billions of dollars upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas, leaving investors frustrated over the expense. UPS has also unveiled a number of new surcharges in recent years, seen as a way to manage the higher costs associated with e-commerce and unwieldy packages.   UPS said it would raise rates across many of its U.S. services by 4.9 percent from Dec. 24, and will also apply a new 2018 peak season surcharge for handling of large or awkward packages of $3.15. UPS posted third-quarter net income of $1.26 billion or $1.45 per share, compared with $1.27 billion or $1.44 per share a year earlier, and quarterly revenue of $15.98 billion from $14.93 billion. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.45 and revenue of $15.6 billion. The company said it expects full-year earnings per share in a range from $5.85 to $6.10.

570,UPS,UPS CEO says early peak charges reflect retailer demands,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) told customers about extra holiday charges for 2018 much earlier than it did this year to give major retailers a full year to plan shipping schedules and defray costs, Chief Executive David Abney said on Thursday. “We heard clearly from our customers that they do their planning a year in advance,” Abney told Reuters after UPS posted a lower quarterly profit but lifted its full-year earnings forecast partly on rosy expectations for the holidays. The world’s largest package delivery company announced Wednesday it would include some new 2018 holiday season surcharges and raise surcharges for most residential packages “by a few pennies.” UPS has worked for years to increase its visibility into customer shipping demands to avoid major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays.  The Atlanta-based company announced its 2017 peak surcharges in June. “So if (customers) can utilize the weekend before the peak surcharge kicks in, or get it to us the week before, they are going to be able to save, or for things that aren’t Christmas-important, having those ship out the week after Christmas is going to save our customers a lot of money,” Abney said.

Separately, Abney said UPS has an “ace-in-the-hole that we hope we don’t have to play” in the event the United States leaves the North American Free Trade Agreement because of its expertise in cross-border supply chains.  Mexico, the United States and Canada are in the midst of tough talks to renegotiate NAFTA. The latest round of formal discussions should take place in Mexico City next month. U.S. President Donald Trump, who made trade a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, has repeatedly threatened to terminate NAFTA if Mexico and Canada refuse major changes. “We have the systems, we have the people, we have the network to adjust to that,” Abney said. “It’s just that if they have these supply chains so scattered across these borders, it’s just going to make it very difficult and could drive up costs for our customers.”  ",10262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-results-ceo/ups-ceo-says-early-peak-charges-reflect-retailer-demands-idUSKBN1CV2X2
571,UPS,UPDATE 3-UPS hit by hurricanes but rosy on holiday shipping,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported a slightly lower quarterly net profit on Thursday due to U.S. hurricanes and higher costs for Saturday delivery but lifted its full-year forecast, citing global shipping strength and expectations for the crucial holiday season. The world’s largest package delivery company, often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, expects to make about 750 million deliveries globally between the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and New Year’s Eve, about 40 million more than last year, it said. UPS CEO David Abney told analysts on a conference call his optimism for 2018 was growing on the strength of global trade, U.S. consumer spending, and proposed tax cuts. “Obviously the consumer is still driving the economy and especially for e-commerce we think that is just going to continue to grow,” Abney said. “There is also optimism about tax reform and what that can do to stimulate the economy.” The Atlanta-based company’s quarterly performance met Wall Street forecasts. Revenue at its core U.S. domestic package service rose 3.9 percent from a year ago to $9.65 billion, driven by deliveries of online purchases, it said. Shares were up 1 percent at $119.77 in early trading. UPS said it took a $50-million hit from hurricanes across the United States in August and September, and higher costs from Saturday delivery.  UPS’ international segment produced a record third-quarter operating profit of $627 million, up 8.9 percent, as a result of a strong global economy and new business following a June cyber attack on rival FedEx Corp’s (FDX.N) Dutch unit. UPS CFO Richard Peretz told analysts capital expenditures are likely to be around 8 percent of sales for 2018, higher than earlier forecasts of 6-7 percent, as the company adds 5 million square feet of capacity versus 1 million added in 2017. UPS and FedEx have spent billions of dollars upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas, leaving investors frustrated over the expense. UPS has also unveiled a number of new surcharges in recent years, seen as a way to manage the higher costs associated with e-commerce and unwieldy packages.   UPS said it would raise rates across many of its U.S. services by 4.9 percent from Dec. 24, and will also apply a new 2018 peak season surcharge for handling of large or awkward packages of $3.15. UPS posted third-quarter net income of $1.26 billion or $1.45 per share, compared with $1.27 billion or $1.44 per share a year earlier, and quarterly revenue of $15.98 billion from $14.93 billion. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.45 and revenue of $15.6 billion. The company said it expects full-year earnings per share in a range from $5.85 to $6.10. Analysts expect $6.01 per share.      ",10262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/ups-results/update-3-ups-hit-by-hurricanes-but-rosy-on-holiday-shipping-idUSL2N1N10LS

586,UPS,"UPS reserves 125 Tesla semi-trucks, largest public pre-order yet","DETROIT (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Tuesday it is buying 125 Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) all-electric semi-trucks, the largest known order for the big rig so far, as the package delivery company expands its fleet of alternative-fuel vehicles. Tesla is trying to convince the trucking community it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and cargo capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks. This is the largest public order of the big rig so far, Tesla said. Tesla unveiled its semi last month and expects the truck to be in production by 2019.  The Tesla trucks will cost around $200,000 each for a total order of about $25 million. UPS expects the semi-trucks, the big rigs that haul freight along America’s highways, will have a lower total cost of ownership than conventional vehicles, which run at about $120,000.   Tesla has received pre-orders from such major companies as Walmart (WMT.N), fleet operator J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc  (JBHT.O) and food service distributor Sysco Corp (SYY.N) Prior to UPS, the largest single pre-order came from PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, for 100 trucks. UPS said it has provided Tesla with data on how its trucks function on their real-world routes in order to evaluate how the vehicle should perform in its fleet.   “As with any introductory technology for our fleet, we want to make sure it’s in a position to succeed,” Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told Reuters.  Phillippi said the 125 trucks will allow UPS to conduct a proper test of their abilities. He said the company was still determining their routes, but the semis will “primarily be in the United States.” Tesla will provide consultation and support on charging infrastructure. “We have high expectations and are very optimistic that this will be a good product and it will have firm support from Tesla to make it work,” Phillippi said.   The UPS alternative fuel fleet already includes trucks propelled by electricity, natural gas, propane and other non-traditional fuels.  About 260,000 semis, or heavy-duty Class-8 trucks, are produced in North America annually, according to FTR, an industry economics research firm. Including the UPS order, Tesla has at least 410 pre-orders in hand, according to a Reuters tally. Navistar International Corp (NAV.N) and Volkswagen AG VOWG-P.DE hope to launch a smaller, electric medium-duty truck by late 2019, while rival Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) has delivered the first of a smaller range of electric trucks to customers in New York.

590,UPS,"RPT-UPDATE 2-As online shopping grows, UPS sees record holiday package returns","(Repeats story first published earlier on Wednesday) By Eric M. Johnson SEATTLE, Dec 27 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc is on track to return a record number of packages this holiday shipping season, a sign that e-commerce purchases surged to new heights over the past month. The world’s largest package delivery company and rival FedEx Corp get paid by retailers like Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc for handling e-commerce deliveries. Both have benefited from booming delivery volumes over the past few years, but also have had to invest billions of dollars to upgrade and expand their networks to cope. UPS said on Wednesday it handled more than 1 million returns to retailers daily in December, a pace expected to last into early January. It said returns would likely peak at 1.4 million on Jan. 3, which would be a fifth consecutive annual record, up 8 percent from this year. The returns follow what could be the strongest holiday shopping season on record for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers, once stores publish sales data. Mastercard Inc said on Tuesday U.S. shoppers spent over $800 billion during the season, more than ever before. FedEx said on Wednesday it experienced another record-breaking peak shipping season, but declined to provide specifics. The company’s Chief Marketing Officer Rajesh Subramaniam told analysts last week about 15 percent of all goods purchased online are returned, with apparel running at about 30 percent. UPS said record-breaking e-commerce sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in late November jolted the returns season, with a larger flood of packages going back to retailers even as many gifts sat under Christmas trees. UPS has worked for years to increase its ability to forecast customer shipping demands to handle major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays. It has also raised shipping rates and added 2018 peak-season surcharges. The returns delivered in 2017 are part of the 750 million packages UPS said it expects to deliver globally during the peak shipping season from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Year’s Eve. That is an increase of nearly 40 million over the previous year. UPS and FedEx shares were both up slightly on Wednesday. (Reporting by Eric M.

591,UPS,"As online shopping grows, UPS sees record holiday package returns","SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. holiday shopping season is on track to break sales records on the back of surging consumer confidence and increased use of mobile devices, presenting an unexpected boon for retailers and the delivery companies they rely on. The holiday shopping season, a crucial period for retailers that can account for up to 40 percent of annual sales, brought record-breaking online and in-store spending this year of more than $800 billion, according to Mastercard Inc’s analytics arm. Stakes are particularly high this year for traditional retailers that have invested heavily in technology and free delivery and returns, determined to stay relevant in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.com Inc. “It has been an extremely positive holiday season in terms of sales both for brick-and-mortar and for online businesses,” said Shelley Kohan, a Retail Fellow at analytics firm RetailNext.  Preliminary numbers show total holiday sales will exceed RetailNext’s initial forecast of a 3.8 percent increase from last year. “All the economic indicators were very strong, and so I think consumers were more willing to open up their wallets and purses and spend more,” Kohan added. RetailNext and most other analytics firms and industry groups - including Adobe Analytics and the National Retail Federation - are due to publish holiday sales data in January. Mastercard Inc said on Tuesday that a late-season rally had driven an 18.1 percent rise in online sales. Department store chain Macy’s Inc and Target Corp both noted increased activity during that time. Target spokesman Joshua Thomas told Reuters that during the week before Christmas the company had seen a marked increase in shoppers picking up online orders in stores, while Macy’s spokeswoman Blair Rosenberg said last-minute shoppers boosted fragrance sales during that period.    The S&P; retail index was flat on Wednesday.    Package delivery companies that handle returns for retailers have benefited from booming delivery volumes in recent years, but also have had to invest billions of dollars to upgrade and expand their networks to cope as e-commerce purchases surge to new heights. Delivering individual packages to shoppers - and picking up returns - is a lower margin business for delivery companies, which make more when they deliver in bulk to businesses.  United Parcel Service Inc, the world’s largest package delivery company, said on Wednesday it was on track to return a record number of packages this holiday, having handled more than 1 million returns to retailers daily in December. That pace is expected to continue into early January, UPS said, and would likely peak at 1.4 million on Jan. 3, which would be a fifth consecutive annual record, up 8 percent from this year.

596,UPS,More retailer forecasts will prevent UPS peak shopping season bottlenecks: CEO,"(Reuters) - Getting more of its major retailer customers to share data on their holiday shipping needs will prevent a repeat of last year’s parcel delivery bottleneck, United Parcel Service Inc’s (UPS.N) Chief Executive told Reuters. The world’s largest package delivery company delivered a record 762 million packages, exceeding forecasts, during the peak U.S. holiday shopping season which runs from around the Thanksgiving Day holiday in late November through to Christmas in late December.   But around “Cyber Monday”, the first Monday after the annual Thursday Thanksgiving holiday in late November, those extra packages also exceeded its ability to handle them, adding about $125 million in fourth-quarter operating costs, UPS CEO David Abney said.  “Our forecasting during peak was extremely accurate,” Abney told Reuters after the company reported quarterly results on Thursday. “It was that cyber weekend and cyber week that we have to do a better job of working with our customers.”  UPS expected volume to increase 9.0 percent, but it increased 20 percent, around the time of Cyber Monday, he said. “When you are talking about that you are delivering 25-30 million packages a day, that 20 percent had a significant impact.”  This is not the first time UPS has experienced problems with balancing costs and resources in its network during peak season shopping, and those problems have persistently stemmed from its burgeoning, unpredictable and low-margin e-commerce business. A late surge in e-commerce orders and bad weather in 2013 left an estimated two million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve, mostly stranded in Atlanta-based UPS’s package network. Main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) experienced problems on a smaller scale.  In 2014, UPS spent $500 million, boosted seasonal hiring and worked with retailers to forecast package volumes that failed to materialize and overspending hurt fourth-quarter earnings. FedEx did not experience problems that year. Since getting peak season right in 2015, executives have said repeatedly UPS is deepening cooperation with major customers to improve visibility on orders and better manage network bulges.  The company has also invested heavily to handle ecommerce packages, while trying to figure out ways to cut the higher costs associated with delivering packages to residential addresses versus businesses. It has also raised shipping rates and added peak-season surcharges. [nL2N1N026T] Abney said UPS will expand the number of customers it receives package volume forecasts from. “The area that we’ve got to focus on of course for this year is cyber week, and we already announced changes in the surcharges that we think we will help that for 2018,” he said. “We’re going to continue to discuss other ways we can send that message across.”  Earlier Thursday, UPS reported a quarterly net profit that was boosted by growth in deliveries in the U.S. and abroad and benefits from changes to U.S. tax law, though its capital spending and the 2018 earnings outlook overshadowed its results.

597,UPS,"UPS shares slide on 2018 outlook, spending plans","(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) shares slid 7.0 percent on Thursday after it gave a 2018 earnings forecast that fell short of analyst estimates and said it would spend at least $6.5 billion this year improving its delivery network.  The world’s largest package delivery company and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) have already spent billions of dollars upgrading their networks to handle surging e-commerce package volumes, weighing on margins and leaving investors frustrated over the expense. But UPS said on Thursday there was still work to be done. Network bottlenecks that delayed some deliveries during the key holiday season cost about $125 million. It spent $1.5 billion on capital in the quarter, and some $60 million on installing new technology and automated capacity. “We are going to have significantly different capacity (by peak season 2018),” Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters after the company’s earnings topped Wall Street expectations but were overshadowed by the issue of spending and the 2018 earnings outlook. The rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for shipping demand, but UPS has struggled to bring down the extra costs of making more smaller deliveries to households, compared to businesses that on average receive more parcels at once. The investments show UPS is betting that if it can handle more volume it can increase the number of packages it delivers to households, and eventually improve margins and profitability, versus pushing for higher prices and less volume, said Stephens analyst Jack Atkins. “If they can’t get the delivery density - to date we haven’t seen a yearly improvement in density - that’s going to be a big problem,” Atkins said. Analysts on a call to discuss the results pushed UPS executives on when investors would see improved margin growth at its core U.S. business and why the company had not increased prices more. “We expect 2018 to have some challenges, because of the investment dollars,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz said. UPS said it would invest $6.5 billion to $7 billion in 2018, part of that on buying 14 Boeing 747-8 cargo jets and four Boeing 767s for its fleet. It plans 18 new or retrofitted facilities this year, including adding three U.S. ground hubs online later this year in areas where a surge in holiday online shopping orders overwhelmed its system.  UPS pegged its 2018 adjusted earnings per share at $7.03 to $7.37, with the lower end of that range falling short of the $7.16 per share analysts had been expecting on average. Earlier Thursday, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), the world’s largest package delivery company, reported a quarterly net profit on Thursday that was boosted by growth in deliveries in the U.S. and abroad and benefits from changes to U.S. tax law.  The Atlanta-based company posted fourth-quarter net income of $1.1 billion or $1.27 per share, up from a $239 million loss,  or a loss of 27 cents per share a year earlier.  Adjusted for one-time items, UPS reported earnings per share of $1.67. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.66.

Amazon is running “Shipping with Amazon” in Los Angeles and possibly other locations, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity. News of the test sparked investor concern that the world’s largest online retailer would upend the shipping market. FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) shares were down more than 4 percent in afternoon trading. FedEx, UPS and analysts played down the idea that a trial poses a near-term threat to the couriers’ businesses.  Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker estimated Amazon would have to invest $100 billion to build a global network of facilities, planes and trucks to compete with FedEx and UPS. See a graphic unpacking Amazon and the 'Prime economy' here: http://reut.rs/2EfyCqy The program, while still at an early stage, aims to reduce hurdles that some sellers face getting their inventory to Amazon’s facilities. Under the new process being tested, Amazon sends a truck to pick up sellers’ products, which then takes inventory either directly to an Amazon fulfillment center or to the U.S. Postal Service or to couriers like FedEx, depending on what’s most cost-effective, said the person who spoke to Reuters. Amazon has run a number of experiments in Los Angeles because the city is spread out and is a big market for deliveries. “Shipping with Amazon” is currently intended for select third-party sellers in the test, not for businesses in general, and still it is not yet ready to roll out widely to sellers on Amazon, said the person. FedEx and UPS customers should not expect to shift their business to Amazon any time soon. The Seattle-based company has considered taking work from the couriers on a conceptual level but does not have initiatives currently planned to ramp up competition, the person said. Amazon said on Friday it was “always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster lower-cost delivery choices.” UPS and FedEx have both spent billions of dollars in recent years to upgrade and expand their networks to handle soaring e-commerce volumes. UPS said last week it plans to spend $7 billion on upgrading its network this year alone. UPS and FedEx also consider Amazon an important customer. Amazon accounts for less than 10 percent of total revenue for UPS and 4 percent of revenue for FedEx, according to Wolfe Research analyst Scott Group. UPS and FedEx declined to comment on Amazon’s specific strategies or decisions regarding the utilization of their services. “There is tremendous opportunity in the business-to-customer market and more growth coming to the sector and UPS, irrespective of how other companies shift strategies,” UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said.

609,UPS,"RPT-Shares of UPS, FedEx fall after report Amazon to launch delivery service","(Repeats with no change to text or headline) By Eric M. Johnson Feb 9 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp shares fell 2 percent on Friday, after a report said Amazon.com Inc is preparing to launch a delivery service for businesses, which would directly compete with the U.S. package delivery companies. The e-commerce company expects to roll out a new delivery service, dubbed ""Shipping with Amazon"" or SWA, in Los Angeles in coming weeks, the Wall Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/2H4pZ4e) The service, which will entail Amazon picking up packages from businesses and shipping them to consumers, could expand to more cities as soon as this year, the report said. The program is being piloted with Amazon’s third-party sellers, and could eventually be opened to other businesses too, the Journal said adding that Amazon was planning to undercut UPS and FedEx on pricing, although the exact rate structure was still unclear. Shares of FedEx fell to $234.59, while UPS was at $106.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. “The headline in today’s Wall Street Journal demonstrates a lack of basic understanding of the full scale of the global transportation industry,” said FedEx spokesman Patrick Fitzgerald. UPS declined to comment about Amazon’s specific business strategies or Amazon’s decisions regarding the utilization of UPS services. “There is tremendous opportunity in the business-to-customer market (i.e. Walmart to household deliveries) and more growth coming to the sector and UPS, irrespective of how other companies shift strategies,” UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said. Amazon, which would have to invest $100 billion to compete with UPS and FedEx, according to some analysts, appears to be targeting the “last mile” deliveries to households fueled by online shopping, which has grown fast in recent years but is a lower margin business. “To date (Amazon) hasn’t made a meaningful push into the true transportation asset ownership we believe is necessary to be a competitor. It appears to be a difficult task to compete in this market as an asset light parcel delivery carrier,” Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee said. Amazon as a customer accounts for less than 10 percent of total revenue for UPS and 4 percent of revenue for FedEx, according to Wolfe research. Amazon said on Friday it was “always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster lower-cost delivery choices.” (Reporting by Eric Johnson in Seattle, and Ankit Ajmera and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2092018,http://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-delivery/rpt-shares-of-ups-fedex-fall-after-report-amazon-to-launch-delivery-service-idUSL4N1PZ53V

611,UPS,"Reshaped Maersk aims to deliver competition for UPS, Fedex","COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) plans to compete directly with package delivery companies UPS (UPS.N) and Fedex (FDX.N) as it expands its transport and logistics business, its chief executive said on Tuesday. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, sold its North Sea-focused oil and gas business in August to France’s Total (TOTF.PA) in a $7.5 billion deal in August as it focuses on transport and logistics.  As part of its restructuring, Maersk aims to expand its services to all parts of the supply chain, giving customers the chance to deal with one firm when shipping goods from one side  of the world to another. “We’re building this company that is a global integrated container business, a company very similar to UPS and Fedex,” CEO Soren Skou told investors at a capital markets day in Copenhagen on Tuesday. “I hope they will be considered peers of ours, when we are done with this journey in 3-5 years,” he added. The capital markets day was being held less than two weeks after the world’s largest container shipping firm missed profit forecasts and gave what analysts saw as a conservative outlook. Maersk has acknowledged that despite handling one in seven containers globally, being the biggest is no longer enough, as the growth of e-commerce is driving demand for quicker, easier and more flexible shipping. “Our customers businesses are to a large extent changing, they are being disrupted by new technologies, by e-commerce and new ways of doing things,” said Maersk’s chief commercial officer Vincent Clerc. Maersk is betting that a digital drive, in which it for example has teamed up with IBM (IBM.N) to create an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform, will allow it to offer more value-added services in areas such as freight forwarding and trade finance. However, on Tuesday investors were left with little detail on Maersk plans to monetize the blockchain project or how it will use the proceeds from breaking up the conglomerate. Shares in Maersk were trading 4.6 percent lower at 10,400 Danish crowns at 1420 GMT, below the August level when the Total sale was announced and around same level as when it announced its new strategy in September 2016.  “Many had hoped for something more specific for example with regards to how the proceeds from the sale of Maersk Oil will be distributed,” said Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard of the fall in share price. The firm still aims to find solutions this year for its offshore drilling and supply service unit, which is being valued at $4.7 billion and $0.6 billion respectively according to analysts’ consensus.

Maersk has acknowledged that despite handling one in seven containers globally, being the biggest is no longer enough, as the growth of e-commerce is driving demand for quicker, easier and more flexible shipping. “Our customers businesses are to a large extent changing, they are being disrupted by new technologies, by e-commerce and new ways of doing things,” said Maersk’s chief commercial officer Vincent Clerc. Maersk is betting that a digital drive, in which it for example has teamed up with IBM (IBM.N) to create an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform, will allow it to offer more value-added services in areas such as freight forwarding and trade finance. However, on Tuesday investors were left with little detail on Maersk plans to monetize the blockchain project or how it will use the proceeds from breaking up the conglomerate. Shares in Maersk were trading 4.6 percent lower at 10,400 Danish crowns at 1420 GMT, below the August level when the Total sale was announced and around same level as when it announced its new strategy in September 2016.  “Many had hoped for something more specific for example with regards to how the proceeds from the sale of Maersk Oil will be distributed,” said Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard of the fall in share price. The firm still aims to find solutions this year for its offshore drilling and supply service unit, which is being valued at $4.7 billion and $0.6 billion respectively according to analysts’ consensus.

613,UPS,"Maersk says to compete with UPS, Fedex as conglomerate breaks up","COPENHAGEN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A.P. Moller-Maersk plans to expand its transport and logistics business to compete directly with package delivery companies UPS and Fedex as part of a major restructuring, its chief executive said Tuesday. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, has sold off the majority of its energy assets to focus entirely on transport and logistics. “We’re building this company that is a global integrated container business, a company very similar to UPS and Fedex,” CEO Soren Skou told investors at a capital markets day in Copenhagen on Tuesday. “I hope they will be considered peers of ours, when we are done with this journey in 3-5 years,” he added.

In a digitisation drive, Maersk has teamed up with IBM to create an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform it says will allow it to offer more value-added services in areas like freight forwarding and trade finance. In the biggest deal in breaking up the Maersk conglomerate, French oil major Total purchased the company’s North Sea-focused oil and gas business in August in a $7.5 billion deal. Shares in Maersk were trading 3.7 percent lower at 10,495 Danish crowns at 1003 GMT, below the August level when the Total sale was announced and around same level as when it announced its new strategy in September 2016.

615,UPS,UPS-Workhorse electric van deal shows progress on charging costs,"DETROIT (Reuters) - A deal Thursday between UPS (UPS.N) and U.S. electric van maker Workhorse Group Inc (WKHS.O) shows how the delivery industry is making progress to resolve a major obstacle to deployment of battery-powered commercial vehicles: Charging costs. UPS, like its rivals in the package delivery business, faces pressure from regulators in major cities around the world to clean up its fleet of petroleum-burning vehicles. UPS is partnering with Workhorse to build an all-new electric delivery van. The first 50 vehicles with a driving range of 100 miles (160 km) will be delivered in 2018.  That range is enough to allow UPS to replace around 35,000 diesel or gasoline delivery trucks, company officials said. Until recently, however, UPS would have faced substantial costs for the charging stations and related infrastructure to top up the batteries at the end of the day. “With the large-scale deployments of vehicles, if you can’t put them somewhere to take advantage of them then it’s irrelevant,” Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told Reuters. “We have to have solutions in place to make that happen.”  Solutions for the charging problem are now in sight, UPS and other industry officials say. UPS recently rolled out “smart charging” software at a central London facility that allowed the company to nearly triple its local electric fleet to 170 delivery vans.       The smart charging technology determines when and how fast to charge vehicles. If vehicles are not scheduled for a full route the next day, the system can opt not to fully charge them and charge other vehicles more. Without the software, UPS would have had to install enough infrastructure to charge all the vehicles at the same time - the equivalent of powering an office building or hospital - at a cost of millions of dollars for electric grid hardware. The project at UPS’s London facility was partly funded by Innovate UK, the British government innovation agency. If successful, UPS will use its London experience as a blueprint around the world as it expands its electric delivery vehicle fleet. UPS’ approach could also serve as a model for smaller companies that cannot afford major infrastructure investments.     “If this solution didn’t exist, it would cost too much money for small companies to upgrade their connection capacity,” said Christos Keramisanos, a consultant at UK Power Networks Services(UKPNS) [EDFIBG.UL] in charge of the UPS project in London.      Charging costs are critical as delivery fleet operators calculate the costs of switching to electric vehicles.    Hermes, a European delivery service, plans to deploy 1,500 electric Mercedes vans, and is working with Daimler AG’s (DAIGn.DE) commercial van unit to design recharging systems that do not require new transformers or large numbers of individual charging stations, said Benjamin Kaehler, head of Mercedes’ electric van business.    Mercedes’ goal is to structure charging costs so an electric van has the same total cost of ownership as a petroleum-fueled van over three years, Kaehler told Reuters. Cheaper charging is key to that goal.     “That’s the breakthrough,” he said. U.S. truck leasing and rental company Ryder System Inc (R.N), which has bought electric vans from Chanje, a unit of China’s FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd (0729.HK), is already training its technical and sales staff on smart charging technology.  “Ryder is aware the world is going electric and we are preparing for that future,” said Chris Nordh, Ryder’s director of advanced vehicle technology. “Smart charging is key to creating scale.”  Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments - $1.7 trillion in battery plants, manufacturing and chargers, and $1 trillion on distribution and generation capacity, said Balu Balagopal, a partner in A.T.Kearney’s energy practice. His estimate is based on an assumption that 64 percent of the global vehicle fleet is electrified by 2040.  Utility regulations are an obstacle. The United States lacks national standards for recovering the costs of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure.     For Tesla’s “Semi” big rig - far larger than a delivery van - customers such as PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O), Anheuser-Busch Inbev (ABI.BR) and UPS plan to build their own charging stations.         California has moved to allow utilities to recoup investments and is reviewing proposals from utilities to spend more than $1 billion over five years on electrification infrastructure for cars, buses and trucks.    Other states do not allow utilities to spread electric vehicle infrastructure costs across their broad base of ratepayers.     “The right structures haven’t been put in place to allow us to operate and participate in this market,” said Lang Reynolds, electric transportation manager at Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) of Charlotte, North Carolina, which serves several southeastern U.S. states.

616,UPS,UPS partners with Workhorse to build electric delivery vans,"DETROIT (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Thursday it is partnering with truck maker Workhorse Group Inc (WKHS.O) to build electric delivery vans that could replace tens of thousands of vehicles in the package delivery company’s fleet. The two companies said the first 50 vans will have a range of 100 miles (160 km) and will be delivered in 2018.  Atlanta-based UPS said it has approximately 35,000 diesel or gasoline trucks currently in service in urban and suburban areas that are comparable in size and run on routes comparable to the new vehicle’s range. “We see this vehicle as being a game changer in the electric truck arena,” Carlton Rose, UPS’ president for global fleet maintenance and engineering told Reuters. “It’s also an industry first because the acquisition cost is comparable to gas and diesel.”  The Workhorse delivery vehicles will cost about the same as conventional trucks, but have a lower cost of ownership because they are cheaper to run on a per-mile basis.  Vehicle manufacturers such as Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) and Navistar International Corp (NAV.N), plus a host of new entrants, are racing to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines in delivery vehicles as regulators crack down on carbon dioxide and soot pollution. Daimler said last fall UPS will be the first U.S. commercial customer for its new battery-powered eCanter truck, and the automaker will expand production as cheaper, longer-range batteries become available within two to three years. And U.S. truck leasing and rental company Ryder System Inc (R.N) said in November it would order 125 all-electric delivery vans from Chanje, whose main investor is FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd (0729.HK). Loveland, Ohio-based Workhorse has already sold around 300 delivery vehicles to UPS and has been testing package deliveries with drones for the company. UPS’ Rose said the vans would be lightweight, which will help boost their range and will have fast-charging capability.  Workhorse is already testing its lightweight N-Gen model, which has a carbon composite frame, in California and Ohio for an unnamed customer. That vehicle weighs 5,500 lbs (2,495 kg) when empty - 5,000 lbs lighter than comparable vehicles.

624,UPS,Maersk's port business woos customers with new transport services,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk’s (MAERSKb.CO) is betting on winning new customers for its port division by becoming a one-stop shop that can transport goods from factory to retailers’ shelves. The move comes as Maersk, the world’s biggest container shipper, is entering uncharted territory following its sale last year of most of its energy businesses. This marked a major shift of focus for the group towards transport and logistics. Last month, Maersk said it aimed to expand its port and transport services, giving customers the chance to deal with one company when shipping goods from factory to shop shelf. Maersk has said it aims to become a global integrator of container logistics and is looking to models similar to the courier express and package industry, where customers deal with just one company such as UPS (UPS.N) or FedEx (FDX.N). But   Maersk has no plans to enter the courier and package business. As part of the expansion, APM Terminals, the group’s port division, which operates 74 port facilities and handled nearly 40 million containers last year, will expand onshore services to cater to companies like railway operators and freight haulers.     “If we’re going to optimise Maersk’s entire end-to-end supply chain then of course we need to optimise one of the points that could otherwise be a bottleneck and that’s the port,” APM Terminal’s chief commercial officer Henrik Lundgaard Pedersen said in an interview. Pedersen said customers were increasingly asking for add-on services at the port terminals, which are the effective “nerve centre” for transporting cargo around the world. He said customers’ were looking to deal with “fewer business partners to do the same or more types of services.” The new services include streamlining the process of weighing, stripping and filling the shipping containers and improving trucker appointment systems for delivery and pick-up. “In some parts of the world, truckers can wait hours outside our terminals,” Pedersen said. The planning to reduce waiting time is becoming “very, very critical,” he said.     As part of the plans, APM Terminals has set up landside facilities within customers’ premises in Peru and Chile so it can take charge of a cargo before it even leaves the mine or plantation. “We go all the way into where they grow the grapes, then we help them get them into the right container and all the way through the port to your dining table,” Pedersen said. In Mexico, for example, APM Terminals organizes train transport from the Pacific Coast to premises close to Mexico City. Maersk captured synergies worth $100 million last year from integrating its transport and logistics business and targets total synergies of $600 million by 2019. Pedersen declined to give details on what investments were expected, but said capital expenditure for handling equipment was “much less” than when taking cargo from ship to shore. APM Terminals is the second-biggest division after Maersk Line, the world’s largest container shipper, and it accounted for around 13 percent of revenue last year.

629,UPS,UPDATE 3-FBI reminds couriers on suspicious package protocols after Texas bombings,"(Rewrites throughout with FBI notice to parcel delivery companies) By Eric M. Johnson March 21 (Reuters) - The FBI has reminded parcel delivery companies in the United States to follow “established protocols” for handling suspicious packages following a bomb blast at a FedEx Corp sorting facility in Texas, an agency spokeswoman said on Wednesday. A three-week bombing spree, which sent a shiver through the Texas capital of Austin and rattled the rest of the country, raised fears about the possibility of other attackers via package delivery. “In light of the bombings in Austin the FBI has reached out to our private-sector partners to remind them of established protocols of how to handle suspicious packages,” Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Lindsay Ram said by email. There was no suggestion by the FBI that FedEx had not followed protocols to the letter. Federal prosecutors said on Wednesday they had charged Mark Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas, with unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device before he blew himself up as police closed in on his vehicle. FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc and other couriers collect a vast amount of data on packages in their systems. Some of the information may have helped identify the man who carried out the bombings, a FedEx executive said. FedEx Chief Operations Officer David Bronczek told employees in an internal memo seen by Reuters that the company provided “key evidence” to law enforcement officials on identifying the suspect. The FBI’s Ram did not elaborate on whether the agency was concerned about other deadly packages that may have slipped into a mail network that handles roughly 40 million parcels daily in the United States. FedEx was taking the extraordinary step of screening every package at the sorting facility outside Austin where a parcel bomb exploded on a conveyor belt on Tuesday. It was also x-raying entire trailers filled with packages at that location and other trailers with packages originating from central Texas, a FedEx manager said. FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey declined to comment on package screening and on the evidence FedEx provided authorities. Like FedEx, UPS shipping terms and conditions allow employees to open and inspect packages, and the companies train employees on how to respond if they see packages that look suspicious or may contain drugs. FedEx and UPS have so far not described steps they may take to expand screening. UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the company constantly evaluates and adjusts its security measures, but does not discuss them in order to maintain their effectiveness. The United States Postal Service said in a statement that although it appeared none of the devices in Austin were sent through the U.S. mail, USPS reminded employees and customers to be observant about suspicious packages. Inspectors in its Dangerous Mail Investigations Program “are trained to recognize the common characteristics of suspicious mail and are highly proficient in the use of state-of-the-art equipment to include portable X-ray machines,” the USPS said. The FedEx manager said in-bound international shipments are screened by x-ray or bomb-sniffing dogs, and said the Texas blast could lead to changes in domestic security screening. Airport-like security measures inside package sorting facilities and retail locations would be a costly and unnecessary step that would paralyze operations, particularly given the rarity of package bombs, said Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground.

630,UPS,UPDATE 5-Amazon finishes higher despite Trump's new threat on shipping rates,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest American business lobby group came to the defense of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Tuesday after a multi-day Twitter attack by U.S. President Donald Trump that included unsubstantiated criticism of the world’s biggest online retailer. The value of Amazon (AMZN.O) shares held by Jeff Bezos, the online retailer’s chief executive and single largest shareholder, had taken a $10 billion hit in the week since Trump began attacking him and his company on Twitter. Citing an unspecified report, Trump told reporters at the White House that the company was not paying the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate, and that it was costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars and forcing other retailers out of business, and he threatened to raise rates. Late on Tuesday afternoon, a source familiar with proceedings at the White House said no specific actions addressing Trump’s concerns about Amazon were on the table at the White House at this time, but that could change given Trump’s dissatisfaction with the company.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the country, stepped in on Tuesday to defend Amazon, which is a member. “It’s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,” Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement, citing the value of the free enterprise system and the rule of law. “The record is clear: deviating from those processes undermines economic growth and job creation.” It is not the first time Trump, or another U.S. president, has been publicly critical of a company. Trump has previously criticized automakers, Carrier Corp, which is owned by United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). In 2015, then-President Barack Obama criticized office supply company Staples Inc for not embracing the Affordable Care Act, drawing a quick rebuke from Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Trump has progressively escalated his criticism of Amazon and Bezos, who also privately owns The Washington Post, which has published stories that have angered the president. Bezos, ranked by Forbes magazine as the world’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $115.6 billion, owns 78.89 million Amazon shares, worth about $110 billion at Tuesday’s market close. Amazon shares closed up 1.5 percent at $1,392.05. The shares started the day higher but fell as low as $1,355.33 after Trump’s latest Amazon-related tweet. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but he has offered no evidence to back up his criticisms. “The post office is losing billions of dollars ... because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “If you look at the cost that we’re subsidizing, we’re giving a subsidy to Amazon.” Trump offered no details about the report he cited or how he might charge the company more through USPS. Amazon also ships packages through providers such as FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) as well as its own experimental shipping service. Representatives of Amazon and USPS had no comment on Trump’s tweet on Tuesday and could not be immediately reached regarding his latest comments to reporters.

634,UPS,"UPS goes Groupon, launching discounts for retailers","ATLANTA (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) is taking a page out of a retailer’s playbook, offering discounts on everything from Costco (COST.O) memberships to luxury clothes and Disneyland tickets to loyal customers, UPS said on Wednesday. The UPS My Choice Deals program, first reported by Reuters, appears to mark the first time the world’s largest package deliverer is hoping to cash in on shippers’ products directly. More than 43 million global consumers will get access to some 500 deals - like 10 percent off Goodyear tires, 20 percent off Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] luxury clothes, or the ability to donate half of one percent of an Amazon purchase to charity. UPS hopes to drum up more business and build brand loyalty for retailers, who hopefully would choose UPS over rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) or other couriers, including Amazon’s own logistics and delivery operations. “If you are receiving something from Macy’s (M.N), you’ll have an additional deal from Macy’s right there in your alert,” Stu Marcus, UPS vice president of customer technology marketing, said in an interview at its Atlanta headquarters.  My Choice helps recipients track parcels to their door or choose alternative delivery locations, like an office or a UPS retail store. The program was launched in 2011 to cut higher costs associated with “last mile” delivery to residential addresses by reducing multiple delivery attempts, returns, and customer complaints to retailers.  Robert W. Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford said the deals program is part of UPS’ efforts to increase the penetration of My Choice. “My Choice enhances customer satisfaction because it provides them more control,” Hartford said, adding that My Choice could streamline its network, speed up deliveries and reduce per-unit costs and improve margins. The discount program, tested over the last year and now being rolled out nationwide, reflects changes in UPS’ business, Marcus said. In 2011 deliveries to households amounted to about 40 percent of volume, with deliveries between businesses making up the rest. Currently, about half of volume goes directly to households. My Choice deals are sent to customers in banner ads attached to delivery notifications, or consumers can log into a website to peruse them, Marcus said. Discount loyalty programs have been long used by retailers, including Amazon’s Prime membership, Groupon Inc (GRPN.O), or Brad’s Deals.  UPS gets a commission on the deals for promoting the products, Marcus said, declining to discuss revenue expectations.  “These are active customers receiving deliveries, so the customers who signed up for My Choice have already proven they are willing to receive goods and they are willing to order online. It is a very active group of customers that shippers want to be engaged with,” Marcus said.

636,UPS,"More parcels, higher prices lift UPS profit but costs soar","NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported higher first-quarter net profit on Thursday, driven by strong package volumes in its core U.S. segment, but higher costs from Saturday delivery and nasty winter weather weighed on the bottom line. Shares were up 2.2 percent in morning trade after the world’s largest package delivery company said revenue increased 10 percent to $17.1 billion in the first quarter from a year ago, topping analyst expectations of $16.47 billion.  Revenue at its core U.S. package service rose 7.2 percent to $10.2 billion from a year-ago, driven by a 4.6-percent rise in parcel volumes that reflected growth of online purchases.  However, severe winter weather dragged down its operating profit by $85 million, as did higher expenses for network improvements, higher pension costs, and a big expansion of Saturday delivery over the last year. Operating profit in its core domestic segment plummeted 20 percent, and was down 6 percent overall. “Higher costs continue to pressure earnings,” Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. “In general, the company struggles with capacity issues during the peak season (the weeks leading up to Christmas), and could have issues achieving their EPS target unless their performance improves.” UPS, seen as an indicator of U.S. economic strength and consumer demand, reaffirmed its 2018 earnings per share range of $7.03 to $7.37 and maintained its 2018 spending plan of between $6.5 billion to $7 billion on network improvements like new technology and automating its parcel sorting hubs. Chief Executive David Abney has promised to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions to handle the growth of e-commerce, as investors bristle over the costs.  The rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for shipping demand, but UPS has struggled to bring down the extra costs of delivering to households which on average receive fewer packages at one time than businesses. Revenue per parcel delivered rose just 2.6 percent, as higher prices and fuel surcharges offset the higher costs, the company said. Analysts on a conference call asked Abney about Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) efforts to expand its own delivery capacity for volume traditionally handled by UPS and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N). “It’s very hard to predict what Amazon or any other of our large shippers are going to do,” Abney said, adding UPS would evaluate any market moves and react accordingly.  UPS appears to be seeking out new ways to shave costs. On Wednesday, it offered early-retirement payouts to U.S. management employees, but declined to say how many employees it expects to leave. Abney also said UPS was making progress on non-wage matters during protracted negotiations with the Teamsters union on a contract ending July 31. UPS posted first-quarter net income of $1.35 billion or $1.55 per share, up from $1.17 billion or $1.33 per share a year earlier, a 17 percent rise on a per share basis.

641,UPS,Exclusive: UPS weighs strategy to deliver bulky goods to boost growth,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) is in talks with at least one U.S. trucking firm to launch an in-home delivery service for large, heavy goods such as couches and treadmills, as the world’s largest package deliverer looks to cash in on one the fastest growing segments of online retail. UPS and its rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) currently deliver parcels up to 150 pounds (68.04 kg) in weight to a person’s door step, and neither carries packages into a person’s home or handles so-called “white glove” services such as product assembly or installation. UPS told Reuters it is now eyeing the furniture delivery business - one of the fastest-growing segments of online retail - with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Wayfair Inc (W.N) and other e-commerce companies competing for market share against chains like Crate and Barrel and big-box stores. A source familiar with the matter said UPS is in talks to hire trucking company Werner Enterprises (WERN.O) to help it compete in this area, potentially by the end of the year. Werner launched its “final-mile” service in 2016, and has been building it out over the last year. Details of a potential partnership remain unclear given the early stages of the discussions, the source added.    Werner declined to comment on the matter, and UPS would not identify who it is in talks with. Final-mile delivery is a market that Transport Futures economist Noel Perry said could grow to about $12 billion over the next decade, from about $3.7 billion today, thanks in large part to a growing appetite from younger consumers to buy everything from BBQ grills and mattresses to dining room tables online. “Outsourcing to a trucking firm would allow UPS to enter into the final-mile business without committing its own capital up front to expand its fleet or acquire end-of-line, final-mile infrastructure such as terminals,” R.W. Baird analyst Ben Hartford said.  That could be welcome news to UPS investors waiting on Chief Executive David Abney’s promise to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions.  When asked about the strategy with bulky goods in an interview with Reuters, UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber said the company has decided it can’t ignore the rising demand for in-home deliveries of furniture, mattresses, and treadmills, and was evaluating different ways to handle the larger cargo. “You got bigger products moving through networks across the globe,” said Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber. “What we have to do is try and figure out the right way to get them in the right network as we move forward.” Barber did not confirm talks with any specific company, and said that UPS has not made a final decision “because you have to balance it with our Express network, our labor constraints and our strategy going forward.”       Other trucking players include Schneider National (SNDR.N), Ryder System Inc (R.N), Seko Logistics, and J.B. Hunt, which have expanded final-mile capabilities organically or through partnerships and acquisitions in recent years, hoping to lure major retailers with their scale. Schneider and XPO Logistics (XPO.N), the largest provider of final-mile bulky deliveries in North America, told Reuters they had not met with UPS to discuss handling final-mile deliveries. J.B. Hunt and Ryder declined to comment. Seko did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As it is now, most of the major trucking and logistics firms in this final-mile bulky goods business hire regional contract-carriers – and there are hundreds nationwide – to haul products from warehouses to living rooms across the country. If UPS moves forward, it would give UPS’ retail customers including Wayfair, Amazon.com, Walmart Inc (WMT.N), IKEA AB and Target Corp (TGT.N) a “big and heavy option” in their online shipping portals so consumers can receive  shipments across the country, the source said.  It could also set up UPS to hit its goal of being a one-stop shipping partner for retailers while also solving the problem of sofa-sized boxes unexpectedly showing up in trailers they pick up from retailer warehouses and take to parcel sorting hubs.  UPS has worked for years to limit the sizes of unwieldy - or “non-conveyable” - items as it invests to speed up its package-sorting operation.  It charges big premiums to handle the freight.  UPS main rival FedEx  said in March the expansion of its Memphis hub will include an area for oversized shipments and announced it bought UK-based deliverer P2P Mailing Limited. But a company spokesman said FedEx does not yet do in-home heavy goods deliveries in the United States. Entering the bulk goods delivery business adds new complexities and risks compared to traditional parcel delivery. For example, hauling a dresser to an upstairs bedroom and assembling it is a more intricate and physically demanding affair than dropping off a pallet at a warehouse’s loading dock. XPO Logistics’ Chief Information Officer Mario Harik said in an interview it was training drivers on etiquette and how to use mobile devices to log deliveries and customer complaints for large or heavy deliveries.    Truckers can charge more for “white glove” services - which include varying degrees of installation, product assembly, and repairs - but the margins are often no better than other types of deliveries because stiff competition for new business has held down the prices carriers can charge retailers.  But deliverers are hoping they can hike prices and boost margins as they increase delivery “density,” or the number of deliveries they make in a region on a given day, said Hartford, the R.W. Baird analyst.   Heavy goods deliveries through UPS would likely include two workers willing to spend 20 minutes in a home, versus more complex installation and repairs, the source said. UPS declined to discuss the growth potential, but the source familiar with the strategy said UPS was looking initially for a trucking partner that could make or manage as many as “tens of thousands” of deliveries daily.
