2,CVS,Medicare Part D sees falling drug costs: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cheaper generic drugs will continue to hold down costs for the government, insurers and patients enrolled in the federal prescription drug benefit, according to a report released on Friday.  Researchers said eight of the ten most commonly prescribed drug classes covered by the program known as Medicare Part D have fallen to an average daily cost of therapy of $1 in December 2010 from $1.50 in January 2006.  This trend toward cheaper generic drugs, as brand-name patents expire, is expected to continue through 2015, said the study by Murray Aitken of the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics and Ernst Berndt of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Bureau of Economic Research.  The study forecast the average cost of therapy to fall to 65 cents a day by the end of 2015, or 57 percent lower than it was in January 2006.  The findings could temper some of the concern over the growing costs of Part D that subsidizes medicines for seniors and disabled Medicare patients who pay some of the costs through insurance plans and out of pocket.  Part D went into effect in 2006 after being created under 2003 legislation passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed into law by then-President George W. Bush. It has been criticized for being insufficiently funded, a costly drag on the healthcare system and a contributor to the national debt.  Companies such as Aetna Inc, CVS Caremark Corp and Humana Inc sell the Part D plans, but are overseen by the Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  Last year, 34.5 million Americans were enrolled in Part D plans, receiving an average of $1,789 in benefits, according to a report issued in May by the Medicare Trustees.  The trustees said almost $62 billion was spent on Part D prescription drug benefits in 2010 and projected that this year’s spending will reach $67 billion, growing to almost $157 billion by 2020 as the aging U.S. population sees more and more people enroll.  But the authors of Friday’s study said that may be overstating the costs.  “The general conclusion we draw is that cost declines observed in the first five years of Medicare Part D can be expected to continue,” the researchers wrote.  “The 2006-2015 decade is one of steadily decreasing average daily cost of therapy.”  Berndt, a co-author, said CMS has fairly consistently over-projected future prescription drug costs.  “(It) doesn’t properly take into account reasonably predictable patent protection expirations,” he told reporters on a conference call.

4,CVS,Express Scripts to buy Medco for $29 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Express Scripts Inc will buy rival Medco Health Solutions Inc for $29.1 billion, creating a U.S. powerhouse in managing prescription drug benefits that is sure to draw antitrust scrutiny.  The deal would be the biggest ever in the healthcare services industry and give Express Scripts close to one-third of the pharmacy benefits market, gaining much more leverage for negotiating drug prices for employers and other clients who must reduce their exposure to spiraling healthcare costs.  The industry’s expertise in managing pharmacy spending has made its services all the more attractive and lured new competitors like insurer UnitedHealth Group.  The deal would also give the combined company greater clout against drugstore chains like Walgreen Co and increase competition with the likes of CVS Caremark Corp.  “They would be more than twice as big as their next largest competitor,” Morningstar analyst Matthew Coffina, referring to CVS. “Scale is really what matters in this business in terms of bargaining power relative to suppliers, the ability to operate mail order facilities and process claims efficiently.”  Express Scripts will pay $71.36 per Medco share, a 28 percent premium to Medco’s closing price on Wednesday. Medco shareholders will receive $28.80 cash and 0.81 of an Express Scripts share for each Medco share they own.  Medco shares closed up just 14.4 percent at $63.83. The gap between the offer price and Medco’s share price reflects skepticism that U.S. regulators will approve a deal that would whittle the large industry players down to two from three. Coffina gave it a less than 50 percent chance.  “It’s like a coin flip right now about whether it gets approved or not,” Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas said.  Express Scripts is an experienced acquirer, having struck more than a half dozen sizable deals since 1998, though this would easily be its biggest. It recently finished integrating its roughly $4.7 billion purchase of the drug benefits unit of insurer WellPoint Inc. In 2007, Express Scripts failed in a bid to wrest away Caremark from CVS.  Express Scripts shares closed up 5.4 percent at $55.36.  Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and also run extensive mail-order pharmacies.  The Medco-Express Scripts deal would create a company with 1.6 billion annual prescription claims, while CVS Caremark would be second at 940 million, said JMP Securities analyst Constantine Davides.  “There will be an antitrust hurdle to clear,” Davides said. “It will take a while on the regulatory front, but it’s a consolidating industry.”  Express Scripts Chief Executive Officer George Paz, building a defense against antitrust concerns, said the combination would reduce the ballooning healthcare costs that have helped fuel the U.S. budget deficit.  “This is a transaction the nation needs now,” Paz said on a call with analysts. “We wouldn’t be doing this if we didn’t think we didn’t have a very good chance of getting this through.”  Sharon Treat, a Maine state legislator who has been critical of PBMs, said the industry was concentrated even before this deal.  “It’s more likely to increase the prices that consumers pay when they go to a pharmacy to fill their prescriptions,” said Treat, who is also executive director of the National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug Prices.  The Medco-Express Scripts agreement provides for a break-up fee in certain circumstances, but not in the event of failure to obtain regulatory clearance.  Medco, the bigger company in terms of revenue, suffered a major setback in May when it lost a big pharmacy benefits contract to CVS. That came soon after Medco lost a contract with Calpers, the biggest U.S. public pension fund.  On Thursday, the company said its account with UnitedHealth, which represents 17 percent of Medco’s revenue, would not be renewed. UnitedHealth is building up its own drug benefits business and stands to become a serious competitor.  “Given the attrition risk Medco faces over the next few years, in regard to the UnitedHealth contract going away in 2013 and other publicized losses, (the Express Scripts pact is) a good deal for Medco and their shareholders,” Davides said.  Medco said on Thursday its quarterly profit fell 4 percent to $342.8 million, while total prescription volumes rose 0.5 percent. Express Scripts said its net profit rose more than 15 percent to $334.2 million.  At 10 times Medco’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the deal is in line with previous acquisitions in the PBM industry valued at 10 to 12 times EBITDA, Jonas said.  Credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook on Express Scripts to negative after the deal’s announcement, citing significant integration risk in addition to its “temporarily stretched” financial risk profile.  On completion of the transaction, Express Scripts shareholders are expected to own about 59 percent of the combined company, with Medco shareholders owning the rest.  The combined company’s corporate headquarters will be in St. Louis and Paz will be chairman and CEO. The board of directors will be expanded to include two current independent Medco board members.  Express Scripts projected $1 billion in cost savings, about 1 percent of the combined company’s costs. It said the deal would slightly add to earnings in the first full year after closing, which is expected in the first half of 2012.

6,CVS,Generic Zocor propelled pharmacy benefits business," NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Express Scripts (ESRX.O) and Medco Health Solutions MHS.N may not be household names, but they have charted a 20-year rise to a leading role in lowering the cost of medicines for millions of Americans.   Founded in the 1980s, the two companies — now planning a $29.1 billion merger — became major players in healthcare with the introduction of cheap generic versions of Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) multibillion-dollar cholesterol drug Zocor in 2006.   Both are pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that negotiate and administer drug benefits for employers and health plans to help control rising healthcare costs. Combined they would command nearly one-third of the market, followed by CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N).   They helped push the adoption of generic Zocor by insurers, doctors and patients, and have been a driving force in the use of cheaper medicines. Generic drug use rates now top 70 percent.   Generic Zocor “really created all sorts of new opportunities to find savings for clients by increasing generic penetration and transformed the PBMs into very important cogs in the pharmaceutical supply chain wheel,” said Morningstar analyst Matthew Coffina.   Use of generics not only saves money for clients but carries a higher profit margin for PBMs than more expensive branded medicines.   “Zocor helped put them on the map because they moved medication very quickly from brand to generic. That was confirmation that the PBM model had legs,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Helene Wolk.   Although around for more than 20 years, PBMs really came into their own within the past 10 years as inflation of prescription drugs spending hit the double-digit percentages. The next industry boom is right around the corner.   In 2012, some of the world’s top-selling prescription drugs begin facing generic competition in the United States, including Pfizer’s (PFE.N) cholesterol fighter Lipitor and the blood thinner Plavix, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Sanofi (SASY.PA).   The wave of major patent expirations is set to continue over the next few years.   But consolidation on the scale of the Express-Medco deal may leave consumers worried that cost savings to them could slow with diminished competitive pressure within the industry.

7,CVS,Express Scripts deal to realign pharmacy business,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugstore leader Walgreen Co may need to make amends in its $5 billion contract spat with Express Scripts now that the pharmacy benefits manager looks to be getting much bigger, industry watchers say.  Express Scripts Inc said on Thursday it would pay $29.1 billion to buy rival Medco Health Solutions Inc and become the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefits company, with easily one-third of the market.  The deal could take a year or more to pass through regulatory hurdles, but in the interim it could already have the power to realign the industry, from rival PBM companies to drugstores and pharmaceutical companies.  The Walgreen fight may be the most immediate example. Last month it said it was breaking its relationship with Express Scripts over prescription pricing, risking more than $5 billion in annual sales. But it would not be able to afford to shut out a combined company with Medco.  “It would give Express Scripts a bargaining position with Walgreen that would be somewhat crippling,” said Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the Smead Value Fund.  Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, administer drug benefits for employers and health plans. Express Scripts would gain even more leverage for negotiating drug prices if the deal went through.  Shares of Walgreen, which had no comment on the impact of the deal, closed the day down 5.2 percent at $39.64. Shares in AmerisourceBergen, a smaller PBM, fell 6 percent.  Rite Aid Corp, a distant No. 3 in the drug store industry, finished up 3.8 percent at $1.35.  The deal could take some pressure off CVS Caremark Corp, which has struggled to quiet critics who say that the $27 billion merger of CVS with the Caremark PBM in 2007 has not lived up to its promise and has been a drag on profitability.  CVS may also pick up some PBM business in the coming year from clients concerned that Express Scripts and Medco will be too distracted by their merger efforts.  CVS shares rose 2.4 percent to close at $37.82, while Express Scripts shares rose 5.4 percent to end at $55.36.  While Walgreen may need to take a more conciliatory approach with Express Scripts, it may also become more aggressive in acquiring drugstores to preserve its clout, said Smead. His fund has held Walgreen shares for 3-1/2 years. CVS may take the same tack, he said.  Other retailers with pharmacies, such as Kroger Co, Target Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc either could not be immediately reached or declined to comment.  Express Scripts has said that Walgreen gives its clients smaller discounts than other drugstores do. Walgreen finds Express Scripts’ rates “really, really below standard,” but may have little room to play hardball.  “This really hurts Walgreens. It has definitely tipped the scales in that discussion,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Arthur Henderson, who covers the PBM industry.  Raymond James analyst John Ransom estimates that losing the business of a combined company would hit Walgreen’s annual earnings per share by $1.00. Analysts are expecting the chain to have an EPS of $2.63 this year.  Walgreen has already sold off its PBM to Catalyst Health Solutions Inc, potentially leaving it further exposed to major PBMs. In 2010, Walgreen fought with rival CVS Caremark, whose PBM stands to be the second-largest after the merger.  Prescriptions make up two-thirds of Walgreen’s revenue and draw in shoppers who buy general merchandise such as suntan lotion and food when they come in for their medications.  Jefferies & Co drugstore analyst Scott Mushkin said that the Express Script-Medco deal, which comes at the time of year when PBMs most actively try to land contracts with large employers, could prompt some to chose CVS Caremark rather than the huge combined Express Script-Medco.  After stumbling in 2009 and losing a major contract, CVS Caremark is having a good selling season this year, landing a major contract with the Federal Employee Program.

CVS shares rose 2.6 percent to $37.90, while Express Scripts shares rose 6.1 percent to $55.76.   Shares of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), a distant No. 3 in the drugstore industry, were up 4.6 percent to $1.36.   While Walgreen may need to take a more conciliatory approach with Express Scripts, it may also become more aggressive in acquiring drugstores to preserve its clout, said Smead. His fund has held Walgreen shares for 3-1/2 years. CVS may take the same tack, he said.   Other retailers with pharmacies, such as Kroger Co (KR.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) either could not be immediately reached or declined to comment.   Express Scripts has said that Walgreen gives its clients smaller discounts than other drugstores do. Walgreen finds Express Scripts’ rates “really, really below standard,” but may have little room to play hardball.   “This really hurts Walgreens. It has definitely tipped the scales in that discussion,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Arthur Henderson, who covers the PBM industry.   Raymond James analyst John Ransom estimates that losing the business of a combined company would hit Walgreen’s annual earnings per share by $1.00. Analysts are expecting the chain to have an EPS of $2.63 this year.   Walgreen has already sold off its PBM to Catalyst Health Solutions Inc CHSI.O, potentially leaving it further exposed to major PBMs. In 2010, Walgreen fought with rival CVS Caremark, whose PBM stands to be the second-largest after the merger.   Prescriptions make up two-thirds of Walgreen’s revenue and draw in shoppers who buy general merchandise such as suntan lotion and food when they come in for their medications.   Jefferies & Co drugstore analyst Scott Mushkin said that the Express Script-Medco deal, which comes at the time of year when PBMs most actively try to land contracts with large employers, could prompt some to chose CVS Caremark rather than the huge combined Express Script-Medco.   After stumbling in 2009 and losing a major contract, CVS Caremark is having a good selling season this year, landing a major contract with the Federal Employee Program.

10,CVS,UPDATE 1-Express Scripts to buy Medco for $29 bln - WSJ," * Express expected to pay $71.36 per share in cash, stock   * Acquisition would be second biggest of 2011   * Healthcare firms positioning to deal with U.S. reform   (Adds background, detail on companies)	   LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Express Scripts Inc has agreed to buy rival Medco Health Solutions Inc for about $29 billion, combining two of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.	   The deal, which could be announced as early as Thursday, underscores a scramble by healthcare firms to reposition themselves to cope with far-reaching changes in the world’s biggest market.	   It would be the year’s second-largest takeover after AT&T Inc’s planned purchase of T-Mobile USA.	   The newspaper said the deal was signed early on Thursday and Express Scripts was expected to pay $71.36 per share in cash and stock for Medco. That would be a 28 percent premium to Medco’s closing price of $55.78 on Wednesday.	   Buying Medco would help Express Scripts compete with rival pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark Corp , which has emerged as a powerful force following its own round of acquisitions.	   PBMs play a central role in the U.S. healthcare system by  administering prescription-drug benefits and processing claims. Their work is likely to increase as President Barack Obama’s overhaul of the health system extends insurance coverage to more Americans.	   An Express Scripts spokesperson declined to comment to Reuters on the report. Medco Health Solutions could not be reached for comment.	    Medco suffered a major setback in May when it lost a big pharmacy benefit contract to CVS starting next year. The surprise decision on the Federal Employee Program account followed closely on Medco losing a contract with Calpers, the biggest U.S. public pension fund.

11,CVS,Back-to-school spending to dip slightly-NRF survey," * Spending to total $68.8 bln   * Department stores, discount stores top destinations   * Shoppers will hunt for bargains-NRF CEO   By Phil Wahba   NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. shoppers plan to pull back a bit on their spending this back-to-school season, a survey showed on Thursday, the latest sign that the second biggest selling season is not likely to be a boon for retailers.   Families with children in kindergarten through grade 12 will spend on average $603.63 for clothes, school supplies and electronics this year, down 0.5 percent from last year, when parents replenished their children’s wardrobes after cutting back during the recession, according to National Retail Federation survey.   Spending should total $68.8 billion, according to the survey.   Gasoline prices are still high and job creation at a near standstill, so shoppers want deals and store chains will oblige them, NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay said in a statement.   “Retailers understand consumers are extremely focused on value,” Shay said.   The results echo those of a survey this month by America’s Research Group, which found that only one-third of shoppers plan to spend more on back-to-school this year than in 2010. [ID:nN1E76I060]   Earlier this month, top U.S. retailers reported strong June sales thanks to bargains that Wall Street analysts said would remain a fixture during back-to-school, which kicks off in earnest in late July and lasts through September. [ID:nN1E76602K]   The NRF survey of 8,684 shoppers by BIGresearch in early July, found that more shoppers than ever, 57 percent, plan to shop at department stores, given their growing preference for private label brands, which are often less expensive.   Chains such as Macy’s Inc (M.N), J.C. Penney (JCP.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) have all increased the selection of exclusive and private label merchandise to give shoppers a reason to choose one store over the other.   More shoppers will turn to online stores and drugstores this year, potentially benefiting retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Walgreen Co WAG.N and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N).   For more stories on back-to-school: [ID:nN1E76J05V]   Still, the most common destination will again be discount stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).   Slightly more than half of shoppers with school-age children plan to buy electronics, sharply down from 63.7 percent last year.   Shoppers will wait until the last minute to spend money, the NRF survey found, meaning that retailers will have to be careful about how they time their deals and how much inventory they allow to build up if they want to avoid the heavy discounts that have dented profits in the past.   “Parents want their children to take a good look around at what they already have before deciding,” Shay said.

12,CVS,CEOs say yes to Congress on removing tax breaks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other major U.S. employers told Congress on Wednesday they would be willing to give up tax breaks that benefit their companies in return for a steep drop in the country’s 35 percent corporate tax rate.  Companies, including big companies, pay a much lower overall effective rate by exploiting tax breaks, usually in perfectly legal ways, that in 2011 are costing the government about $102 billion in lost revenue.  “We do believe comprehensive reform means willingness to put everything on the table,” Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke told the Senate Finance Committee. Without lower corporate tax rates, Duke and the other panelists said, U.S. companies are at a competitive disadvantage both at home and abroad.  Now, amid increasingly frantic debt ceiling negotiations, President Barack Obama and lawmakers are talking about agreeing to tackle tax reform in 2012, but analysts are skeptical that this could be before elections in November 2012.  Though the hearing was billed as focusing on how the tax code affects hiring, businesses and economic growth, there were no specific numbers on how many jobs a lower tax rate would help to create.  Also missing: any concrete discussion of how a tax break on multinational repatriation of foreign profits — favored by business — could be structured to ensure that money is later invested in more U.S. jobs. A prior tax holiday was later proven to have created few, if any, new jobs.  The discussion focused instead on what the tax rate should be and what companies might give up to get there.  All four CEOS agreed the rate should come down, though how far was the topic of some disagreement as was the question of which incentives — assailed by critics as breaks or loopholes — might be removed from the tax code.  Wal-Mart’s Duke suggested a 25 percent rate would be a good figure, but Gregory Lang, CEO of semiconductor manufacturer PMC-Sierra Inc, said to compete with his Asian rivals the rate would have to be far lower — 15 percent to 17 percent. Lang also stopped short of saying he would be willing to give up the research and development tax credit.  Last year, the number of jobs at PMC-Sierra grew by 20 percent but only 15 percent of the new positions were in the United States. A third were added in Canada, where he emphasized that the research credit is quite generous. PMC-Sierra’s tax rate is significantly below the statutory rate due to income earned overseas in lower taxed regions and other tax shields. Last year the company paid 27 percent.  Many companies that have most effectively lowered their taxes and benefit the most from the current system, including General Electric Co and Exxon Mobil Corp, were not on the panel. Kimberly-Clark’s rate is over 30 percent.  Duke testified that Wal-Mart, as the country’s largest private employer, paid $4.7 billion in corporate taxes in 2010, 3 percent of all corporate income taxes collected by the U.S. Treasury, an effective tax rate of 32.2 percent. “Many companies that testify before you theoretically face similar tax rates; we actually pay them,” he said.  CVS Caremark paid the full 35 percent last year, said CEO Larry Merlo, because the company operates only in the United States and is in an industry with no significant tax breaks. He sees a lowering of the rate as a way for CVS to better compete with companies from outside the United States expanding their U.S. presence including Dutch grocer Ahold.  The group’s overall position was largely in step with what the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has promoted since March, including the lower overall tax rate and elimination of tax breaks that benefit one industry over another.  Tom Falk, CEO of diaper maker Kimberly-Clark Corp, urged action. “Our nation is facing a crisis, and in a crisis you can drive a lot of change. I would urge you to be bold,” Falk said, “and get some things done that couldn’t be done in ordinary time.”  Falk said he would readily give up the manufacturing and research and development credits, and others his company uses, in exchange for a 22 percent or 23 percent federal tax rate.  Agreement on a corporate tax overhaul seemed unanimous, with Senator Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the committee, calling the current tax system “antiquated.” The hearing, however, provided few details on how that will get done.

14,CVS,"CVS Caremark cuts sales view, shares fall","CHICAGO (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) trimmed its 2011 sales forecast and narrowed its profit target, sending its shares down more than 3 percent on Thursday even though it posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit.  While the company’s pharmacy benefits management business is showing signs of improvement after some trouble in recent years, CVS is still feeling the impact of a weak economy.  Shoppers are opting to buy less expensive goods, including generic drugs. CVS said visits to its stores in the second quarter were flat versus a year earlier.  “If I think about the outlook for the remainder of the year, I personally don’t see the economy changing dramatically,” Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton said in an interview. “I think the consumer is going to remain cautious.”  CVS, like other drugstores and pharmacy benefits managers, is selling more generic drugs. That move crimps revenue because generic drugs are less expensive than their branded counterparts. However, generics are more profitable.  Denton declined to say how much of a lift generics provide, although he called it substantial.  CVS now sees 2011 revenue up 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent, down from a prior forecast of 11 percent to 13 percent.  CVS hopes to benefit from uncertainty as two rival PBMs, Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) and Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N, work on a merger and Express Scripts deals with the potential loss of its business with Walgreen Co WAG.N.  Two large pharmacy groups said on Thursday they sent a letter to U.S. Federal Trade Commission opposing Express Scripts’ plan to buy Medco. CVS would not say whether it specifically is lobbying against the proposed deal.  CVS shares were down 3.6 percent at $34.90 in afternoon trading amid a broad market sell-off. The shares of Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, fell 0.7 percent to $37.86.  For its drugstore unit, which operates more than 7,200 stores and accounts for a little more than half of total revenue, CVS now expects sales at stores open at least a year to rise 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, down from a May forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Net drugstore revenue is now expected to rise 3 percent to 4 percent, down from a May forecast of 4 percent to 6 percent.  Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 2 percent in the second quarter, but fell short of some estimates. Analysts’ consensus forecast was 3.1 percent, according to Bernstein analyst Helene Wolk.  Sales at stores open at least a year across a variety of chains, excluding CVS, rose 4.4 percent in July.  Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were flat at 65 cents per share, topping analysts’ average forecast by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net income attributable to CVS Caremark was $816 million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $821 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 10.9 percent to $26.63 billion, just short of the $26.77 billion expected by analysts.  Retail revenue rose 3.6 percent to $14.8 billion.  Revenue in the pharmacy services business jumped 23.2 percent to $14.6 billion, due in part to the addition of a previously announced major contract with Aetna Inc (AET.N).  CVS now expects pharmacy services revenue to rise 23 percent to 24 percent this year, compared with a prior forecast of 23 percent to 26 percent. The unit’s operating profit is now expected to fall 7 percent to 9 percent, compared with a prior target of a 5 percent to 9 percent drop.  CVS expects to earn $2.75 to $2.81 per share from continuing operations this year, versus its prior forecast of $2.72 to $2.82. The average forecast of analysts is $2.78.  CVS forecast third-quarter adjusted earnings of 66 cents to 68 cents per share. Analysts were looking for 68 cents.  The company, formed through CVS’s 2007 acquisition of Caremark, continues to cooperate with the FTC in its ongoing investigation into the combined company’s business practices, Denton said. The probe began in August 2009.  ",8042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cvscaremark/cvs-caremark-cuts-sales-view-shares-fall-idUSTRE7732RI20110804

16,CVS,UPDATE 1-CVS taps Macy's exec to oversee drugstores," NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) named a Macy’s Inc (M.N) executive to head its drugstores division, ending a months-long search after a judge blocked a previous choice.   CVS, the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain operator, said Mark Cosby, 52, would become president of its CVS/pharmacy unit on Oct. 1. Cosby would oversee CVS’ retail operations, including its distribution centers, e-commerce and pharmacy operations. CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo had been overseeing the unit on an interim basis.   Cosby most recently was department store operator Macy’s president of stores.   Last year, CVS hired Hank Mullany, who served as president of Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) northern U.S. division until November. The discount retailer then sued CVS, saying the move would violate a noncompete agreement. A Delaware Chancery Court judge blocked Mullany in December from taking the job. [ID:nN0396549]   CVS, which operates nearly 7,300 drugstores, had $14.8 billion in retail sales during its most recent quarter, or 55.6 percent of the CVS Caremark’s total revenue. The rest came primarily from its pharmacy benefits business.   CVS shares were unchanged at $32.42 in afternoon trading.

17,CVS,Wall Street rises as investors flee gold; Apple falls late,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted strong gains for a second day on Wednesday as investors jumped back into beaten-down financial shares and backed away from safer assets like gold in volatile trading.  In a stunning development after the closing bell, Silicon Valley legend Steve Jobs resigned as chief executive of Apple Inc — the technology powerhouse he co-founded in a garage. Jobs, 55, is a pancreatic cancer survivor who has been on medical leave for an undisclosed condition since January 17. Apple said Jobs has been elected chairman and Tim Cook has been elected CEO, Apple said.  Apple’s stock, which had been halted after hours, resumed trading at 6:55 p.m. and slid 7 percent. In regular trading, Apple had gained 0.7 percent to close at $376.18 and the S&P information technology index, which includes Apple as a component, had gained 0.8 percent during the session.  Analysts’ opinions of the implications for Apple’s future were mixed. Ashok Kumar of Rodman & Renshaw said it “is not a good sign” for Jobs to step down ahead of the highly anticipated release of the iPhone 5, while Jeffrey Fidacaro of Susquehanna Financial Group called it “a prudent move” to name Cook as Jobs’ successor, adding that “it’s nice to get a succession plan in place with Steve Jobs still at the helm of the board.”  During the regular session, the stock market swung back and forth as investors anticipated a key speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday. There had been hope the Fed chief would hint of stimulus to aid the struggling economy, but a more likely outcome is for gradual measures.  “Some investors have been buying because it feels, looks like perhaps we’ve seen the lows of the correction,” said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.  “(But) savvy investors don’t expect QE3. They do not expect the Federal Reserve to unveil anything significant.”  The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 143.95 points, or 1.29 percent, to end at 11,320.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped 15.25 points, or 1.31 percent, to finish at 1,177.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 21.63 points, or 0.88 percent, to close at 2,467.69.  The S&P has risen for three straight sessions.  Bank of America Corp rose 11 percent to $6.99, reversing losses on Tuesday when the Dow component hit a 2-1/2-year low on fears it may have to raise large amounts of capital. BofA shares are still down more than 30 percent so far this month.  The S&P financials index advanced 2.8 percent, with JPMorgan Chase & Co shares up 3 percent at  Traditional value stocks such as CVS Caremark and Time Warner were among the day’s top gainers. CVS shares rose 3.1 percent to $34.44 and Time Warner gained 3.3 percent to $29.84.  Bernanke is due to address central bankers at an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. His speech last year laid the groundwork for the Fed’s unprecedented $600 billion bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, or  QE2, to revive a sputtering U.S. economy.  The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell but remained at high levels, and investors preferred buying traditional value stocks, suggesting there was caution in the market.  The VIX fell 1 percent to close at 35.90. The gauge generally moves inversely to the stock market as it tracks the price investors pay for protective options on the S&P 500 index.  Exchange-traded funds tracking gold stocks and gold-mining stocks fell after U.S. gold futures for December dropped more than 5 percent, sliding $104 to end at $1,757.30 an ounce in the steepest percentage drop since December 2008 during the financial crisis. On a price basis, it was the biggest decline in the continuous front-month gold futures contract since January 22, 1980, when it fell nearly $150.  The SPDR Gold Trust Index declined 3.4 percent to $171.63, while the Market Vectors Gold Miners Index fell 2.5 percent to $59.96..  Barrick Gold shares dropped 3.4 percent to $48.99 and Goldcorp Inc shares fell 3.6 percent to $49.44.  Sectors that led Tuesday’s rally, such as energy and technology, shed gains.

22,CVS,Analysis: Express Scripts risks culture row with Medco deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - At their roots, Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) and Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N share the same goal: Reduce drug and healthcare costs for their clients.  But the similarities largely end there. Before announcing their $29 billion merger, the two U.S. pharmacy benefit managers were pursuing vastly different strategies.  Express Scripts — the acquirer in the deal that will create the industry’s clear leader — faces some tough choices about Medco’s long-term game plan in a deal that is already beset with antitrust concerns.  Medco began to expand in recent years into international markets, gene-based therapy and post-approval drug studies, seeking new money-making opportunities and envisioning itself as a broader clinical company.  Express Scripts doubled down on the U.S. market for managing prescription drug benefits for employers and other clients with a series of deals, while pointedly avoiding some of the areas in which Medco invested.  “There are going to be some cultural challenges to overcome,” said Eugene Goldenberg, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.  “The Big 3 are probably the most different now than they’ve ever been,” Goldenberg said of Express, Medco and rival CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N). “The overall goal is to drive generics and to maximize savings for the consumer and the client, but the way in which they go about it is very, very different.”  Even Express Scripts concedes the differences could be a problem. In its recent quarterly securities filing, Express cited the risk of “integrating two unique corporate cultures, which may prove to be incompatible.”  Problems with integration could lead to service disruptions or the departure of key employees, as well as turn worried clients toward rivals.  St. Louis-based Express Scripts projects $1 billion in cost savings and other synergies from the deal. It may slash jobs at Medco, based in suburban Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. Medco had nearly twice the number of employees — 24,625 compared with 13,170 at Express — at the end of 2010.  Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said it is too early to speculate on the outcome of the integration, but the companies have “complementary capabilities.” He also cited Express’s track record in integrating acquisitions. It has struck seven other deals since 1998, including two that doubled its size.  The divide is also apparent in Medco CEO David Snow and Express Scripts CEO George Paz.  For example, PBMs are set to benefit greatly from a wave of big-selling medicines going generic over the next few years.  Snow, who served as a health insurance executive before joining Medco in 2003, is already planting the seeds for growth in the latter part of the decade when the generic surge subsides.  Agnes Brady, who worked for Medco for more than 17 years, including as a finance executive, said the company became more innovative under Snow.  “It was a real can-do culture — jump in and just get the job done,” said Brady, now executive vice president in charge of medical products at diabetes supply company NationsHealth.  At Medco, Brady said she was given chances to get involved in healthcare beyond the business of dispensing drugs.  “If we strictly had a PBM/distribution model focus, I don’t think I would have had that opportunity,” Brady added.  Paz, an accountant by training, was chief financial officer and president before becoming CEO in 2005. His signature move before the Medco deal was acquiring WellPoint Inc’s WLP.N PBM unit for $4.7 billion — a deal that added heft to Express’s main business and won praise on Wall Street.  “Express has always been very focused on the core PBM functions of claims processing, formulary design, mail-order fulfillment and believed that sticking to the core drove efficiencies and drives results,” said George Van Antwerp, who worked for the company from 2001 to 2006, including as senior director of product management.  Van Antwerp, now general manager of pharmacy solutions for Silverlink Communications, described Paz’s style as “leadership by results,” with a focus on the fundamentals of the business.  “It’s a narrow-casting versus a broad approach to what the meaning and value of pharmacy is,” Van Antwerp said in contrasting Express Scripts and Medco. “There will be some differences strategically as you blend the two entities.”  Express may also need to reevaluate some of its earlier views. While Medco has struck several deals in Europe, Paz told investors in January he was not “overly excited” about such expansion.  Wall Street may want Express Scripts to keep some of the businesses Medco has been investing in to help ensure growth beyond the generics wave.  “That is part of the allure in the transaction,” Goldenberg said. “To walk away from all of that, I think investors would be disappointed if Express chose to do that.”  Even in the U.S. drug benefits business, the companies have pursued different strategies.  Express Scripts touts its ability to understand consumer behavior, what it calls “consumerology.” Medco focuses on its therapeutic resource centers, in which pharmacists specialize in diabetes and other chronic diseases.  Nadina Rosier, North America pharmacy practice leader for Towers Watson, which helps employers with their benefit plans, said combining these platforms could drive out healthcare waste and lower drug costs.  The issues that “keep employers up at night” about the merger include the fate of customer service, mail-order prescription turnarounds and claims accuracy under a combined company, Rosier said.  “Employers want to ensure that the newly merged organization is not distracted by any of the challenges they face during the integration,” she added.

In a stunning development after the closing bell, Jobs -- a Silicon Valley legend who co-founded Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a garage --  resigned as chief executive of the technology powerhouse. Jobs, 55, is a pancreatic cancer survivor who has been on medical leave for an undisclosed condition since Jan. 17. Apple said Jobs has been elected chairman and Tim Cook has been elected CEO. [ID:nN1E77N21M]  Apple's stock, which was halted after hours, resumed trading at 6:55 p.m. and slid 7 percent. In regular trading, Apple gained 0.7 percent to end at $376.18.  Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 were hit hardest, losing 21.5 points, or 1 percent, to 2,117.50 after the news. Apple has the biggest effect on the Nasdaq 100's daily moves, as it accounted for more than 14 percent of the index at the end of trading on Wednesday, according to Reuters data.  S&P futures fell 3.8 points. Apple is the second-largest component in the S&P 500, when ranked by market capitalization, where it is second only to Exxon Mobil(XOM.N).  In May, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) cut Apple's weighting in the index to 12.3 percent from 20.5 percent as part of a rebalancing to better reflect the market cap of the biggest Nasdaq issues. Since then, however, Apple has continued to rise. At the end of Wednesday trading, Apple had a market cap of nearly $349 billion.  Analysts' opinions of the implications for Apple's future were mixed. Ashok Kumar of Rodman & Renshaw said it ""is not a good sign"" for Jobs to step down ahead of the highly anticipated release of the iPhone 5, while Jeffrey Fidacaro of Susquehanna Financial Group called it ""a prudent move"" to name Cook as Jobs' successor, adding that ""it's nice to get a succession plan in place with Steve Jobs still at the helm of the board.""  SWING TIME  During the regular session, the stock market swung back and forth as investors anticipated a key speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday. There had been hope the Fed chief would hint of stimulus to aid the struggling economy, but a more likely outcome is for gradual measures.

26,CVS,"Home Depot, Walmart, grocers get boost from Irene"," * Supercenters, grocers see shoppers stock up before storm   * Other chains likely to see August sales crimped   * Travel pause to cancel high-end sales - analyst   By Dhanya Skariachan and Phil Wahba   NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene sent east coast shoppers into stores to stock up on essentials this week, instead of the clothes, notebooks and other supplies that retailers were counting on selling as parents prepare to send their children back to school.   Chains such as Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) were doing brisk business on Friday, selling water, flashlights, batteries and other goods in states standing in Irene’s potential track from the Carolinas to Massachusetts.   “We’re selling things like generators almost as soon as they arrive at the stores in the watch areas,” said Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes.   Irene is due to make its first U.S. landfall in North Carolina on Saturday. The storm, which battered Atlantic and Caribbean islands including the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, is then expected to head to the densely-populated Northeast. [ID:nN1E77P00B]   Those who were not trying to squeeze in one last summer stay on the New Jersey shore or Long Island beaches may have been planning to go to shopping malls to buy clothes, shoes and other items for children that will soon head back to school. Now, those plans will be on hold.   “Nobody is going to go to a mall to buy a pair of jeans,” said Richard Hastings, consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities.   The back-to-school shopping season is the second-largest spending time for U.S. shoppers behind the winter holidays.   The storm may dent the upcoming index of August sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, by 1.5 percentage points, Hastings said. About two dozen retailers, including department stores and apparel chains, are due to report their monthly tallies on Sept. 1.   It could hurt retailers like Saks Inc SKS.N and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) if airports stay closed for too long or people cancel their trips, said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. The hurricane hitting on a weekend worsens its impact, he added.   Hastings expects Home Depot to do well, as it has 35 percent more stores than Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) in the affected region. He also expects Newell Rubbermaid Inc (NWL.N) to do well as people buy storage containers.   Hastings and others expected to see brisk business at wholesale clubs that sell bulk packs of batteries and water.   At a Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) in New York’s Long Island City neighborhood late Thursday, it was mostly business as usual.   “It’s usually crazy here no matter what day of the week it is,” said manager Rose Ramos. “This is a normal day for us.”   Some items were selling faster than others as Hurricane Irene set its sights on the largest city in the United States. Costco stacked 24-packs of Poland Spring and Glaceau water bottles by its entrance.   “The water is going very quickly,” Ramos said. “People want to stock up.”   Tim Buxton, a missions director at the Times Square Church, stopped in to get supplies for the church’s 22 interns. The church has not decided whether to hold services on Sunday, when the storm is expected to reach New York, he said as he pushed a cart filled with four cases of gallon-water jugs, four packs of bottled water, instant soup and granola bars.   Based on Friday’s storm track from the National Hurricane Center, 96 BJ’s Wholesale Club BJ.N stores in 10 states will be affected, a spokeswoman said. Those stores are receiving extra deliveries of items such as batteries, flashlights, generators and groceries, and the Massachusetts-based company’s buyers are working to get water delivered to those locations.   Target Corp (TGT.N) said it stores merchandise in distribution centers before hurricane season so supplies can be sent to stores where they are needed most.   Walgreen Co WAG.N, CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), the nation’s largest drugstore chains, reminded customers to keep a supply of medication on hand and keep medicine bottles in waterproof bags to make it easier to refill prescriptions at out-of-town pharmacies, if necessary.

27,CVS,UPDATE 2-Walgreen plans for life after Express Scripts," * Walgreen, Express Scripts still have no new contract   * Companies disagree on prescription reimbursement rates   * Walgreen testing pilot stores with new pharmacy layout  (Adds Walgreen comments, updates stock activity)   By Jessica Wohl and Phil Wahba   CHICAGO/NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Walgreen Co WAG.N and pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) have made no progress in their dispute and each is preparing to move on without the other, the companies said on Wednesday.   Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, is testing pilot stores where taking photos of pills and other updates could help improve patients’ experiences and reduce costs.   Express Scripts, meanwhile, is reaching out to clients to inform them of options besides plans that involve Walgreen.   Walgreen said in June it would stop filling prescriptions for people covered by Express Scripts at the end of 2011 after failing to agree on new contract terms, walking away from a deal worth more than $5 billion in annual sales. [ID:nN1E75K038]   Walgreen’s decision took on more heft one month later when Express Scripts said it plans to buy Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N, the largest PBM. [ID:nN1E76K0AS] Talks have not brought the two sides much closer to reaching an agreement.   “We are still very, very far apart from Express Scripts,” Kermit Crawford, Walgreen’s president of pharmacy, health and wellness, told Reuters. “This is more about philosophy.”   At issue is how much Express Scripts reimburses drugstore chains for the prescriptions they fill.   “No progress has been made since what was said a few months ago,” an Express Scripts spokesman said. “We are still open to getting an agreement with Walgreens, but only at the right rates for our clients.”   In Walgreen’s pilot stores, a health guide armed with an iPad, express refill kiosks and handle other issues that can help patrons more easily speak to pharmacists, get their medications and see nurse practitioners at its in-store Take Care clinics.   The first such store, in the village of Oak Park, Illinois, opened in November. Walgreen plans to have 20 stores in Chicago and other nearby towns by October.   In the Oak Park store, electronic price tags allow the company to change prices from the office, freeing up the in-store staff of about 20 people for other tasks.   Features such as a variety of prepared and fresh foods, a bright beauty section and an updated checkout area were copied from Duane Reade, the New York chain Walgreen acquired in 2010.   The pharmacist can chat with customers at a desk or in a private area, rather than at a counter where others can overhear. When technicians fill prescriptions, the pharmacist  checks their work via photos sent to her computer rather than having to watch them count pills and attach labels.   Technicians wear blue scrubs and the prescriptions they prepare are stored in white cabinets, giving the pharmacy more of a medical office feel than a retail one. Phone calls are taken elsewhere to keep the area quiet, and a room for classes sits between the pharmacy and two Take Care clinic exam rooms.   “It’s a big departure for us,” Nimesh Jhaveri, Walgreen’s executive director of pharmacy and healthcare experience, said as he walked through the Oak Park store on Tuesday.   While initial results are “very positive,” Jhaveri stressed that the stores are only a pilot and Walgreen declined to say what its next steps are with the “Well Experience” format.   “We still have to do our due diligence to make sure that we have these stores right,” said Crawford.   Walgreen is making its changes as other chains, especially drugstore and PBM CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N), also push into more services and update their operations.   Walgreen aims to again be the second-largest provider of flu shots in the United States, behind the government, and Crawford hopes to surpass the 6 million shots it administered last year. Others, including CVS and grocer Safeway Inc SWY.N, also give flu shots at their pharmacies.   As for its battle against Express Scripts, Walgreen believes it has the figures to defend its stance.   Crawford said Walgreen’s acquisitions last year of the Duane Reade chain and 300 independent pharmacies showed Walgreen was getting inferior reimbursement rates.   Walgreen is quicker to adopt generic drugs than others and its exit from Express Scripts’ operations would lower the PBM’s generic use by 1.4 percentage points, according to Crawford.   Walgreen shares closed down 29 cents, or about 0.82 percent, at $35.21 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Express Scripts’ shares rose 13 cents, or 0.28 percent, to $46.94 on the Nasdaq.

28,CVS,"Analysis: Big name investors, funds bet on Rite Aid recovery","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), a perennial laggard U.S. drugstore chain, is enjoying something of a comeback, enticing some big-name hedge funds to buy shares on the bet that a turnaround will send them rising.  Debt-saddled, money-losing Rite Aid is the third-largest U.S. drugstore chain, with nearly 4,700 stores. After years of declines, same-store sales have risen in its three most recent quarters. On Thursday, Rite Aid said second-quarter same-store sales were up 2.2 percent.  The improvement, however modest, is fueling speculation that Rite Aid shares, which have been trading for less than $1.50 for nearly a year and a half, have hit bottom.  New initiatives, like a customer loyalty program and smaller stores, are gaining traction with shoppers, and the company’s CEO of 14 months, John Standley, is well regarded by investors.  Shares in Rite Aid have fallen 84 percent in roughly four years and were as low as 20 cents in 2008.  “You could see the business doing a lot better; you could see the stock doing a lot better “ one large shareholder said, speaking on condition of anonymity. His fund has tripled its shares in Rite Aid in recent months.  Even a modest rise in shares could yield a big payday for investors, many of whom were bondholders who bought debt on the cheap in 2008 and have converted that into equity.  Investors that recently have taken equity in Rite Aid or added to what they already owned include: Leonard Green & Partners LP, Diamondback Capital Management, Perry Capital LLC, Standard Pacific Capital and billionaire investor George Soros, whose fund reported a small stake in May.  Canadian retailer Jean Coutu Group (PJCa.TO), Rite Aid’s biggest shareholder since it sold its U.S. drugstores to Rite Aid in 2007, when Rite Aid shares were worth $6.70, said in July it would shed 10 percent of its 26.8 percent stake. Coutu also said it intends to remain the largest investor.  A major draw for investors is Rite Aid’s potential as a takeover target, despite its market value of just $1 billion.  Still, Rite Aid will not be in play until it makes serious inroads into its enormous debt load.  For now, the company could keep selling or shutting some stores. In recent years, rival Walgreen Co WAG.N has bought more than 20 stores from Rite Aid.  Analysts say Walgreen and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N), the top two drugstore chains, could particularly be drawn to Rite Aid’s attractive portfolio of stores in California and Pennsylvania, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) could be tempted by its stores’ sizes to help expand its new smaller-format business.  Rite Aid’s $6 billion long-term debt has been an albatross, leading to severe liquidity crises in 2000 and 2008. The company’s interest expenses of more than $500 million a year in the last two fiscal years effectively wiped out any profit.  “The biggest obstacle (to a deal) is their debt load,” said a retail investment banker, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  Rite Aid’s debt is seen as so risky that on Thursday it cost 29 times more to protect $10 million of Rite Aid debt for five years than Walgreen debt based on credit default swap trades, according to Markit. Walgreen CDS are thinly traded.  Although Leonard Green, the private equity firm that has done a number of leveraged buyouts of retail chains, is the No. 2 investor in Rite Aid and holds a seat on its board, it is unlikely to make a bid for the company, a source close to the situation said. One reason is that Rite Aid largely leases its stores rather than owning them.  Leonard Green did not return a request for comment. Rite Aid declined to comment for this article.  In addition, Rite Aid’s unionized workers would deter Wal-Mart, which has no U.S. unions, industry experts said.  Despite the debt load, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing is not considered an imminent possibility. Rite Aid has no major maturities coming due until 2014 and generates ample cash from $25 billion in annual sales.  Rite Aid still faces a number of challenges.  It commands just 11.4 percent of the U.S. market, compared with 27.1 percent for CVS and 32 percent for Walgreen, according to IBISWorld. Its same-store sales gains have been far smaller than its profitable, deep-pocketed rivals.  Many of its stores are not very productive, and sit in undesirable locations under landlords with tough lease terms.  Last fiscal year, Rite Aid stores generated sales of about $534 per square foot, compared with $822 at CVS and $802 at Walgreen, according to data in the companies’ annual reports.  “It’s all about sales per square foot,” said Andrew Wolf, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets.  CVS and Walgreen have the means to invest heavily in sprucing up their stores, expanding their worksite wellness clinics and offering more fresh food.  Rite Aid, despite being handcuffed by its debt, also has managed to try new concepts, but analysts say it lags rivals.  “One of the issues Rite Aid has had for a while is that it’s not a first mover in the industry,” said IBISWorld healthcare analyst Sophie Snyder. Snyder believes Rite Aid’s market share will hold steady but that Walgreen and CVS will keep gaining customers.  The next few years will be decisive for Rite Aid.  “We have at least four years or more of what we call runway, the time for the business to perform and rebound,” the shareholder said.

30,CVS,UPDATE 1-Express Scripts sees small risk in Walgreen spat," * CFO says risk from dispute not significant   * Says still “probable” Medco deal closes in H1 of 2012  (Adds Walgreen comment)   By Lewis Krauskopf   Sept 14 (Reuters) - Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) might lose a “small fraction” of its business from a dispute with drugstore chain Walgreen Co WAG.N, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday, but it would not be a significant amount.   Express Scripts, which manages prescription drug benefits for employers and other clients, has been locked in a high-stakes public dispute with Walgreen since June, when the largest U.S. drugstore chain said it would stop filling prescriptions covered by Express Scripts at the end of the year after failing to agree on contract terms.   Express Scripts prescriptions are expected to be worth $5.3 billion in sales for Walgreen this year, or about 7 percent of the chain’s total expected revenue.   Speaking at an investor conference, Express Scripts CFO Jeff Hall said many of its customers support the company in the dispute because they do not want to pay a premium price to have Walgreen in the network.   “We would expect that some small fraction of our business might move away,” Hall said at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York. “We don’t think that’s a meaningful amount of our business.”   Hall said there was no cut-off deadline after which no resolution could be reached between the two sides. But he said that after Jan 1, when Walgreen stores would leave the network, some members may not return to the stores should an agreement eventually be struck.   “In general, they don’t move back,” he said.   Walgreen resolved a similar spat with CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) last year, but it appears to be digging in its heels more deeply in the dispute with Express Scripts.   Last week, Express Scripts filed an injunction in federal court in Illinois alleging Walgreen published false marketing materials designed to encourage Medicare recipients to leave health plans that are Express Scripts clients.    Walgreen, whose “white paper” to clients outlined its plan to leave its Express Scripts’ business, said it would vigorously defend itself against the suit. It said it was important to inform people about the impact should Walgreen leave the Express Scripts network.   The stakes in the dispute with Walgreen rose higher in July when Express Scripts announced its $29 billion deal to acquire rival Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N and create a powerhouse in managing prescription drug benefits.   However, the deal is attracting significant antitrust scrutiny, and Express Scripts said earlier this month that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had asked for additional information about it.   Some analysts have said it is a coin flip as to whether the deal wins regulatory approval. Medco shares are trading about 24 percent below the offer price, reflecting in large part skepticism the deal will be completed.   Hall said he believes the main regulatory concern is whether the deal would be pro-competitive and reduce costs.   “We will look forward to making our case on why this is indeed going to lower the overall cost of healthcare for the U.S.,” Hall said.   He said it was still “probable” that the deal closes in the first half of next year. “There’s nothing that we’ve seen so far that would make us push that date out any further,” he said.   Hall also sounded a dour note about Americans continuing to cut back on healthcare spending because of the weak economy, the latest sign of such a persistent pull-back.   While Express Scripts sees prescriptions increase 3 percent to 5 percent in an average year, he said, there has been virtually no growth over the past three years.   “The economy has actually gotten worse since the June-July timeframe...and we don’t see the economy getting any better,” he said. “If the economy stays at this place, then utilization is going to continue to be lower than previously expected.”  (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York, additional reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago, editing by Dave Zimmerman)   ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/expressscripts/update-1-express-scripts-sees-small-risk-in-walgreen-spat-idUSS1E78D1LM20110914

While Express Scripts sees prescriptions increase 3 percent to 5 percent in an average year, he said, there has been virtually no growth over the past three years.   “The economy has actually gotten worse since the June-July timeframe...and we don’t see the economy getting any better,” he said. “If the economy stays at this place, then utilization is going to continue to be lower than previously expected.”  ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/expressscripts/express-scripts-sees-small-risk-in-walgreen-spat-idUSS1E78D12O20110914
33,CVS,"UPDATE 1-Express, Medco tout savings,competition in hearing"," * Express: there are 40 PBM competitors, not three   * Investors skeptical the deal will be approved   * Pharmacists group says big PBMs hurt consumers  (Adds quotes from the hearing)   By Diane Bartz   WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Express Scripts’ deal to buy Medco Health Solutions will bring down drug costs and help the U.S. government track waste and fraud, executives told lawmakers examining whether the deal would stifle competition in the market for managing prescription benefits.   The merger, valued at about $24 billion by Monday’s closing share prices, has come under fire from pharmacists and consumer groups, who argue that a market dominated by two powerful pharmacy benefit mangers would mean higher drug prices.   The deal would combine two of the three largest U.S. drug benefit managers and create an industry leader with nearly one-third of the market.   But Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) Chief Executive George Paz told the panel antitrust concern is misplaced.   “We are fully aligned with our patients and employers. We make money by saving them money. This union of our two companies will strengthen our ability to do just that,” said Paz.   He said Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N are just two of 40 pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that manage prescription drug plans for companies and state and federal agencies.   Express Scripts’ post-merger U.S. market share would be 30 percent, said Brian Henry, a spokesman for the company.   While most lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel refrained from criticizing the deal, Representatives Thomas Marino of Pennsylvania and Judy Chu of California expressed concern about PBM efforts to push down payments to retail pharmacies and to move toward mail order drug delivery, cutting retail pharmacies out of the financial equation altogether.   Medco’s chief executive, David Snow, disagreed, saying the companies they do business with often require that retail pharmacies be available to their employees.   “I would like the independent retailers to survive,” he said.   Joseph Lech, a member of the National Community Pharmacists Association, testified that in 25 years he had seen large PBMs buy up smaller ones, while the number of community pharmacies shrank.   “I would love to believe that they want to work with me and need me. But I have not seen that,” he said.   Neither Express Scripts nor Medco has retail pharmacies, but both have mail order pharmacies.   “Mail order costs less than retail pharmacies,” said Paz.   Pressed by Representative Mel Watt of North Carolina, Paz said the merger would fall apart if the FTC required divestiture of either the mail order business or specialty drugs, which treat ailments such as multiple sclerosis.   The Federal Trade Commission will make the final decision on whether to challenge the deal, but Congressional hearings can influence public opinion.   Investors seem skeptical that the deal announced in July will pass antitrust scrutiny. Medco’s shares have continued to trade at a discount to Express Scripts’ offer price.   Critics of the deal argue that only Express Scripts, Medco and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) have the reach to serve companies that need service in multiple cities. The FTC is looking into complaints about anti-competitive behavior by CVS Caremark.   The Medco and Express Scripts merger deal carries termination fees and expenses of up to $225 million if a company fails to make its best effort to get the deal closed.   But no termination fees would be required if the U.S. government blocks the combination, the companies have said.   Groups criticizing the deal include Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, Consumer Federation of America, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, National Consumers League and the National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug Prices.

The combined firm’s database will also aid in investigations to prevent waste and fraud, and could help U.S. health organizations track diseases, Paz said.  Medco’s chief executive, David Snow, also testified that the PBM marketplace was extremely competitive.

36,CVS,Rite Aid's outlook improves as loss narrows,"(Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp’s (RAD.N) improving sales and efforts to trim operating costs helped narrow its quarterly loss, and the debt-saddled drugstore chain said it expects those trends to continue, forecasting a smaller loss for the full fiscal year.  Rite Aid, the third-largest U.S. drugstore operator, lost $94.7 million, or 11 cents per share, during the second quarter ended August 27, compared with a year-earlier loss of $199.3 million, or 23 cents a share.  That was better than the loss of 17 cents per share expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But it was still Rite Aid’s 17th straight quarterly loss.  Sales rose 1.8 percent to $6.27 billion, and sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.2 percent, the company said earlier this month.  Same-store sales of general merchandise such as shampoo and paper towels rose 2.5 percent.  The introduction of less-expensive generic drugs lowered pharmacy same-store sales, which account for about two-thirds of revenue, by 1.5 to 2 percentage points. While generic drugs bring in less revenue, they are more profitable for drugstores to sell.  Rite Aid, which has long lagged competitors Walgreen Co WAG.N and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N), said its Wellness + Customer Loyalty program now has 44 million enrollees. Analysts have credited the program with playing a big role in Rite Aid’s improving sales.  Same-store sales have risen for three straight quarters.  Rite Aid said it now expects a loss of 40 cents to 56 cents per share for fiscal 2012, which ends in February, compared with its earlier forecast for a loss of 42 cents to 64 cents.  The chain also raised the low end of its sales forecasts. It now expects same-store sales to rise 0.75 percent to 2 percent, and total sales of $25.8 billion to $26.1 billion.  Rite Aid, which carries $6 billion in long-term debt, incurred interest expense of $130.8 million in the second quarter. Stripping out that expense as well as taxes, depreciation and amortization, the company earned $184.3 million, up from $181.2 million a year earlier.  Rite Aid has been closing stores while Walgreen and CVS have been expanding. Rite Aid had 4,697 stores as of August 27, down from 4,747 a year earlier.  The company last posted a quarterly profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. That quarter ended in May 2007.  Rite Aid shares were up 1 cent to $1.08 in premarket trading.

38,CVS,Walgreen digs in heels in Express Scripts fight,"(Reuters) - Walgreen Co WAG.N signaled it would not budge in its battle with Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) over what the pharmacy benefits manager will reimburse them for prescriptions, sending shares of the largest U.S. drugstore chain down nearly 6 percent.  The company, which operates about 7,700 drugstores, said in June that it would stop filling prescriptions for people covered by Express Scripts at the end of the year after failing to agree on new contract terms. The impasse threatens to cost Walgreen about $5 billion in annual sales, or about 7 percent of its business.  Walgreen said on Tuesday that it still “firmly” believed the terms offered by Express Scripts would not do and that the parties are still far apart.  So the chain is asking employers and health plans to bypass the pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) altogether if their contracts allow them to.  Chief Executive Officer Greg Wasson told analysts on a conference call that he was “encouraged” by the response Walgreen has been getting.  But when pressed, Wasson would not say whether Walgreen has yet landed any deals with Express Scripts customers.  Wasson also said Walgreen would take a similar stand with Medco Health Solutions MHS.N, which Express Scripts is seeking approval to buy, if Medco asked for similar terms.  “We would expect the fair compensation we get today with them, and if we weren’t to get that, then we wouldn’t be in that network either,” Wasson said on the conference call.  Express Scripts and Medco’s $29 billion merger would create the largest PBM.  Chief Financial Officer Wade Miquelon told analysts that if Walgreen keeps 25 percent of the contracts it has through Express Scripts, the negative impact on earnings would be 21 cents per share for fiscal 2012, which ends next July. If it keeps 75 percent, the damage would be 7 cents per share.  The company said regardless of how either scenario plays out cost cutting would help. Wall Street analysts expect EPS of $2.99 per share for fiscal 2012.  J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a note that Walgreen’s claim to be better off without Express Scripts was “illogical” and questioned how much of the dent in sales Walgreen’s cost cutting could mitigate.  Walgreen archrival CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) operates a large pharmacy benefits management business, while Walgreen sold its own PBM unit in June.  Prescription drugs account for almost two-thirds of Walgreen’s sales.  The company said more people had visited its stores and spent more per visit during the last quarter. Walgreen is working on expanding its health and wellness services, such as clinics it operates in its stores and at work sites, as it tries to differentiate itself from CVS.  Walgreen said it had earned $792 million, or 87 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended on August 31, compared with $470 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding the benefit from the PBM sale, the profit was 57 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 55 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/ES.  Sales rose 6.5 percent to $18.0 billion, slightly above the $17.92 billion that analysts were expecting.  Sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent, outpacing the gains of CVS and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) in their latest quarters.  Same-store prescriptions rose 3.4 percent at Walgreen, which claimed to have a 20 percent market share for fiscal 2011.  The number of visitors to drugstores open at least a year rose 1.6 percent, and customers spent 3 percent more per visit.  Shares of Walgreen were down 6 percent at $33.86 in afternoon trading.

42,CVS,Family Dollar plans more stores as shoppers eye bargains,"(Reuters) - Discount chain Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N forecast strong earnings and plans to ramp up store openings in the coming year as it looks to tap into demand from bargain-hungry consumers.  Family Dollar, which sells clothing and other goods that typically sell for $10 or less, has seen robust demand for food and other essentials in recent months, as customers focus more on the basic necessities in a sluggish U.S. economy.  The retailer, which posted a market-beating fourth quarter profit, plans to open 450-500 new outlets in fiscal 2012 — a more than 50 percent increase over store openings in 2011.  “I think its largely to counter the fact that Dollar General, their main competitor, has gotten more aggressive as well,” BB&T analyst Anthony Chukumba told Reuters.  Dollar General opened 301 new stores and remodeled or relocated 371 stores in its latest reported quarter.  Family Dollar, which operated 7,023 stores at the end of the fourth quarter, has worked on appealing to a more cautious clientele without raising prices too much.  It expects sales at stores open for at least a year, or same-store sales, to jump 4-6 percent in its current quarter.  Family Dollar, Dollar General Corp (DG.N) and stores that focus on $1 items, such as Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O), have wooed shoppers away from chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) by offering more name-brand goods at lower prices.  Analyst Chukumba reckons that stores like Family Dollar are more convenient than supermarkets as they are located closer to their consumers and are easily accessible.  “I think they are gaining a lot of share from supermarkets, drug stores and convenience stores,” analyst Chukumba said.  Shoppers often wind up paying more per ounce or serving size by buying an item at a dollar store instead of at Wal-Mart or other chains that offer larger packs. Still, when money is tight, a smaller container of milk or detergent seems like a bargain even if it costs more per ounce.  The world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, which has posted nine straight quarters of declining same-store sales, is also trying to offer more lower-priced items to attract customers.  Family Dollar’s board also authorized the repurchase of an additional $250 million in stock.

44,CVS,UPDATE 1-Aetna and CVS latest to offer Medicare drug plan," Oct 3 (Reuters) - Aetna Inc (AET.N) and CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) are jointly offering a U.S. Medicare prescription drug plan, the latest such arrangement between a health insurer and a drugstore chain.   Coventry Health Care Inc CVH.N said over the weekend it would offer a Medicare drug plan in 2012 with Walgreen Co WAG.N and discount retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), which have pharmacies in their stores.   The Aetna plan, which the companies announced on Monday, has no deductible for generic drugs and will cost $26 per month in premiums. The Coventry plan has an average monthly premium of $25.60 and no annual deductible.   A year ago, Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Wal-Mart teamed up for a Medicare drug plan.   The Aetna-CVS plan deepens the companies’ relationship. Last year, CVS landed a 12-year deal to manage some pharmacy benefits for about 9.7 million Aetna pharmacy members and administer about $9.5 billion in annual drug spending.   Medicare, the U.S. government health coverage program for the elderly and disabled, began offering a drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D, in 2006 through private plans approved by the government.

45,CVS,Exclusive: Dozens of states probe Medco/Express Scripts deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Over two dozen states are scrutinizing Express Scripts’ (ESRX.O) proposed acquisition of Medco Health Solutions MHS.N, as pharmacists stoke fears that the $22 billion deal would propel the companies’ aggressive tactics.  More than 25 states have formed a group concerned about the potential merger of the two massive pharmacy benefit managers, said James Donahue of the Pennsylvania state attorney general’s office, who declined to name the states.  Connecticut and Iowa are among those concerned, according to officials from those states.  The states do not have a direct say in the review by the Federal Trade Commission, whose role is to make sure the deal complies with antitrust law.  But they will likely add pressure on the FTC to give tough scrutiny to the merger, and could hand the agency evidence that would potentially serve as ammunition to challenge it.  The states could also challenge the deal on their own.  The deal, announced in July, would combine two of the three largest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that are big enough to manage prescription drug benefits for large, nationwide companies. It would create an industry leader with nearly one-third of the market.  The FTC is already getting an earful from community and specialty pharmacists who feel bullied by Medco and Express Scripts as the companies negotiate drug prices for employers and other clients worried about spiraling healthcare costs.  There are allegations that the PBM industry drives a hard bargain but largely pockets the savings. There have also been complaints that the PBMs unfairly pressure doctors and patients to switch to their own in-house pharmacies.  The pharmacy groups opposed to the deal have met with staff at the FTC and with individual commissioners at least five times since the deal was announced, said David Balto, a former FTC policy director who is working with the pharmacists.  The FTC is in the early stages of its probe, said Balto. The FTC declined to comment on its review.  “They were very interested in our thoughts,” said Russell Gay, executive director of the Independent Specialty Pharmacy Coalition. “We are asking for it to be blocked.”  Shares of Medco have continued to trade below the value implied by Express Scripts’ cash and stock offer, closing at a 20 percent discount on Wednesday, suggesting investors are concerned the deal may not win approval.  Specialty pharmacists — who provide medicines for chronic, serious ailments like hemophilia or hepatitis C and provide some patient oversight — say that Express Scripts is contacting patients’ doctors and asking them to switch patients from their usual specialty pharmacy to CuraScript, a specialty pharmacy company which Express bought in 2004.  PBMs that own specialty pharmacies contact patients’ doctors thousands of times a day to urge that the patients be shifted to the PBM-owned pharmacy, said Gay. “We’re constantly fighting these days in order to get authorization for patients we have today.”  Express Scripts described the effort as a way to keep rising health care costs under control.  “Moving patients to the lowest cost, clinically equivalent treatment is a core PBM tool, and the country absolutely needs this sort of benefit management,” said Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry in an email. “Whether or not to use CuraScript, just like mail order, is a plan sponsor decision.”  Some specialty pharmacists say Express Scripts subjects them to abusive audits as it tries to move into the business.  “Express Scripts audits almost every single claim from (a health care plan),” said one specialty pharmacist who asked not to be named and questioned if the company audits itself as aggressively.  Express Scripts said the audits were needed. “Pharmacy audits that ensure proper payments save plan sponsors and patients money,” said Henry.  “We’re committed to working with FTC, and we welcome their questions,” he added.  Community pharmacists, already facing stiff challenges from big-box store pharmacies like Wal-Mart (WMT.N), fear powerful pharmacy benefits managers will push for consumers to get many drugs, like blood pressure medicines, by mail.  They fear a replay of the fight with CVS Caremark (CVS.N), the largest U.S. prescription drug provider and second-largest drugstore chain, which has been accused of using Caremark data to steer customers to mail order or to CVS retail pharmacies.  CVS said in November 2009 that the FTC was investigating its business practices.  The FTC was an early supporter of PBMs, on the grounds that a strong drug distributor would be able to negotiate good prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers.  But the three big pharmacy benefits manager companies — Express Scripts, Medco and Caremark, before its merger with CVS in 2007, have been in hot water with regulators.  All three settled with states angered by the companies urging doctors and patients to switch medications, saying it would benefit the patient or plan. In fact, usually it was the PBM which benefited in the form of rebates given to the PBM by the drug company, said a source who spoke privately.  Medco reached a multi-state agreement that cost it $29.3 million in 2004, while Caremark and Express Scripts made similar settlements in 2008 for $41 million and $9.5 million, respectively.  Express Scripts said on Wednesday it never admitted to wrongdoing in the settlement.  If regulators find that abusive practices are rife throughout the industry, they may be reluctant to allow a merger that would create a U.S. powerhouse in managing prescription drug benefits.",10052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-medco-expressscripts/exclusive-dozens-of-states-probe-medco-express-scripts-deal-idUSTRE7946EB20111005
46,CVS,CVS Caremark's higher profit tops expectations,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) posted a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Thursday as its pharmacy benefits business improved, and it expects this year’s profit to be at the higher end of its prior forecast. CVS shares rise 3.8 percent in afternoon trading. The company, which operates the CVS drugstore chain and the Caremark pharmacy benefits management business, said Caremark got off to a good start in the current benefits selling season. Analysts were also pleased with the margins in that business, which had been under pressure in recent years. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, administer drug benefits for employers and health plans. With nearly 70 percent of its contracts up for renewal in 2012 completed so far, Caremark had a 98 percent retention rate. Walgreen Co WAG.N plans to leave Express Scripts Inc’s (ESRX.O) network starting in 2012. Since CVS competes with Walgreen and Caremark competes with Express Scripts, it remains to be seen just how much CVS Caremark can benefit if that relationship ends. It is too early to see any material lift from that spat, CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call. “It’s our opinion that (CVS Caremark) are pretty well positioned to benefit from that, however it goes, just because any time there is customer disruption, you would like to be the guy that doesn’t have any,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark. Clark, who has “buy” ratings on CVS, Walgreen and Express Scripts, said that he still expects Walgreen and Express Scripts to reach a deal by the end of the year. At the same time, Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) is working on buying Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N, a deal that could affect business at both CVS and Walgreen. Walgreen said on Thursday it expects to achieve 97 percent to 99 percent of its fiscal 2011 prescription volume in fiscal 2012, a forecast that does not include any assumption on Express Scripts’ pending acquisition of Medco. Net income attributable to CVS Caremark rose to $868 million, or 65 cents per share, from $809 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to CVS Caremark rose to 70 cents from 64 cents, topping CVS’s forecast of 66 to 68 cents and analysts’ average forecast of 68 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 12.5 percent to $26.67 billion, while analysts were looking for $26.75 billion. Revenue in the pharmacy services business jumped 25.8 percent to $14.8 billion, due largely to the addition of a previously announced major contract with Aetna Inc (AET.N) and the acquisition Universal American Corp’s UAM.N Medicare prescription drug business. Revenue in the drugstore unit, which operates more than 7,300 stores and accounts for roughly half of total revenue, rose 3.8 percent to $14.7 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 2.3 percent. Consumers remain “pretty cautious,” a move that weighs on sales but can also help profitability as they switch to the chain’s own branded goods, which carry higher margins, Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton told Reuters in an interview. The outbreak of flu so far this season has been modest, leading to lower flu-related prescription volume, though the company has been administering more flu shots, he said. Meanwhile, Walgreen’s October same-store sales rose just 2.6 percent, falling short of analysts’ average forecast for a rise of 4.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Walgreen has administered fewer flu shots than it had by the same time last year, it said. CVS expects to post adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.77 to $2.81 per share this year, trimming 2 cents off of the low end of the range it gave in August. Analysts’ average 2011 forecast is $2.78 per share. It will give more outlook at a December 20 analyst meeting. Shares of CVS were up 3.8 percent to $37.12 in afternoon trading, while shares of Walgreen fell 1.3 percent to $32.56.

48,CVS,FDA stings retailers for selling tobacco to minors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Health regulators have hit some 1,200 retailers, including Walgreen, CVS and Rite Aid, with warnings this year for unlawfully selling cigarettes and other tobacco products to children under 18. The Food and Drug Administration said inspectors had made 27,500 undercover checks, many of which involved sending minors to stores to buy cigarettes. The undercover operations resulted in hundreds of warning letters to retailers. Spokesmen for CVS Caremark Corp and Rite Aid Corp said the companies regretted that their policies were not followed. Rite Aid was taking corrective action at the seven stores that received warning letters, including retraining all the staff, the company spokesman said. CVS took appropriate actions to correct problems at its six stores and since the FDA’s inspection program began, CVS spokesman said, the retailer has had a success rate of more than 98 percent. Walgreen Co was not immediately available for comment. The FDA received broad authority over tobacco manufacturing and sales from the Tobacco Control Act of 2009. One of the provisions allows the agency to contract with states to inspect spots where youths could buy cigarettes or chewable tobacco. The law requires store workers to check identification of anybody who appears younger than 27. The FDA posted the warning letters online on Thursday alongside a vast searchable database of all conducted compliance checks. The letters allow retailers to correct their mistakes without fines. Repeat offenders could face fines or loss of ability to sell tobacco. “We applaud the efforts made by many retail establishments to protect our kids, but ... it’s 1,200 too many” stores that allowed minors to buy tobacco products, Ann Simoneau with FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products told reporters on a press call. “We’ve seen violations across the board, in all kinds of establishments,” she said when asked whether FDA targeted any specific types of stores. Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. Every day, some 3,450 Americans between 12 and 17 years old try their first cigarette, and about 850 youths become daily smokers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. FDA officials said they are on a mission to begin battling the stubbornly high U.S. smoking rates by keeping tobacco out of underage hands in the first place. “The public education, compliance checks and warning letters are good for a start. What will be critical is that FDA act aggressively on repeat offenders,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Earlier this year, the FDA released nine new graphic images they are requiring tobacco companies to place prominently on cigarette packs and advertising. Several companies, led by Reynolds American Inc’s R.J. Reynolds unit, balked at the new labels, which depict diseased lungs, dead bodies and rotting teeth. They sued the FDA, saying the agency breached their First Amendment rights. On Monday, a federal judge blocked the rule and granted a temporary injunction.

49,CVS,UPDATE 2-UnitedHealth switches drug unit CEO amid expansion,"* Dirk McMahon to replace Jacqueline Kosecoff at OptumRx * Comes as OptumRx brings Medco business in house * Shares down 2 pct, in line with market By Lewis Krauskopf Nov 23 (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc changed the leadership of its pharmacy benefit unit as the business readies for a major expansion that stands to pit it against Express Scripts Inc and CVS Caremark Corp . Dirk McMahon, who has been leading operations for the benefit plans under the health insurer’s UnitedHealthcare banner, is taking over as chief executive officer of OptumRx, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. He replaces Jacqueline Kosecoff, who will become senior advisor to Larry Renfro, the CEO of UnitedHealth’s Optum services businesses. The moves were effective last Friday, UnitedHealth spokesman Don Nathan said. UnitedHealth is gearing up for a major expansion when it takes over the prescription benefits business it had previously outsourced to Medco Health Solutions Inc after the contract expires next year. The addition of the Medco business helps position UnitedHealth as a national rival to Express Scripts, which has struck a $29 billion deal to buy Medco, and CVS. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, administer drug benefits for employers and health plans, and run extensive mail-order pharmacies. UnitedHealth’s executive changes come ahead of the company’s annual investor day to be held in New York next Tuesday, when it is expected to provide more detail about its 2012 financial forecasts. Growth in the company’s Optum businesses, along with its Medicare plans for the elderly, is expected to boost earnings next year, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Sarah James. Moving the pharmacy business in-house is expected to add roughly $11 billion in revenue, James said in a research note on Wednesday previewing the meeting. “We believe United’s PBM is poised to grow organically, taking share,” James said. UnitedHealth shares were off 2 percent at $43.54 in morning trading on a down day for the overall market.",11232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/djc-unitedhealth/update-2-unitedhealth-switches-drug-unit-ceo-amid-expansion-idUSN1E7AM0PT20111123
50,CVS,CVS will not fill some prescriptions for potent drugs in Florida,"ORLANDO, Fla (Reuters) - CVS has told some doctors in Florida, the nation’s pill mill capital, that its retail pharmacies will no longer fill prescriptions they write for some potent and addictive drugs, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. “While we regret any inconvenience this may cause for our customers, we treat the dispensing of controlled substances with the utmost care and seriousness,” CVS corporate public relations director Michael DeAngelis told Reuters in an e-mailed statement. DeAngelis said the company had sent letters to “a small number of Florida physicians” announcing the decision, which he said applied only to prescriptions presented at Florida retail pharmacies. He gave no further details. Florida doctors prescribe 10 times more oxycodone - a frequently abused pain killer - than all other states combined, according to federal estimates. The Florida Attorney General’s office reports that the state is the primary source of illegal prescription drugs for the eastern United States. State and federal agents have arrested dozens of people this year including doctors during statewide raids on pill mills that dispense medically unnecessary narcotics, commonly oxycodone. The Florida attorney general’s office reports that nearly 1,000 pain management clinics, not all of them fraudulent, operate in the state. Jeffrey Scott, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, told Reuters that “CVS’s notification was a decision made solely by CVS and not at our direction.” A letter on CVS Caremark letterhead detailing the move, a copy of which was posted on the website of Health News Florida, said the company was concerned about prescription drug abuse in the state. “This is to inform you that CVS/pharmacy stores will not be able to fill prescriptions that you write for Schedule II narcotic controlled substances,” the letter, dated November 18, said. The name of the letter recipient was blacked out. “CVS Pharmacy, Inc. has become increasingly concerned with escalating reports of prescription drug abuse in Florida, especially oxycodone abuse,” it added. The letter also advises that CVS will continue to review the issue and notify the doctors if their status changes.

51,CVS,"CVS Caremark sees PBM strength in 2012, shares up","(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) on Tuesday silenced some critics of its 2007 merger as it showed that major corporations are choosing its combination of pharmacy benefits management and drugstores as a way to cut healthcare costs. IBM (IBM.N), Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) and others have signed up for the company’s Caremark pharmacy benefits management plan for 2012, executives said at an analyst meeting on Tuesday. Those additions, along with a healthy dose of branded drugs moving to more profitable generic versions, should help push operating profit at the Caremark unit up 11 percent to 15 percent next year, said Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton. Shares of CVS, which also said earnings should increase next year and raised its dividend, rose as much as 9 percent to their highest level since June 2008. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run mail-order pharmacies. CVS can add the ability to pick up prescriptions at its namesake drugstores in Maintenance Choice, a service that IBM and some other new clients have signed up for. The company’s PBM is expected to show a roughly 7 percent to 8 percent decline in operating profit for 2011, as CVS worked on turning around results. “It was only a few years ago that we were selling the belief that we could do all this,” said Chief Executive Larry Merlo. “Today, we’re selling the results.” Since the completion of the $27 billion deal in 2007 that merged CVS and Caremark, CVS has tried to address criticism that the combination has crushed profitability. The PBM hit a low point in late 2009, when it lost $4.8 billion in contracts and its president left. Fast forward two years, and the unit has signed $12.3 billion in new contracts for 2012, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier, said Per Lofberg, president of Caremark pharmacy services, who joined the company in 2010. Caremark also retained 98 percent of its clients, improving upon retention rates of 96 percent and 90 percent in the prior two years. “Overall the multiyear turnaround is gaining momentum,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Muken, who attended the meeting. Among the new contract wins, Caremark will start to handle PBM services for IBM and for pension fund and benefits manager CalPERS, which it said were both previously clients of Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N. Now, CVS is busy adding services to satisfy such clients. Its Pharmacy Advisor program, currently focused on diabetes, tries to help patients better adhere to drug regimens. Next year, the program will be expanded to include certain cardiovascular conditions, asthma, depression, cancer and osteoporosis, CVS said. Other conditions, such as arthritis, should be added thereafter. Shares of CVS ended regular trading on Tuesday up 8.9 percent at $39.80, while shares of Walgreen Co WAG.N, its largest drugstore competitor, rose 2.3 percent to $33.50. Walgreen is due to report quarterly results on Wednesday. (For a graphic that compares CVS Caremark and Walgreen, click on link.reuters.com/vus65s) CVS forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25 for 2012, which would be an increase of 13 percent to 16.5 percent from the midpoint of its 2011 forecast. Analysts on average have forecast $3.21 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue is expected to rise 11.5 percent to 13 percent. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, are only expected to rise 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent, as CVS feels the impact of generic versions of popular drugs, such as Lipitor and Plavix, hitting the market. Generic drugs produce lower revenue than their branded counterparts but are more profitable for CVS and others to sell. CVS said its forecast excluded any potential benefits from an end to the relationship between Walgreen and pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O), which have not yet agreed on a new contract. The current contract between Walgreen and Express Scripts expires on December 31. If Walgreen stops filling roughly $5 billion annually in Express Scripts prescriptions, sales at other pharmacies could increase. An end to that contract could add 8 cents to 11 cents per share to CVS earnings in 2012, CFO Denton said. The company also said that it expects to earn 58 cents to 60 cents on an adjusted basis in the first quarter. CVS said its board had approved a 30 percent increase in its dividend, payable in February, bringing the quarterly payout to 16.25 cents per share from 12.5 cents. The dividend increased nearly 43 percent in January. ",12202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cvscaremark/cvs-caremark-sees-pbm-strength-in-2012-shares-up-idUSTRE7BJ23620111220
52,CVS,CVS agrees to pay $5 million to settles investigation,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp agreed to pay $5 million to settle charges of inaccurate pricing of some drugs for the elderly and the disabled, ending a wide-ranging, multi-year probe into its business practices. The Federal Trade Commission said RxAmerica, which CVS bought in 2008, had posted incorrect prices online for some Medicare Part D prescription drugs sold at CVS and Walgreen Co stores. In some cases, the real prices were 10 times higher than those posted, the FTC said. The $5 million will be used to reimburse seniors who overpaid, the FTC said in a statement. CVS said the incorrect pricing was inadvertent. The settlement had a small impact on CVS shares, which were up 0.3 percent to $42.15 in afternoon trading. Consumer groups and some lawmakers had asked for tougher action. They had accused CVS of arranging to have consumers’ prescriptions filled only at CVS without the consumers’ permission and using Caremark data on consumers to steer them to CVS pharmacies. Critics also accused CVS of designing its prescription drug card to mislead consumers into believing it could only be used at CVS. CVS acquired Caremark, a major pharmacy benefits manager, in 2007. CVS said in a statement that it was pleased to see the end of the probe, which it first acknowledged in 2009. “There were no allegations of antitrust law violations or anti-competitive behavior related to CVS Caremark’s business practices or its products or service offerings,” the company said in a statement. Sharon Treat, director of the National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug Prices, said the settlement amount sounded low given the number of people on the Part D plan and said she was disappointed that the FTC could not, on its own, fine CVS. “I don’t know whether this amount of rebate addresses the problem that some people didn’t buy the drugs because they couldn’t afford it,” she said, calling the $5 million “a not very significant deterrence.” FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said the settlement was aimed at helping older Americans. “With the cost of health care on the rise, the FTC is especially focused on protecting consumers from any deceptive claims that would cause them to pay more than they should,” he said.

53,CVS,DEA raids 2 CVS pharmacies in drug abuse probe,"ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - The Drug Enforcement Administration said on Monday it raided two CVS pharmacies over the weekend as part of an effort to curb the abuse of prescription painkillers and other potentially addictive substances. The action, which occurred on Saturday, came one day after the agency suspended the license of drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc, prohibiting it from shipping such products from its facility in Lakeland, Florida. Cardinal immediately obtained a restraining order allowing it to continue shipments pending a hearing on February 13. Florida’s drug enforcers have been cracking down on pharmacies for several years, but this is the first time they have targeted a major chain. Mark Trouville, special agent in charge of DEA’s Miami bureau, said at a press conference that last year the two pharmacies, located 5.5 miles apart in Sanford, about 30 miles south of Orlando, ordered 3 million doses of the painkiller oxycodone. That compares to an national average of 69,000. Trouville said the pharmacies either knew, or should have known, that a large number of the prescriptions it filled were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose. Red flags the pharmacies should have recognized included misspelled drug names, irregular dosing instructions and phony telephone numbers on prescriptions, he said. In some instances, four or five people dropped off identical prescriptions from the same doctor at the same time, paid for by one person. CVS Caremark Corp said that it was “disappointed” in the DEA’s action. “CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its compliance with and support of the measures taken by federal and state law enforcement officials to prevent drug abuse and keep controlled substances out of the wrong hands,” it said in an emailed statement. The company said that that last fall, with the knowledge of the DEA, it had informed a small number of Florida physicians that it would no longer fill the prescriptions they write for controlled narcotics. As a result, distributions of oxycodone to the two Florida stores that were raided have decreased by about 80 percent in the last three months from the prior three months. Florida is at the epicenter of the national crisis of illegal prescription drug use. Seven people in the state die each day as a result of prescription drug abuse, more than from heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine combined, Trouville said. Two other pharmacies were also served last week with suspension orders, but Trouville said they gave up their registrations rather than fight the matter in court. Under DEA rules, those pharmacies are not publicly identified. CVS said it is cooperating with the DEA. In the meantime, “we remain committed to ensuring that all our customers, including customers of the two pharmacies, get the medications they need, including controlled substances.” Controlled substances are those, such as stimulants, painkillers and tranquilizers, that have the potential for addiction and abuse. Every entity that handles a controlled substance, from the manufacturer to the distributor to the pharmacy to the physician, must register with the agency. Cardinal said on Friday that the DEA had suspended its license based on suspiciously high volume at the four pharmacies. But the company told a judge that it had already stopped shipping to two of the pharmacies several months ago, and stopped shipping to the CVS stores after its license was temporarily suspended on Friday morning. Cardinal has protested the DEA’s action, saying the agency fails to share information that could help industry and government alike prevent diversion of the products for illegal use. Trouville declined to address Cardinal’s concerns, saying, “That will be sorted out in court.” ",2062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dea-raids/dea-raids-2-cvs-pharmacies-in-drug-abuse-probe-idUSTRE8151NA20120206

Mark Trouville, special agent in charge of DEA’s Miami bureau, said at a press conference that last year the two pharmacies, located 5.5 miles apart in Sanford, about 30 miles south of Orlando, ordered 3 million doses of the painkiller oxycodone. That compares to an national average of 69,000. Trouville said the pharmacies either knew, or should have known, that a large number of the prescriptions it filled were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose. Red flags the pharmacies should have recognized included misspelled drug names, irregular dosing instructions and phony telephone numbers on prescriptions, he said. In some instances, four or five people dropped off identical prescriptions from the same doctor at the same time, paid for by one person. CVS Caremark Corp said that it was “disappointed” in the DEA’s action. “CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its compliance with and support of the measures taken by federal and state law enforcement officials to prevent drug abuse and keep controlled substances out of the wrong hands,” it said in an emailed statement. The company said that that last fall, with the knowledge of the DEA, it had informed a small number of Florida physicians that it would no longer fill the prescriptions they write for controlled narcotics. As a result, distributions of oxycodone to the two Florida stores that were raided have decreased by about 80 percent in the last three months from the prior three months. Florida is at the epicenter of the national crisis of illegal prescription drug use. Seven people in the state die each day as a result of prescription drug abuse, more than from heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine combined, Trouville said. Two other pharmacies were also served last week with suspension orders, but Trouville said they gave up their registrations rather than fight the matter in court. Under DEA rules, those pharmacies are not publicly identified. CVS said it is cooperating with the DEA. In the meantime, “we remain committed to ensuring that all our customers, including customers of the two pharmacies, get the medications they need, including controlled substances.” Controlled substances are those, such as stimulants, painkillers and tranquilizers, that have the potential for addiction and abuse. Every entity that handles a controlled substance, from the manufacturer to the distributor to the pharmacy to the physician, must register with the agency. Cardinal said on Friday that the DEA had suspended its license based on suspiciously high volume at the four pharmacies. But the company told a judge that it had already stopped shipping to two of the pharmacies several months ago, and stopped shipping to the CVS stores after its license was temporarily suspended on Friday morning. Cardinal has protested the DEA’s action, saying the agency fails to share information that could help industry and government alike prevent diversion of the products for illegal use. Trouville declined to address Cardinal’s concerns, saying, “That will be sorted out in court.” ",2062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvs-raid/update-1-us-dea-raids-2-cvs-pharmacies-in-drug-abuse-probe-idUSL2E8D6H6V20120206
55,CVS,US DEA raids 2 CVS pharmacies in drug abuse probe,"* DEA action part of prescription drug abuse crackdown * Follows action against Cardinal Health * DEA press conference to be held on Monday Feb 6 (Reuters) - Agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raided two CVS pharmacies in Florida as part of an effort to curb the abuse of prescription painkillers and other potentially addictive substances. The action on Saturday came one day after the agency suspended the license of drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc  to ship such products from its facility in Lakeland, Florida. Cardinal immediately obtained a restraining order allowing it to continue shipments pending a hearing on Feb. 13. The DEA declined to discuss details of the raids, but it plans to hold a news conference at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT) on Monday “to announce the latest efforts by the Drug Enforcement Administration in its efforts to thwart the diversion of licit pharmaceutical controlled substances.” Controlled substances are those, like stimulants, painkillers and tranquilizers, that can be addictive. Every entity that handles a controlled substance, from the manufacturer to the distributor to the pharmacy to the physician, must register with the agency. The DEA’s action comes as Florida, like other states, battles an ever-rising tide of prescription drug abuse. Cardinal said on Friday that the DEA had suspended its license based on suspiciously high volume at four pharmacies. The company told a judge that it had already stopped shipping to two of the pharmacies several months ago, and stopped shipping to the CVS stores, in Sanford, after its license was temporarily suspended on Friday morning. CVS Caremark Corp said in an emailed statement that it was “disappointed that the DEA has taken an administrative action to prohibit two CVS/pharmacy stores in Florida from dispensing controlled substances. “CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its compliance with and support of the measures taken by federal and state law enforcement officials to prevent drug abuse and keep controlled substances out of the wrong hands.” CVS said that last fall, with the knowledge of the DEA, it had informed a small number of Florida physicians that it would no longer fill the prescriptions they write for controlled narcotics. As a result, distributions of oxycodone to the two Florida stores have decreased by about 80 percent in the last three months from the prior three months, CVS said. “We are cooperating with the DEA in regard to the administrative action,” the company said. “Meanwhile, we remain committed to ensuring that all our customers, including customers of the two pharmacies, get the medications they need, including controlled substances.”",2062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvs-raid/us-dea-raids-2-cvs-pharmacies-in-drug-abuse-probe-idUSL2E8D66V020120206
56,CVS,CVS seeks restraining order in drug abuse probe,"* Application follows raid on two pharmacies * Dispute centers on painkiller oxycodone Feb 7 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp has applied for a temporary restraining order that would prevent the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from prohibiting two CVS pharmacies in Florida from selling prescription painkillers and other controlled substances. On Saturday, the DEA raided two CVS stores in Sanford, about 30 miles south of Orlando, in the belief the stores were filling illegitimate prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone. On Friday, the DEA sought to prohibit drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc from selling any controlled substances from its facility in Lakeland, Florida, saying four customers, including the two CVS stores, filled prescriptions that were not issued for legitimate medical uses. Cardinal, which told a judge on Friday that it had stopped supplying two of the pharmacies months ago, and stopped selling to the CVS stores on receiving the order from DEA, immediately won a restraining order against the DEA allowing the company to continue shipping products to its 5,200 or so accounts pending a hearing on Feb. 13. CVS hopes for a similar ruling. The company said that last October the DEA served both pharmacies with warrants seeking documents related to oxycodone dispensing volumes. The agency also sought documents relating to certain prescribers. CVS said it cooperated with the DEA and provided all requested information. Even so, the agency served the pharmacies with immediate suspension orders on Saturday preventing them from filling prescriptions for any controlled substance. These might include painkillers, tranquilizers and stimulants. The company said the DEA relied for its information on volume dispensed before October 2011, and that volumes at both stores in November and December decreased significantly. The company said the DEA has failed to identify any specific prescribers or prescriptions where there was evidence that the prescriber was not valid and registered by the DEA, or where the prescriptions were not issued for a legitimate purpose, or where the pharmacist should have known about either event. For it’s part, the DEA says the pharmacies should have been suspicious because some of the doctors who had written prescriptions filled at the stores were the subjects of criminal, civil or administrative actions. CVS filed its motion in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

57,CVS,CVS raises forecast due to rivals' rift,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) raised its full-year profit forecast as it wins over former patrons of Walgreen Co WAG.N who fill prescriptions with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O). CVS, which operates the CVS drugstore chain and the CVS Caremark pharmacy benefits management business, also posted a fourth-quarter profit in line with analysts’ expectations, helped by better-than-expected revenue. Shares of CVS, which plans $3.8 billion of dividend payments and share repurchases this year, rose 2.3 percent in midday trade. Its strongest growth in the fourth quarter came from the pharmacy side, while sales of general merchandise at existing drugstores rose just 0.1 percent, due largely to weak sales of Christmas merchandise and over-the-counter flu medications. The company’s combined retail and pharmacy benefits business “is really working right now,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark, who has a “buy” rating on CVS shares. “One quarter of weakness in one part of their business isn’t really a cause for alarm.” CVS, with more than 7,300 U.S. stores, is among the retailers benefitting as Express Scripts patients go elsewhere after Walgreen stopped filling their prescriptions at the beginning of the year. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, such as Express Scripts and CVS Caremark administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run mail-order pharmacies. CVS can add the ability to pick up prescriptions at its namesake drugstores. In late December, CVS anticipated that it could see a lift of about 2 cents per share in the first quarter from the rift between Walgreen and Express Scripts. Now, CVS sees a boost of 3 cents a share in the quarter, and said on Wednesday that it believes it is gaining more than its fair share of Walgreen’s former Express Scripts business. Overall, bringing in new patients has gone well, although there were delays at some stores where business picked up much more than usual, CVS Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton said. In San Francisco, for example, CVS has just three stores, while Walgreen has more than 60. Those CVS stores have had a 10-fold increase in prescription volume, Denton said. “It’s hard on day one to accommodate that,” he said in an interview. “We’ve done a lot to improve the service there.” Denton declined to say much about the prospects of Express Scripts buying rival PBM Medco Health Solutions MHS.N, a deal being reviewed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. CVS believes it is well-positioned to compete with the larger entity if the deal is approved, he said. CVS added 3 cents per share to its first-quarter and full-year earnings forecasts to reflect the expected benefit in just the current quarter from the Walgreen-Express Scripts dispute. It now expects to earn 61 cents to 63 cents per share this quarter and $3.18 to $3.28 per share this year. Analysts were looking for 61 cents per share and $3.25 per share, respectively, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In December, Denton said the rift could add 8 cents to 11 cents per share to the company’s full-year 2012 profit. “It could prove a little conservative,” said Clark. Last week, Walgreen said it was hit by its withdrawal from the Express Scripts network and by a much-weaker-than-expected flu season, leading it to temper its expectations for the number of prescriptions it will fill this year. Walgreen continues to believe that leaving the Express Scripts network, rather than agreeing to what it felt were less-than-acceptable terms, will lead it to prosper after the current shakeout as many customers leave it for other pharmacies. Shares of CVS rose 2.3 percent to $44.06 in midday trading, while Walgreen’s shares fell 1.2 percent to $33.06. CVS raised its sales expectations as business picks up at pharmacy counters and as it adds new PBM clients. It now expects 2012 revenue to rise 12 percent to 13.5 percent, up from a December forecast of 11.5 percent to 13 percent. It expects sales at stores open for at least a year, or same-store sales, to rise 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, a full percentage point more than before. Fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company rose to $1.06 billion, or 81 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for acquisitions, earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to the company climbed to 89 cents from 79 cents a year earlier, meeting analysts’ forecast. Revenue rose 15.2 percent to $28.32 billion, while analysts anticipated $28.12 billion. Pharmacy services revenue soared more than 32 percent to $15.87 billion, due largely to the addition of a big Aetna Inc (AET.N) contract and the acquisition of Universal American Corp’s UAM.N Medicare prescription drug business, two deals that were previously announced. Revenue in the drugstore unit rose 4 percent to $15.5 billion. Same-store sales rose 2.5 percent.

59,CVS,CVS gets restraining order in drug abuse probe,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday granted CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) a temporary restraining order allowing it to keep selling controlled prescription drugs at two Florida pharmacies at the center of raids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, of U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said it was likely CVS would be able to show that the DEA failed to establish the “imminent danger to public health” necessary to suspend the pharmacies’ registrations. On Saturday, the DEA raided two CVS stores in Sanford, about 30 miles south of Orlando, on the belief the stores were filling illegitimate prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone. CVS sought a temporary restraining order, saying it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to stop filling prescriptions at the pharmacies. Judge Jackson agreed, saying once customers find a new pharmacy, “they are unlikely to come back.” The judge also said CVS was likely to win on the underlying issue of whether its alleged misdeeds posed a serious public safety threat. CVS has already agreed to stop selling oxycodone and other so-called Schedule II drugs at the pharmacies while the case plays out before an administrative law judge, Jackson noted. CVS said that last October the DEA served both pharmacies with warrants seeking documents related to oxycodone dispensing volumes. The agency also sought documents relating to certain prescribers. CVS said it cooperated with the DEA and provided all requested information.

64,CVS,UPDATE 1-US can stop some drug sales at 2 CVS stores-judge,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration can stop two CVS Caremark Corp  pharmacies from selling potentially addictive drugs in a case involving suspected prescription drug abuse, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton vacated a temporary restraining order that had blocked the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)from acting against the two Florida stores suspected of selling doses of the painkiller oxycodone outside legitimate channels. Walton stayed his ruling until 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Wednesday to give CVS Caremark attorneys time to appeal. But the company appealed later on Tuesday. Further details were not immediately available. CVS Caremark had asked the judge to impose a preliminary injunction that could have blocked the DEA from taking action until an administrative law judge decided the matter later this year. Walton said he could find no reason to believe the CVS argument that DEA had acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner in ordering sales suspended or that remedial steps taken by CVS were sufficient. “We are disappointed with today’s ruling,” CVS said in a statement. “Regardless of today’s outcome, we remain committed to working with the DEA to do everything we can to reduce prescription drug abuse.” The litigation stems from the DEA’s battle against prescription drug abuse, which has surged in the United States to eclipse abuse of most illicit drugs including heroin and cocaine. The DEA said in court documents that about 7 million Americans abuse pharmaceuticals made with controlled substances for purposes not related to medicine and that Florida is the center of the growing epidemic. The federal agency cited state statistics showing a 346 percent increase in overdose deaths related to oxycodone from 2005 to 2010, and an average 11 deaths per day from oxycodone, methadone, hydrocodone, benzodiazepines or morphine. In a case related to the CVS ruling, Walton last month allowed the DEA to suspend Cardinal Health Inc’s license to distribute controlled substances from a Florida facility that serves about 2,700 drug stores or hospitals. The ruling was later blocked temporarily by a U.S. appeals court. Walton said he expected the appeals court to take the same action on CVS. The CVS stores are two of four Cardinal customers that DEA has said were inappropriately filling oxycodone prescriptions. A CVS attorney said the company had stopped oxycodone sales at the two pharmacies. But a Justice Department attorney said suspicious sales had involved other controlled substances. The DEA charged that between January 2008 and December 2011 the two CVS stores purchased amounts of oxycodone far in excess of normal pharmacy volumes, ignored DEA warnings and addressed the issue only after the DEA acted. A CVS attorney told the court that the volumes were not out of line for high-volume pharmacies that maintain 24-hour service and argued that remedial steps taken by CVS had eliminated any immediate danger to the community by the time the DEA ordered sales suspended in February.

66,CVS,CORRECTED-US court lets two CVS stores sell controlled drugs,"By Anna Yukhananov WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruled that CVS Caremark Corp may continue selling potentially addictive prescription drugs at two Florida pharmacies, blocking a Drug Enforcement Administration order to suspend shipments. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order on Wednesday temporarily lifting a Feb. 4 DEA suspension that was issued because of concerns that CVS was not adequately watching for prescription abuse. The DEA said the two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, about 30 miles south of Orlando, were inappropriately filling prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone, which can be highly addictive. They also had suspicious sales of other controlled substances. CVS said the DEA had acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner in ordering sales suspended, and that remedial steps taken by CVS were sufficient. It said it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to stop filling prescriptions at the pharmacies. Initially a federal district court judge blocked the DEA order but on Tuesday agreed to let it take effect. CVS appealed the decision. The appeals court in Washington on Wednesday granted CVS’s request and issued a stay pending further proceedings.

67,CVS,Court lets two CVS stores sell controlled drugs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A appeals court ruled that CVS Caremark Corp may continue selling potentially addictive prescription drugs at two Florida pharmacies, blocking a Drug Enforcement Administration order to suspend shipments. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order on Wednesday temporarily lifting a February 4 DEA suspension that was issued because of concerns that CVS was not adequately watching for prescription abuse. The DEA said the two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, about 30 miles south of Orlando, were inappropriately filling prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone, which can be highly addictive. They also had suspicious sales of other controlled substances. CVS said the DEA had acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner in ordering sales suspended, and that remedial steps taken by CVS were sufficient. It said it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to stop filling prescriptions at the pharmacies. Initially a federal district court judge blocked the DEA order but on Tuesday agreed to let it take effect. CVS appealed the decision. The appeals court in Washington on Wednesday granted CVS’s request and issued a stay pending further proceedings.

69,CVS,CVS shutting down experimental Beauty 360 stores,"March 26 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp said on Monday that it plans to close its Beauty 360 stores and web site in May as it tries to reach a broader group of shoppers. Beauty 360, which made its debut in November 2008, was an attempt by CVS to cater to a more upscale clientele, with high-end cosmetics priced from about $15 to $170 when the first shop opened in Washington D.C.’s Dupont Circle neighborhood. CVS had planned to open about 50 of its Beauty360 stores by 2009 but only got to 25 as it faced competition from chains like LVMH’s Sephora and Ulta Salon Cosmetics and Fragrance Inc, and as it dealt with the economic downturn. The stores and web site will be shut down by May 19, the company said in a statement. Still, CVS is looking for ways to grow its beauty business. Last year, it launched a CVS/pharmacy “Beauty Club” that already has 10 million members and launched a line only sold by CVS, Nuance Salma Hayek, that has exceeded its sales expectations. CVS added that it learned a lot about beauty shoppers through the stores and plans to use that knowledge as it enhances the beauty departments in its thousands of CVS drugstores. The company is looking at each Beauty 360 location on a case by case basis to determine what to do with the space, it said. News of the shutdown was reported by Women’s Wear Daily.

70,CVS,UPDATE 1-CVS names new president for its PBM business,"March 30 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp said on Friday that Jon Roberts, chief operating officer of its pharmacy benefits management business, will become president of that critical unit on Sept. 1 as Per Lofberg gets set to retire next year. Roberts, who is also an executive vice president, will continue to report to Lofberg, CVS said. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, like CVS’ Caremark Pharmacy Services business administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run mail-order pharmacies. Lofberg joined CVS in January 2010 to lead a turnaround at Caremark after the unit hit a low point in late 2009 when it lost $4.8 billion in contracts and its president left. By late 2011, Caremark had signed $12.3 billion in new contracts for 2012, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier, and retained 98 percent of its clients, improving upon retention rates of 96 percent and 90 percent in the prior two years. Lofberg said in December that he planned to stay with the company through 2013. Once Roberts becomes president of Caremark in September, Lofberg will focus on areas such as new business development and client relationships and retention, essentially serving as a chairman of the unit. Lofberg will still report to Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo. Roberts, 56, is a pharmacist by training and has been with CVS for 21 years. He became COO of the Caremark business in 2010 after holding positions in both pharmacy and retail areas. The news came just days after PBM rival Express Scripts Inc  said it could close its $29 billion acquisition of Medco Health Solutions Inc as soon as next week. Pharmacy groups and several small pharmacy chains filed a lawsuit on Thursday arguing that the proposed merger should be stopped because it would hurt such businesses. Before Lofberg joined CVS, his career in the PBM industry included serving as chairman of Merck-Medco Managed Care LLC, which later became Medco Health Solutions.",3302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvs/update-1-cvs-names-new-president-for-its-pbm-business-idUSL2E8EU35D20120330

72,CVS,Feds weigh pulling drug licenses for two Florida CVS stores,"ARLINGTON, Va (Reuters) - A federal hearing began on Wednesday on whether to bar two CVS Caremark Corp drugstores in Florida from selling potentially addictive painkillers as part of a government crackdown on prescription pain pills, especially oxycodone. The CVS drugstores, both in Sanford, ranked 23rd and 37th respectively among the thousands of U.S. pharmacies for distribution of oxycodone, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) district supervisor Gayle Lane told the court. The DEA has increased its focus on drug wholesalers and pharmacies as it tries to battle what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call a prescription drug abuse “epidemic.” Deaths from narcotic painkillers now top those of heroin and cocaine combined. A pharmacist at one store told investigators in October 2011 that sometimes the store would run out of oxycodone as soon as 30 minutes after opening at 8 a.m and most days between 10 a.m. and noon, DEA investigator Heather Wehrle testified. “He stated he could fill oxycodone prescriptions all day long if he had the manpower and the inventory,” Wehrle said. The DEA has alleged that the two stores, about 30 miles south of Orlando, were inappropriately filling prescriptions for oxycodone, which can be highly addictive, and also had suspicious sales of other controlled substances. The hearing before Administrative Law Judge John Mulrooney II is expected to run through the end of next week, with a decision to follow later. CVS has contended that the high volume of oxycodone and other prescription painkillers from the two stores arose because they were busy pharmacies, being close to Interstate Highway 4, and one store was open 24 hours a day. The hearing follows a move by the DEA to prevent the two CVS pharmacies in Florida from selling controlled substances and to suspend Cardinal Health Inc’s license to distribute controlled substances from its plant in Lakeland, Florida. The companies also are fighting the orders in court. CVS attorney Catherine O’Neil told Mulrooney the two stores had effective controls in place, such as taking hours to verify prescriptions, and had installed new guidelines in October 2011. The company also has replaced the chief pharmacists at the stores. She said employees had no incentive to sell painkillers, adding, “They had nothing to gain and everything to lose if they failed to meet their obligations.” DEA group supervisor Ruth Carter said her checks with Cardinal Health, which supplies oxycodone, had shown that Cardinal had shipped 7.5 million pills to the two CVS stores over 36 months. Carter said records at the two stores showed that they consistently were filling “prescription cocktails” - a mix of oxycodone and anti-anxiety drugs and muscle relaxers — with the same diagnosis of lower back, or lumbar, pain. The DEA has suspended Cardinal Health’s license to distribute controlled substances - drugs that are liable to abuse - from its plant in Lakeland, Florida. Florida has long been considered the center of prescription drug abuse. Susan Langston, the acting DEA manager overseeing the diversion of prescription drugs in Florida, testified that 98 of the top 100 doctors prescribing oxycodone in the United States were in Florida, and more of the painkiller was dispensed in the state than the rest of the country combined. The DEA this month said it was inspecting six Walgreen Co pharmacies and its distribution center in Florida after the agency noticed a jump in purchases of oxycodone.

74,CVS,"CVS Caremark ups outlook, grabs Walgreen patrons","(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday after reporting a sharp rise in first-quarter sales as the drugstore operator and pharmacy benefits manager continued to win over former patrons of Walgreen Co WAG.N stores. CVS, which operates the CVS drugstore chain and the CVS Caremark pharmacy benefits management business, said net revenue rose 19.9 percent to $30.8 billion in the quarter, helped by an 8.4 percent increase in sales at drugstores open at least a year and more business from Medicare recipients. Its shares rose 2.2 percent to $45.71 in morning trading. Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, stopped filling prescriptions for patients of Express Scripts (ESRX.O), a pharmacy benefits manager, at the end of 2011 after the companies were unable to agree on the terms of their contract. Walgreen reported a same-store sales decline in the quarter ended February, and again for the month of March. CVS, with 7,352 U.S. stores, is among the retailers benefiting as Express Scripts patients go elsewhere to get their prescriptions filled and pick up items like shampoo while they’re at a drugstore. CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo told Reuters that the boost from his rivals’ fallout could be long lasting. “The longer the impasse lasts, the stickier that customer is going to be,” Merlo said. “They’re going to have an opportunity to visit a CVS multiple times and begin to establish a relationship with the CVS pharmacists.” CVS raised its full-year profit forecast by 5 cents per share at both ends of its prior forecast, to between $3.23 and $3.33 per share. Analysts were expecting it to earn $3.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the current quarter, it expects the Walgreen-Express Scripts impasse to lift earnings by 3 to 4 cents per share, and CVS forecast adjusted earnings of 78 to 80 cents per share. CVS estimated that same-store revenues from prescriptions filled would rise 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent this quarter and for same-store sales to be up 5 percent to 6 percent. At the same time, the company is not estimating what the benefit of the rift beyond the current quarter could be, because of the possibility Express Scripts and Walgreen could make up. CVS earned $776 million, or 59 cents a share, in the first quarter, up from $713 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, CVS earned 65 cents per share, beating analysts’ average forecast by 2 cents. Drugstore revenue rose 9.9 percent to $16 billion. The only things that slowed down the company’s pharmacy sales were a weak flu season and new generic drugs, which carry lower prices than brand name drugs. Pharmacy services revenue rose 32.3 percent to $18.3 billion. CVS’s purchase of Universal American Corp’s UAM.N Medicare prescription plan last year has brought in more patients getting their prescriptions filled. Medicare is the U.S. government’s health coverage plan for senior citizens. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, such as Express Scripts and CVS Caremark administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run mail-order pharmacies. CVS can add the ability to pick up prescriptions at its namesake drugstores. Merlo said he was “optimistic” at this early stage of the so-called PBM “selling season,” the annual campaign that hits to land more corporate accounts. Its two largest PBM rivals, Express Scripts and Medco, merged last month, but at least one analyst does not expect that deal to hurt CVS Caremark’s ability to win new contracts. “It doesn’t pose a threat. In many ways this can be good for CVS because they’re the clear alternative,” said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones. So far, CVS has renewed for one-quarter of the contracts coming up for renewal for 2013, which the company said was par for the course at this time of year.

Meanwhile, rival CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) continues to see a lift from Walgreen’s continued rift with pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts, CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo told reporters in Boston on Tuesday. Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, stopped filling prescriptions in January for members of Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), which manages prescription drug benefits for employers and other clients, after the two companies failed to agree on terms to renew their contract. Walgreen’s pharmacy sales at stores open at least a year fell 8.5 percent in May, it said on Tuesday. The spat with Express Scripts hit comparable store prescriptions by 10.8 percentage points, Walgreen said. Speaking to reporters after a speech to Boston College’s Chief Executives’ Club, Merlo said that while the situation between Express Scripts and Walgreen remains “fluid,” he believes CVS has won more than its share of new business. “One of the things we have always believed about the pharmacy customer is, it’s the hardest person to lose, but once you’ve lose them, it’s the hardest person to win back,” he said. “We hope to retain a high percentage of those customers.” CVS operates the CVS drugstore chain and the CVS Caremark pharmacy benefits management business. Pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, such as Express Scripts and CVS Caremark administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run large mail order pharmacies. Still, Walgreen expects its pharmacy business to be helped by employers and health plans changing benefits managers or adding details to new contracts to ensure continued access to its drugstores, Chief Financial Officer Wade Miquelon said in a statement. Those comments followed Walgreen’s announcement on Monday that it had extended its partnership with OptumRx, a PBM owned by UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N). “The agreement with OptumRx is not significant in our opinion because the market was not expecting OptumRx to exclude (Walgreen) from its pharmacy network,” said Barclays analyst Meredith Adler. CVS said in early May that the Walgreen-Express Scripts impasse should lift its second-quarter earnings by 3 to 4 cents a share. Merlo said the disruption caused by the Walgreen-Express Scripts dispute was less severe than might have been expected and is having an impact on how PBM customers view the lineup of services they are willing to provide their members. “One of the things we have seen that is different from past selling seasons is that in responding to the RFPs (request for proposals) clients are interested in looking at an opportunity for a more restricted network versus a full network,” Merlo said. “It’s something that is getting a lot more focus and attention than in prior years.” Merlo said Express Scripts “did an exceptional job of minimizing member disruption.” Walgreen said its total third-quarter sales fell 3.3 percent to $17.77 billion. Overall same-store sales fell 6.5 percent, while same-store pharmacy sales plunged 9.8 percent. Shares of Walgreen rose 0.2 percent to $30.58 on Tuesday. Shares of CVS slipped 0.2 percent to $44.03.

In a complaint filed Tuesday with the federal court in Trenton, New Jersey, CVS and Rite Aid accused Pfizer’s Wyeth unit of scheming to block generic versions of Effexor XR for at least two years after its marketing rights to the original compound lapsed in June 2008. They said Wyeth did this by obtaining fraudulent patents, engaging in sham litigation against Teva and 16 other generic drug makers, and scheming with Teva to keep cheaper generic equivalents off the market and prolong Teva’s generic exclusivity rights. U.S. sales of Effexor XR topped $2.5 billion annually during this period, they said. “Plaintiffs have sustained substantial injuries to their business and property in the form of overcharges,” the complaint said. CVS and Rite Aid are seeking triple damages and other remedies. Rite Aid’s Brooks and Eckert units are also among the plaintiffs. Pfizer and Teva had no immediate comment. They have rejected the claims in the December lawsuit, which was filed in the same court by Walgreen Co, Kroger Co, Safeway Inc, Supervalu Inc and HEB Grocery Co. Effexor XR is used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Its chemical name is venlafaxine hydrochloride. Pfizer’s global sales of Effexor XR totaled $129 million from January to March. Sales fell 37 percent from a year earlier and have been declining because of generic competition. Pfizer is based in New York; Wyeth has operations in Madison, New Jersey; and Israel-based Teva has U.S. operations in North Wales, Pennsylvania. CVS is based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and Rite Aid in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. The case is Rite Aid Corp et al. v. Wyeth Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 12-03523.

85,CVS,CVS profit up during rivals' rift; 2012 view raised,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) posted a higher quarterly profit and raised its forecast for the year as it works to retain customers who switched to its drugstores during an impasse between main drugstore rival Walgreen and pharmacy benefits manager competitor Express Scripts. CVS shares closed down 1.7 percent at $44.12 on Tuesday. The question for investors is how much of a lift CVS will continue to see now that Walgreen Co WAG.N and Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O) have patched up their relationship. At the same time, CVS is seeing greater pressure from the introduction of generic versions of popular drugs such as Lipitor, which cuts into revenue though it does boost profits. A disagreement over contract terms led Walgreen to stop filling prescriptions for Express Scripts patients at the beginning of 2012. After resolving their dispute in July, Walgreen will start working with Express Scripts again, as of September 15. On Tuesday, Express Scripts raised its full-year earnings forecast after a strong second quarter and on sooner-than-expected benefits from the acquisition of Medco Health Solutions. CVS, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain behind Walgreen, was one of the biggest beneficiaries during the rift, gaining customers who previously filled prescriptions at Walgreen. CVS said in the fourth quarter it expected to retain at least 50 percent of the prescription business gained during the impasse. “We’ve had the better part of nine months to introduce those new customers to the CVS pharmacy brand,” Chief Executive Larry Merlo told Reuters. CVS, which has more than 7,380 drugstores, is increasing its marketing push to work on keeping those customers. That spending is already factored into the company’s outlook, Merlo said. “We think CVS is going to be able to keep more of their customers than even the company has guided to,” said Judson Clark, a health care analyst for Edward Jones, who has “buy” ratings on CVS and Express Scripts and a “hold” on Walgreen. “Traditionally, pharmacy customers are very sticky. They’re very hard to lose but once you have lost them they are very hard to get back.” Pharmacy benefits managers such as Express Scripts and CVS Caremark administer on behalf of employers and health plans and run mail-order pharmacies. CVS can add the ability to pick up prescriptions at its namesake drugstores. CVS has retained a smaller percentage of its pharmacy benefits clients to date than it had a year earlier. CVS said it retained 96.3 percent of clients to date. In August 2011, it had retained 98 percent of clients. Second-quarter profit rose to $966 million, or 75 cents per share, from $816 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 81 cents per share, topping the company’s forecast of 78 cents to 80 cents and analysts’ average target of 80 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 16.3 percent to $30.71 billion, missing analysts’ average expectation of $30.96 billion. CVS now expects full-year earnings of $3.32 to $3.38 per share, excluding items, up from a May forecast of $3.23 to $3.33. The analysts’ average estimate is $3.33. Revenue rose 28.2 percent to $18.4 billion in pharmacy services and was up 6.9 percent to $15.8 billion in the retail unit.

88,CVS,CVS Caremark profit up; full-year view raised,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) posted a higher quarterly profit and raised its forecast for the year on Tuesday as it continued to see a lift in sales, due in part to an impasse between its main drugstore rival, Walgreen Co WAG.N, and its pharmacy benefits manager competitor, Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O).

91,CVS,Walgreen is finally ready to launch a loyalty card,"(Reuters) - Walgreen Co WAG.N will join the loyalty card game next month as it tries to win back millions of pharmacy patrons, a daunting task as rivals CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) already have well-established programs. For years Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, said it was just fine without a loyalty card that rewards holders for spending more. Now, after testing formats for a year and a half, and after losing shoppers who had to fill Express Scripts prescriptions elsewhere for most of 2012, the chain is embarking on one of the biggest marketing pushes in its 111-year history. Heading the introduction of the Balance Rewards card is Graham Atkinson, who led United Airlines’ (UAL.N) Mileage Plus program before he joined Walgreen as chief customer experience officer in January 2011. Walgreen’s new program blends aspects of airlines’ frequent flyer plans and loyalty cards from drugstore rivals and Duane Reade, which the company acquired in 2010. “This program is all about collecting points, saving up for a treat,” said Atkinson. “If we get a more engaged customer, and ultimately a more loyal customer, they will give us a larger share of their shopping wallet.” Walgreen will bring out its loyalty card on September 16, although patrons can sign up starting early next month with a chance to win 10 million points. “Today, it’s kind of table stakes in most retail to have some program for rewarding, incenting, personalizing communications to your shoppers,” said Ben Sprecher, co-founder of Incentive Targeting, a software company that helps retailers and brands understand and change shopper behavior. “It absolutely needs to be done, and better late than never.” Walgreen shoppers will earn points for buying certain items, filling prescriptions, getting shots and even participating in a walking program. Those points are worth more as users accrue them. For example 5,000 points nets a shopper a $5 reward. But it only takes 40,000 points to get $50 to use in the store or online. “We’re looking for tens of millions of sign-ups before the end of the year, and we do believe this can be as big, if not bigger, than the CVS program,” said Atkinson. But CVS and Rite Aid, which continue to add features to their programs, say they think they have a head start. “You can’t make a 12-year scotch in 12 months,” said CVS Chief Marketing Officer Rob Price. “We feel a little bit that way about loyalty. A genuine relationship takes time to develop.” CVS’s ExtraCare card began with a pilot program in 1997 and went national in 2001. More than 70 million households and more than 100 million individuals use it at least once every six months. Rite Aid said that as of early June, it had 25 million wellness+ members who had used their cards at least twice in the past six months. Any retail loyalty program is often measured against the one at Kroger Co (KR.N). The grocer partnered with British loyalty firm dunnhumby in 2003 to better personalize discounts after starting its own program in the mid-1990s. Nearly 60 million households have signed up for Kroger’s card, and redemption rates for its personalized offers can be as high as 70 percent, well above the average rate of 5 percent or less for coupons. CVS, the leader in drugstore loyalty, said its quarterly ExtraBucks rewards had a redemption rate of about 55 percent. Drugstores already have an edge in keeping customers loyal since many return to a store to pick up regular prescriptions. But Walgreen lost many patrons this year during its now-resolved rift with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O). Walgreen can start filling Express Scripts prescriptions again on September 15, the day before Balance Rewards begins. CVS, meanwhile, is trying to strengthen the connection between pharmacy sales and loyalty. It is conducting a five-market pilot program in which users get $5 in ExtraBucks for every five prescriptions filled, up from $1 for every two prescriptions. CVS said it was thinking about whether to enhance pharmacy-related ExtraCare rewards nationally in 2013. While Walgreen has not divulged costs, introducing its plan included a “significant technological investment,” Atkinson said. Implementing a loyalty card program at a large retailer can cost millions of dollars, Sprecher said. The payoff can be even greater, as chains’ most loyal patrons become their most profitable ones. In the first quarter, Rite Aid’s wellness+ users accounted for 75 percent of general merchandise sales, up from 67 percent a year earlier, and 69 percent of prescriptions filled, up from 62 percent. Shoppers who reach Rite Aid’s “silver” and “gold” levels get discounts across most of the store, which then spur them to visit the chain more often. “We see pretty dramatically increased frequency and spending from those customers,” said Rite Aid Chief Operating Officer Ken Martindale. “They are by far our most profitable customers.” ",8242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walgreen-loyalty/walgreen-is-finally-ready-to-launch-a-loyalty-card-idUSBRE87N0L820120824

Shoppers who reach Rite Aid’s “silver” and “gold” levels get discounts across most of the store, which then spur them to visit the chain more often. “We see pretty dramatically increased frequency and spending from those customers,” said Rite Aid Chief Operating Officer Ken Martindale. “They are by far our most profitable customers.”",8242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/walgreen-loyalty/walgreen-is-finally-ready-to-launch-a-loyalty-card-idUSL2E8JLD4720120824
93,CVS,CVS unaware of any government prescription refill probe,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp said on Friday it has not been contacted by the U.S. government regarding alleged claims the drugstore chain refilled prescriptions and sought reimbursement for them without the approval of patients. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, which quotes an unnamed official with knowledge of the matter, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is investigating such allegations as part of efforts to stem fraud against the government's Medicare health plan for the elderly. link.reuters.com/wyp33t A spokesman for the OIG said he could not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation. CVS, which runs both a major U.S. pharmacy chain and a large pharmacy benefits management business, said its programs require that a patient’s consent be obtained before a prescription is filled. “At this time, we have not been contacted by OIG in regard to an investigation,” said CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis. “The LA Times reported this based on an unnamed source.” CVS reached a $17.5 million settlement last year involving allegations that it inflated prescription claims to the government’s Medicaid program for the poor in 10 states. Drugstore customers often sign up for programs that allow a pharmacy to refill prescriptions on a regular basis or have the company call to ask if a refill is wanted. “In our opinion, it is a far stretch to assume that CVS would knowingly ‘cheat’ third-party payers by routinely accepting reimbursement for medications never picked up by customers,” said SunTrust analyst David Magee. He did note that some customers are notified by CVS that refills were ready even before such a request was made. “Presumably, customers have given prior approval of this practice ... which was mostly done in the spirit of customer service and drug adherence goals,” Magee said. “While the automatic refill practice appears to be more than regional, any wrongdoing was likely unintentional and we would be surprised if this issue amounts to much.” CVS shares fell 1.1 percent to close $47.08 in trading on Friday, a steeper decline than the broader U.S. stock market. CVS Caremark also agreed to pay $5 million in January to settle charges it inaccurately priced some drugs for the elderly and the disabled, ending a wide-ranging, multi-year investigation into its business practices.

99,CVS,"CVS posts higher profit, raises 2012 forecast","(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) posted a higher quarterly profit and raised its expectations for the year on Tuesday as it filled more prescriptions with generic medicines and its drugstores retained former Walgreen patrons. The company has been working on keeping customers who switched to its stores during an impasse between larger drugstore rival Walgreen Co WAG.N and pharmacy benefits manager competitor Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O). Walgreen did not fill Express Scripts prescriptions from the beginning of the year until mid-September. This gave CVS and other drugstores the opportunity to woo Walgreen customers who had to go elsewhere. CVS expects to retain at least 60 percent of the prescriptions it gained through the fourth quarter, up from its prior goal of keeping at least 50 percent, Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said in an interview. “We continue to view CVS’s outlook for retention as conservative, as we estimate Walgreens has recaptured roughly 25 percent of prescriptions lost during the impasse thus far through October,” said William Blair analyst Mark Miller. Shares of CVS, which operates the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain, gained 2 percent in early trading but reversed course, slipping 29 cents to $46.34, later in the session. The results came a day after Express Scripts said analysts’ forecasts for its 2013 results were too aggressive, casting doubt on how well it is integrating its $29 billion purchase of Medco Health Solutions Inc. [ID:nL1E8M5DA5] Express Scripts shares plunged more than 16 percent on Tuesday morning. CVS said it had earned $1.01 billion, or 79 cents per share in the third quarter, up from $868 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding intangible asset amortization related to acquisitions, the profit was 85 cents per share. That topped analysts’ expectations of 84 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and was ahead of the company’s forecast of 81 cents to 83 cents. CVS has increased its marketing to hold onto the new customers it gained during the earlier part of 2012, and it will spend more during the fourth quarter to work on retaining them. The increased marketing spending is already included in the company’s outlook, Merlo said. CVS expects to earn $1.08 to $1.11 per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, which includes a hit of about a penny per share from Hurricane Sandy. More than 1,100 CVS stores were closed at the height of the storm last week and 20 remain closed. Some 15 stores suffered extensive damage and CVS said it does not know when those will reopen. CVS is raising its fourth-quarter expectations for its pharmacies because it has been keeping more Express Scripts prescriptions, Merlo said. He also cited a rise in flu-related prescriptions and shots, more visits by patients to doctors over the last six months and an increase in Medicare Part D prescriptions. At the same time, CVS’s drugstores and pharmacy benefits units are filling more prescriptions with generic drugs, which are more profitable than brand-name versions. Revenue rose 13.3 percent to $30.23 billion, beating the analysts’ average forecast of $30.09 billion. Revenue in the pharmacy services business jumped 22.2 percent to $18.1 billion, helped by the addition of new clients, higher drug costs and the growth of its Medicare Part D program for older people. Revenue at the CVS drugstore chain rose 5.5 percent to $15.5 billion. Sales at stores open a least a year rose 4.3 percent, topping the company’s August forecast of a 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent increase.

105,CVS,CVS Caremark sees Obamacare as expansion opportunity,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) is looking at changes in U.S. healthcare as an opportunity to serve more customers, whether they are picking up prescriptions, getting them through the mail or stopping by an in-house MinuteClinic for a checkup. The company, formed when drugstore chain CVS bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark in 2007 in a $27 billion all-stock deal, gave a 2013 forecast on Thursday that exceeded Wall Street estimates as it tries to use its combined businesses to its advantage. It also said that this year’s results are trending toward the high end of its expectations. The merger, scorned by some industry watchers years ago, now appears to be putting more pressure on rivals that operate in a limited part of the sector, as CVS is gaining ground with its model of combined retail, drug benefits management and clinic. “CVS’ integrated model messaging has been gaining momentum over the past few years, while other players will need to convince the market that their new business strategies will ultimately prove superior,” said ISI Group analyst Ross Muken. Muken raised his price target on CVS shares to $57, from $53.50, after the company’s forecast. Shares of CVS rose as much as 4.7 percent to an all-time high on Thursday. Shares of its larger drugstore rival, Walgreen Co WAG.N, and its larger competitor in the pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), each fell less than 1 percent. The coming year stands to be a busy one for the healthcare sector as the United States prepares for 30 million people to join the ranks of insured patients under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” starting in 2014. The large population of aging baby boomers and rising demand for specialty drugs could be opportunities for companies such as CVS. The industry is already seeing rapid growth in the number of people signing up for Medicare Part D prescription plans, which are part of the Medicare healthcare plan for older people. “You’ve got 10,000 baby boomers becoming eligible for Medicare every day now,” CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said. “The change is upon us, and it will evolve over the next several years.” At the same time, the number of Americans with chronic diseases keeps rising, and those patients spend five times more than others on healthcare as they often need to visit doctors more frequently and take medications, Merlo said. If complications arise, additional treatment can be costly. About half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases. Among those who are newly diagnosed with a chronic disease, almost half fail to stick with their drug regimen in the first year, Merlo said. Merlo said that CVS can play a bigger role in getting patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes to keep taking their drugs, which can save billions of dollars. “The lack of medication adherence is costing our healthcare system some $300 billion a year in unnecessary costs,” he said. For 2013, CVS expects to earn $3.84 to $3.98 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average were expecting $3.82, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s forecast assumes the repurchase of $4 billion of its shares during 2013. CVS has bought back $3.5 billion to $4 billion worth of its stock annually since 2010. CVS also plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 38 percent, bringing the payout to 22.5 cents per share. First-quarter revenue should fall 2.5 percent to 4 percent due to the rise in usage of generic drugs, which sell at lower prices than branded drugs but are more profitable, it said. CVS forecast first-quarter earnings of 77 cents to 80 cents per share before items, while analysts expected 74 cents. Meanwhile, its main competitors have work to do. Walgreen Co WAG.N is trying to lure patients back to its stores after reaching a new contract with Express Scripts. CVS still expects to retain at least 60 percent of the Walgreen patrons that switched to its chain during an 8-1/2 month impasse when Walgreen and Express Scripts stopped working together. That is expected to boost CVS’ fourth-quarter earnings by at least 12.5 cents per share. In November, Express Scripts said its business would come under pressure because of the weak economy, leaving analysts to question that company’s strategy in the wake of its acquisition of another PBM, Medco Health Solutions. Merlo declined to comment on whether CVS planned any acquisitions, adding that it was always reviewing “bolt-on” purchases to support its retail or PBM units. More patients have been coming to CVS’s 650 MinuteClinic healthcare clinics, and the company plans to have more than 1,500 of the clinics by 2017. The day after Thanksgiving was their busiest day to date, with 19,000 visits on November 23. CVS expects more than 3 million visits to MinuteClinic in 2012.

112,CVS,CVS Caremark sees Obamacare as expansion opportunity,"Dec 13 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp is looking at changes in U.S. healthcare as an opportunity to serve more customers, whether they are picking up prescriptions, getting them through the mail, or stopping by an in-house MinuteClinic for a checkup. The company, formed when drugstore chain CVS bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark in 2007 in a $27 billion all-stock deal, is set to give details on its strategy as it meets with analysts and investors in New York on Thursday. It also plans to discuss its 2013 financial forecasts. The coming year stands to be a busy one for the healthcare sector as the United States prepares for 30 million people to join the ranks of insured patients under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, starting in 2014. At the same time, the large population of aging baby boomers and rising demand for specialty drugs stand to be opportunities for companies such as CVS. The industry is already seeing rapid growth in the number of people signing up for Medicare Part D prescription plans. “You’ve got 10,000 baby boomers becoming eligible for Medicare every day now,” CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said, referring to the health insurance plan for seniors. “The change is upon us and it will evolve over the next several years.” Merlo asserts that CVS can play a bigger role in getting patients with chronic conditions to stick to their drug regimens, which can save billions of dollars. About half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases and of those who are newly diagnosed with a chronic disease, such as diabetes, almost 50 percent failed to stick with their drug regimen in the first year, Merlo said. “The lack of medication adherence is costing our healthcare system some $300 billion a year in unnecessary costs,” he said. While CVS prepares for next year, its main competitors have come under pressure. Drugstore leader Walgreen Co is trying to lure patients back to its stores after reaching a new contract with Express Scripts Holding Co, CVS Caremark’s largest competitor in the pharmacy benefits manager business (PBM). In November, Express Scripts said that its business would come under pressure in the weak economy, leaving analysts to question that company’s strategy in the wake of its acquisition of another PBM, Medco Health Solutions. Merlo declined to comment on whether CVS’s strategy would include any acquisitions, though “bolt-on” acquisitions to support its retail or PBM units are always being reviewed. CVS also runs roughly 650 MinuteClinic health care clinics, which have seen more patients come in. The day after Thanksgiving was the clinics’ busiest day to date, with 19,000 visits on Nov. 23. CVS expects more than 3 million visits to MinuteClinic in 2012. Eight of the more than 7,400 CVS stores remain closed after being significantly damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Six should reopen by the end of 2012 and the rest may reopen by the end of the first quarter of 2013, Merlo said. CVS already said that costs associated with the massive storm would reduce its fourth-quarter earnings by as much as 1 cent per share. Its third-quarter profit came in a penny ahead of analysts’ expectations, with growth in both the pharmacy benefits management business and the drugstore chain.",12132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvscaremark-meeting/cvs-caremark-sees-obamacare-as-expansion-opportunity-idUSL1E8NCE0620121213

115,CVS,CVS stops putting Tylenol in some stores to end supply holes,"Jan 14 (Reuters) - If you cannot find Tylenol pain reliever at your local CVS store this flu season, it might be because that store is no longer stocking it. CVS this month changed how it stocks Tylenol at its stores in the wake of manufacturing problems at the drug’s maker, Johnson & Johnson, that have disrupted supplies for more than three years. Under the new plan, CVS will try to have Tylenol in stores in each market, but will not have it in every store, spokesman Michael DeAngelis said. The company is getting enough Tylenol to stock about half of its 7,400 U.S. stores, and it changed the stocking of Tylenol to eliminate empty spots on shelves where the medication would have been. The move by the drugstore unit of CVS Caremark Corp, the second largest such unit in the United States, could be a sign of the difficulty J&J; faces as it tries to fix quality-control problems and rebuild its Tylenol business. A spokesman for J&J;’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit, which makes Tylenol, did not return Reuters’ calls seeking comment. Since 2009, faulty manufacturing has prompted J&J;’s McNeil unit to recall millions of bottles and packages of Tylenol, Benadryl, Motrin and other over-the-counter medicines. At the same time, CVS and other retailers have been putting more emphasis on their private-label products, which cost less than brand-name products but can be more profitable for retailers. The length of time it has taken for J&J; to upgrade its factories and ramp up manufacturing of Tylenol has given consumers plenty of time to try the store brand and decide whether they want to pay more for Tylenol, Stephanie Prymas, Consumer health analyst at market data researcher Euromonitor International, said. “That’s a pretty long time for private-label to gain some credibility,” Prymas said. In 2009, before the recalls started, Tylenol had 56 percent of the U.S. market share for acetaminophen, the chemical name of Tylenol, according to Euromonitor. In 2012, that was down to 24 percent. At the same time, private-label market share has grown from 32 percent to 62 percent. Prymas said that private-label products are more accepted now than 20 years ago, when deaths linked to cyanide-tainted capsules caused Tylenol to be pulled from store shelves. Private-label offerings are now more commonplace and trusted, she said. “We’re kind of expecting private label to hold on more tenaciously to what they have captured,” Prymas said. A visit to a CVS store on Chicago’s North Side on Sunday showed no obvious signs that Tylenol extra strength pain reliever for adults had ever been on the shelves or any spaces for the medication had to be restocked. Instead, the shelves were well-stocked with the CVS brand. DeAngelis declined to say whether the supply of Tylenol had changed in recent weeks to prompt the new distribution plan. A spokesman for Walgreen Co, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, said that company has seen no change in its supply of Tylenol products.",1142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvs-tylenol/cvs-stops-putting-tylenol-in-some-stores-to-end-supply-holes-idUSL2N0AJENP20130114

117,CVS,"UPDATE 2-CVS Caremark profit up, buys Brazil's Onofre chain","* CVS buys Brazil’s Drogaria Onofre; terms not disclosed * Profit of $1.14/share excluding items vs Street view $1.10 * 2013 forecast raised due to late 2012 refinancing * Shares up 0.3 percent after modest decline in early trading By Jessica Wohl Feb 6 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp posted a bigger-than-anticipated rise in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, helped by growth at both its pharmacy services business and its CVS drugstore chain, and made its first international push by buying a Brazilian retailer. CVS Caremark said it bought Drogaria Onofre, Brazil’s eighth-largest drugstore chain by sales, last week. The move comes months after larger U.S. drugstore rival Walgreen Co  stepped out of the United States for the first time when it bought a 45 percent stake in Europe’s Alliance Boots , with the option to purchase the rest of it in about three years. Drogaria Onofre, with 44 stores in Brazil, is a small international start for CVS, which has more than 7,400 U.S. drugstores. “It’s a toe in the water; it’s not financially material to our numbers this year,” CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo told Reuters. CVS did not disclose terms of the Drogaria Onofre deal. Walgreen paid Alliance Boots $7.02 billion in cash and stock for its stake when that deal closed in August. CVS also raised its 2013 profit forecast by 2 cents per share due to a debt tender and refinancing executed at the end of 2012. The company’s shares were up 0.3 percent at $51.85 after slipping to $51.40 in early trading. CVS Caremark was formed when drugstore chain CVS bought the Caremark pharmacy benefits management business in 2007 in a $27 billion stock deal. The company faced scorn from some industry watchers years ago for its combined model of running drugstores and a PBM. Lately, though, CVS has been putting more pressure on rivals that operate in a limited part of the sector, such as Express Scripts Holding Co and Walgreen. CVS said it expects to continue to retain at least 60 percent of the prescriptions it gained during a now-resolved impasse between Walgreen and Express Scripts. CVS earned $1.13 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, up from $1.06 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a loss from early extinguishment of debt, the profit of $1.14 per share topped the analysts’ average forecast of $1.10, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 3 cents per share of the profit stemmed from a lower effective tax rate and from having fewer shares outstanding than originally anticipated, CVS said. Revenue rose 10.9 percent to $31.39 billion, topping the analysts’ average estimate of $31.13 billion. The quarter was “solid,” but the stock is fairly valued at 13 times next year’s earnings due to expectations for moderately slower trends in 2013 due to Walgreen’s efforts to win back market share and a potentially more competitive PBM selling season, said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst David Magee. Revenue in the PBM unit, which administers drug benefits for employers and health plans and runs a large mail order pharmacy, rose 17.4 percent to $18.64 billion. Revenue in the retail division rose 5.1 percent to $16.28 billion, with sales at drugstores open at least a year up 4 percent. The retail business had a bit of a lift in the fourth quarter, and more in the first quarter, from a flu season that has been significantly stronger than a year earlier, bringing people into stores for everything from flu shots to medicine. Still, while the first quarter is tracking to the high end of the company’s December forecast, it would be premature to adjust the outlook based on the flu season at this point, Merlo said. The company still expects to earn 77 cents to 80 cents per share before items in the first quarter, it said. Analysts are looking for a profit of 79 cents per share. CVS said it expects earnings per share of $3.86 to $4.00 this year before special items, up from the December forecast of $3.84 to $3.98. The analysts’ current estimate is $3.94.",2062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvscaremark-results/update-2-cvs-caremark-profit-up-buys-brazils-onofre-chain-idUSL1N0B620J20130206

The 44-store chain will continue to be managed locally, and the acquisition should not be financially material to CVS in 2013, Merlo told Reuters. “We view Brazil as an attractive market given that healthcare and pharmacy are expected to grow double digits for the next decade,” said Merlo. “It’s still a highly-fragmented market, so we see nice opportunity to grow the business over time.” Sao Paulo-based Onofre is Brazil’s 8th biggest pharmacy group by sales, and the 18th largest by number of stores, according to local industry group Abrafarma.

124,CVS,CVS Caremark gets contract to serve 1.1 million CareFirst members,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp is set to provide pharmacy benefit and other services for 1.1 million CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield members starting next year, a deal that could represent about $1 billion in annual spending on medications and boost CVS’ profit by a penny per share, an industry analyst said. The three-year contract is the latest win for CVS Caremark, which has been gaining ground with its combined approach of running retail drugstores and a pharmacy benefits management business. This year stands to be a busy one for the healthcare sector as the United States prepares for 30 million people to join the ranks of insured patients under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” starting in 2014. CareFirst announced the contract, which begins on January 1, 2014, in a statement issued on Monday. It said the contract covers its commercial and Medicare Part D members. The deal could add about 1 penny per share to CVS Caremark’s earnings in 2014, JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill said on Tuesday. CareFirst said that it expects to see substantial savings in prescription drug costs, and would reflect those savings in its subscribers’ premiums. “As federal health reform begins to fully take effect, we are heading into a challenging environment in which meeting our members pharmacy needs - and doing so cost efficiently - is more important than ever,” CareFirst President and Chief Executive Chet Burrell said.

German monthly Manager Magazin cited industry sources as saying that CVS was interested in buying Haniel’s 50.01 percent stake in the group and had held extensive talks with Celesio Chief Executive Markus Pinger before the latter approached Haniel CEO Stephan Gemkow on June 12. Haniel denied it was in talks with CVS over a sale and added that Celesio remained a core investment for the group, while CVS declined to comment on what it called market rumors. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that Pinger had met with Gemkow on June 12, but not to discuss a sale to CVS but rather to inform the Haniel CEO of talks between Celesio and CVS over a possible joint purchasing cooperation. According to manager magazine, CVS is prepared to pay Haniel a 30 percent premium to the current share price around 16 euros, amounting to as much as 2 billion euros. Were CVS to acquire the stake, it would be required under German securities laws to launch a public tender bid for the remaining 49.99 percent of the shares held by minority investors. The magazine said that CVS was under pressure to expand, after larger U.S. drugstore chain Walgreens bought a stake in Alliance Boots.

134,CVS,Medicare patients do better taking drugs on time - study,"June 27 (Reuters) - Americans on Medicare prescription drug plans do a better job of taking their medicines on time compared to other insured patients, and if more people followed their lead, it could save billions of dollars in healthcare costs, a report by CVS Caremark Corp concluded. CVS, the drugstore chain and one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, gathered data on its customers who get drugs via insurance plans, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, employer-sponsored programs and the government’s Medicare Part D prescription plan for people 65 and older. The study focused on four chronic conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and depression. If the same patients consistently took their medications, filling and receiving prescriptions at least 80 percent of the time, the savings could total around $7 billion a year, CVS found. According to the report, half of patients who take medicines for a wider range of chronic diseases stop taking them within a year, raising healthcare costs by up to $290 billion. With millions of Americans expected to sign up for health insurance next year under the Affordable Care Act, increased coverage could lead more patients to fill prescriptions and take their medications consistently. CVS studied the amount of drugs that patients had on hand versus the amount they would need to adhere to their medication plans over a specific period of time. Among its patients, 84 percent of those using Medicare Part D programs had the proper level of medication on hand, compared with 81.3 percent of those on employer plans and 76.4 percent of those on insurer-managed health plans. Medicare patients’ age and insurance benefits contributed to their higher adherence rates, said Dr. Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. Choudhry did not participate in the report, released on Thursday, but does research with CVS on medication adherence.

135,CVS,CVS Caremark set to pay $20 million to resolve SEC investigation,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp said on Friday that it plans to pay a $20 million civil penalty to resolve a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into 2009 comments and staff securities transactions and its accounting for an acquisition. The drugstore and pharmacy benefits management company said the settlement will be entered on a “no admit or deny” basis, resolving a number of alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including some anti-fraud provisions. CVS received a subpoena from the SEC in February 2011, followed by additional subpoenas and other requests for information related to issues such as public disclosures the company made in 2009, securities transactions by some company officers and employees during that year, and the purchase accounting for its 2008 acquisition of Longs Drug Stores Corp. The settlement, reached in principle with staff of the SEC’s Boston regional office, is subject to the completion of final documentation and approval by the SEC and federal court, CVS said. The company said it has fully reserved funds for the settlement and will not need to restate earnings for any period.

137,CVS,"CVS Medicare issues taking longer than planned, profit up","(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) expects to lose about 10 percent of patients enrolled in one of its Medicare prescription drug plans because of a government marketing ban but does not expect the decrease to have a significant impact on its long-term results. In January, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said CVS could not market to or enroll new members in its SilverScript drug plan for seniors because of service issues. But CVS still sees “significant opportunity” to grow its Medicare prescription business over time, Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on Tuesday on a conference call. “The impact will be relatively muted,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark, who still rates CVS shares a “buy.” CVS posted second-quarter profits that rose slightly more than Wall Street expected, as growth at its pharmacy benefits management unit outpaced its drugstores. The company narrowed its 2013 earnings per share forecast, bringing the bottom of the range up by a penny and the top down by 4 cents, citing share repurchases largely coming in the second half of the year and its results so far. Its shares fell 2.4 percent to $60.15. The CMS ban on certain Medicare Part D plan activity arose in January after CVS converted to a new enrollment system, which led to service issues such as an increase in calls and issues processing claims that included, in some instances, not being able to have patients’ claims processed at the pharmacy. CVS’ goal had been to fix those issues in time to participate in the 2014 enrollment period, which begins on October 15. But it no longer expects it will be able to do so. The company said it is taking longer than expected to develop a remedy for the issues, saying it found additional complexity, though it would not say exactly what it is doing to resolve the problems. The company now expects to complete the process sometime near the end of the year. After that, CMS must do a review before it could lift its sanction. CVS estimated that it could lose roughly 350,000 Part D Plan members, leaving it with about 3.1 million enrollees in the SilverScript plan by the end of January 2014. The company’s SilverScript Part D plan has about 3.4 million enrollees out of a total of about 6.8 million on its Medicare Part D plans. The CMS sanction does not affect CVS’ Medicare Part D business through health plans. CVS is still allowed to enroll newly eligible retirees in certain existing plans. CVS earned $1.12 billion, or 91 cents per share, in the quarter, up from $966 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to 97 cents from 81 cents. That topped analysts’ average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. New generic drugs helped profits but weighed on sales. Generic drugs sell for less than branded ones but are more profitable. Operating profit jumped 32 percent in the pharmacy benefits management business, near the high end of the company’s forecast for 26.5 percent to 32.5 percent growth. Operating profit rose 9 percent in the retail business, meeting the high end of the company’s forecast of 7.25 percent to 9 percent. Revenue was up 1.7 percent to $31.25 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 0.4 percent, in line with analysts’ expectations. CVS expects adjusted earnings of $3.90 to $3.96 per share this year, with a profit of $1 to $1.03 in the current third quarter. Analysts look for full-year profit of $3.98, and 97 cents per share this quarter. CVS suspended share repurchases during part of the quarter while it negotiated with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over an agreement in principle. On Friday, CVS said it plans to pay a $20 million civil penalty to resolve an SEC investigation of 2009 comments and staff securities transactions and accounting for an acquisition. The company said it has repurchased $748 million of its shares so far and still plans to buy back $4 billion in stock this year.

138,CVS,CVS cuts access to opioid pain-killers for suspect doctors,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp said on Wednesday that it has taken the unusual step of cutting off access to powerful pain-killers for more than 36 doctors and other healthcare providers found to prescribe the drugs at an alarmingly high rate. The drugstore chain, which was drawn into a government crackdown on prescription painkiller abuse last year, began revoking the dispensing privileges of certain providers in late 2012, said CVS Chief Medical Officer Troyen Brennan. “This isn’t a definitive solution to the problem,” Brennan told Reuters. “We wanted to share what it was that we did and have other people in healthcare, including other pharmacies, look at what we did and discuss what some more comprehensive solutions might be.” CVS disclosed the suspensions in an article published on Wednesday on the website of the New England Journal of Medicine. Abuse of opioid prescription pain-killers like Oxycontin ranks as the No. 2 cause of accidental death in the United States, CVS said. In 2009, painkiller use was cited in more than 15,500 overdose deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has targeted large pharmacy chains like CVS and rival Walgreen Co, as well as distributors such as Cardinal Health, to stem the flow of prescription drugs where abuse is suspected. The DEA revoked the controlled substance licenses of two CVS drugstores in Florida last September. In June, Walgreen reached a record $80 million settlement with the DEA to resolve allegations that its negligence in record-keeping and dispensing allowed the highly addictive drugs to reach abusers and be sold illegally. Brennan said that CVS has not yet discussed its findings about suspect providers with the DEA or others. CVS said the suspensions followed an analysis of prescriptions brought to its drugstores from March 2010 through January 2012 for hydrocodone, oxycodone, alprazolam, methadone and carisoprodol. CVS said it first identified several dozen healthcare providers — from a database of nearly 1 million — with extreme patterns of prescribing high-risk drugs. CVS checked their prescription rates versus other providers in the same specialty and geographic region, the ages of the patients and the number of patients paying with cash for the drugs. For instance, one “outlier prescriber” in the field of preventive medicine was prescribing on average more than 44,000 doses of high-risk drugs, compared with 662 for similar providers. CVS asked 42 providers for more details about their prescribing habits. Six of those 42 gave what CVS said were legitimate reasons for the high volume of prescriptions, such as a medical director at a hospice prescribing pain-killers. The company said its stores and its mail-order pharmacy will no longer dispense controlled substances for 36 providers who it said could not justify their prescribing habits. Brennan said that an additional “handful” have been suspended as the company continues its analysis.

139,CVS,"CVS Caremark raises outlook, sees exchanges helping in 2014","(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp raised its profit forecast for the year on Tuesday, as sales grew at its drugstore chain and it processed more prescriptions from new clients. The company also said it expects private health insurance exchanges to help business next year. Shares were up 2.4 percent at $63.44 in late-morning trade. CVS, which operates the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain and a major pharmacy benefits management business, reported total revenue rose 5.8 percent to $31.97 billion in the third quarter. Wall Street analysts expected $31.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Looking ahead to 2014, CVS said its participation in public and private health insurance exchanges should lift revenue in 2014. The company will provide a more detailed forecast for 2014 and beyond at its analyst day on December 18. Still, CVS Caremark Chief Executive Larry Merlo told investors on a conference call that the company expects large employers to take a “wait-and-see” approach to private health insurance exchanges, especially for active employees, based on his conversations with clients and private exchange operators. Merlo also said large employers may choose to move retirees to the exchanges over time. Private exchanges mimic the coverage mandated under the U.S. Affordable Care Act and allow a company’s employees to choose a plan from multiple insurers, a sign of the shifting landscape for corporate healthcare because of rising costs. CVS, whose Caremark PBM unit competes with Express Scripts Holding Co, said it has completed 75 percent of renewals for the 2014 selling season and has won $1.8 billion in new contracts, net of attrition in its business processing prescriptions for beneficiaries of Medicare Part D. The federal program subsidizes the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. In August, CVS said it expected to lose about 10 percent of patients enrolled in one of its Medicare prescription drug plans because of a marketing ban imposed earlier in the year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The CMS ban on some Medicare Part D plan activity arose in January after CVS converted to a new enrollment system, which led to service problems, such as an increase in calls and problems in processing claims. In some instances, patient claims could not be processed at pharmacies. Merlo reiterated his belief that CVS will have the problems fixed by the end of 2013. Revenue in pharmacy services rose 7.8 percent in the quarter, primarily because it processed more claims with new clients. In CVS’ retail business, sales at stores open at least year were up 3.6 percent, as it filled more prescriptions. But CVS reported a small decline in comparable sales of general merchandise due to “softer traffic.” “We have seen the promotional environment intensify,” Merlo told analysts on the call. CVS rival Walgreen Co has reported that sales rose in October but traffic fell 0.6 percent. CVS, which also competes with Rite Aid Corp, earned $1.25 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the quarter, up from $1 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items such as a gain from a legal settlement, adjusted profit came to $1.05 per share, 3 cents better than Wall Street expected.

145,CVS,UPDATE 2-CVS to buy specialty drug infusion business for $2.1 bln,"Nov 27 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp will buy drug infusion services provider Coram LLC for $2.1 billion, allowing the company to bolster its pharmacy benefits management business by offering cost-effective delivery of specialty drugs. Most pharma companies are increasingly focused on developing niche drugs for complex disorders as several mass market drugs lose patent protection. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS, which administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans, can offer greater value to clients by diversifying their offerings. CVS, which operates the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain and the second-largest PBM business, said the acquisition would expand its services to include infusion therapy, which involves administering medication through a needle or catheter to patients too severe to be treated orally. “The addition of Coram further increases the company’s attractiveness to PBM customers seeking to control rising specialty (prescription) costs,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. Coram, owned by Blackstone Group -controlled Apria Healthcare Group Inc, provides infusion services primarily at patients’ homes at a far lesser cost than if these were to be done at hospitals or physicians’ offices, CVS said. Such services will become increasingly important as providers look to manage the overall cost of care delivery, J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note. CVS, whose Caremark PBM unit competes with Express Scripts Holding Co, said Coram would add $1.4 billion to revenues in the first year after the deal closes and 3 to 5 cents per share to CVS’s adjusted earnings per share in 2015. CVS expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2014. Barclays served as CVS’s financial adviser on the deal, while Sullivan and Cromwell LLP and Dechert LLP served as legal advisers. Apria was advised by Goldman, Sachs & Co and Blackstone Advisory Partners, while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP served as the legal adviser.

Healthcare stocks were among the most active after company news while utilities was the worst performer of the 10 industry groups on the S&P; 500. The S&P; 500 held above key technical indicators including its 14-day moving average, and volume remained below average even for a thinly-traded month. “It’s a bit of consolidation after a run-up to new highs. There’s no reason to think this is anything different than that,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York.

But stronger economic data of late, including a drop in the unemployment rate to a five-year low, helped ease investors’ angst over a pullback in  the Fed’s stimulus. “Monetary policy responds to changes in the economy and as long as the economy is better, tapering shouldn’t be too difficult to endure,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey.

149,CVS,"CVS, Cardinal Health form U.S. generic drug venture","(Reuters) - Pharmacy chain CVS Caremark Corp and pharmaceutical distributor Cardinal Health Inc on Tuesday announced a 10-year agreement to form the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States, the world’s biggest generic drug market. The 50-50 joint venture, which combines the generic drug purchasing power of two of the largest companies in the market for the cheaper medicines, will be operational as soon as July 1, 2014. Under the agreement, Cardinal will pay CVS $25 million on a quarterly basis for the duration of the contract, with an estimated after-tax value to CVS of $435 million. “We view this agreement positively as it provides an effective way to drive better purchasing through increased scale without a large capital commitment or increased complexity of international markets,” JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a research note. The companies also announced a three-year extension of their existing distribution agreements, taking them through June 2019. The U.S. market for medicines has seen a major shift toward cheaper generic drugs following a wave of patent expiries in recent years for major brand-name treatments and a growing effort to lower costs throughout the healthcare system. Generic drugs now account for more than 80 percent of all prescriptions filled, according to data from IMS Health, which tracks prescription drug data. RBC Capital Markets analyst Frank Morgan said the CVS-Cardinal joint venture should help keep generic drugmakers from substantially raising prices. “To the extent that there was any concern about pricing leverage for the generic manufacturers, this JV will likely be one of the largest global buyers of generics on the planet now, so that should certainly calm any potential concerns about that,” Morgan said. “From the CVS perspective, this joint venture brings quantifiable incremental cash flows to CVS over the next 10 years and also the potential for savings down the road,” Morgan said. ISI Group analyst Ross Muken in a research note said the deal was important following tie-ups by Cardinal’s main competitors - AmerisourceBergen Corp and McKesson Corp. He was referring to the Amerisource deal with pharmacy chain Walgreen Co and McKesson’s bid to buy German pharmaceutical wholesaler and retailer Celesio “The partnership puts Cardinal Health back on equal footing with other industry participants that have formed buying groups,” Muken said. Muken forecast that the deal could add 25 cents to 30 cents per share to annual Cardinal earnings and 18 cents to 20 cents to CVS Caremark earnings per share. CVS Caremark shares rose $1.38, or 2.1 percent, to $68.11, while Cardinal shares were up $2.50, or 3.9 percent, at $66.77 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

153,CVS,CVS expects 2014 sales gain despite Obamacare,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) said on Wednesday that it expected sales and earnings to rise in 2014 despite only a “modest” benefit next year from the launch of Obamacare and a ban preventing it from marketing to some Medicare patients. The company said at its analyst day in New York that it expects revenue to rise between 4 percent and 5.25 percent next year, with big gains in its pharmacy benefits management business mitigating softer growth at its drugstores. CVS also raised its dividend and unveiled a new $6 billion stock-buyback program, and its shares rose 2.3 percent to $68.35 in midday trading. Enrollment in Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act and designed to increase the number of Americans with medical insurance, has been impeded by problems with the government’s HealthCare.gov web site. But longer term, CVS sees a big opportunity in a program that could insure another 30 million Americans and bring more customers into its stores and pharmacies. “It’s going to be bumpy. There’s no doubt about that,” Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting. “We do believe this will get worked out.” Another roadblock for CVS is a marketing ban imposed earlier in the year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, preventing it from enrolling patients in SilverScript, the Medicare Part D prescription drug plans that CVS offers to seniors. Denton told analysts that CVS has told the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that it has fixed the problem and expects the ban to be lifted in early 2014. The federal agency’s ban on some Medicare Part D plan activity arose in January after CVS converted to a new enrollment system, which led to service problems, such as an increase in calls and problems in processing claims. In some instances, patient claims could not be processed at pharmacies. CVS expects same-store sales to be up 0.75 percent to 2 percent in 2014. But an increase in generic drugs, which sell for less but are far more profitable, will help the retail unit’s profit. Its pharmacy benefit management unit, which competes with Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), should record a revenue rise between 7.25 percent and 8.5 percent in 2014, CVS said. According to the company, CVS has held on to about 60 percent of the business it won away from Walgreen in 2012 when for months, its rival stopped filling prescriptions for Express Scripts members, who went to chains like CVS and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) instead. Walgreen and Express Scripts ended their fight in July 2012. CVS, which operates the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain after Walgreen Co WAG.N, expects adjusted earnings to rise to a range of $4.36 to $4.50 per share in 2014, while analysts on average were projecting a profit of $4.47, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said its board had approved a 22 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, bringing it up to 27.5 cents per share. CVS said it expected its adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2013 to come in at the high end of the $3.94-to-$3.97 range it gave last month.

158,CVS,RPT-Fitch affirms CVS Caremark at 'BBB+'; withdraws ratings,"Jan 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings has affirmed and withdrawn the  following ratings for CVS Caremark Corp. (NYSE: CVS): —Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘BBB+’; —Senior unsecured bank facilities at ‘BBB+’; —Senior unsecured notes at ‘BBB+’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F2’; —Commercial paper at ‘F2’. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch is discontinuing the ratings, which are uncompensated. The affirmations reflect the company’s relatively steady credit metrics and  strong liquidity position. Fitch expects CVS to manage its credit profile and  capital allocation within the context of maintaining its publicly stated  adjusted debt/EBITDA (including NPV of lease obligations) ratio of 2.7 times  (x). The ratings also consider CVS’s strong positioning in all prescription  distribution channels, with a #2 market position in the retail segment and  pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and a #1 position in the fast-growing  specialty pharmacy business, making it the largest provider of prescriptions in  the U.S. with a 21% share of 2012 prescription volume. The company is well positioned to drive continued market share gains and  capitalize on favorable industry trends for prescription growth such as the  aging population and expansion of coverage to the uninsured, the continued  growth in higher-margin generics and mid-teens growth in specialty pharmacy over  the next five years. Of concern are the ongoing cyclical pressures on the  industry resulting in soft front end sales, the industry-wide pressure on  pharmacy pricing and reimbursement rates in both the retail and PBM businesses,  and any potential hit to profitability from regulatory issues. Ongoing  healthcare reform initiatives could pressure reimbursement rates but be positive  for prescription volume over the intermediate term as the Affordable Care Act is  implemented. CVS and Cardinal Health recently announced an agreement to jointly source their  generics and also announced a three-year extension through June 2019 of Cardinal  Health’s existing pharmaceutical distribution agreements with CVS Caremark. The  U.S.-based joint venture is expected to be operational as soon as July 1, 2014,  and will have an initial term of 10 years. In order to reflect an equitable  50/50 joint venture, the agreement includes a quarterly payment of $25 million  over the life of the agreement from Cardinal Health to CVS Caremark. The  payments have an estimated after-tax present value of $435 million. Fitch  expects large pharmacy chain, distributors and service providers to continue to  find ways to partner together to leverage their buying scale and distribution  networks. This was also evidenced by the announcement of a strategic  relationship in March 2013 between Walgreens and Alliance Boots with  AmeriSourceBergen to collaborate on global supply chain opportunities. Retail EBIT Margins Expected to be up Modestly in 2014-2015  The retail segment which accounts for approximately 70% of operating profit  continues to perform well in spite of near-term cyclical pressures and the  company continues to lead the drug retail sector in sales productivity and other  operating metrics. It has had a successful track record in integrating  large-scale retail acquisitions over the past 10 years, while maintaining a  healthy level of growth and improving profitability on an organic basis.  As large-scale retail acquisition opportunities are limited going forward, share  gains will depend on: generating above-average organic growth; store closings or  share losses by weaker independents and regional chains; and small market  fill-in acquisitions and prescription file buys. Fitch expects retail top-line  growth to be in the 3% - 4% range going forward with comparable store sales  growth in the 2% - 2.5% range and square footage contribution in the 1% - 1.25%  range. Operating profit growth is expected to be 9% in 2013 and in the  mid-single digits in 2014 - 2015, which assumes flat to a modest increase in  gross margin, due to the ongoing benefit of branded to generic conversions  offset by reimbursement pressure on the prescription side. As a result, retail  EBIT margins are expected to increase modestly over the next 2 - 3 years on an  expected base of 9.4% to 9.5% in 2013. PBM EBIT Margin Expand In 2013; Expected to be Flat in 2014/2015 CVS has seen positive momentum in its PBM segment since 2011 from a top line  perspective with strong business wins that were accretive in 2012, including the  ramp up of Aetna and the UAM acquisition which contributed $5.5 billion in  incremental revenue in 2012. The company has won approximately $25 billion in  net new business over the past three years. Revenues have grown in the mid-20%  range in 2011 - 2012 and are expected to grow in the 4% to 6% in 2013 to 2015.  CVS recently announced the acquisition of Coram LLC (Coram), the specialty  infusion services and enteral nutrition business unit of Apria Healthcare Group  Inc. for approximately $2.1 billion. Coram is expected to generate approximately  $1.4 billion in revenues during the first 12 months following the close of the  deal (expected end of 1Q’14) and will further strengthen CVS’s leadership  position in the specialty pharmacy market where it controls about 20% of the  market with 2013 estimated revenue of $20 billion. Pharmacy services EBIT margin are expected to expand to 4% from 3.6% in 2013  after four years of decline, as the company integrates large scale contracts  such as Aetna Inc. and is realizing benefits from the streamlining initiatives  that it put in place in late 2009 to deliver over $1 billion in cost savings  from 2011 - 2015. Overall EBIT Growth of Mid-Single Digits; Strong FCF Fitch expects total EBIT growth including retail to be in the mid-single digit  over the next 24 months, after growing 11%-12% in 2013. CVS continues to  generate strong free cash flow (FCF) providing the company with significant  financial flexibility. Fitch expects $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion in annual FCF  (after dividends which are expected to grow in the 20% to 25% range annually, as  the company targets a payout ratio of 25% to 30% by 2015, and before any sales  leaseback transactions) over the next few years. Fitch expects FCF will  primarily be used toward share buybacks ($4 billion to $5 billion annually), and  any bolt-on acquisitions within the context of maintaining adjusted debt/EBITDAR  at 2.7x. The company’s liquidity is also supported by various credit facilities  that support its $3.5 billion commercial paper program. CVS had $10 billion in debt outstanding at Sept. 30, 2013. CVS recently issued  $4 billion of debt (staggered maturities of 3, 5, 10, and 30 years) to fund the  $2.1 billion acquisition of Coram and to pay down commercial paper borrowings  (which stood at $814 million on Sept. 30, 2013). The company has debt maturities  of $550 million each in 2014 and 2015 and $1.2 billion in 2016, which Fitch  expects will be refinanced.",1142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-cvs-caremark-at-bbb-withdr/rpt-fitch-affirms-cvs-caremark-at-bbb-withdraws-ratings-idUSFit68359520140114
159,CVS,CVS becomes first big U.S. drugstore chain to drop tobacco,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp will stop selling tobacco products at its 7,600 stores by October 1, the company said on Wednesday, making it the first national drugstore chain in the United States to take cigarettes off the shelves. Public health experts hailed the precedent-setting decision by the No. 2 U.S. drugstore as a step that could pressure other retailers to follow suit. With pharmacies taking on a larger role in the U.S. healthcare system with walk-in clinics and services such as managing health plans, many experts say they should no longer offer unhealthy products like tobacco. President Barack Obama, a former smoker, praised CVS, saying in a statement the move will help wider efforts to “reduce tobacco-related deaths, cancer, and heart disease, as well as bring down healthcare costs.” CVS expects the decision to hurt profits initially, along with a $2 billion hit to annual sales. But the company, whose Caremark unit is a pharmacy benefits manager for corporations and the U.S. government’s Medicare program, believes the move will boost its appeal as a healthcare provider. CVS hopes to replace some sales through signing up customers to smoking cessation programs, which will be a selling point with potential corporate contracts. Analysts said CVS could eventually recoup lost sales through increased use of its healthcare services. But investors focused on the short-term pain. CVS shares fell 1 percent. Larger rival Walgreen Co, which will keep selling cigarettes, rose 3.9 percent, while No. 3 Rite Aid Corp which also will still offer cigarettes rose 2 percent. Shares of cigarette makers Lorillard Inc, Altria Group and Reynolds American all slipped. Pharmacists have long been a source of community health information, and drugstore chains have embraced that tradition by adding walk-in clinics. CVS is the largest U.S. pharmacy healthcare provider, with more than 800 MinuteClinic locations. “I think CVS recognized that it was just paradoxical to be both a seller of deadly products and a healthcare provider,” U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden told Reuters. CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan said in a piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association that increased health coverage under the U.S. Affordable Care Act “comes with a price” of promoting public health. Experts noted that healthcare organizations and advocacy groups such as Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights have been urging pharmacies for years to get out of the tobacco business. Cornell University communication professor Jeff Niederdeppe cited “an evolving social climate that has become less and less supportive of the marketing, sale, and use of tobacco products in the U.S.” Some U.S. cities, including Boston and San Francisco, already ban the sale of tobacco products in pharmacies, and nonsmoking advocates hope other chains will follow CVS. “This is a trend we’re going to see many, many retailers and food companies jump on,” said Alexandra von Plato, president and global chief creative officer of Publicis Healthcare Communications Group. Only 18 percent of U.S. adults smoke, down sharply from 43 percent in 1965. But the habit still kills 480,000 Americans each year, remaining the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. SHORT-TERM HIT CVS said the decision to drop tobacco sales will cost the company 6 cents to 9 cents in profit per share this year. Analysts expect 2014 revenue of $132.9 billion and earnings of $4.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall U.S. cigarette sales fell 31.3 percent from 2003 to 2013, according to Euromonitor International. And CVS faced more competition in selling to that shrinking market, as discount retailers Family Dollar Stores Inc and Dollar General Corp chains charge much less and have far more locations. “We believe the move will be viewed as a positive long-term decision by CVS, despite the near-term profit drag, as it paves the way for increased credibility with both healthcare consumers and payers,” ISI Group analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note to investors. CVS has been bolstering its position in the healthcare market in recent months and in December, it said it expected pharmacy benefit manager revenue to rise between 7.25 percent and 8.5 percent in 2014, more than double the rate of retail business growth. Tobacco companies shrugged off the announcement even as shares dipped on concerns about potential disruption to sales. “It’s up to retailers to decide if they’re going to sell tobacco products,” said Brian May, spokesman for Altria Group, maker of Marlboro and other popular brands. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said he expected little impact on tobacco companies. He noted that they rely on convenience stores for more than 75 percent of sales. But Dr. Richard Wender of the American Cancer Society said CVS’s move would have an effect. “Every time we make it more difficult to purchase a pack of cigarettes, someone quits.” ",2052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cvscaremark-cigarettes/cvs-becomes-first-big-u-s-drugstore-chain-to-drop-tobacco-idUSBREA140RP20140205

Analysts expect 2014 revenue of $132.9 billion and earnings of $4.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall U.S. cigarette sales fell 31.3 percent from 2003 to 2013, according to Euromonitor International. And CVS faced more competition in selling to that shrinking market, as discount retailers Family Dollar Stores Inc and Dollar General Corp chains charge much less and have far more locations. “We believe the move will be viewed as a positive long-term decision by CVS, despite the near-term profit drag, as it paves the way for increased credibility with both healthcare consumers and payers,” ISI Group analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note to investors. CVS has been bolstering its position in the healthcare market in recent months and in December, it said it expected pharmacy benefit manager revenue to rise between 7.25 percent and 8.5 percent in 2014, more than double the rate of retail business growth. Tobacco companies shrugged off the announcement even as shares dipped on concerns about potential disruption to sales. “It’s up to retailers to decide if they’re going to sell tobacco products,” said Brian May, spokesman for Altria Group , maker of Marlboro and other popular brands. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said he expected little impact on tobacco companies. He noted that they rely on convenience stores for more than 75 percent of sales. But Dr. Richard Wender of the American Cancer Society said CVS’s move would have an effect. “Every time we make it more difficult to purchase a pack of cigarettes, someone quits.”",2052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvscaremark-cigarettes/update-3-cvs-becomes-first-big-u-s-drugstore-chain-to-drop-tobacco-idUSL2N0LA11S20140205
161,CVS,RPT-UPDATE 1-CVS to become first major U.S. drugstore chain to drop cigarettes,"By Phil Wahba and Julie Steenhuysen Feb 5 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp said on Wednesday that it would stop selling tobacco products at its 7,600 stores by October, becoming the first national drugstore chain in the United States to take cigarettes off the shelf. Public health experts called the decision by the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain a precedent-setting step that could pressure other retailers to follow suit. President Barack Obama, a former smoker, praised the move, saying CVS had set a powerful example. “Today’s decision will help advance my Administration’s efforts to reduce tobacco-related deaths, cancer, and heart disease, as well as bring down healthcare costs,” Obama said in a statement. CVS, whose Caremark unit is a major pharmacy benefits manager for corporations and the U.S. government’s Medicare program, said the decision would strengthen its position as a healthcare provider. “I think it will put pressure on other retailers who want to be in healthcare,” said CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan. Although some U.S. cities, including Boston and San Francisco, already ban the sale of tobacco products in pharmacies, advocates hope the voluntary move by CVS will have a ripple effect across other drugstore chains. Walgreen Co, the largest pharmacy chain, said it would still sell cigarettes for now but will continue to evaluate the product category. Third-ranked Rite Aid Corp  did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some retailers stopped selling cigarettes years ago:  Target Corp decided to drop them in 1996, while East Coast supermarket chain Wegmans Food Markets did so in 2008. Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, chief executive officer of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which focuses on public health, said CVS had made “a bold, precedent-setting move because it acknowledges that pharmacies have become healthcare settings.” However, CVS said the decision would not make a big dent in its financial results. The company said the cost would be about $2 billion in annual sales and 6 cents to 9 cents in profit per share this year. Analysts expect CVS to report 2014 revenue of $132.9 billion and earnings of $4.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. Declining smoking rates, along with new competition in the last two years from the low-cost Family Dollar Stores Inc  and Dollar General Corp chains, suggest prospects for tobacco product sales were shrinking at CVS. Dollar stores have far more locations and offer goods at lower prices. “We believe the move will be viewed as a positive long-term decision by CVS, despite the near-term profit drag, as it paves the way for increased credibility with both healthcare consumers and payors,” ISI Group analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note. Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said CVS’s announcement could help lead more people to quit smoking. U.S. cigarette sales fell 31.3 percent between 2003 and 2013, according to Euromonitor International. Although adult smoking rates have fallen from 43 percent of Americans in 1965 to 18 percent currently, the habit remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 people each year. Last month, the American Lung Association and other advocacy organizations called on political leaders to commit to cutting smoking rates to less than 10 percent of the population in a decade and to protect all Americans from secondhand smoke within five years.

The gains were broad, with all 10 S&P; 500 sectors up for the day and about 75 percent of New York Stock Exchange-traded stocks ending higher. About 67 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares closed in positive territory, while the S&P; 500 ended just 1.6 percent away from its record closing high. Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives caved in to demands by President Barack Obama and agreed to advance legislation increasing Washington’s borrowing authority, removing a potential market headwind. Fed Chair Janet Yellen emphasized continuity in the U.S. central bank’s policy strategy of cutting asset purchases by $10 billion a month, saying she strongly supports the approach of her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. In her first public comments as Fed chief, Yellen also said that while the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen recently, labor market conditions needed to improve further. “No one was really expecting a major debt ceiling showdown or changes in tapering, but anticipation is one thing, and the experience is another,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. “Everyone is more relaxed now that those issues are officially off the table.” The Fed’s policies have been credited with driving the market’s steep gains in 2013, and those accommodative measures are expected to keep a floor under stock prices for as long as they continue. However, had the pace of ending the program been slowed, it may have raised concerns that the economy was still not strong enough to grow on its own.

The index also moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since Jan. 24, a positive sign of near-term momentum. The index has recovered much of its recent weakness, which took the index down as much as 6 percent from its record close on Jan. 15. Sprint Corp rose 2.7 percent to end at $7.90 after the company reported quarterly revenue ahead of analysts’ expectations and said it added wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter.

168,CVS,CVS sticks to 2014 sales forecast despite tobacco exit,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) stuck to its 2014 sales forecast on Tuesday, a week after announcing it was giving up its $2 billion a year tobacco business, and said sales at its drugstores are off to a good start this year. Shares in CVS, which reported a better than expected quarterly profit, rose 2.5 percent to $68.79. “The ongoing strength in our core retail pharmacy business will help offset the loss from our decision to exit the tobacco category,” Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton told Wall Street analysts on a call. CVS, which operates the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain with 7,600 stores, and a major pharmacy benefits management business, reported a higher profit for the quarter ended December 31, as it processed more prescriptions and benefited from the introduction of new generic drugs, helping it offset a drop in store visits by customers. The company raised its first-quarter profit forecast by 7 cents per share to a range of $1.03 to $1.06, saying sales have been strong this quarter so far. Revenue in the quarter ended December 31 rose 4.6 percent to $32.83 billion, beating analyst forecasts of $32.67 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, despite two impediments. CVS’s pharmacy services unit processed 0.3 percent fewer network claims because of lower membership in a Medicare plan aimed at seniors. The company was hit by sanctions placed on CVS last year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over its marketing of the plan. The government lifted its sanctions in December, allowing CVS to resume enrolling members last month. Another challenge was a drop in the number of visits to stores, a problem that has also hit rivals Walgreen Co WAG.N and Rite Aid Corp. (RAD.N) That contributed to a 1.9 percent decline in sales of general merchandise at stores open at least a year last quarter. Still, the company filled 3.8 percent more prescriptions and sold more generic drugs which cost less but have larger profit margins, lifting overall same-store sales well above Wall Street expectations. CVS earned $1.27 billion from continuing operations, or $1.05 per share, in the fourth quarter, up from $1.13 billion, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, it reported a profit of $1.12 per share, a penny better than expected. CVS announced last week it would stop selling all tobacco products at its drugstores by October, making it the first national drugstore chain in the United States to take cigarettes off the shelves. The decision was aimed at bolstering CVS’ position in the healthcare market in recent months. At its analyst day in December, the company said it expected pharmacy benefit manager revenue to rise between 7.25 percent and 8.5 percent in 2014, more than double the rate of retail business growth. It stuck to the 2014 forecast from December and still expects adjusted profit of $4.36 to $4.50 per share this year.

In her first public comments as Fed chief, Yellen, giving a balanced testimony to a House committee, acknowledged recent volatility in global financial markets but said it did “not pose a substantial risk to the U.S. economic outlook,” and that she strongly supported the policy approach of her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. Yellen’s appearance before the House Financial Services Committee began at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT). “We didn’t see anything, at least in the written release that would cause us any concerns,” said Paul Mangus, head of equity research and strategy at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Naturally the testimony is just beginning so that will be very interesting to watch, the written testimony was in many ways a continuation of what the Bernanke policies had been.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 83.69 points or 0.53 percent, to 15,885.48, the S&P; 500 gained 7.74 points or 0.43 percent, to 1,807.58 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 18.85 points or 0.45 percent, to 4,167.023. The central bank has cut its bond-buying program by $10 billion at each of its last two meetings, reducing the monthly purchases to $65 billion. Stocks also saw a potential headwind removed when Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives caved in to demands by President Barack Obama and agreed to advance legislation raising Washington’s borrowing authority. Sprint Corp, the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider, reported quarterly revenue ahead of analysts’ expectations and said it added wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter.

In her first public comments as Fed chief, Yellen, giving a balanced testimony to a House committee, acknowledged recent volatility in global financial markets but said it did “not pose a substantial risk to the U.S. economic outlook,” and that she strongly supported the policy approach of her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. “Obviously it’s all about Yellen today,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “We are setting ourselves up for what could be a volatile session if there are any negative surprises, by that I mean if she is not as dovish as the market may be expecting.” S&P; 500 e-mini futures rose 1.75 points and were slightly above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.

174,CVS,UPDATE 1-U.S. court boosts SEC's power to recoup insider trading profits,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, Feb 18 (Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday strengthened the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s ability to recover insider trading profit from people who do not personally benefit directly from their alleged illegal trades. By a 2-1 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said former Jefferies Group Inc portfolio manager Joseph Contorinis, convicted in 2010 of insider trading, must give up $7.26 million of alleged illegal profit that he made for the firm’s Paragon Fund, plus $2.42 million in interest. “Whether the defendant’s motive is direct economic profit, selfaggrandizement, psychic satisfaction from benefiting a loved one, or future profits by enhancing one’s reputation as a successful fund manager, the insider trader who trades for another’s account has engaged in a fraud, secured a benefit thereby, and directed the profits of the fraud where he has chosen them to go,” Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote for the majority. The decision could affect how much people convicted of insider trading on behalf of hedge funds may have to pay in related SEC civil cases. Many of these cases are in New York, which is part of the 2nd Circuit. “This is a huge decision, and ratchets up substantially the deterrent effect of prosecutions,” James Cox, a law professor at Duke University, said in a phone interview. Contorinis, 49, is serving a six-year prison term following his October 2010 conviction for securities fraud and conspiracy over trades in supermarket chain Albertsons Inc ahead of its 2006 buyout by Supervalu Inc, CVS Corp and investors led by Cerberus Capital Management LP. Prosecutors said Contorinis’ trades were based on tips from Nicos Stephanou, a friend and former banker at UBS AG, which was advising the Cerberus group on the buyout. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who oversaw the criminal and civil cases, previously ordered Contorinis to forfeit $427,875 in the criminal case. Tuesday’s decision upheld the penalty in the SEC civil case. Roberto Finzi, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who represents Contorinis, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. SEC spokesman John Nester said the regulator is pleased with the decision. In his appeal of the civil penalty, Contorinis said he should not have to give up, or disgorge, profit he made for Paragon because he did not personally control that profit. Writing for the 2nd Circuit majority, however, Lynch said there was “no injustice” in holding Contorinis liable, given that successful trading could boost his reputation and pay. Circuit Judge Denny Chin dissented. He said disgorgement is supposed to be remedial rather than punitive, and that “while Contorinis undeniably deserved to be punished, disgorgement was not the proper mechanism.” Cox, the Duke professor, said “the level of profits that could be subject to disgorgement by employees could be so huge that it would be seen as a punishment.” Stephanou pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy and testified against Contorinis. After spending 19 months in jail, Stephanou was sentenced by Sullivan to time served. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Contorinis is housed at the Beckley prison complex in Beaver, West Virginia, and not eligible for release until December 2015.

177,CVS,Another earthquake rattles southern California following 5.1 quake,"(Reuters) - Residents of southern California were rattled by a 4.1 magnitude earthquake Saturday afternoon, the largest of more than 100 aftershocks following Friday’s 5.1 rumbler that caused light scattered damage around the Los Angeles area. Saturday’s quake rippled through an area near Rowland Heights, California, about 2:32 p.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The temblor was considered relatively shallow with a depth of 5.6 miles, the USGS said. Aftershocks are expected following earthquakes, according to the USGS. Seismologists said there was about a 5 percent chance that Friday’s quake, which struck at 9:09 p.m., was a foreshock to a bigger temblor. No injuries were immediately reported from either Saturday’s quake or the more significant earthquake that struck Friday evening outside La Habra, California, which is about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Friday’s temblor displaced at least 50 people in Fullerton, about 5 miles from the epicenter, because of minor damage to homes and apartment dwellings, Fullerton Police Lieutenant Mike Chlebowski said. As well, a water main break in the city forced the closure of some streets due to flooding, he said. The quake also shook items off tables, rattled chandeliers and resulted in scattered damage to cars and property, including setting off a rockslide in the Orange County city of Brea that flipped a car on its roof. Friday’s quake was felt as far away as Palm Springs in the east, San Diego in the south and Ventura County to the north. While not large, the event “seems unusual, of course, because a lot of people felt it,” said Doug Given, a USGS geophysicist. “These quakes occur in populated areas and people try to put two and two together and predict that something more is coming, but that’s simply not the case,” he said. The quake shut down Metrolink trains to allow for inspection of tracks and cars. In Anaheim, Disneyland briefly turned off park rides as a precaution and asked guests to remain seated. But the Los Angeles Philharmonic didn’t miss a note even as the quake rattled downtown Los Angeles’s Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Los Angeles Times reported. “The L.A. Philharmonic should get combat pay,” audience member Michael Healy told the newspaper.

178,CVS,CVS to pay $20 million to settle SEC fraud charges,"(Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp, the second largest U.S. drugstore chain, will pay $20 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it defrauded investors in 2009 during a debt offering and by accounting improperly for an acquisition. The SEC, which announced the settlement on Tuesday, said CVS failed to disclose while marketing $1.5 billion of bonds in September 2009 having recently lost significant Medicare and contract revenue streams in its pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) business, including from the former Caremark Rx Inc that it bought in March 2007. After CVS disclosed the problems on November 5, 2009, which resulted in a 20-percent plunge in its share price, the company further misled investors by manipulating its “retention rate,” thereby inflating its ability to retain business, the SEC said. CVS was also accused of having in November 2009 manipulated accounting for its October 2008 purchase of Longs Drug Stores Corp. The SEC said the changes improperly boosted profit by as much as 11.7 cents per share for the third quarter of 2009, enabling CVS to exceed rather than miss analyst forecasts. “CVS broke faith with investors,” Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement. “The intentional misconduct by CVS breached the core principle of fair and accurate reporting of financial performance.” The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, and on Tuesday said it is not restating any financial results. Separately, the SEC said Laird Daniels, CVS’ senior vice president for international operations and business development, agreed to pay $75,000 and accept a one-year accounting ban to settle related charges over the Longs accounting. He also did not admit or deny wrongdoing. In court papers, the SEC said Daniels, who in 2009 was a CVS retail controller, characterized the accounting changes as turning the Longs purchase into a “good guy” rather than a “bad guy” for CVS, referring to its impact on profitability. Daniels, 44, lives in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, the SEC said. His lawyer Robert Cleary, a partner at Proskauer Rose specializing in white collar defense, declined to comment. A shareholder lawsuit against CVS over the PBM disclosures remains pending in a federal court in Providence, Rhode Island. The SEC’s evidence “confirms our allegations about the PBM business and that the wrongful conduct was occurring at least since year-end 2008,” Joseph Fonti, a partner at Labaton Sucharow representing the shareholders, said in an interview.

187,CVS,"RPT-Barclays sees generational shift, rivals smell blood","(Repeats Friday item) * Barclays pares back ambitions to be Wall Street powerhouse * Jenkins doesn’t expect talent exodus after U.S. departures * Traders spruce up their CVs, talk to headhunters - source * Barclays to remain largest investment bank in Europe By Steve Slater LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Where Barclays sees a “generational shift”, its investment bank rivals are smelling blood. The British bank, which under former chief Bob Diamond poached top staff and customers from competitors in trouble after the financial crisis, now risks suffering the same fate as it radically shrinks its investment banking business. Diamond’s successor as Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins, says he does not expect a further exodus of top talent after departures from Barclays’ U.S. operation, but some trading staff at least are preparing for the exit as the bank pares back its ambitions to be a Wall Street powerhouse. Barclays announced this week plans to shrink its debt trading business and axe a quarter of staff, focusing instead on U.S. and British clients and products where it ranks in the top five in business such as selling government bonds, stocks and currencies and advising on deals. Tom King, who made his career advising telecoms firms on takeover battles, is tasked with making the strategy work and hailed it as a “step change” that was needed in a new era of tougher regulations that have made some trades too expensive. “We’re really shifting the investment bank from one that was a business run for revenue to one that is being run for return,” King said on Thursday. The worry for Jenkins and King is that top staff and clients leave and the business slowly dies, echoing the problems of Credit Suisse First Boston when it bought Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette for $11 billion in 2000, only for many senior bankers there to depart. Jenkins, who previously ran Barclays’ retail business and has no background in investment banking, admitted he feared a “death spiral” after an exodus of staff from its U.S. business last year. This prompted him controversially to raise bonuses for 2013 despite a fall in profits. King himself left Citigroup for Barclays in 2009 because the bailed out U.S. group was scaling back its investment bank while Barclays, under former debt trader Diamond, was vowing to take on Wall Street after its takeover of the U.S. division of Lehman Brothers. Even before Thursday’s announcement, the atmosphere among Barclays’ dealers was grim. People who feared the chop were already arriving to work late and leaving early, spending the time in-between sprucing up their CVs and talking to headhunters, said one person within the bank. “Whenever this sort of thing happens the best people will be getting a lot of inbound calls. This won’t be any different,” said a senior banker at a rival. Jenkins wants his bank to be more balanced and with lower costs to boost profitability. Cutting thousands of jobs could save the bank more than 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) a year based on average pay. Winding down large parts of its trading book will help to reduce the investment bank’s use of capital to 30 percent by 2016 from 51 percent last year. The result will be a dismantling of much of the bond trading  powerhouse built up by Diamond in the decade prior to the 2008/09 financial crisis. Much of the former Lehman business, which includes the U.S. equities and advisory desks, will stay at the heart of the smaller firm. For Barclays, that means focusing on its strong “home” markets of the United States and Britain, which account for 60 percent of global market business. It will cut back hard in Asia, largely serving only big clients’ needs there and Asian customers who want help on overseas deals. There have already been a series of high profile departures in the United States, including Hugh ‘Skip’ McGee, the head of its Americas business who was the most senior ex-Lehman banker. The bank also lost Ros Stephenson, Paul Parker and Larry Wieseneck. “I’m not concerned at all about the level of departures. What we’re seeing is a something of a generational shift,” Jenkins said on Thursday as he unveiled his plan. “We’re seeing some of the senior leadership saying it’s the right time for them to move on,” he said. “We’re seeing low levels of attrition in the people that are going to be running the bank going forward, the next generation of MDs.” Senior sources at the bank concurred, and said many of the senior people had left after missing out on the top job taken by King, a U.S. native who moved to London for a couple of years in 1999 and stayed for over a decade. He is now based in New York. Industry sources said this is part of a wider trend in the industry. “I feel that banks are in a mode to reduce the senior level,” a source at another bank said. “The only way to protect and promote the mid-level talent is by freeing up the top.” Barclays has said it plans to cut 7,000 investment bank jobs in the next three years, with about 2,000 of those this year. It plans to put 340 billion pounds of investment bank assets into a new “non-core” unit where they will be run down, so whole teams will be cut. Staff in those areas that the bank wants to keep may have bonuses based on hitting asset reduction targets - something which UBS did as it shrank its business after a bailout by the Swiss state. At Barclays, Eric Bommensath - the former fixed income boss who became co-head of the investment bank with King a year ago - is in charge of the non-core business and no longer sits on the executive committee. Barclays faces risks in carrying out its plan. It will  “meaningfully reduce” the number of clients, with most focus on the top 1,000 who deliver 75 percent of the investment bank’s revenues. The investment bank will also still be left with 490 billion pounds of assets. While smaller than U.S. players such as JP Morgan, it will remain the largest investment bank in Europe with more assets than the “core” businesses of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse after they also pruned operations. Barclays is exiting most commodities business and is likely to retreat from areas including emerging markets and interest rate trading products, structured products, securitisation and cross currency swaps. Areas where the bank is strong - such as rates in the G10 leading economies, foreign exchange and credit trading and debt capital markets - will be less affected. It is also sticking with its equities and advisory operations, which have expanded in the last three years, require less capital and appear set for yet stronger growth. Bankers said that while Barclays lags some rivals with its plans, it won’t be the last to take radical action. “In the next year or two, more people will shrink or pull out. We’ve not seen anything meaningful other than UBS and RBS. Deutsche is going through some change and now Barclays, but there’s still a lot more to come,” a senior rival banker said. “It’s a painful process. The key questions are where do you pick your spots, and you need to be disciplined.”   ($1 = 0.5899 British Pounds)   (Additional reporting by Clare Hutchison, So-young Kim, Lawrence White and Katharina Bart; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and David Stamp)",5122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/barclays-investmentbank/rpt-barclays-sees-generational-shift-rivals-smell-blood-idUSL6N0NY1DV20140512

193,CVS,Study shows downward trend in Sovaldi utilization,"(Reuters) - Over the last several months there has been a ‘plateau and downward trend’ in the use of Gilead Sciences Inc’s controversial $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi, a CVS Health Corp analysis showed. The study, encompassing data from May through August 2014, suggests that another surge of patients will begin therapy when newer treatments of similar effectiveness and shorter duration are introduced later in the year.

201,CVS,"Some U.S. retailers shun Apple Pay, eye rival payments system","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Some large U.S. retailers are refusing to use Apple Inc’s APPL.O new electronic payments service as they commit to developing a rival payments system that would bolster their profits by eliminating credit card transaction fees. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is among the roughly 50 big retailers that have chosen not to accept Apple Pay, along with Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) and CVS HealthCorp (CVS.N). They say they are working instead on developing their own payment system, called Current C, through the Merchants Customer Exchange (MCX) consortium. The driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N), analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction. “”The economics and benefits of having your own payment system is definitely one of the main reasons,” said Hitesh Sheth, chief executive of retail technology cybersecurity firm Vectra Networks. Apple did not immediately respond to queries seeking comment. Mastercard criticized the move by CVS and Rite Aid, saying it would limit the options of consumers. “We are disappointed that both Rite Aid and CVS have decided to block their customers from using the payment method of their choice,” Mastercard spokesman Jim Issokson said.  Apple Pay, unveiled just last month, is a mobile payment app that allows consumers to buy things by simply holding their iPhone6 and 6 Plus devices up to readers installed by store merchants. The retailers shunning Apple Pay have also refused to use mobile payment systems like Google Wallet and Softcard. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said on Monday the company is continually evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies. CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two CVS stores showed the NFC (Near Field Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used has been deactivated. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said Wal-Mart is not participating in Apple Pay at this point. It is focused instead on MCX, as one of the heavyweights in the consortium. Target said that it supports MCX but is also allowing users to make online purchases through its mobile app using Apple Pay. Antitrust experts said CVS and Rite Aid have the right to drop a vendor if they believe they can save money by going around the credit card companies and Apple, both of which will take a piece of the action. But they could run into antitrust trouble if they coordinated on dropping Apple Pay and Google Wallet or if someone else, perhaps a person working with CurrentC, organized their decision to drop Apple and Google’s payment services. “If I was a regulator, I would want to take a look at that,” said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

204,CVS,Apple CEO fires back as retailers block Pay,"LAGUNA BEACH Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook fired back at CVS (CVS.N) and Rite Aid (RAD.N) on Monday after the drugstore chains blocked the iPhone maker’s mobile payments service, saying there were plenty of other retailers around the world to sign up. Apple Pay launched about a week ago and saw more than a million credit cards registered over the first 72 hours. It already totes up more transactions than all other “contact less” payment methods combined, Cook said, citing Visa and Mastercard data.  Such services, through which a user pays by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal, have failed to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google Inc (GOOG.O) and other influential players. News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly 50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for in-house use. “We’ve got a lot more merchants to sign up, we’ve got a lot of banks to sign up and we’ve got the rest of the world,” Cook told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the company’s most extensive comments on the blockade so far. In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall utility. Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming the first widely used payments feature on smartphones. CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move.      But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N), analysts said.

205,CVS,Apple CEO fires back as retailers block Pay,"LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., Oct 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  CEO Tim Cook fired back at CVS and Rite Aid on Monday after the drugstore chains blocked the iPhone maker’s mobile payments service, saying there were plenty of other retailers around the world to sign up. Apple Pay launched about a week ago and saw more than a million credit cards registered over the first 72 hours. It already totes up more transactions than all other “contactless” payment methods combined, Cook said, citing Visa and Mastercard data. Such services, through which a user pays by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal, have failed to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google Inc and other influential players. News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly 50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for in-house use. “We’ve got a lot more merchants to sign up, we’ve got a lot of banks to sign up and we’ve got the rest of the world,” Cook told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the company’s most extensive comments on the blockade so far. In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall utility. Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming the first widely used payments feature on smartphones. CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move.     But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa and Mastercard, analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores.

206,CVS,CVS posts slightly higher-than-expected quarterly results,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp reported slightly higher-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday, helped by growth in sales of specialty drugs and new client additions in its pharmacy benefits business. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 2 percent during the third quarter. Same-store sales jumped 4.8 percent in the pharmacy section but fewer customers meant a 4.5 percent decline for toothpaste, snacks and other merchandise sold at the front of the stores. Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said on a conference call that front-end margins showed a “solid improvement,” one-third of which stemmed from the absence of low-margin tobacco sales. In September, 7,700 CVS stores stopped selling tobacco products after the company sought to reposition itself as a healthcare destination. Net income at CVS, which operates the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain and a major pharmacy benefits management business, fell to $948 million, or 81 cents per share, from $1.25 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a pre-tax loss of $521 on early retirement of debt and other items, earnings per share rose 9 percent to $1.15. Analysts on average had expected $1.13, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating margins improved on the back of new generic drug additions, with operating profit for pharmacy services up 7.3 percent and retail pharmacy up 4.3 percent.    Revenue rose 9.7 percent to $35 billion, led by strong sales of specialty drugs in the pharmacy benefits business. Analysts had forecast $34.74 billion. Specialty drugs treat complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and cancer. Developing this business has been one of the company’s top priorities.  CVS said it expected 2014 earnings of $4.47 to $4.50 per share, compared with a prior outlook of $4.43 to $4.51. Shares of CVS were down 1.5 percent at $84.83 in early trading.

But both indexes were well off their highs for the day, with consumer discretionary shares the biggest drag on the S&P;, while the Nasdaq was lower. Shares of Amazon were down 2.5 percent. The S&P; 500 moved more than 40 points from its high of the day to its low. Futures crumbled in early trading as the ruble neared 80 per U.S. dollar, down 21 percent.

212,CVS,CVS to cover Gilead hepatitis C treatment over AbbVie regimen,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, one of the largest U.S. managers of drug benefits, said it would give preferred status to the hepatitis C treatments from Gilead Sciences and cover a new competing treatment from AbbVie Inc only as an exception. The latest salvo in the battle to grab market share for new all-oral treatments for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus follows a move last month by CVS rival Express Scripts Holding that favored AbbVie’s regimen after negotiating a price discount below what Gilead had been charging its commercial customers. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would cover AbbVie’s Viekira Pak and exclude Gilead’s Sovaldi and combination drug Harvoni. The decision had sent Gilead shares sharply lower at the time. On Monday, Gilead shares were up 2.5 percent following the CVS announcement, while AbbVie shares were down 2.2 percent. Gilead has come under intense criticism for the high price of its first-to-market all-oral treatment; Sovaldi costs about $1,000 per pill. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with another drug into a one-pill, once-a-day treatment with cure rates well above 90 percent. A 12-week course of treatment with Harvoni costs about $93,500, although some patients may need just eights weeks of therapy costing about $63,000. It was not yet known whether Gilead agreed to a substantially discounted price to secure CVS coverage. Gilead did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Express Scripts said it is still negotiating with Gilead on behalf of its plans. “Our actions have changed how pharmaceutical innovation will be rewarded in the future,”  spokesman Brian Henry said.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said the CVS move “removes near-term uncertainty for many investors who feared CVS would also strike a deal with AbbVie and put more pressure on Gilead.” AbbVie declined to say whether it was still in talks with CVS. CVS said the Gilead drugs would be exclusive on its standard commercial formulary, as well as those for exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part D and Medicaid. “Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C,” CVS spokeswoman Christine Cramer said in a statement. The recently approved AbbVie regimen has similarly high cure rates, but involves more drugs and pills per day. Many patients must also take the older drug ribavirin, which can cause anemia and other side effects. Gilead shares were up $2.28 at $97.19, while AbbVie shares were down $1.45 at $64.44.

214,CVS,CVS Health revenue beats as pharmacy services sales rise,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly net revenue, boosted by growth in its Medicaid business and strength in specialty drug sales. Pharmacy sales at stores open at least a year rose 5.5 percent during the fourth quarter but fewer customers and the decision to stop selling cigarettes meant a 7.2 percent decline for toothpaste, snacks and other merchandise sold at the front of the stores. The company said an increase in items purchased per customer helped stem the decline. The company estimated that front-end same store sales would have been approximately 800 basis points higher if the impact of the loss of tobacco was removed. Shares of the No. 2 U.S. drugstore operator were down 0.3 percent at $99.24 in early trading.  Chief Executive Larry Merlo said the impact of tobacco sales on other product categories has been less than expected. CVS became the first national drugstore chain in the United States to take cigarettes off its shelves from Oct. 1. The company had warned that the decision would hurt profits initially, along with a $2 billion hit to annual sales. Revenue in the pharmacy services division jumped 21.7 percent to $23.9 billion, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy business, the company said. CVS Health has focused on developing its specialty pharmacy business, which sells drugs to treat complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and cancer.  The medium-term outlook for the pharmacy services segment remains highly favorable due to government policy and the continued opening of healthcare clinics, said Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail research and consulting firm Conlumino. CVS on Tuesday reaffirmed its current-quarter earnings forecast of $1.06-$1.09 per share. Analysts on average are expecting a profit of $1.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose nearly 13 percent to $37.06 billion. The company, which also operates a major pharmacy benefits management business, said net income rose to $1.32 billion, or $1.14 per share, from $1.27 billion, or $1.05 per share. Excluding items, CVS earned $1.21 per share, at the top end of the $1.18-$1.21 per share it forecast in November. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.20 per share on revenue of $36.08 billion.

217,CVS,CVS urges cost controls for new cholesterol drugs,"(Reuters) - CVS Health warned on Tuesday that the costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments could eclipse those of other expensive medicines and overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.” Two of the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could gain U.S. approval this summer. CVS said they could eventually be used by as many as 15 million patients at an annual cost of up to $150 billion a year if priced at $7,000 to $12,000 a year, making it the highest-selling class of drugs in history. “The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement. CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans. The CVS call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians over the high cost of new, highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, especially two medicines from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500 per patient for a course of treatment. Unlike those drugs, which are typically taken for about 12 weeks, the PCSK9s would be used for a lifetime. Express Scripts, the largest U.S. PBM, which has waged a campaign against Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs and is now scrutinizing costly cancer medications, provided a slightly different view of the new cholesterol drug market. Express Scripts also expects annual costs of around $10,000 per year per patient. But it sees a patient population that will start small before it ever reaches a possible high of 10 million people and a potential annual cost of $100 billion. Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview that limits set by regulators and the fact that the first wave of drugs are injections may slow their uptake.  “We are going to work to get these products at the best price possible, but they also deserve to get value in the marketplace,” Miller said. Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors.  They are expected to be used first by patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol - a population that CVS and Express peg at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used by those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor.

219,CVS,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-CVS urges cost controls for new cholesterol, specialty drugs","(Corrects first paragraph to show that CVS move was on Tuesday, not Monday) By Ransdell Pierson Feb 17 (Reuters) - CVS Health on Tuesday warned that costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments and other specialty drugs in development could eclipse those of expensive new medicines and overwhelm the healthcare system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.” CVS, the second largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager which negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans, noted that two of the new injectable cholesterol fighters - called PCSK9 inhibitors - could be approved by mid-2015 and likely each cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year. All told, PCSK9 inhibitors could eventually cost the healthcare system as much as $150 billion a year and become the highest-selling class of drugs in history, CVS said. “The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement. The company added that the sky-high prices of the new cholesterol drugs could pave the way for other very costly specialty drugs. CVS’ call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians of the high costs of recently approved oral treatments for hepatitis C, especially two brands from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500. Those drugs wipe out the liver virus in more than 90 percent of patients and don’t need to be used beyond 12 weeks for most patients. By contrast, CVS warned that the new cholesterol drugs might be needed “for the duration of patients’ lives” and eventually be deemed appropriate for as many as 15 million Americans. Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting U.S. approval of their rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be approved for patients who are genetically prone to high levels of cholesterol - a population that CVS pegs at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used for those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc’s  Lipitor. The experimental treatments, in combination with statins,  knocked down their levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by as much as 60 percent more than statins alone. Gilead’s Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another of its  anti-viral medicines into a daily pill, won U.S. approval late last year and has a retail price of $94,500. By itself, Sovaldi’s list price is $84,000 per treatment. Gilead has acknowledged negotiating price discounts with payers of more than 40 percent for the two hepatitis C brands, as it vies for market share with a newer rival therapy from AbbVie called Viekira Pak. Shares of Amgen were up 0.8 percent on Tuesday on the Nasdaq, while Regeneron’s stock gained 2.2 percent. Sanofi’s shares slipped 0.3 percent in trading in Paris.

General merchandise sales at drugstores open at least a year were down, however. The company blamed its decision in October to stop selling tobacco products. CVS, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore operator, also raised the low end of its 2015 profit forecast to $5.08 a share from $5.05 before special items, while keeping the high end at 5.19. Its shares rose 1 percent to $100.24 in morning trading. One of CVS’s top priorities has been to develop its specialty pharmacy business, which provides medication and services for complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C and cancer. Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said on a conference call that specialty pharmacy revenue increased in the quarter because of volume, new products, inflation and a prescription services program called Specialty Connect. Overall pharmacy services revenue rose 18.2 percent to $23.9 billion.  Total net revenue increased 11 percent to $36.33 billion. Analysts on average had expected $35.93 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The number of pharmacy network claims CVS processed increased 11 percent to 230.8 million, with growth from its Medicaid management business and public exchanges. Same-store sales increased 1.2 percent, double analysts’ expectations of a 0.6 percent rise. On that basis, pharmacy sales increased 4.2 percent, helped by more flu cases, but general merchandise fell 6.1 percent.

235,CVS,CVS to expand pharmacy business with $10.1 billion Omnicare buy,"(Reuters) - Drugstore operator CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) said Thursday it will spend $10.1 billion to buy Omnicare Inc OCR.N, a company that supplies prescription medicines to nursing, assisted living and other healthcare facilities. The move gives CVS, the second-largest U.S. drugstore operator, access to the older, sicker U.S. population and builds on its specialty pharmacy, which provides drugs to people with expensive chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. CVS said it expects the deal to add about 20 cents to adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The deal also includes debt of about $2.3 billion, the companies said.         The pharmaceutical sector has been consolidating as companies look to beef up and bargain for lower prices from both drug manufacturers and the three largest U.S. drug distributors.  “There’s a lot of purchasing scale. There’s a lot more volume. They could renegotiate their supply contracts given the volume,” said FBR analyst Steven Halper. In addition to its drugstore chain and mail-order sales, CVS is the second-largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States, securing pricing for big employers and government plans. CVS offered $98 per Omnicare share, representing a premium of 4 percent to the closing price Wednesday of Omnicare, the top U.S. provider of pharmacy services to the elderly. The offer is at a nearly 21 percent premium to Omnicare’s April 21 close, a day before Bloomberg reported that the company was exploring a sale. Shares of Omnicare,  rose 1.5 percent to $96 while CVS was up 2.8 percent at $104.08. Bloomberg first reported Wednesday that CVS was nearing a deal to buy Omnicare.  Speculation has mounted of more pharmacy-industry consolidation as others have tied up, and the field of companies involved in drug distribution, sales or management has shrunk. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) agreed to buy Catamaran Corp CTRX.O CCT.TO for about $12.8 billion in March. Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) bought pharmacy benefit manager EnvisionRx for about $2 billion in February. Last year, pharmacy Walgreen tied up with European pharmacy and drug distribution company Boots Alliance. CVS said it secured $13 billion in financing from Barclays for the deal, which is expected to close near the end of 2015.  Barclays and Evercore are CVS’s financial advisers, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Centerview Partners advised Omnicare. CVS’s legal adviser is Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, while White & Case LLP served as Omnicare’s legal counsel.

CVS said it expects the deal to add about 20 cents to adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The deal also includes debt of about $2.3 billion, the companies said. The pharmaceutical sector has been consolidating as companies look to beef up and bargain for lower prices from both drug manufacturers and the three largest U.S. drug distributors. “There’s a lot of purchasing scale. There’s a lot more volume. They could renegotiate their supply contracts given the volume,” said FBR analyst Steven Halper. In addition to its drugstore chain and mail-order sales, CVS is the second-largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States, securing pricing for big employers and government plans. CVS offered $98 per Omnicare share, representing a premium of 4 percent to the closing price Wednesday of Omnicare, the top U.S. provider of pharmacy services to the elderly. The offer is at a nearly 21 percent premium to Omnicare’s April 21 close, a day before Bloomberg reported that the company was exploring a sale. Shares of Omnicare,  rose 1.5 percent to $96 while CVS was up 2.8 percent at $104.08. Bloomberg first reported Wednesday that CVS was nearing a deal to buy Omnicare. Speculation has mounted of more pharmacy-industry consolidation as others have tied up, and the field of companies involved in drug distribution, sales or management has shrunk. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc agreed to buy Catamaran Corp  for about $12.8 billion in March. Rite Aid Corp bought pharmacy benefit manager EnvisionRx for about $2 billion in February. Last year, pharmacy Walgreen tied up with European pharmacy and drug distribution company Boots Alliance. CVS said it secured $13 billion in financing from Barclays for the deal, which is expected to close near the end of 2015. Barclays and Evercore are CVS’s financial advisers, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Centerview Partners advised Omnicare. CVS’s legal adviser is Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, while White & Case LLP served as Omnicare’s legal counsel.

The central bank’s officials believed it would be premature to raise rates next month even though most felt the economy was set to rebound from a dismal start to the year, according to minutes from their April policy meeting. However, data on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly more than expected last week, while growth in the manufacturing sector slowed for a second straight month during May. That was followed by data that showed home resales unexpectedly fell in April as tight inventories pushed prices higher. Still, the underlying trend in last week’s jobless claims suggested the jobs market was strengthening despite a sluggish economy. “There is a malaise in the market as investors re-adjust their expectations of a Fed hike,” said Andrew Barber, chief market strategist at Eagleview Capital in Delaware. “The consensus is probably for a tightening in September, though an increasing number of people think there will be no hike in 2015 as economic data remains weak.” At 10:13 a.m. ET (1413 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 4.51 points, or 0.02 percent, at 18,289.91, the S&P; 500 was up 2.76 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,128.61 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 7.37 points, or 0.15 percent, at 5,079.12. Eight of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the energy index rising 0.7 percent as oil prices rose for a second day. The Fed has kept interest rates at near zero for almost a decade, which has made funds cheaper and helped the stock market reach record highs. The S&P; 500 hit a record intraday high on Wednesday. The Dow, which had closed at record highs in the previous two sessions, was also briefly on track for another all-time high close.

The number of people aged between 55 and 64, commonly called baby boomers, having two or more chronic conditions that require medication grew 39.2 percent in the last decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest report. Baby Boomers surpassed all other age groups as the highest-cost medication users in 2014, according to a report from Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager. CVS offered $98 per Omnicare share, representing a premium of 4 percent to Omnicare’s closing price on Wednesday. The offer is at a nearly 21 percent premium to Omnicare’s April 21 close, the day before Bloomberg reported that the company was exploring a sale. Shares of Omnicare, the top U.S. provider of pharmacy services to the elderly, rose 1.2 percent to $95.75 in premarket trading. CVS’s stock was up 1.6 percent at $102.90 in light trading on Thursday. The deal comes at a time when pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy chain operators are consolidating to negotiate better prices with drugmakers. Rite Aid Corp bought pharmacy benefit manager EnvisionRx for about $2 billion in February, while health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc agreed to buy Catamaran Corp  for about $12.8 billion in March. “Both (CVS and Omnicare) are big Part D players and there could be some scale benefits in negotiating with other payors,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee wrote in a note on Wednesday. Bloomberg first reported on Wednesday that CVS was nearing a deal to buy Omnicare. CVS said the deal will also help expand its presence in the rapidly growing specialty pharmacy business, which sells high-cost drugs to treat complex or rare conditions. CVS said it expects the deal to add about 20 cents to adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The deal values Omnicare at about $12.7 billion, including debt of about $2.3 billion, the companies said.

While the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly more than expected last week, the four-week moving average was the lowest since April 2000, continuing to suggest the labor market was tightening. That gives weight to the opinion of most central bank officials who agreed that economic growth would climb to a healthier pace and the labor market would strengthen, according to minutes from the Fed’s April 28-29 meeting. Fed officials believed it would be premature to raise rates in June, even though most felt the U.S. economy was set to rebound from a dismal start to the year. Data measuring the growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector in May is due at 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT) and 15 minutes later the National Association of Realtors data is expected to show that sales of used homes increased last month. “There is a malaise in the market as investors re-adjust their expectations of a Fed hike,” said Andrew Barber, chief market strategist at Eagleview Capital in Delaware.

242,CVS,CVS-Target deal could spur supermarkets to find pharmacy partners,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp’s (TGT.N) sale of its in-store pharmacies to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) may encourage large supermarket chains with struggling pharmacies to look for professional drug store partners of their own. More than 1,660 Target pharmacies will become CVS units in the $1.9 billion deal, the first time a drugstore chain has expanded its pharmacy business within a third party retail store, pharmacy consultants and analysts said. Drug stores in recent years have focused on opening new stores, an effort which has slowed recently. Target pharmacies helped drive overall sales at the chain but lost money, as the government health care program known as Obamacare expanded ranks of insured and increased pressure on costs. “Grocery store chains must be taking the news today and thinking hard about it. Pharmacy is not really a core competence,” said Todd Huseby, partner, AT Kearney said, citing Safeway and Albertsons as two companies that might consider it. Neither responded to a request for comment. Some supermarkets may have the scale and buying power to make their own pharmacies work, said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle. They may see the store-in-store format as an opening for a competitor, he said. However, margins are eroding, said Adam Fein, president of advisory and research firm Pembroke Consulting.  “The future of pharmacy is really about being a low cost buyer of generic drugs and capability to dispense specialty drugs and that is an area of challenge for several supermarket operators,” he said. Supermarkets with pharmacies such as Kroger (KR.N), Safeway and Stop & Shop saw a 0.6 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled, but a 0.17 percent decline in prescription market share in 2014 from a year earlier, data from Fein’s blog Drug Channels showed. Last year, prescriptions filled at chain drugstores like CVS, Walgreens WBA.N, Rite Aid (RAD.N) rose 5.1 percent, with 1.41 percent growth in prescription market share, while mass merchant chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) increased market share by 0.32 percent. Wal-Mart’s health and wellness business has been performing very well, and it sees no need to have pharmacies handled by another company, spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said. Drug store chains could look to stores-in-stores as a way to get “immediate access to new markets at a much lower cost,” than building their own stores, said Tom Charland, chief executive at consulting firm Merchant Medicine.

CVS, the second-largest U.S. drugstore operator with 7,800 stores, said on Monday it will acquire Target’s more than 1,660 pharmacies in 47 states with about $4 billion in annual sales. It will also acquire Target’s nearly 80 clinics. The pharmacies will continue to be located within Target stores but carry the CVS brand. The move was the CVS’ second large acquisition in as many months, coming on the heels of its $10.1 billion deal for healthcare services firm Omnicare Inc in May. The transaction will significantly expand the drugstore chain’s retail presence and should bolster its bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies. “The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly,” CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call. “In this environment, success is all about effectively managing costs, quality and access.” For Target, the deal divests a business that was “modestly negative” in terms of profits. While Target will lose revenue, its sales, general and administrative costs will drop by $1 billion. Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said the move fits with the company’s focus on a handful of categories where it believes it can be most competitive including apparel, items for children and health and wellness-related goods. Target will continue to handle the sale of over-the-counter drugs. Cornell, who has been remaking the retailer’s strategy since taking the helm in August, said the deal will allow it to focus resources on reviving its food business, for instance. He also said it should bring more customers into Target stores. The companies hope CVS’ price advantages, including in generic drugs, will attract more customers to the pharmacies who then buy other items from Target. “They bring scale, cost efficiency; they bring expertise that we just could not bring to a space that we were operating as a subscale player,” Cornell said of CVS. CVS shares were up 0.7 percent at $102.88, while Target shares rose 1.3 percent to $80.51 in morning trading. The two companies said the 80 Target clinics will be rebranded as MinuteClinics, as will the 20 additional clinics they plan to open within three years of the deal closing, expected near the end of 2015.. Target and CVS also said they plan to co-develop five to 10 small-format stores, potentially accelerating Target’s strategy of finding growth through smaller outlets in urban areas. The deal will also affect both companies’ plans for share buybacks. Target said it would likely use some of the expected $1.2 billion in after-tax proceeds for shares repurchases. It doubled its share buyback program to $10 billion last week. In contrast, CVS cut its 2015 share repurchase program by $1 billion to $5 billion as a result of the transaction, which it will finance with debt. The move adds to the strain on its finances, already under pressure from the Omnicare deal. CVS’ reduced buyback target led it to lower its 2015 and 2016 adjusted earnings forecast. Barclays is CVS’ financial adviser, while Target’s is Goldman Sachs. CVS’ legal adviser is Fried Frank and regulatory adviser is Dechert LLP.

251,CVS,"Wall Street moves lower on Apple, interest rate worries","(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday for a third straight session as investors worried about a rise in interest rates while Apple’s shares hit their lowest in over six months. The iPhone maker’s shares fell 3.21 percent to $114.64, firmly below their 200-day daily moving average, a key technical level closely watched by traders. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes. A slowdown in China and skepticism over demand for iPhones were contributing to pressure on Apple’s shares, traders said. “Apple has been the weak sister in the market today,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist and director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. “But if you look at the sectors, most everything is down with the exception of materials.”  Stocks extended losses after Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart told the Wall Street Journal that September may be the right time for Fed to lift interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 0.27 percent to end at 17,550.69 and the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.22 percent to 2,093.32. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.19 percent finish at 5,105.55. Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors fell, with the utilities index’s .SPLRCU 1.64 percent decline leading the losers.  The Fed has said it needs to see a sustained economic recovery before it raises interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Soft economic data had prompted some investors to argue that the Fed might hold off on raising rates until December. After the Fed meeting last week, investors expected a rate increase in September. “The market is getting such a mixed bag of rhetoric from the Fed, it seems like the Fed isn’t sure what it’s going to do,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. After the bell, shares of crafts website Etsy (ETSY.O) fell 9 percent and Walt Disney (DIS.N) lost 1.4 percent after the companies posted quarterly results that disappointed Wall Street. First Solar (FSLR.O) posted better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance and its stock was up 10 percent. During the session, American International Group (AIG.N) fell 2.82 percent after the insurer’s underwriting income fell in almost all of its units, while home and auto insurer Allstate (ALL.N) fell 10.15 percent after its profit missed expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1.23 to 1. On the Nasdaq, 1,414 issues fell and 1,376 advanced for a 1.03-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 32 new 52-week highs and 26 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 91 new highs and 127 new lows.  Some 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the five-day average of 7.0 billion this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

257,CVS,"UPDATE 1-CVS strips Viagra, other top drugs, from insurance coverage","(Adds J&J; comment) By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot Aug 5 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, which operates the nation’s second-biggest pharmacy benefit manager, said that next year it will exclude an additional 31 prescription medicines from insurance coverage, including Viagra and widely used treatments for diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The 2016 excluded drugs, disclosed on Wednesday, also include Vivus Inc’s weight loss treatment Qsymia, which last week was excluded from the 2016 formulary of rival PBM Express Scripts Holding Co. Vivus officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and also run large mail-order pharmacies, have been challenging the rising cost of new medications. When drugs are knocked off their formularies, patients may have to pay full price for them. PBMs often keep or dump a product depending on whether they can obtain favorable pricing. Viagra, the world’s first approved pill for erectile dysfunction, has annual sales of $1.8 billion, including $1.3 billion in the United States. Cheaper generic versions are expected to be launched by December 2017. “Pfizer is committed to ensuring patient access to our medicines,” the drugmaker said in an emailed statement. The CVS formulary, however, does include Eli Lilly and Co’s  rival Cialis anti-impotence treatment. Next year’s formulary will also exclude two interferon-based multiple sclerosis treatments from Biogen, big-selling Avonex and its new longer-acting Plegridy. Avonex, Biogen’s second-biggest product, has annual sales of almost $2.5 billion. “Avonex and Plegridy have broad insurance coverage,” Biogen said in an emailed statement. “We are confident that patients will continue to have access to our medicines.” Johnson & Johnson’s two-year-old diabetes treatment, Invokana, and a related combination treatment called Invokamet, will also be stripped from CVS coverage. Combined sales of the medicines have been growing by leaps and bounds, reaching $318 million in the second quarter. “We are disappointed in this decision because it affects patients who are currently taking Invokana and are experiencing success with it,” J&J; said in a statement. “Despite this decision, Invokana will continue to have broad access for patients with Medicare with more than 70 percent preferred access for patients with private insurance and more than 90 percent preferred access for patients with Medicare, Part D coverage.” Another diabetes drug to be excluded from the CVS formulary is Bydureon, a once-weekly treatment from AstraZeneca Plc . CVS will favor instead similar treatments from Lilly and Novo Nordisk. “Bydureon continues to have excellent access across commercial and non-commercial plans, including (Medicare) Part D,” AstraZeneca said.

260,CVS,CVS: 'all bets are off' for new cholesterol drug contracts,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, the No 2 manager of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers, will wait until a second new cholesterol-lowering drug is approved by regulators before negotiating for price discounts or adding either of the much pricer new drugs to its list of covered medications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s  Praluent, which works by blocking a protein called PCSK9 that helps “bad” LDL cholesterol stay in the bloodstream. An FDA decision on a second PCSK9 inhibitor, Amgen Inc’s Repatha, is expected later this month. CVS and other pharmacy benefit managers are concerned about the cost of the PCSK9s compared to older cholesterol fighters such as statins, which are available as generics for less than $50 a month. Praluent, given by injection, has a list price of almost $15,000 a year. “It’s smart to wait and see what the competitor medication looks like in terms of what the FDA label is,” Dr Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS, told Reuters, referring to the type of patients who should be given the drug. Brennan added that “all bets are off” in negotiations between CVS and the PCSK9 drugmakers in terms of which, if either, of the drugs would be added to its formulary, or list of covered medications. Currently, doctors seeking to prescribe Praluent have to go through a “formulary exception process,” to secure CVS coverage. Brennan said an exclusive agreement for one of the new drugs would be “a tried and true method” for obtaining the best pricing, but CVS could have deals to place both drugs on its formulary. He said CVS will institute a “utilization management program,” taking into account issues such as patient history of heart disease or diabetes, as well as overall risk for cardiovascular disease. “We expect patients to first use statins,” Brennan said. “If they can’t use statins, or can’t make (LDL) targets, then they would use PCSK9 inhibitors.” CVS estimates that about 73 million Americans have elevated cholesterol. Brennan forecast that less than 1 percent of current statin users will be switched to PCSK9s in the first year they are on the market. “That could change as new data comes in on outcome measures,” he said. Brennan said Praluent will first be used by the small number of people who are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol. “For those patients, the use of this drug is less expensive than the drugs they were on,” he said.

262,CVS,CVS says its ban on cigarette sales has reduced smoking,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp said on Thursday its decision to stop selling tobacco products last year led to a 1 percent decrease in cigarette sales in some states where the drugstore chain has a sizeable presence. The September 2014 decision hurt sales, with general merchandise revenue at CVS pharmacies open at least a year falling 7.8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the company said. However, CVS said it benefited in others ways. In the eight months since the decision, nicotine patch purchases rose 4 percent from a year earlier in the 26 states where it had a market share of 15 percent or greater. The company also said the average number of visits to its retail clinics for smoking cessation counseling nearly doubled. The 1 percent reduction in sales of cigarette packs occurred in 13 of the states where CVS’s market share was at least 15 percent. The company said the decline equated to the average smoker in those states buying five fewer packs of cigarettes, or a total of 95 million. The company estimated it held 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the U.S. tobacco market before it stopped selling the products, which accounted for about $2 billion in annual sales. For the analysis, CVS said it compared cigarette pack purchases in markets where it had a presence with those where it did not. Researchers looked at sales in drug, food, big box, dollar, convenience and gas station retailers. Chief Medical Officer Troyen Brennan said many people thought that smokers would go elsewhere to buy cigarettes once the chain stopped selling them.  “The data shows that our decision to not sell cigarettes did have an impact,” he said. CVS has 7,800 retail pharmacies and is the second-largest manager of prescription-drug benefits in the United States.

264,CVS,CVS Health in $48 million settlement of lawsuit over hiding loss,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp reached a $48 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing the U.S. drugstore operator of fraudulently concealing a big loss of revenue in its pharmacy benefits manager business, culminating in a plunge in its stock price. The all-cash settlement with investors led by three Massachusetts public pension funds was disclosed in a Monday filing with the federal court in Providence, Rhode Island. CVS’ share price tumbled 20.1 percent on Nov. 5, 2009, after the company, then known as CVS Caremark, revealed the loss of contracts representing about $4.5 billion of annual revenue. Shareholders said this disclosure blindsided them, after CVS officials had repeatedly assured them that the company was doing an excellent job integrating the former Caremark Rx Inc and retaining clients. CVS bought Caremark in March 2007 and changed its name to CVS Health last September. The settlement requires court approval and awaits class-action certification for shareholders from Oct. 30, 2008, to Nov. 4, 2009. CVS denied wrongdoing. CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said the payment will be covered by insurance and that the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company settled to avoid the “burden, uncertainty and expense of continuing litigation.” In April 2014, CVS agreed to pay $20 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges related to the PBM business, and its accounting for an unrelated acquisition. The $48 million is just 1 percent of CVS’ annual profit, but the plaintiffs’ lawyers in court papers called the accord “a very good recovery,” given the risks of continued litigation. They estimated the sum at 5.33 percent of the potential $900 million of “recoverable damages” in the litigation. The lead plaintiffs are the City of Brockton Retirement System, Norfolk County Retirement System and Plymouth County Retirement System. Their lawyers, led by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Labaton Sucharow, plan to seek legal fees of up to 30 percent of the settlement amount, court papers show.

269,CVS,"CVS, Express Scripts drop Valeant's Philidor; stock dives","(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc. sustained hits on several fronts on Thursday after CVS Health Corp and Express Scripts dropped Philidor from their networks in a sign the fallout from the drugmaker’s connection with the specialty pharmacy is spreading. The moves by the nation’s two largest pharmacy benefit managers whacked Valeant shares before the market close, and pushed them 10 percent lower to $99 after hours. After coming under pressure this summer, Valeant’s stock plunged last week after short-seller Citron Research said that the company was using its drug distributor, Philidor Rx, to inflate revenue numbers. About a dozen Valeant officials held a conference call on Monday to address the accusations, which helped ease pressure on the company’s stock. Valeant said it properly accounts for sales through its pharmacy partners and only books revenue once one of its medicines reaches a patient. Valeant’s stock recovered throughout the week than sank on the CVS and Express Scripts news. CVS, late on Thursday, said its Caremark program was dropping Philidor. CVS took the step following an audit of Philidor, citing “noncompliance” with its provider agreement, the company said. Shortly after the market close, Express Scripts said it too was ending its ties to Philidor.   CVS did not explain the “noncompliance” further when contacted by Reuters. Bloomberg on Thursday said Philidor has altered doctors’ orders to wring more payment out of insurers, according to former employees and an internal document, which details how to proceed with a prescription for certain Valeant drugs after they have been rejected. “Valeant’s drugs are provided to patients through many channels, including traditional retail pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, and directly from health care providers,” said Valeant Spokeswoman Laurie Little in an emailed statement.  Philidor declined to comment on Thursday.   CVS and Express Scripts Holdings manage most of the prescriptions filled under health plans run by the nation’s largest insurers. Express Scripts manages prescription benefits for 85 million people.  The move by CVS and Express Scripts will have a direct impact on Valeant, though Philidor accounts for a small portion of the Canadian company’s revenues. In Valeant’s detailed presentation on Monday that spelled out its dealings with Philidor, the company said that the pharmacy accounted for about 5.9 percent of its total sales so far this year. The stock was trading as high as $260 per share in August. The next month, U.S. Democratic politicians singled out Valeant for hiking drug prices on consumers, and a federal subpoena followed. With the stock under pressure, the Citron report last Wednesday sent it into a tailspin. The CVS announcement came after mutual fund manager Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc., sent a letter to its own investors about the Valeant saga. The Sequoia Fund, which the mutual fund manages, owns 9.93 percent of Valeant and is the company’s largest shareholder. While the letter is largely a defense of Valeant’s practices, it says that the company needs to move faster with paying down its debt. It also points out that Valeant’s aggressive business practices have “pushed boundaries,” and that the company needs to better manage its image. “We would stress the importance of taking a more systemic approach to managing business practices with an eye on the company’s long-term corporate reputation,” said the letter dated Oct. 28 and signed by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb President Robert Goldfarb and Executive Vice President David Poppe. Separately, two of the five independent directors of the Sequoia Fund resigned over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing the board’s chairman. A person who answered the phone at Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb said the chairman, Roger Lowenstein, could not be reached. Valeant’s abrupt slide from a hedge fund darling to a drug company under fire has weighed heavily on two of the best known U.S. activist funds: ValueAct Partners and Pershing Square. ValueAct has been an investor in Valeant since 2006, and played a significant role in instituting the company’s strategy and its current CEO, Michael Pearson. Pearson took over in 2008 and built Valeant into a more than $40 billion company with over 100 transactions. ValueAct, with $19 billion under management, now has two directors on the company’s board, and was the fourth largest shareholder as of June 30. William Ackman’s Pershing Square, Valeant’s third-largest shareholder, has scheduled a call on Friday at 9 am EDT to address the drug company’s issues. Pershing owned 5.7 percent of Valeant as of June 30, and faced a paper loss of more than $800 million at one point last week.

The drugstore operator’s profit missed analysts’ estimates for the first time in six quarters, as its $10-billion Omnicare acquisition failed to offset pressure from lower reimbursement rates and new low-margin generic drugs. CVS shares were down 4.6 percent at $98.98 in heavy trading on Friday, among the top decliners on the S&P; 500 .SPX. They fell as much as 7 percent earlier. The weak forecast from CVS, the No.2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, comes in the same week that larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said it would buy No.3 Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $9.4 billion. CVS forecast 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.68-$5.88 per share, including a $4 billion stock buyback plan and a 6 cents per share impact related to the acquisition of Target’s (TGT.N) pharmacies in June. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $6.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “While no one can complain about a $100 billion behemoth growing EPS 10-14 percent in a challenging environment, expects were clearly somewhat higher given the M&A; activity in 2015,” Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note. CVS said sales at its drugstores were hurt in the third quarter by the introduction of low-margin generic drugs, lower reimbursement rates and its move to stop selling tobacco products last year. “Reimbursement pressure has not changed but ... Medicare and Medicaid are big areas of growth in this (PBM) business. And they carry a lower margin rate,” Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call. Rising generic drug prices are hurting drugstore operators as insurers and PBMs have been slow in raising reimbursement rates for those drugs. Margins in CVS’s PBM business, which accounted for 66 percent of net revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30, fell 45 basis points. Net income attributable to CVS rose 31.4 percent to $1.25 billion, or $1.11 per share. Excluding items, it earned $1.28 per share. Net revenue rose 10.3 percent to $38.64 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.29 per share on revenue of $37.89 billion.

287,CVS,CVS Health forecasts first-quarter profit below estimates,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the No.2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, forecast current-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates as customer traffic to its retail stores slows. Shares of the company, which sells items such as personal care products, over-the-counter drugs and snacks at its retail stores, fell 2.4 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday. CVS’s comparable sales at these stores declined 5 percent in 2015, which the company attributed to its decision to discontinue sales of tobacco products.  Research firm Conlumino’s Chief Executive Neil Saunders, however, said the argument now held much less weight and CVS’s “front of house offer simply isn’t compelling or engaging enough.” “...Over a holiday period in which sales of beauty and personal care products were robust, CVS is losing ground and losing share,” Saunders said.  Comparable sales in CVS’s pharmacy benefits management business rose 4.5 percent in 2015. The company forecast an adjusted profit of $1.14-$1.17 per share for the first quarter, below the average analyst estimate of $1.18, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

288,CVS,UPDATE 2-CVS Health forecasts 1st-qtr profit below estimates,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the No.2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, forecast current-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates as customer traffic to its retail stores slows. Shares of the company, which sells items such as personal care products, over-the-counter drugs and snacks at its retail stores, fell 2.4 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday. CVS’s comparable sales at these stores declined 5 percent in 2015, which the company attributed to its decision to discontinue sales of tobacco products.  Research firm Conlumino’s Chief Executive Neil Saunders, however, said the argument now held much less weight and CVS’s “front of house offer simply isn’t compelling or engaging enough.” “...Over a holiday period in which sales of beauty and personal care products were robust, CVS is losing ground and losing share,” Saunders said.  Comparable sales in CVS’s pharmacy benefits management business rose 4.5 percent in 2015. The company forecast an adjusted profit of $1.14-$1.17 per share for the first quarter, below the average analyst estimate of $1.18, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The net income attributable to CVS rose 13.4 percent to $1.50 billion, or $1.34 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

290,CVS,"CORRECTED-CVS says 2015 drug spending grew 5 percent, far less than in 2014","NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) said on Tuesday its pharmacy benefit customers spent about 5 percent more on prescription drugs in 2015 than in 2014, a year when drug spending jumped nearly 12 percent. The No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain attributed the lower increase to careful management of its coverage plans, saying it negotiated with pharmaceutical makers for rebates and discounts and had more selective coverage that excluded pricey drugs. It also said fewer new high-priced specialty drugs hit the market in 2015 and that inflation in branded drugs for high volume disorders like diabetes had one of the biggest impacts on spending. Drug spending in 2014 was boosted in part by a pricey new hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences (GILD.O), CVS said. In 2015, AbbVie Inc’s ABBV.O competing product hit the market and is estimated to have nearly halved the price of Gilead’s treatment. CVS competes against Express Scripts Holding Corp (ESRX.O) and Optum, a unit of UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N). Express Scripts also is expected to release a detailed drug spending report for 2015.  CVS Chief Medical Officer Troyen Brennan said that the 2015 overall drug price trend would have been nearly the same as in 2014 if it had not made changes to its main coverage plan, called a formulary, or negotiated such steep discounts. Drug companies have a list price but typically provide discounts and rebates to large buyers. One drug Brennan called out as particularly pricey was Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ (VRX.N) Jublia, a toenail fungus treatment whose cost trend for customers rose 950 percent during the year, reflecting a combination of increased use and price. A cheaper oral medication that has better clinical results is preferred, he said. Valeant has been criticized for raising prices of its treatments sharply and for using a pharmacy that used aggressive tactics to push sales of its drugs. (This version of the story corrects eighth paragraph to show Jublia increase was utilization and price, not price alone) ",2232016,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvs-health-pricing/corrected-cvs-says-2015-drug-spending-grew-5-percent-far-less-than-in-2014-idUSL2N1611PM

Jana said last month TeamHealth would benefit from new directors, after disclosing an 8 percent stake. TeamHealth said it added Edwin Crawford, former chairman of pharmacy benefits manager CVS Caremark Corp, and Scott Ostfeld, a partner at Jana, to its board, increasing its size to 12 directors. The company said Nancy Schlichting, CEO of healthcare provider Henry Ford Health Systems, will be appointed as a director in January 2017. TeamHealth said it would also reduce the size of the board by one director each year over the next three years, beginning at the 2016 shareholder meeting. The company rejected a $5.3 billion takeover offer from AmSurg Corp last year and, instead, bought IPC Healthcare Inc for $1.4 billion.

292,CVS,Walgreens' Wall Street edge fades against rival CVS as earnings near,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - For much of the last three years, investors have been willing to pay more for expected profit at Walgreens than for competitor CVS, but the pharmacy chain may be losing that edge on Wall Street. Analysts are now putting much more favorable ratings on CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), and CVS shares are outrunning Walgreens so far this year and closing the valuation gap. When Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) reports fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday, it could win converts. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.28 per share, up 8 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken rates both stocks as “buys,” but said that most investors choose between the companies, with Walgreens now representing a higher-risk, higher-reward play, and CVS the lower-risk stock as Walgreens undergoes changes under a new CEO.  Perhaps reflecting the view that CVS is a safer bet, a greater portion of analysts are recommending its shares, with 85 percent placing “buy” or “strong buy” ratings on the stock against 58 percent for Walgreen, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Walgreens shares are trading at 18 times forward earnings estimates compared with 17.4 times for CVS. But that gap has been wider for most of the past year. With a market cap of about $93 billion, Walgreens has established itself as a massive international retailer and distributor after completing the acquisition of Europe’s Alliance Boots more than a year ago. That company’s former executive chairman, Stefano Pessina, was named to head Walgreens on a permanent basis last July. Well-regarded by investors, Pessina has been leading changes that include significant cost cutting, according to analysts. Meanwhile, uncertainty clouds Walgreens’ latest big deal - its proposed $9.4 billion acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), which would expand its U.S. drugstore footprint but faces antitrust scrutiny. Seattle-based Smead Capital Management holds more than 860,000 Walgreens shares and views the company as a “best in class player” in operating pharmacy outlets and convenience stores, said Tony Scherrer, Smead’s director of research. CVS has also been on the acquisition path, with recent deals for pharmacy services provider Omnicare and Target Corp’s (TGT.N) fleet of pharmacies. CVS, with a market cap of about $115 billion, is one of the biggest U.S. managers of prescription benefits - a business in which Walgreens lacks a comparable big presence - in addition to being the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by sales behind Walgreens, according to Euromonitor. That pharmacy benefits business, which has been increasing revenue at a faster pace than the pharmacy side, gives CVS an edge, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds in Rye, New York, who prefers CVS shares to Walgreens.  CVS should also merit a higher stock market value, he said, because deals in the pharmacy benefits, or PBM, industry have been struck at higher premiums than for drug-store mergers. “I just think with the PBM in particular, (CVS is) going to have a much better growth rate in both revenue and earnings,” Jonas said.

298,CVS,"Drugstore operator CVS's revenue, profit beat estimates","(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by strong demand for its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. Revenue in CVS’s PBM business rose 20.5 percent to $28.8 billion in first quarter ended March 31, with the growth being boosted by pharmacy network claim volume and demand for specialty pharmacy services. CVS boosted its specialty pharmacy business, which provides drugs to people with expensive chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, with its $10.1 billion acquisition of Omnicare Inc in August 2015. Sales at established CVS stores rose 4.2 percent in the quarter, with front-end same-store sales increasing 0.7 percent, after almost three years of decline. The company’s net income fell to $1.15 billion, or $1.04 per share, from $1.22 billion, or $1.07 per share, due to higher interest expenses and acquisition costs. Excluding items, CVS earned $1.18 per share, beating analysts average estimate of $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose 19 percent to $43.22 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $43 billion. However, the company second-quarter adjusted earnings forecast of $1.28-$1.31 per share was below analysts average estimate of $1.35 per share.

300,CVS,"UPDATE 5-Allergan profit beats estimates, share buybacks planned","(Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N), whose $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) collapsed last month, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would buy back up to $10 billion in company stock, helping lift its shares 4 percent. The Dublin drugmaker on Tuesday said the planned $40 billion sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) will close next month and that it will use $8 billion of the money to pay down company debt.  Since the U.S. government torpedoed the merger, a deal that would have relocated Pfizer’s legal domicile to Ireland to reduce Pfizer’s taxes, investors have speculated Allergan might use the Teva proceeds for sizeable new deals. However, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, in a conference call with industry analysts, said he was more interested for now in “stepping stone deals” valued at up to a few billion dollars meant to bolster the company’s existing disease areas. Allergan, known as Actavis Inc until it bought Botox-maker Allergan Inc last year and took on its name, said it expects to buy back $4 billion to $5 billion of its shares over the next four to six months and would consider more stock repurchases if  market conditions allow. The company’s market value is currently $84.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding special items, the company earned $3.04 per share in the first quarter, topping the average analysts’ estimate of $3.01 largely because of lower than expected research spending. Up to Monday’s close of $213.71, Allergan’s stock had fallen about 23 percent since Pfizer scrapped the merger, which would have been the biggest-ever in the pharmaceutical industry. The deal collapsed after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules curbing tax inversions, or moves by American companies to relocate their domicile overseas to cut taxes. “With this highly controversial quarter now in the rear view mirror, we see an attractive setup in Allergan shares going forward based on a combination of attractive valuation, ongoing healthy organic growth and significant capital deployment optionality,” said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott. Revenue in its U.S. brands business, including Botox, rose 27.3 percent to $2.30 billion. The unit accounts for about 60 percent of the company’s total revenue. The company reported net income of $186.1 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with a loss of $535.2 million, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue rose 48 percent to $3.80 billion, below Wall Street’s expectations of $3.95 billion. Revenue fell in the company’s generic distribution unit, which lost business from Target Corp’s (TGT.N) in-store pharmacies after they were acquired by CVS Health (CVS.N).

302,CVS,"UPDATE 4-Target shares plunge after sales, outlook disappoint","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Retail chain Target Corp (TGT.N) gave a cautious outlook on Wednesday after reporting a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales due to unseasonable weather and weaker demand for electronics and groceries.  Shares of the company fell as much as 11 percent, their biggest intraday decline since December 2008, as investors focused on weaker revenues and a poor outlook despite higher-than-expected earnings.  Target’s woes also encouraged investors to sell shares of rival retailers like Macy’s M.N., JC Penney (JCP.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Wednesday. Wal-Mart is due to report quarterly results on Thursday. Target is the latest traditional brick-and-mortar chain to report disappointing sales as traditional chain stores spend more at online merchants like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and as slowly rising wages enable consumers to spend more on big-ticket purchases like cars and home improvements. “We’re approaching our business with appropriate caution as sales trends at Target and many of our key competitors (have) weakened,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a conference call. He said he expected price discounting to intensify as retailers try to shed excess inventory after a slow season.  Target said apparel sales rose during the quarter and were stronger than other retailers’, but unseasonable weather hurt demand. In addition, the company’s grocery division suffered from a reorganization that increased organic and fresh food offerings but made it harder for customers to find products.  The sixth-largest U.S. retailer said customers made larger “pantry-stocking visits,” but growth in smaller “convenience trips” slowed, highlighting a new challenge for chains like Target that have bet on small format-stores for future growth. Target said sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent in the first quarter ended on April 30, missing market expectations for a 1.6 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  Net sales fell 5.4 percent to $16.2 billion, mainly due to the sale of the pharmacy and clinic business to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). Analysts on average had forecast $16.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Digital sales increased 23 percent, compared with a year-earlier rise of 38 percent, and accounted for 3.5 percent of the company’s total.  Target said second-quarter comparable sales would be flat to down 2 percent even though it was confident that it would meet its earnings outlook of $1.00 to $1.20 per share before special items.  Analysts blamed the first-quarter performance on short-term weakness in the sector and expressed confidence about Target’s growth prospects and Cornell’s turnaround strategy.  Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm Conlumino, said the comparable sales were not “spectacular” but nonetheless were “a testament to Target’s relative strength” because they remained in positive territory.    Net income fell to $632 million from $635 million a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and gains from the CVS deal, earnings were $1.29 per share, better than analysts expectations of $1.20 per share.

308,CVS,Walgreens U.S. retail sales rise less than expected,"(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O), the No.1 U.S. drugstore operator by store count, reported a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales, hurt by weak demand for over-the-counter drugs and other products. The company’s shares fell as much as 3.5 percent on Wednesday. Walgreens has been investing to revive U.S. retail sales, or front-end sales, mainly by sprucing up its beauty business, which is a big traffic driver. It is rolling out a revamped beauty division to more than 1,800 stores by end of 2016. However, comparable sales in the business were underwhelming in the latest third quarter, rising just 0.1 percent, after two quarters of declines. Analysts were expecting U.S. retail sales, which accounts for roughly a third of total U.S. sales, to increase 0.7 percent, according to Evercore ISI. The rest of Walgreens’ U.S. sales comes from its pharmacy business, where comparable sales rose 6 percent due to a jump in prescriptions filled for Medicare Part D drugs. Total net sales rose 2.4 percent to $29.5 billion, missing analysts average estimate of $29.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, Walgreens’ profit of $1.18 per share beat analysts average estimate of $1.14. Walgreens said its acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) was on track to close later this year and that it was looking for buyers for the stores it needed to divest to get regulatory clearance. Rite Aid’s shares rose 2 percent. “While USA Retail is facing some pressure, we believe that the RAD deal will cause sentiment in USA Retail to shift positively once integration efforts begin,” Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen wrote in a note. Walgreens also said it was bracing for a long period of volatility following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union. The company’s revenue from UK, about 9 percent of sales last fiscal, could be a cause for concern, especially with the pound falling about 13 percent against the dollar since the vote on June 23. “The situation is very volatile at this time. For sure, the period of uncertainty will be quite long,” Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said. The depreciation of the pound would hit Walgreens’ sales in the near term and more than offset any sales gains in local currency terms, said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino. Still, the company bumped up the lower end of its fiscal 2016 profit forecast – to $4.45-$4.55 per share from $4.35-$4.55.

Excluding items, Walgreens’ profit of $1.18 per share beat analysts average estimate of $1.14. Walgreens said its acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) was on track to close later this year and that it was looking for buyers for the stores it needed to divest to get regulatory clearance. Rite Aid’s shares rose 2 percent. “While USA Retail is facing some pressure, we believe that the RAD deal will cause sentiment in USA Retail to shift positively once integration efforts begin,” Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen wrote in a note. Walgreens also said it was bracing for a long period of volatility following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union. The company’s revenue from UK, about 9 percent of sales last fiscal, could be a cause for concern, especially with the pound falling about 13 percent against the dollar since the vote on June 23. “The situation is very volatile at this time. For sure, the period of uncertainty will be quite long,” Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said. The depreciation of the pound would hit Walgreens’ sales in the near term and more than offset any sales gains in local currency terms, said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino. Still, the company bumped up the lower end of its fiscal 2016 profit forecast – to $4.45-$4.55 per share from $4.35-$4.55.

312,CVS,CVS Health's profit beats estimates on pharma business strength,"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) reported a better-than-expected profit, helped by strong demand for its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast. Shares of the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, rose 3 percent to $96.30 in premarket trading on Tuesday. Revenue in CVS’s pharmacy business rose 20.7 percent to $5.1 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, due to increased pharmacy network claim volume and growth in specialty pharmacy. CVS boosted its specialty pharmacy business, which provides drugs to people with expensive chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, with its $10.1 billion acquisition of Omnicare Inc in August 2015. “We see 2017 shaping up to be another very successful PBM selling season, with substantial gross and net new business to date,” Chief Executive Larry Merlo said. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company raised full-year adjusted earnings to $5.81-$5.89 per share, from $5.73-$5.88 it had expected earlier. Net income attributable to CVS Health fell 27.4 percent to $924 million in the second quarter. Excluding items, CVS earned $1.32 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.30 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, comparable front-end store sales, which include over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics, fell 2.5 percent in the quarter, due to lower customer traffic. CVS is not investing in its front-end operations, while rivals such as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) are stepping up the pace of innovation and investment, said Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino. Walgreens has been working to revive front-end sales, mainly by sprucing up its beauty business, which is a big traffic driver. It is rolling out a revamped beauty section at more than 1,800 stores by end of 2016. The company’s net revenue rose 17.6 percent to $43.73 billion, rising by double-digit percentages for the fourth straight quarter. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $44.28 billion.

316,CVS,Actelion does not see significant CVS hit to Opsumit sales,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Big U.S. pharmacy chain CVS Health’s move to jettison an Actelion drug from a list of covered medications is not expected to have a “meaningful impact” on the Swiss biotechnology company’s sales, a spokesman said on Wednesday. CVS on Tuesday released a list of more than 30 drugs it was removing from its 2017 standard formulary, including Actelion’s Opsumit for deadly pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Andrew Weiss, an Actelion spokesman, said CVS Health was merely continuing its current policy regarding Opsumit prescriptions. This would not stop doctors who believe patients should receive Opsumit from making special demands that they get it from stores within the CVS chain, Weiss said. Furthermore, just a fraction of U.S. PAH sufferers get medications through CVS, he said, adding that government-supported programs Medicaid and Medicare were more important when it comes to covering Opsumit. “We don’t expect the decision by CVS Health to have a meaningful impact on our business with Opsumit,” Weiss said. Actelion’s shares fell 1.2 percent by 1015 GMT. Analysts from Barclays also said they were not overly concerned, opting not to change their outlook for 24 percent growth in Opsumit sales from 2015 to 2018.  That is, in part, because they already expected Opsumit to face competition from generic PAH treatments likely to come onto the market later this year or early next, said analyst Olivia Capra. Opsumit, approved by U.S. regulators in 2013, is Actelion’s follow-on drug to Tracleer, which has lost patent protection. Opsumit made 378 million Swiss francs ($390.2 million) in sales in the first half of the year, up 76 percent. Actelion is banking on Opsumit and another newer PAH drug, Uptravi, to help offset falling Tracleer sales.

322,CVS,CVS must face revived lawsuit in U.S. over vitamin E label,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit accusing CVS Health Corp, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, of deceiving consumers with labels touting how CVS-branded vitamin E promotes “heart health.” The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said the plaintiff, Ronda Kaufman, can pursue a proposed class action accusing CVS of violating a New York consumer protection law, and that a lower court judge erred in dismissing her case. CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis said the company’s store-branded products are designed to be “safe, work as intended, comply with regulations and satisfy customers. We intend to continue vigorously defending against this complaint.” Kaufman, a New Yorker who bought CVS-branded vitamin E from a Long Island store, said scientific studies show that vitamin E offers no cardiovascular benefits, and that CVS misled her and other consumers who relied on contrary statements on its labels. CVS, based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, countered that the studies Kaufman relied on substantiated its health claims, and that the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act prevented her from suing under New York law. Writing for a three-judge panel, however, Circuit Judge William Kayatta said most of the studies tested whether vitamin E prevented disease, not whether it supported heart health, and that one said it could actually damage the heart. “The cited studies do not on their face render implausible the allegation that CVS lacks substantiation that the ‘heart health’ and ‘supports heart health’ statements are truthful and not misleading descriptions of the function of vitamin E supplements in humans,” Kayatta wrote. Tuesday’s decision did not address the merits of the lawsuit, which was returned to U.S. District Judge Mary Lisi in Providence, Rhode Island. Kaufman had sued CVS in May 2014, seeking actual and punitive damages plus an injunction against improper labeling.

Mylan, which has been lambasted by consumers and lawmakers for raising EpiPen prices six-fold in less than a decade, said last month it would start selling a generic version of EpiPen for $300 per two-pack, a more than 50 percent discount.

346,CVS,CVS defends PBM industry against drug price hikes,"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) defended the industry on Thursday, saying any suggestion that PBMs are causing drug prices to rise was “simply erroneous”. Drug pricing has become a hot topic of discussion among lawmakers in the past few years with several drugmakers under federal investigations, and pharma supply chain members, such as PBMs are also facing the backlash. CVS’s growth in recent quarters has been fueled by strong demand for its PBM and specialty pharmacy businesses, which provide drugs to people with expensive chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. “We are the solution and not the problem,” CVS’s Chief Executive Larry Merlo said, noting that numerous evaluations from government agencies have concluded that PBMs drive real savings to the healthcare sector. PBMs negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers. They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments. Merlo added both public and private health insurers continue to count on PBMs as “indispensable partners” that help manage their drug trends. Shares of the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, which posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue, fell as much as 2.34 percent to $75.23 in midday trade. We are believers in the PBM model, and CVS and Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O) both work to improve overall drug trends, Leerink analyst David Larsen said in a client note. Express Scripts, the largest PBM in the United States, will report its quarterly results next week. “Without the increased competition among manufacturers that the PBMs create, drug price inflation would be even higher than where it is now,” Larsen added. CVS, which confirmed its earnings and cash flow forecast for the full year and first quarter of 2017, lowered its full year PBM unit revenue growth forecast to 7.5-9.5 percent from 8.5-10.5 percent. Management indicated that branded drug price increases were lower than anticipated, driving some of the revisions, Larsen said. Excluding items, the company earned $1.71 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.67, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

354,CVS,"When CVS stopped selling cigarettes, some customers quit smoking","(Reuters Health) - - The retail pharmacy company CVS Health helped its customers quit smoking by pulling cigarettes off the shelves two years ago, a new study suggests. Smokers who purchased cigarettes exclusively at CVS stores were 38 percent less likely to buy tobacco after the national chain stopped selling cigarettes, the study shows.  In addition, cigarette sales dropped 1 percent - or by 95 million packs - in 13 states in the eight months after CVS left the tobacco market in September 2014, according to the report in the American Journal of Public Health. “It shows that responsible behavior by a pharmacy has public health benefits for the whole population,” Stanton Glantz said in a phone interview. He directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, and was not involved with the study. The results provide “very strong evidence” that removing tobacco from CVS’ more than 7,800 stores reduced smoking, Glantz said. “It was a big enough effect that you could see it in the population level, which is very impressive,” he said. The findings heartened Dr. Troyen Brennan, CVS Health’s chief medical officer and one of the study’s authors. “We think that this research definitely shows that if pharmacies didn’t sell cigarettes, fewer people would smoke, more people would live longer, and fewer people would die,” he said in a phone interview. Brennan and a team of CVS researchers analyzed data from a nationally representative survey of consumers’ cigarette purchases at drug, food, big box, dollar, convenience and gas station retailers prior to and one year following the company’s exit from the cigarette market. While they found that shoppers who purchased cigarettes exclusively from CVS were 38 percent more likely to stop buying cigarettes altogether, they could not conclude that those customers kicked the habit. The data shows they did not purchase cigarettes elsewhere, but it remained unclear whether they got cigarettes from another source, possibly a friend or relative, Brennan said. But states in which CVS pulled out of the tobacco market sold 0.14 fewer packs of cigarettes per smoker a month compared to other states, the study found. In 1970, the American Pharmaceutical Association declared cigarette displays to be in conflict with the public health role of pharmacies. The following year, the association recommended that pharmacies stop selling tobacco.  But until CVS quit the business, nationwide pharmacy chains had ignored the recommendation. “We know that tobacco kills 488,000 people a year in the U.S.,” Brennan said. “How can you sell that kind of thing when you’re supposed to be emphasizing health care?” Public health advocates have pressed Walgreens to also clear its shelves of cigarettes. But the pharmacy chain, one of the nation’s largest, has refused to leave the tobacco market. Asked to comment about the study, Walgreens provided a written statement. “We believe that the most effective step we can take to help smokers quit is to address the root causes of smoking, which go far beyond the small percentage of smokers who access this product at pharmacies,” it says. “We have made an active decision to reduce space and visibility of tobacco products in certain of our stores as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking,” the statement says. Robin Koval, CEO and president of Truth Initiative, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit dedicated to ending youth smoking, took Walgreens to task for failing to follow CVS’ lead and “missing a significant opportunity to serve their customers’ health and welfare.” The new study underscores the need for Walgreens to remove tobacco from its stores, Koval, who was not involved in the study, said in an email. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. One in four American adults use tobacco, and nearly 17 percent smoke cigarettes.  The vast majority of smokers want to quit, Brennan said. Consequently, moving cigarettes out of their line of sight helps them to abstain. “Cigarettes are an impulsive buy,” he said. “When you change availability, you can change the smoking habits of individuals.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2lMrHQD American Journal of Public Health, online February 16, 2017.",3202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pharmacies-cigarettes/when-cvs-stopped-selling-cigarettes-some-customers-quit-smoking-idUSKBN16R2HY

360,CVS,CVS Health's profit beats as pharmacy margins rise,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit as higher margins in its pharmacy business helped offset the loss of major contracts last year. Same-store prescription volumes fell 460 basis points in the first quarter due to the loss of contracts to fill prescriptions for Tricare, a U.S. Department of Defense health care program, and for customers of pharmacy benefits manager Prime Therapeutics, to rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O).

The deal follows an investigation that began in 2012 after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration noticed an increased number of thefts and unexplained losses of the opioid pain medication hydrocodone at some CVS stores, according to settlement papers. The settlement came as U.S. authorities continue to grapple with a national opioid addiction epidemic, which has brought increased attention on companies involved in the distribution and production of prescription painkillers. “The Department of Justice is committed to fighting prescription drug abuse, including the alarming rise of prescription opioid abuse that is plaguing the country,” U.S. Attorney Phillip Talbert in Sacramento said in a statement. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to Talbert’s office, from April 2011 through April 2013, CVS pharmacies failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances. In addition to paying $5 million, CVS also entered into an administrative compliance plan with the DEA that covers 168 pharmacies in California, Talbert’s office said. As part of the settlement agreement, CVS acknowledged that during that time frame, some of its California pharmacies failed to fulfill certain record-keeping obligations under federal law. But CVS contends any record-keeping failure did not cause drugs to be diverted for illegal uses, the settlement agreement said. “As the settlement agreements recognize, CVS already maintains extensive programs and measures concerning compliance with the Controlled Substances Act and corresponding regulations,” CVS said in a statement.",7112017,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvs-health-settlement/cvs-to-pay-5-million-to-resolve-u-s-drug-probe-idUSL1N1K21YZ

Amazon’s entry into pharmaceuticals has been long rumored in the media. On Friday, CNBC reported that the e-commerce giant would decide before Thanksgiving whether to move into selling prescription drugs online, citing a company email and a source familiar with the matter. (cnb.cx/2hTIxvL) Amazon does not comment on rumors or speculation, a company spokeswoman said. Shares of drug retailers Walgreens closed down 5.8 percent, Rite Aid 4.9 percent and CVS Health 4.9 percent.

384,CVS,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Health insurer Anthem takes pharmacy business in house, taps CVS to help","(Repeats correction) Oct 18 (Reuters) - Health insurer Anthem Inc will start managing its billions of dollars of patient prescriptions itself in 2020, it said on Wednesday, ending a deal with Express Scripts Holding that had deteriorated into lawsuits over terms. Anthem, which has said Express Scripts overcharged it by $3 billion annually through unfavorable prices, said it would use drug retailer CVS Health Corp to handle prescription fulfillment and claims processing for five years for the new company, called IngenioRX. Pharmacy benefit managers negotiate prices with drugmakers and determine which treatments are included on their list of covered drugs and how much of a co-payment to charge for them versus their rivals. As drug prices have posted annual double-digit gains, companies, insurers and the U.S. government have pushed benefit managers to better manage costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte estimated that No.2 health insurer Anthem’s prescription business represents about 220 million scripts per year worth about $23 billion in revenue. The move should add $1.50 per share to earnings starting in 2020 based on the company’s expectations to save that $3 billion annually, she said in a research note. Other insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc, already manage their pharmacy benefit themselves. Anthem, whose 10-year contract with Express Scripts expires in 2019, had said it was considering staying with Express Scripts, choosing another company, or doing the work itself. Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the company was disappointed by the move and would continue to work with Anthem through the contract end date and any transition period. Excluding Anthem, the company has 65 million members, he said. CVS Health, which also has a pharmacy benefit management business in addition to its pharmacies and Minute Clinics, said its five-year agreement with Anthem would begin in 2020 and run through the end of 2024. CVS Health said it expects to incur implementation charges related to the transition of members, but said the costs would not have an impact on its 2017 earnings. Shares of CVS Health were up 1.6 percent at $73.80 in premarket trading on Wednesday, while Express Scripts’ shares were marginally down.

388,CVS,UPDATE 3-CVS makes more than $66 billion bid for Aetna -sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp has made an offer to acquire No. 3 U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. A deal would merge one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide. Aetna shares rose more than 11 percent, or $18.48, to $178.60, while CVS shares fell 3 percent, or $2.22, to $73.31, after the Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks earlier on Thursday.  Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.  Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers. They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments. A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers. But it would also subject it to more antitrust scrutiny.  The deal could also help counter pressure on CVS’s stock following speculation that Amazon.com Inc is preparing to enter the drug prescription market, using its vast e-commerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies.  CVS made the offer earlier this month, although the two companies have been in discussions about a potential deal for several months, the sources said.  These talks were carried out primarily between CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, and were aimed at making executives comfortable with the idea of a merger, the sources said. CVS and Aetna started discussing terms only recently, and a deal is not expected for a few weeks, one of the sources added, cautioning that the pace of the talks could accelerate given the publication of the negotiations.  The sources did not specify how much of CVS’ bid is cash versus stock, but given CVS’s and Aetna’s market capitalizations of $77 billion and $54 billion, respectively, a substantial stock component is likely in any deal. Aetna and CVS declined to comment. Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive. The deal comes after years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans. Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Act’s facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement. The lack of progress - as well as Trump’s executive order to bring down healthcare costs - has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018. After the deal with Humana fell apart, Bertolini has said that he did not believe large deals were possible in the insurance industry. But analysts have speculated about a tighter partnership between Aetna and CVS since early in the year. CVS and Aetna have a long-term contract in which CVS has provided pharmacy benefits for Aetna customers. “Aetna really makes the best sense” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “It’s their largest client on the PBM side. They really have similar views as to where healthcare should go, which is to the retail setting.” Jonas, who owns both Aetna and CVS shares, noted the two companies were already talking about working together on Minute Clinic, on home infusion and other services. “To go from that to a full merger is a big step but it’s not huge,” he said. Last week No. 2 insurer Anthem Inc. announced plans to manage its own pharmacy benefits with the help of CVS, a move that would give it a set-up similar to UnitedHealth Group Inc. and its Optum unit. Insurers want more control over the pharmaceutical component of care as they implement pricing schemes with doctors and hospitals that are based on health outcomes, not just procedures. They also want to work on driving down costs, and as a pharmacy benefit manager, would negotiate directly with drugmakers.

389,CVS,Breakingviews - Aetna bid is a defensive prescription for CVS,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - A bid for Aetna is a defensive prescription for CVS Health. The drugstore and pharmacy-benefit company should be able to generate some cost savings if its $66 billion offer for the health insurer prevails. Even more important, it could help the firm resist Amazon’s entry into drug distribution, and the unpleasant side effects of transparency and low margins that may follow.  Getting drugs from producers to consumers is a complex and foggy business, with multiple middlemen capturing bits and pieces along the way. Combining CVS and Aetna would create a single business able to negotiate a lower price from a drugmaker, dispense the medicine, and insure customers so they can pay for it.  That could mean savings from fewer administrative staff and combined IT systems. The nation’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, runs a prescription drug benefit business in-house that has done well. There may be a cost though. Rival insurer Anthem recently partnered with CVS to form a drug-benefit business due to start in 2020. Whether Anthem would want to play ball with Aetna in the picture is a big question. Yet it’s notable that this overture became public the same day that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch confirmed Amazon had received approval from multiple states to become a wholesale pharmaceutical distributer. Rumor and logic suggest strongly that the retailer will ultimately offer prescriptions online.  That news caused widespread damage to drug middlemen stocks earlier in the day. CVS, for example, saw its shares initially fall up to 6 percent on the news. Currently pharmacy-benefit managers can negotiate discounts with drugmakers in the dark, push customers toward captive pharmacies and extract a profit. It’s one of the reasons why healthcare is so much more costly and complex in America than in most developed countries. Amazon on the other hand, is notorious for disrupting businesses, focusing on customers, and being willing to accept nearly non-existent margins. For CVS, having an insurer steer a lot of customers its way might help neuter the Amazon threat. Of course, CVS’s strategy may have side effects of its own. U.S. politicians and consumers have become increasingly critical of the high cost and murkiness of drug pricing. Transparency may be coming regardless of what deals are made.

DowDuPont (DWDP.N) was up 2.8 percent as the biggest boost to the S&P; 500. It forecast third-quarter profit well above Wall Street’s expectations ahead of the combined company’s first earnings report next week. Twitter (TWTR.N) jumped 18.5 percent after the company said it could turn its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter, helped by cost cuts and new sources of revenue. “This earnings season so far looks good, mixed as always and obviously there is a lot more to go here in terms of earnings,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York.  The healthcare sector, off 1.03 percent, held gains in check, led lower by a 16.4-percent plunge in Celgene (CELG.O), the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. The company reported lower-than-expected sales for its psoriasis drug Otezla and lowered its overall 2020 sales outlook.  Losses accelerated in the sector after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported, citing public records, that Amazon (AMZN.O) gained approval from a number of state pharmaceutical boards to become a wholesale distributor. In addition, President Donald Trump announced steps to fight the opioid crisis in the United States by declaring it a national public health emergency. “Even though it has been talked about for months and the stocks had taken a hit several times, when reality hits there is always another downside to it and the group is getting slammed,” said Ghriskey.

Shares of Aetna, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, closed down 3 percent on Friday after closing 12 percent higher on Thursday on reports of the deal. CVS Health was down 5.9 percent. CVS Health has made an offer to acquire Aetna for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, making it the biggest deal of the year.

That possibility has hit shares of most drugstore operators on fears that the online retailer would leverage its vast ecommerce platform in prescription drug sales. “We believe CVS does need to respond to the potential threat and strike a different path,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a note. A deal would make CVS-Aetna a one-stop shop for customers’ health care needs - ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. The vertical integration of retail pharmacy, PBM, and insurers fits with broader healthcare themes of expanded access, consumerism and cost reduction, Jefferies analysts said, adding that the deal chatter was not a complete surprise. “It would address each company’s need for a fresh script.” The deal between companies in two very concentrated industries will likely prompt concern about their rivals having an access to market, or foreclosure, two antitrust expert said.

The deal comes after years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans. Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Act’s facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement. The lack of progress - as well as Trump’s executive order to bring down healthcare costs - has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018. After the deal with Humana fell apart, Bertolini has said that he did not believe large deals were possible in the insurance industry. But analysts have speculated about a tighter partnership between Aetna and CVS since early in the year. CVS and Aetna have a long-term contract in which CVS has provided pharmacy benefits for Aetna customers. “Aetna really makes the best sense” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “It’s their largest client on the PBM side. They really have similar views as to where healthcare should go, which is to the retail setting.” Jonas, who owns both Aetna and CVS shares, noted the two companies were already talking about working together on Minute Clinic, on home infusion and other services. “To go from that to a full merger is a big step but it’s not huge,” he said. Last week No. 2 insurer Anthem Inc. announced plans to manage its own pharmacy benefits with the help of CVS, a move that would give it a set-up similar to UnitedHealth Group Inc. and its Optum unit. Insurers want more control over the pharmaceutical component of care as they implement pricing schemes with doctors and hospitals that are based on health outcomes, not just procedures. They also want to work on driving down costs, and as a pharmacy benefit manager, would negotiate directly with drugmakers.

400,CVS,CVS-Aetna deal gets Wall Street thumbs up amid Amazon entry fears,"Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp’s move to buy health insurer Aetna Inc will broaden their reach in the industry and could spark another round of dealmaking in a sector dreading Amazon’s arrival, analysts said. Shares of Aetna, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, were marginally up in early trading on Friday, after closing 12 percent higher on Thursday following reports of the deal. CVS Health was down about 1 percent. CVS Health has made an offer to acquire No. 3 U.S. health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, making it the biggest deal of the year, Reuters reported on Thursday. “A potential combination would diversify CVS profit streams ahead of an Amazon entry and set the stage for a new healthcare-retail delivery model,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note. Amazon.com Inc’s speculated entry has hit shares of most drugstore operators on fears that the online retailer would leverage its vast ecommerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies. “We believe CVS does need to respond to the potential threat and strike a different path,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a note. A deal would make CVS-Aetna a one-stop shop for customers’ health care needs - ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. The vertical integration of retail pharmacy, PBM, and insurers fits with broader healthcare themes of expanded access, consumerism and cost reduction, Jefferies analysts said, adding that the deal chatter was not a complete surprise. “It would address each company’s need for a fresh script.” Some analysts said the deal could also trigger a wave of consolidation across the industry. It could be a possible catalyst for higher health insurance sector valuation, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Bosch said, adding that WellCare Health Plans, Humana and Centene could be possible acquisition targets.

401,CVS,CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The proposed merger between U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp and No. 3 health insurer Aetna Inc represents a $66 billion bet that insurers can drive down high U.S. drug prices by cutting out the middleman. The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug. CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize. If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.  “It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”  For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.  But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies. UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.  Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.      CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.   Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive. The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.  Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported  to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.  Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.  Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.  UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.      Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.       Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.  But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerink’s Gupta said.     Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks.

403,CVS,Breakingviews - Aetna lays out its insurance value for CVS,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Aetna’s third-quarter results lay out its insurance value for CVS Health. Revenue at the $56 billion health-coverage firm fell 5 percent in the three months to the end of September, partly from dumping some Obamacare policies. But profit jumped 48 percent as the company kept costs under control. That offers alluring protection for CVS, whose pharmacy and drug-benefit business is threatened by rising competition and transparency. Amazon is at the forefront of this challenge. The internet company is ramping up an effort to sell pills and other goods to patients  - and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos regards short-term profit as an afterthought. CVS’s other business is to act as the middleman negotiating cheaper drug prices and keeping a slug of the savings. Decent returns here depend on keeping the market opaque. Clients, however, are wondering if the system benefits them; reducing the murkiness of price setting, whether by political process or Amazon-inspired competition, could leave less for CVS. Now consider Aetna. The firm’s management wouldn’t talk about CVS’s bid on the earnings call with investors. But it has over 22 million people covered by its medical plans and is becoming better at figuring out how to squeeze more profit out of them by reducing spending. In its big healthcare segment, its medical benefits ratio – a key measure of costs relative to premiums – decreased to 81.5 percent in the first nine months of 2017, an improvement of a fifth of a percentage point from the same period last year. That helped it to easily beat analysts’ profit estimate. Aetna also raised earnings guidance for the full year. Finding growth will be more difficult for Aetna. Extracting itself from the individual policy market for Obamacare probably means a stagnant top line in 2018. Merging with big direct rivals is also out of the question after regulators shot down its proposed deal for Humana. That makes a CVS bid and its 25 percent premium to Aetna’s undisturbed share price more tempting. The real attraction of Aetna, however, is the insurer sending all these clients its way. CVS has made a big push into offering medical services such as vaccinations, routine medical care for earaches and even performing home infusions. It’s more convenient for patients and cheaper than an emergency room. That combination could keep Aetna’s higher profit trend going – straight into the combined firm’s pocket.",10312017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-aetna-lays-out-its-insurance-value-for-cvs-idUSKBN1D02EU
404,CVS,"Aetna silent on CVS bid reports, flags tax hit in 2018","(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc failed to provide any hints on reported merger talks with CVS Health Corp when discussing quarterly results on Tuesday and laid out obstacles to 2018 earnings growth, sending its shares lower. The company reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit despite a decline in revenue related to a scaling back of its Obamacare individual insurance business, which Aetna expects to lose about $200 million on this year. Aetna said it expects member medical spending to stay low this year, a trend that has benefited the health insurers and dragged down hospital revenues, and that the moderated spending would likely continue into 2018.  The No. 3 U.S. health insurer did not provide a 2018 revenue or profit forecast, but executives said on a conference call with analysts that 2018 earnings growth would be hindered by a reinstated industry-wide 3 percent health insurance tax, which represents a hit of 25 cents per share.  Aetna shares were down about 0.5 percent in afternoon trading. Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel called out the comments about 2018 in a research note, saying that Aetna will be better positioned to return to its long-term revenue growth target of mid- to high-single digits in 2019. The commentary suggested that upside is limited for 2018 earnings based on the current consensus, which is for earnings of $10.14 per share, Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini started the call off by declining to comment on rumor or speculation, referencing last week’s reports that pharmacy CVS Health offered to buy Aetna for more than $200 per share, or more than $66 billion. CVS currently has a contract to manage much of Aetna’s drug benefits. Bertolini said that the company would make a decision about the contract internally by the end of this year, and a public decision by mid-2018. Aetna rival Anthem Inc recently announced it would stop using drug benefit manager Express Scripts Holdings and manage more in house and through CVS.  Aetna has mostly pulled out of the individual markets under Obamacare for 2018 because of instability, with enrollment below expectations and premiums soaring.  In 2017, it said it still expects to lose money on the business. Bertolini said the company would consider reentering the individual market when it stabilized.  Bertolini said Aetna is considering relaunching short-term, one-year transition insurance plans for individuals, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order of earlier this month. Such plans are restricted to three months under former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare..  Republicans want to roll back Obamacare, which established key benefits that almost all individual insurance plans must offer and set up an online market where more than 10 million people buy their insurance. Current transition plans do not provide these benefits. The company said net income rose 39 percent to $838 million. Revenue dipped 5 percent to about $15 billion, partly due to Aetna’s reduced presence in the Obamacare business.  The insurer said its medical benefit ratio, the percent of premiums spent on claims, fell to 81.4 percent in its commercial business from 83.8 percent a year earlier.  It said that it expects its overall medical costs to rise 5.5 percent in 2017. Excluding items, Aetna earned $2.45 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $2.09, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Aetna said it now expects adjusted earnings for 2017 to be about $9.75, up from its previous estimate of $9.45 to $9.55 per share.

They have risen over 10 percent since Oct. 26, when the Wall Street Journal first reported that CVS and Aetna were in merger talks. CVS shares ended trading down 0.2 percent at $69.25, giving the company a market capitalization of $70 billion.

410,CVS,U.S. healthcare brightens tame U.S. high-grade M&A; lending,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp’s planned US$66bn buy of Aetna Inc is poised to boost the healthcare sector’s share of US investment-grade mergers and acquisitions lending beyond its current one-third share of the US$122bn total as the sector remains a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster market. Healthcare was already the busiest sector for US high-grade M&A; loans, with year-to-date volume of US$40.5bn more than double the US$18.5bn for the second-placed retail sector, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, before US pharmacy operator CVS’s offer to purchase the third-biggest health insurer in the US was reported on October 26.  Based on Aetna’s market capitalization, CVS’s acquisition will be the largest healthcare insurance deal on record, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence, and a loan backing the deal could take US high-grade healthcare M&A; lending past the US$42.75bn tally for full-year 2016.  Bankers remain eager to provide financing for high-quality transactions and are actively pitching financing packages to CVS.  “There are a lot of banks hovering around, willing to utilize their balance sheet,” one banker said. “They are proposing bridge structures and financing structures that are pretty attractive for the client, in big sizes, for the cash portion.” Healthcare deal-making got off to a slow start in the first quarter, as companies waited for the results of early failed attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare and details of US tax reforms, but acquisitions that were unlikely to be thwarted by antitrust rulings started to emerge in April. Consolidation remains a popular option for insurers and pharmacies that are under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs, Reuters reported. US M&A; activity has been tempered by uncertainty about the implementation of healthcare, tax and trade changes pledged by the Trump administration. US investment-grade M&A; lending of US$$122bn is 18% lower in the year to date than the same period of 2016.  Mergers have largely been contained to companies seeking growth in a slow-growing economy by buying complementary businesses.  The healthcare sector’s 33% share of high-grade acquisition finance is already higher than 23% in full-year 2016, although the rising share is from a smaller overall high-grade lending pool.   Drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc’s US$6.1bn deal to buy Medtronic Plc’s medical supplies units in April, just days after Abbott Laboratories agreed to a long-awaited US$5.3bn purchase of diagnostic testing company Alere Inc, were the first deals to raise the sector’s pulse. Earlier in April, two high-profile insurance company mergers – Aetna with Humana and Cigna with Anthem – were scrapped by separate anti-trust rulings and the loans backing the financings fell away.  Once the chute was opened, Becton Dickinson announced its US$24bn purchase of C R Bard in the medical device sector on April 24 and Gilead Sciences said on August 28 that it was buying Kite Pharma for US$11.9bn, which produced the two largest healthcare loan financing transactions this year of US$15.7bn and US$6bn, respectively. While the second-placed retail sector’s share of high-grade M&A; lending also has climbed this year, to 15% from 5% for all of last year, most of that backs Amazon’s purchase of high-end grocer Whole Foods – whereas the number of healthcare mergers is growing, according to LPC data.  The beleaguered retail sector is threatened by a growing preference for online shopping and the growing tentacles of Amazon. Amazon’s recently reported interest in the pharmacy business may have sped up the CVS bid for Aetna, some bankers said. More healthcare mergers are widely anticipated, as consolidation for competitive advantage continues. Lower US corporate tax rates, if passed, are expected to free up more cash for more deal-making, bankers said.  “Healthcare in a lot of ways is very fragmented, with some very strong in certain treatments and subsectors, and it might be easier to see some of these mega-acquisitions” to achieve expansion, another banker said.

Bankers remain eager to provide financing for high-quality transactions and are actively pitching financing packages to CVS.  “There are a lot of banks hovering around, willing to utilize their balance sheet,” one banker said. “They are proposing bridge structures and financing structures that are pretty attractive for the client, in big sizes, for the cash portion.” Healthcare deal-making got off to a slow start in the first quarter, as companies waited for the results of early failed attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare and details of US tax reforms, but acquisitions that were unlikely to be thwarted by antitrust rulings started to emerge in April. Consolidation remains a popular option for insurers and pharmacies that are under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs, Reuters reported. US M&A; activity has been tempered by uncertainty about the implementation of healthcare, tax and trade changes pledged by the Trump administration. US investment-grade M&A; lending of US$$122bn is 18% lower in the year to date than the same period of 2016.  Mergers have largely been contained to companies seeking growth in a slow-growing economy by buying complementary businesses.  The healthcare sector’s 33% share of high-grade acquisition finance is already higher than 23% in full-year 2016, although the rising share is from a smaller overall high-grade lending pool.   Drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc’s US$6.1bn deal to buy Medtronic Plc’s medical supplies units in April, just days after Abbott Laboratories agreed to a long-awaited US$5.3bn purchase of diagnostic testing company Alere Inc, were the first deals to raise the sector’s pulse. Earlier in April, two high-profile insurance company mergers – Aetna with Humana and Cigna with Anthem – were scrapped by separate anti-trust rulings and the loans backing the financings fell away.  Once the chute was opened, Becton Dickinson announced its US$24bn purchase of C R Bard in the medical device sector on April 24 and Gilead Sciences said on August 28 that it was buying Kite Pharma for US$11.9bn, which produced the two largest healthcare loan financing transactions this year of US$15.7bn and US$6bn, respectively. While the second-placed retail sector’s share of high-grade M&A; lending also has climbed this year, to 15% from 5% for all of last year, most of that backs Amazon’s purchase of high-end grocer Whole Foods – whereas the number of healthcare mergers is growing, according to LPC data.  The beleaguered retail sector is threatened by a growing preference for online shopping and the growing tentacles of Amazon. Amazon’s recently reported interest in the pharmacy business may have sped up the CVS bid for Aetna, some bankers said. More healthcare mergers are widely anticipated, as consolidation for competitive advantage continues. Lower US corporate tax rates, if passed, are expected to free up more cash for more deal-making, bankers said.  “Healthcare in a lot of ways is very fragmented, with some very strong in certain treatments and subsectors, and it might be easier to see some of these mega-acquisitions” to achieve expansion, another banker said.

416,CVS,CVS to start next-day delivery as Amazon threat looms,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugstore chain CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) said on Monday it would start next-day delivery from its stores in 2018, a move some analysts said was in response to Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) potential entry into prescription drug sales. Shares of drugstore operators have been under pressure on fears that the online retailer will use its vast ecommerce platform to disrupt the pharmaceutical supply chain. “We will bring the pharmacy to our patients’ doorsteps, with nationwide next-day delivery from our stores,” CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call with analysts. The pharmacy store operator, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday, said it would offer same-day delivery in select metro areas and free same-day delivery for drugs in Manhattan starting on Dec. 4. Mizuho Securities USA analyst Ann Hynes said the plan could be seen by some as a defensive move in the face of Amazon’s potential entry. CVS’ shares fell as much as 4 percent in early trading before paring some losses to trade down 2.7 percent. The company said it was open to working with Amazon, adding that it would never close the door on any type of partnership. “I think CVS also worries about Amazon’s potential future moves ... This is possibly a defensive strategy just to make sure that CVS is in a position to respond when that happens,” GlobalData Retail analyst Neil Saunders told Reuters. CVS Health, which is said to be in talks to buy health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), said it would not comment on “rumors or speculations”. CVS is reported to have made an offer to buy Aetna for more than $66 billion in a deal that would give the drugstore chain more leverage in price negotiations with drug makers. A deal would also merge one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide. Net income attributable to CVS fell 17 percent to $1.29 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The drop in net income was mainly due to a loss of contracts to fill millions of retail prescriptions for customers of Tricare, a Department of Defense health care program, and pharmacy benefits manager Prime Therapeutics. Excluding items, CVS earned a profit of $1.50 per share, beating he average analyst estimate of $1.48, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

422,CVS,UPDATE 2-Bayer hires new blood to stem 'Amazon effect' in consumer health,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer has hired the head of Nestle’s baby food business to help it reverse a drop in revenue from consumer health brands, which often fail to appeal to buyers on Amazon and other online platforms. Bayer has appointed Nestle’s Heiko Schipper, 48, to run the Consumer Health division as a group board member from March 1 next year, replacing Erica Mann, Bayer said in a statement on Wednesday. Bayer was caught off guard by the speed of U.S. consumers switching to online stores at the expense of established drugstores. Major over-the-counter (OTC) drug rival GlaxoSmithKline has also struggled with the transition. The shake-up in the segment is a harbinger of what could be in store for the much larger prescription drug sector when Amazon moves into that market and uses its purchasing power to squeeze prices, as is widely anticipated. Moves such as drug distributor McKesson’s purchase of a CVS Health Corp unit that provides services to pharma firms as well as CVS Health’s planned push into next-day delivery are seen as pre-empting Amazon’s potential entry into prescription drug sales. Bernstein analysts said in a note earlier this month they expect Amazon to “cause long-term margin compression through the drug supply chain”. In the market for non-prescription treatments, consumers are more easily comparing prices on the Internet, with Bayer’s premium brands such as sunscreen Coppertone or allergy remedy Claritin often falling by the wayside. “The U.S. is the market that is facing tremendous structural changes,” outgoing executive Erica Mann said in an analyst call discussing third-quarter results this month. “We also noted in the U.S. market significant channel shifts, such as an acceleration towards e-commerce and, in particular, I can call it the Amazon effect... Consumer behaviors are shifting and they’re really moving towards e-commerce channels as well as searching for value.” Both Pfizer and Germany’s Merck KGaA are making preparations to sell their respective OTC businesses. Bayer’s OTC drugs unit, boosted by a $14 billion acquisition of brands from U.S. rival Merck & Co in 2014, reported a 7.4 percent fall in third-quarter sales, down 2.9 percent adjusted for currency fluctuations and portfolio changes. U.S. drugstore chains have merged in response to the online threat, wielding increased purchasing power to squeeze procurement prices. Nestle on Wednesday confirmed Schipper’s departure, announcing an overhaul in its infant nutrition business, managing it no longer globally but regionally.

The companies are in advanced stages of negotiating a deal that would value Aetna at between $200 and $205 per share and would be comprised mainly of cash, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Shares of both companies rose on the news, with the enhanced cash component viewed as a positive surprise. CVS shares were up 3.9 percent and Aetna gained 1.3 percent. Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager for Gabelli Funds, said the reported price was a bit less than he had expected.  “The bigger deal is if they’re going to be paying mostly cash it would be much more accretive to CVS,” he said. “Initially I’d been thinking anywhere from a third to a half in stock and it’s a pretty depressed stock price.

PBMs negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.

428,CVS,Exclusive: CVS eyes major expansion of health clinics with Aetna deal - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) is planning to significantly expand health services at its retail pharmacies if it completes a more than $66 billion deal for insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), a move that could save more than $1 billion annually, people familiar with the matter said.     A key rationale is to use many of the U.S. pharmacy chain’s 9,700 brick-and-mortar outlets to improve access to preventative care and cut back on some emergency room visits for Aetna’s roughly 23 million members with medical coverage, these people said.      The full benefits of the strategy will take several years to realize, requiring billions of dollars in investment to increase the number of CVS clinics and provide the staff and equipment for a wider variety of treatments, the people said.   Those funds would be diverted from planned investments in CVS retail facilities, and not amount to additional expenses, they said.     Deal talks between the companies are still underway, and an agreement could be announced as early as Sunday or Monday, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. It is also possible that a deal is delayed or does not materialize, they said.     Health insurers have redoubled their efforts to cut costs in a time of steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.  Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to gain more leverage over costs, but that transaction, as well as a proposed merger between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N), was shot down by antitrust regulators.     Many insurers have already been encouraging patients to use urgent care centers, which can provide some of the same services as emergency rooms for as little as a tenth of the cost, said Laurel Stoimenoff, chief executive of the Urgent Care Association of America.   The industry has grown to about 8,000 urgent care centers nationwide, as more hospitals, insurers and private operators open such walk-in facilities, Stoimenoff said, with 400 to 500 centers added each year. They may be staffed by doctors and provide relatively advanced care including X-rays.     CVS operates more than 1,000 MinuteClinics, which offer more basic services ranging from flu shots to physicals and are mainly staffed by nurse practitioners.  Combined with Aetna, the company would be able to seamlessly access medical records, offer certain preventive services to covered members for free and make drugs promptly available in adjacent CVS pharmacies, said Dan Mendelson, president of consultancy Avalere Health.      The in-store clinics could provide immunizations, check if a patient needs antibiotics, help manage chronic illnesses like diabetes or even administer medications by infusion, but are unlikely to offer acute treatment of serious injuries, healthcare experts said.         “It would probably be unsettling to people coming in to buy socks to have someone with a bleeding head come in for stitches,” said Greg Burke of the United Hospital Fund, a non-profit focused on improving healthcare in New York.          Expanding the clinics could eventually save the combined company more than $1 billion annually by substituting low-cost treatments in CVS stores for more expensive hospital visits, two people familiar with the matter said. The combined net income of Aetna and CVS is forecast to be about $9.25 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.          Aetna competitor UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) operates 230 MedExpress urgent care centers in 17 states in one of its fastest-growing divisions, with nearly 20 percent compounded revenue growth per year.      For CVS, which has seen non-pharmacy sales decline at its stores, the clinics could have the added benefit of bringing in new customers and providing alternatives for less productive retail space.            “It’s a tough retail environment.

430,CVS,UPDATE 2-CVS Health to acquire Aetna for $69 bln in year's largest acquisition,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) for $69 billion, seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies. This year’s largest corporate acquisition will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans.  The deal comes after Aetna’s $37 billion plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurance peer Humana Inc (HUM.N) was blocked in January by a U.S. federal judge over antitrust concerns. A proposed combination of peers Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) was also shot down.  Aetna shareholders stand to receive $207 per share in the deal with CVS, the companies said. The consideration comprises $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS shares for each Aetna share. Reuters first reported the terms of the deal earlier on Sunday.  Aetna shareholders will own about 22 percent of the combined company, while CVS shareholders will own the remainder. The companies said that cost synergies in the second full year after the transaction closes — 2020 if the deal closes in the second half of 2018 as they expect — would amount to $750 million. They foresee it adding to adjusted earnings per share by the low- to mid-single digit percentage points. Their vision expands beyond capitalizing on CVS’ existing MinuteClinic structure, which largely offers preventative services like flu shots, the companies’ chief executives said in an interview.  “When you walk into CVS there’s the pharmacy. What if there’s a vision and audiology center, and perhaps a nutritionist, and some sort of care manager?” CVS CEO Larry Merlo said.  Aetna will be operated as a separate unit and Aetna’s existing leadership is expected to run the Aetna businesses, Merlo said. Aetna will have two of its directors, in addition to Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini join the board of CVS. The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to a shifting landscape, including changes in the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).  CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to provide medical services to Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members. In addition to health clinics and medical equipment, CVS could provide assistance with vision, hearing and nutrition.  A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business. The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.  That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits. Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers. Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.  Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act. Large corporate customers of Aetna are taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding the impact on costs, benefits experts have said. Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.  It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.  Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.  Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice. The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.  But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off. It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon. “(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,” said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T; Inc (T.N) from buying Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Barclays and Goldman Sachs served as financial advisers to CVS, and Centerview Partners also provided financial advice to CVS’s board.

431,CVS,Aetna's board set to approve $68 bln sale to CVS Health -sources,"Dec 3 (Reuters) - Aetna Inc’s board of directors was meeting on Sunday to approve the U.S. health insurer’s sale to U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp for approximately $207 per share in cash and stock, according to people familiar with the matter. The $68 billion deal will be this year’s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide. CVS plans to pay for the deal mostly with cash, but it will also use its own stock to pay for around 30 percent of the purchase price, the sources said. The announcement of the deal could come as early as Sunday, the sources added. The sources requested not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said. A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business. The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments. That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients. Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers. Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act. Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp.

432,CVS,CVS-Aetna deal to change how big employers buy health benefits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp’s (CVS.N) proposed purchase of Aetna Inc (AET.N) will change the way many major U.S. corporations buy health coverage for employees and raise new questions over the cost of those benefits, benefit consultants said. CVS on Sunday said it planned to buy Aetna for $69 billion. Most national companies employing more than 20,000 people keep their prescription drug benefits separate from medical coverage. They believe they are paying less by shopping those contracts around to competitors within each industry. CVS and Aetna argue that their deal will lower healthcare costs for employees of their large corporate customers, giving the company greater clout to negotiate down drug prices and better manage the use of those medicines.  “It’s the lower overall cost of therapy. It’s not just the drugs. It’s not just the PBM (prescription benefit manager). It’s the overall outcome for the patient,” Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini told Reuters in an interview. But employers are expected to scrutinize that kind of claim closely, according to benefit consultants in touch with hundreds of large employers. So far, they are taking a “wait-and-see attitude as to whether there is a direct favorable impact on their pricing” of a CVS-Aetna combination, said Jim Winkler, senior vice president for health at Aon, part of Aon Plc (AON.N). Last year, large employers’ concerns over two proposed mergers between health insurers Aetna and Humana Inc (HUM.N) and between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) were a major factor in U.S. antitrust regulators blocking the deals.  Industry experts say that is less likely to happen with CVS-Aetna because of their minimal direct overlap, historically the main concern for customers.    “By and large they are in separate places in the value chain, so it’s more of a vertical integration,” said Winkler. CVS is the No. 2 U.S. provider of prescription drug benefits and competes with larger rival Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O). Aetna is the nation’s No. 3 health insurer, competing against UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Anthem and Cigna to provide coverage for doctor and hospital visits. A combined CVS-Aetna will reorder those options, leaving Express Scripts as the only standalone company big enough to easily provide pharmacy benefits to top employers. Aon’s Winkler expects this will lead large companies to turn to their insurer for pharmacy benefits the same way mid-sized companies have. About 63 percent of large corporations use a separate pharmacy benefit company, consultant Mercer’s 2016 employer survey found. In scale, CVS and Aetna offer a much bigger pharmacy benefits manager than UnitedHealth, which expanded its OptumRx business with the $13 billion purchase of Catamaran in 2015.  Anthem in October said it would expand its own pharmacy benefits business, and hired CVS to help do so. That partnership could be thrown into jeopardy by the new Aetna agreement, health industry analysts said. Insurers say combining the two benefits saves money. Large employers who combine the benefits under one insurer have begun to demand insurers hit a specific dollar figure of medical cost savings per member, per year, said David Dross, national pharmacy practice leader at Mercer, part of Marsh & McLennan Co. (MMC.N). Insurers may also try to make it more pricey for large companies to keep the benefits separate.  Some have started charging mid-size corporate customers, who employ 2,000 to 10,000 people, additional fees for integrating medical claims and pharmaceutical claims when they are managed by different companies, Dross said, and could require those fees for larger clients as well. “The plans have sort of decided this is the model we need to move to now,” Dross said. He expects that next year, as large companies negotiate their benefits contracts, they will be asking much more than in the past “will a carve-out option look better, or does the carve-in option look better?” ",12042017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health-employers-analys/cvs-aetna-deal-to-change-how-big-employers-buy-health-benefits-idUSKBN1DX0UJ
433,CVS,"UPDATE 4-CVS, Aetna executives defend $69 bln deal to skeptical Wall St","NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Aetna Inc (AET.N) said on Monday their $69 billion deal to combine the pharmacy and drug benefit manager and the No. 3 U.S. health insurer would transform healthcare and deliver cost savings, but investors took a pessimistic view of the combination in the short term. CVS and Aetna announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement for a deal that will allow CVS to expand cheaper medical services in its pharmacy-based MinuteClinics and rein in soaring U.S. healthcare costs for consumers, large corporations, and the government. CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on an investor call on Monday that he expects the deal to close in 2018 after an antitrust review, and that he expects $750 million in savings from eliminating duplicate corporate functions at CVS and Aetna and combining some drug health plan and drug benefit management areas. But investors on Monday described the savings as modest and worried that they will not kick in until 2020 at the earliest. Investors are also concerned that CVS earnings would not grow as much as expected next year due to deal costs.  CVS shares fell 4.6 percent to close at $71.69 on Monday and Aetna shares fell 1.4 percent to close at $178.70. LONG-TERM GROWTH, SHORT-TERM PAIN CVS and Aetna envision a new healthcare system in which patient health is improved as the companies integrate pharmacy and medical claims and increase preventative services in clinics from the current emphasis on flu shots to include other areas such as vision, hearing and nutrition. Strategically, Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas said, he likes the idea, which could drive customer growth in CVS’s MinuteClinics. “Financially, though, it’s really a stretch,” he said. CVS’s plan to cancel share buybacks likely means lower earnings per share next year and the deal - the biggest merger of 2017 - will increase the company’s debt costs. Two ratings agencies, Moody’s and S&P;, said on Monday that the debt load from the deal could spur them to lower credit ratings on the companies. The companies are turning to several banks to provide $49 billion in financing to fund the cash portion of the deal. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said investors were increasingly skeptical, and that attaining the $750 million in savings would be difficult given the stiff competition with rivals and pricing pressure on health insurance products and pharmaceuticals. But she said the deal would probably be approved after regulators ask for small asset sales of Medicare drug plans to maintain market competition.  Antitrust regulators last year blocked two separate mergers proposed by the large insurers: Aetna’s plan to buy Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Anthem Inc’s (ANTM.N) acquisition of Cigna Corp (CI.N), saying they would hurt consumers.  Unlike those deals, the CVS-Aetna combination is a “vertical” integration in which the companies do not directly overlap operations. Several antitrust experts said they expected the CVS-Aetna deal to gain approval for that reason, but that it would be scrutinized closely.  Large corporate customers were a major factor in the antitrust litigation on the insurer mergers, and benefits consultants said they are taking a wait-and-see attitude about the companies’ promises for the CVS deal. Addressing investor skepticism during a conference call with analysts on Monday, Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said the companies - which were already working together on pharmacy benefits and to expand MinuteClinics - needed to merge so that CVS could have more control on finding the savings and other opportunities.  “Owner economics matter here,” Bertolini said when asked by a Wall Street analyst why the two companies did not simply partner. The payout from the deal for Bertolini, who plans to remain a director, could be worth as much as $85 million if he leaves the company, as he is due to receive $6.7 million in severance, more than $9 million in deferred compensation and his unvested stock awards vest, according to data from the company’s filings. That would be on top of the roughly $120 million from the 574,000 shares he already owns, as well as additional money from shares that will vest between now and the deal’s closing.

439,CVS,BREAKINGVIEWS - CVS deal reveals high cost of Amazon defense,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - CVS Health just revealed the high cost of defending against Amazon. The U.S. drugstore chain and pharmacy-benefits manager is shelling out $77 billion, including debt, to buy insurer Aetna. In time, sending more patients to in-store clinics could lift profit. The plan, however, is more apt to simply stop existing customers from leaving. There is nothing immediately attractive about the acquisition financially. CVS projects about $750 million of cost synergies within a couple years of completing the deal. Their present value, once taxed and put on a multiple of 10, is worth perhaps a third of the roughly $15 billion being paid over the target’s undisturbed value. And some of those benefits will accrue to Aetna shareholders, who end up with a little over a fifth of the combined company. This so-called vertical merger of companies in different parts of the healthcare chain is evidence of the mounting pressure to rein in expenses. It is a notoriously inefficient sector. The United States spends about 18 percent of its GDP on medical services, yet receives relatively poor outcomes compared to other industrialized nations. Times are changing, though. The growth in outlays has slowed dramatically over the past few years, as the government, insurance providers and companies attempt to clamp down on costs. Aetna, for example, will probably have a stagnant top line in 2018 as it withdraws from the individual policy market for Obamacare.  The industry’s weaknesses and myriad unhappy customers has caught Amazon’s eye. It already has received approval from multiple states to distribute pharmaceuticals. The company isn’t rushing to do so, but the mere prospect has sent shivers through other middle-men and drugstores. And the e-commerce goliath is famously satisfied with growth over profitability.  CVS will be able to steer Aetna customers to its chain and drug-distribution network. If more patients go to its more than 1,100 in-store clinics instead of the emergency room, there also could be substantial savings. It’s a big if, and rival insurers may prefer other pharmacies to one tied to Aetna. With more than $20 billion of debt on its books, and another $49 billion lined up for the deal, CVS may find fending off Amazon puts its own financial health at risk.  ",12042017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-cvs-deal-reveals-high-cost-of-amazon-defense-idUSKBN1DY07L
440,CVS,"CVS likely wants FTC antitrust review, not Justice Department, of Aetna deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It is uncertain who in the U.S. government will carry out an antitrust review of CVS Health Corp’s (CVS.N) deal to buy health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), but the drugstore company is likely hoping the potentially more lenient Federal Trade Commission gets the nod, antitrust experts say.  The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission share the job of reviewing mergers to make sure they don’t hurt consumers, but sometimes it comes down to a coin toss as to who reviews a deal that involves both agencies’ areas of expertise.  The Justice Department might be best-placed since it recently reviewed, and stopped, two insurance industry tie-ups, including Aetna’s plan to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N).  Meanwhile, the FTC also has highly-relevant expertise, considering it reviewed CVS’s purchase of Target’s (TGT.N) pharmacy business in 2015 as well as another big pharmacy deal, Walgreens’ (WBA.O) purchase of much of Rite Aid (RAD.N) this year.     “If I were the parties, I would try to steer it to the FTC,” said Fiona Schaeffer of the law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy. She described CVS’s plan to buy Aetna as “eminently approvable” by either agency because critics would be unable to come up with a convincing theory to show the deal will harm consumers. The issue will likely be resolved in clearance discussions held almost immediately after the companies officially inform enforcers about the deal. In the meeting, both sides will consider each agency’s expertise in the industry in question as well as resource constraints. Which agency gets the deal may also be left to chance. “It tends it goes to a coin toss via a computer program if they (agency officials) can’t work it out,” said one expert, who asked not to be named to protect business relationships. Antitrust experts said that the companies likely hope the Justice Department loses that coin toss. After decades of allowing vertical deals like the CVS/Aetna tie-up, where a company merges with a supplier, the Justice Department just sued to stop AT&T; (T.N), owner of DirecTV, from buying Time Warner (TWX.N), in late November. In general, antitrust experts say, the antitrust agencies tend to approve vertical deals because of the efficiencies inherent in buying a supplier. The big exception - and this is the situation in AT&T;’s deal for Time Warner - is if there is a fear that AT&T;’s rivals would lose critical access to Time-Warner products like HBO or CNN. Unlike the Justice Department, the FTC has shown no apparent interest in suing to stop a vertical deal. The agency is chaired by Maureen Ohlhausen, a moderate Republican, who will be replaced by Joe Simons, another moderate Republican, as soon as the Senate confirms him.  It would be a surprise for moderate Republicans to file a lawsuit to stop a vertical merger, according to six antitrust experts. That said, two antitrust experts said they believed the Justice Department could try to stop this transaction for fear that customers would either face higher drug prices or have less choice. “Events of the past three weeks suggest that (Justice Department’s top antitrust enforcer) Makan (Delrahim) might sue to challenge this deal,” said Chris Sagers, who teaches antitrust at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.

444,CVS,"CVS, Aetna executives defend $69 billion deal to skeptical Wall Street","NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Aetna Inc (AET.N) said on Monday their $69 billion deal to combine the pharmacy and drug benefit manager and the No. 3 U.S. health insurer would transform healthcare and deliver cost savings, but investors took a pessimistic view of the combination in the short term. CVS and Aetna announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement for a deal that will allow CVS to expand cheaper medical services in its pharmacy-based MinuteClinics and rein in soaring U.S. healthcare costs for consumers, large corporations, and the government. CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on an investor call on Monday that he expects the deal to close in 2018 after an antitrust review, and that he expects $750 million in savings from eliminating duplicate corporate functions at CVS and Aetna and combining some drug health plan and drug benefit management areas. But investors on Monday described the savings as modest and worried that they will not kick in until 2020 at the earliest. Investors are also concerned that CVS earnings would not grow as much as expected next year due to deal costs.  CVS shares fell 4.6 percent to close at $71.69 on Monday and Aetna shares fell 1.4 percent to close at $178.70. LONG-TERM GROWTH, SHORT-TERM PAIN CVS and Aetna envision a new healthcare system in which patient health is improved as the companies integrate pharmacy and medical claims and increase preventative services in clinics from the current emphasis on flu shots to include other areas such as vision, hearing and nutrition. Strategically, Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas said, he likes the idea, which could drive customer growth in CVS’s MinuteClinics. “Financially, though, it’s really a stretch,” he said. CVS’s plan to cancel share buybacks likely means lower earnings per share next year and the deal - the biggest merger of 2017 - will increase the company’s debt costs. Two ratings agencies, Moody’s and S&P;, said on Monday that the debt load from the deal could spur them to lower credit ratings on the companies. The companies are turning to several banks to provide $49 billion in financing to fund the cash portion of the deal. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said investors were increasingly skeptical, and that attaining the $750 million in savings would be difficult given the stiff competition with rivals and pricing pressure on health insurance products and pharmaceuticals. But she said the deal would probably be approved after regulators ask for small asset sales of Medicare drug plans to maintain market competition.  Antitrust regulators last year blocked two separate mergers proposed by the large insurers: Aetna’s plan to buy Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Anthem Inc’s (ANTM.N) acquisition of Cigna Corp (CI.N), saying they would hurt consumers.  Unlike those deals, the CVS-Aetna combination is a “vertical” integration in which the companies do not directly overlap operations. Several antitrust experts said they expected the CVS-Aetna deal to gain approval for that reason, but that it would be scrutinized closely.  Large corporate customers were a major factor in the antitrust litigation on the insurer mergers, and benefits consultants said they are taking a wait-and-see attitude about the companies’ promises for the CVS deal. Addressing investor skepticism during a conference call with analysts on Monday, Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said the companies - which were already working together on pharmacy benefits and to expand MinuteClinics - needed to merge so that CVS could have more control on finding the savings and other opportunities.  “Owner economics matter here,” Bertolini said when asked by a Wall Street analyst why the two companies did not simply partner. The payout from the deal for Bertolini, who plans to remain a director, could be worth as much as $85 million if he leaves the company, as he is due to receive $6.7 million in severance, more than $9 million in deferred compensation and his unvested stock awards vest, according to data from the company’s filings. That would be on top of the roughly $120 million from the 574,000 shares he already owns, as well as additional money from shares that will vest between now and the deal’s closing.

451,CVS,U.S. employers say CVS-Aetna deal would affect health-benefits decisions: survey,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Corp’s proposed purchase of Aetna Inc will affect decision-making by a majority of large and mid-size U.S. corporations on employee health benefits, a survey by benefits consultant Aon Plc found.     CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, on Dec. 3 said it agreed to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for $69 billion. Reuters reported earlier this month that the deal would change the way top U.S. employers contract health benefits, based on early feedback from benefits consultants.     The new Aon survey, which included responses from decision makers at 450 medium and large-size corporations, provided additional insight into how CVS and Aetna customers may view the deal.  Sixty-one percent of survey respondents, including ones that are not customers of CVS or Aetna, said the deal would affect their decision-making process on health benefits, with 23 percent saying it would accelerate a reassessment of healthcare strategy and 38 percent saying it would delay any such moves until the transaction’s impact could be understood.      Thirty-nine percent expected no change to their overall healthcare strategy. The survey did not determine whether major employers expect the deal to change the cost of their health benefits, which could affect how antitrust regulators view it.     A majority of large employers contract with separate companies to provide prescription drug coverage and medical coverage, believing they can keep costs lower in that way. Combining CVS with Aetna would leave only one major pharmacy benefits company, Express Scripts Holding Co, operating as a standalone entity.    CVS and Aetna argue they can offer bigger savings to customers by better managing prescription drug use and expanding lower-cost medical services offered at thousands of CVS pharmacies.

463,CVS,"UPDATE 4-UnitedHealth raises 2018 profit outlook, to take benefit from tax law","(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc on Tuesday raised its outlook for 2018 earnings per share by more than 16 percent due to the U.S. corporate tax cut and said it will speed up technology investments that aim to cut customer costs. UnitedHealth is the largest U.S. health insurer and the first to report fourth-quarter earnings, which rose to $2.59 per share excluding one-time gains, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.51 per share. UnitedHealth shares jumped 2.4 percent to $234.27, reaching a new high. Shares in rival Anthem Inc rose 1.2 percent to $242.82, also a high, and Cigna Corp gained 1 percent to $215.76. Health insurer shares have risen this year as the growth in medical services costs has slowed, helping to fuel industry profits. UnitedHealth said its 2017 growth rate in those costs was 5.5 percent, at the low end of its forecast, and projected growth of 6 percent in 2018. A planned deal for CVS Health Corp to buy insurer Aetna Inc has helped buoy other insurer stocks as investors consider the potential for healthcare consolidation across sectors. Antitrust regulators shot down deals between Aetna and Humana Inc and Cigna and Anthem two years ago, saying they would raise prices for insurance. UnitedHealth Chief Executive Officer David Wichmann said the company is looking at the changes to individual health insurance presented by Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, including pushing new association health plans that allow individuals to band together to buy insurance outside of Obamacare regulations. The biggest lift to its bottom line this year is a $1.7 billion benefit in earnings and cash flow from the $1.5 trillion tax bill that Trump signed into law last month. That is after a $400 million to $500 million reduction in premium revenue to comply with former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law - less than half of which is to comply with a minimum ratio for profits versus premiums collected. It also excludes $200 million to $300 million it will spend on developing systems to cut consumer costs such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health records, and digital health, Wichmann said on a conference call with investors. The company now forecasts 2018 full-year net earnings per share between $11.65 and $11.95, up from its prior forecast of $10.00 to $10.30. Excluding items, it sees 2018 earnings of $12.30 to $12.60 per share, versus its previous outlook of $10.55 to $10.85.

U.S. drugstore operator CVS agreed in December to acquire Aetna for $69 billion, seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies. The CVS-Aetna deal will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans. Aetna, which expects the deal with CVS to close in the second half of 2018, said the U.S. tax reform will increase gross 2018 adjusted earnings by about $800 million. Net income attributable to Aetna rose to $244 million, or 74 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $139 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.25 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue fell nearly 6 percent to $14.85 billion, but inched ahead of analysts’ estimate of $14.83 billion.

474,CVS,"CVS pledges to reinvest much of its tax savings, shares fall","(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) warned on Thursday that its operating profit could fall this year as it plans to spend most of its $1.2 billion savings from the new U.S. tax law on reducing debt and paying employees more rather than boosting short-term profit.  Shares of the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager fell almost 3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.  CVS, which is in the process of buying health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) for $69 billion, said it now expects full-year adjusted consolidated operating profit to range from an increase of 1.5 percent over last year to a decline of 1.5 percent. That is more pessimistic that its previous estimate of growth ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. “The disappointment here is that much of the tax reform benefit on earnings is essentially going away, so near-term it’s not going to provide as much lift to earnings as people were modeling,” said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Mohan Naidu. Using its tax savings, CVS said it will invest $425 million annually to raise its minimum wage for hourly employees to $11 an hour and offer a paid parental leave program. It also said it will spend at least half of its tax windfall on debt reduction and allocate at least $275 million to strategic investments in its business. The raise for employees follows similar actions by Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) to attract workers at a time when a historically low U.S. unemployment rate is making it harder to find and retain minimum-wage workers. “With $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will be able to make strategic investments in our business in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term,” Chief Financial Officer David Denton said in a statement. Shareholders may have been looking for CVS to use tax savings to return cash to them through share buybacks or increased dividends as some other companies have recently pledged. CVS shares fell as much as 3.6 percent before paring some of those losses and were down $2.09, or 2.8 percent at $72.26. The company said it expected adjusted operating profit growth of 0.5 percent to 4.5 percent in the first quarter as it benefits from a bad flu season. In January, the company projected a tax rate of about 27 percent this year versus 39 percent previously.

476,CVS,"Cardinal Health profit beats on CVS tie-up, Medtronic unit buy","(Reuters) - Cardinal Health’s (CAH.N) quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates as the U.S. drug distributor benefited from its purchase of Medtronic Plc’s (MDT.N) patient care business and a tie-up with drugstore chain CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). The company also raised its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast, sending its shares up nearly 5 percent in early trading on Thursday. U.S. drug distributors have partnered with big retail chains to buy generic drugs at lower costs to counter declining prices for such treatments. Cardinal’s joint venture with CVS, Red Oak Sourcing, delivered better-than-planned results on the cost side, Chief Executive Mike Kauffman said on a post-earnings conference call.  Rival McKesson Corp (MCK.N) also reported a quarterly profit above analysts’ estimates last week, helped by its partnership with Walmart (WMT.N). Cardinal’s quarterly revenue in its the pharmaceuticals division came in at $31.1 billion, above consensus estimate of $30.46 billion compiled by Cowen & Co. The results cap off “a distributor earnings season in which all companies signaled stability in core businesses,” said Baird analyst Eric Coldwell. Cardinal’s medical unit, which also makes medical tapes and bandages, posted a 19 percent jump in quarterly revenue to $4 billion, boosted by its acquisition of the Medtronic business last year. Excluding items, Cardinal earned $1.51 per share in the in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The drug distributor raised its 2018 adjusted earnings per share forecast by 40 cents to $5.25-$5.50, above analysts’ estimate of $5.14, on expected benefits from a lower tax rate. Net earnings attributable surged to $1.05 billion, or $3.33 per share, in the second quarter, from $324 million, or $1.02 per share, a year ago. The company recorded a $736 million benefit from income taxes, and said its board had authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program.   Revenue rose to $35.19 billion from $33.15 billion.

482,CVS,Express Scripts would look at Medicare pharmacy drug plan deals: CEO,"(Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co will take a look at any Medicare pharmacy drug plans up for sale including those of Aetna Inc or CVS Health Corp, Express Scripts’ chief executive officer said on Wednesday, as its rivals seek antitrust approvals for their $69 billion deal.  CEO Tim Wentworth was speaking to Wall Street analysts about the company’s interest in expanding managing pharmacy benefits  under the federal Medicare program for older or disabled people a day after the company reported higher fourth-quarter profit. “If a meaningful book of business is coming to the market, we would take a look,” Wentworth said. Analysts have speculated that CVS and Aetna will need to sell some plans to please antitrust regulators.  The CVS-Aetna combination would lower costs and offer more competitive Part D Medicare drug plans, CVS spokesman David Palombi said. The deal is “a complementary transaction with minimal overlap in the Medicare Part D segment and there are many large and significant competitors that offer Part D plans,” Palombi said.  Aetna declined to comment.

485,CVS,Investors pile into CVS $40 billion M&A; bond,"NEW YORK (IFR) - Strong investor demand for CVS Health’s US$40bn M&A; bond gave a shot of confidence to the US high-grade bond market Tuesday after a recent bout of volatility in the usually rock solid asset class. Order books of more than US$120bn for the nine-tranche trade - the third largest US dollar high-grade corporate deal on record, according to IFR data - brought some relief after new issues have traded wider in secondary of late. “This is the deal of 2018,” Matt Brill, senior portfolio manager at Invesco, told IFR.  “The market needs this to do well.” The CVS bond, which will help finance the US$69bn acquisition of health insurer Aetna, had been hailed as a crucial test for the market that has provided some of the largest corporations with cheap financing for several consecutive years.     CVS had been eyeing other currencies as well due to the large amount of debt it needed to raise.  But hefty demand for the US dollar offering helped alleviate concerns about investor demand that has tapered off in recent weeks, according to Lipper data. The asset class, for example, last month saw its biggest weekly outflow since November 2016. Analysts have also warned about wilting demand from foreign investors as hedging costs have risen. “The market at this juncture still has the capacity to finance large scale transactions,” said a banker not directly involved in the CVS deal. Some investors, however, cautioned that other would-be borrowers may not find as welcome a reception. Some, for example, gave CVS credit for the acquisition which will create one of the largest companies in the US by revenue and help cut costs. It could also help the firm resist Amazon’s entry into drug distribution. “CVS has fundamentally changed its business through this acquisition,” Janelle Woodward, global co-head of income at BMO Global Asset Management, said. Brill described the merged entity - the M&A; deal is yet to close - as almost a conglomerate. “It will have multiple sources of revenue, and will be an industry leader in multiple areas,” Brill said. To win over investors, CVS also offered a steep discount on some of the tranches that include a special mandatory redemption clause. That clause, offered on every tranche except the 30-year, requires CVS to buy the bonds back from investors at a price of 101 if the merger fails to close by September 3 next year. Bond buyers hailed the discount as a break-through. Still, the huge order book is one of the largest ever recorded in the corporate bond market, according to IFR data. Mindful of the recent choppy backdrop, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan - active bookrunners on the CVS trade - closed books unusually early by 10:30am New York time, and launched it just after midday.  That strategy also allowed accounts whose orders weren’t filled to buy bonds in the secondary market on the same day of pricing, Brill said. The deal was trading tighter in the gray market on Tuesday afternoon after launch. Relatively generous initial price thoughts on the trade, comprising maturities ranging from two to 30 years, certainly helped turn heads on the buyside from the get go.. IFR calculated new issue concession of between 30bp-40bp across the deal at IPTs stage, based on where outstanding bonds from CVS were trading. The only exceptions were the two and three-year bonds, which began with NICs closer to 15bp-25bp. But as order books swelled, and leads pulled in spreads, NICs were closer to 10bp-18bp on the longest tranches at launch, and 2bp-4bp on the two shortest dated offerings, IFR calculations show. Only Verizon’s US$49bn bond from 2013, and Anheuser-Busch InBev’s US$46bn bond issue from 2016 have been larger than the CVS issue. InBev, by comparison, paid new issue concessions ranging between negative 5bp and plus 20bp on its multi-tranche offering that helped finance its acquisition of SABMiller, according to IFR calculations. The CVS deal, rated Baa1 by Moody’s and BBB by S&P;, is due to price later on Tuesday. ",3062018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cvs-bond/investors-pile-into-cvs-40-billion-ma-bond-idUSKCN1GI2YO

491,CVS,"UPDATE 1-Judge weighs what evidence U.S. can use to block AT&T;, Time Warner merger","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T; Inc sought to persuade a judge on Monday to throw out evidence the government seeks to use in a trial that begins this week to show that the company’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc would harm consumers and competitors. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier, which owns DirecTV and other services with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN. Opening arguments in the trial, which could shape the future of U.S. media ownership, are set for Wednesday before Judge Richard Leon in Washington. On Monday, Daniel Petrocelli, the lawyer for AT&T;, argued that many exhibits that the government planned to bring should be rejected either because they were irrelevant or because the person writing them was not a decision-maker. Petrocelli objected, for example, to a document from DirecTV that was written before it was acquired by AT&T; that warned of the dangers of higher prices because of a previous media merger. The Justice Department’s Eric Welsh defended the decision to present it. “They are also a market participant,” he said. Welsh also indicated that an official from Google’s YouTube could testify on the importance of the Turner channel to DirecTV’s rivals, which would help show AT&T;’s future ability to raise prices. AT&T; rejected settlement offers from the Justice Department, including government proposals to shed either its DirecTV division or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting assets, which include CNN.  The government has argued that the deal could allow a more powerful AT&T; to raise prices for pay TV rivals and subscribers while hampering the development of online video. They estimate it will hike a subscriber’s monthly cable bill by 45 cents. AT&T; denies that prices would rise and plans to argue the deal is necessary for it to compete with media companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, according to court documents filed before the trial. AT&T; Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes and programming executives from rival companies are expected to testify during the trial that the judge has estimated would last six to eight weeks. Looming over the trial is the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the deal on the campaign trail and again as president, may have influenced the Justice Department’s decision to oppose the transaction.  AT&T; lawyers have said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing Trump’s statements that the deal was bad for consumers and the country. Leon last month rejected a bid by AT&T; to force the government to disclose any White House communications that AT&T; lawyers believe may have shed light on the matter. AT&T; did not raise any arguments relating to Trump in its final pretrial brief filed earlier this month. The outcome of the AT&T;/Time Warner case could affect other pending “vertical” mergers, in which different parts of a supply chain, rather than rivals in the same business, join together.

494,CVS,"UPDATE 1-FDA working on a ""dozen"" policies to boost copycat biotech drugs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food & Drug Administration is working on around a dozen actions to boost use of cheaper versions of expensive biotech medicines, the head of the agency Scott Gottlieb said on Wednesday. The United States has lagged behind Europe in use of so-called biosimilars, to the frustration of FDA policymakers who are starting to approve such products but who are seeing other impediments to getting them to consumers. Biological drugs for treating serious conditions such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis are complex molecules made inside living cells.  “There’s no silver bullet here in terms of trying to make this market really go gangbusters. I think this is going to be a slow build,” Gottlieb told CNBC’s Healthy Returns conference in New York. “We’re going to be coming out with a set of policies, multiple policies, about a dozen policies that I think incrementally will each move the ball in a direction trying to create more avenues for biosimilar competition.” His comments followed a speech earlier this month when he criticized the health industry for “Kabuki drug-pricing constructs”. One specific action Gottlieb said the FDA was working on was a plan to make it harder to tweak original branded biological medicines so that drug makers can extend patents. This should make it easier for makers of copies, who are able to sell their versions once patents expire. Gottlieb also said he was concerned about the impact of deals like the CVS Health purchase of Aetna Inc on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to block the entry of cheaper copycat drugs. As the pharmacy benefit managers, which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and also run large mail-order pharmacies, and the drug supply chains consolidate, Gottlieb said, they are making it easier for pharmaceutical companies to block access to drugs produced by the generic companies that are legally entitled to create cheaper copycat versions of the medicines.  “We don’t have direct purview over it but we do have something to say about it and we’re going to be speaking to the PBMs about it,” Gottlieb said. Cigna Corp also agreed recently to buy pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Inc. A key battleground in the biosimilars fight is Remicade, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease marketed by Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer, which sells a cheaper biosimilar version, has sued J&J; over its Remicade contracts with health insurers, arguing that they are anti-competitive. It contends J&J; is offering discounts on Remicade in exchange for essentially excluding Pfizer’s drug from insurance coverage, keeping it out of the hands of doctors and patients. J&J; says Pfizer’s suit is without merit. ",3282018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-gottlieb/update-1-fda-working-on-a-dozen-policies-to-boost-copycat-biotech-drugs-idUSL1N1RA0QH

506,CVS,UPDATE 1-Glenview's Robbins says talk of Amazon's entering pharma is overblown,"(Adds details about pick) NEW YORK, April 23 (Reuters) - Glenview Capital Management Chief Executive Larry Robbins said on Monday at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York that he still likes a trio of stocks he already owns, citing CVS Health Corp, McKesson Corp and Express Scripts Holdings. He also said speculation that Amazon.com Inc might be looking to enter the pharmacy business and possibly threaten these companies’ business is overblown. Amazon has not made significant hires in the pharmacy business and does not have the licenses needed to enter the business, Robbins said. Amazon’s entry into the business of selling medications, is “neither imminent, assured, nor likely to succeed,” he said. Speculation mounted late last year that the online retail giant might be ready to target pharmacies and the selling of drugs next after buying grocer Whole Foods earlier in 2017. The speculation about Amazon has weighed on CVS’s stock price. But Robbins was confident his stock picks could rise. Within two year, Robbins said, Express Scripts’ stock could climb 69 percent while McKesson’s stock could post returns of 136 percent and CVS could climb 96 percent. “Amazon fears are dramatically overblown,” he said.

508,CVS,Health insurer Aetna beats estimates despite higher flu costs,"(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), which has agreed to be bought by CVS Health Inc (CVS.N), reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday as an adjustment for low healthcare spending late last year offset a rise in flu-related costs.   U.S. drugstore operator CVS agreed in December to acquire Aetna for $69 billion, seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies. Aetna said it expects the deal, which is undergoing an antitrust review at the U.S. Department of Justice, to close in  the second half of 2018. Aetna said its overall medical loss ratio — the percent of premiums spent on health insurance claims — improved to 80.4 percent from 82.5 percent a year earlier.  The company said that its commercial medical cost ratio was helped by exiting the individual insurance market created by former President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law often called Obamacare. Collecting more revenue to help pay for the reinstatement of a national, industry-wide health insurance fee of 3 percent also helped its overall medical cost ratio. The flu dragged on the ratio by 50 basis points, Aetna said. Aetna’s net income was $1.21 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $381 million, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier that was related to costs for its failed deal to buy Humana Inc. (HUM.N). Excluding items, the company reported earnings of $3.19, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $2.97, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.      Total revenue rose to $15.34 billion from $15.17 billion. ",5012018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-results/health-insurer-aetna-beats-estimates-despite-higher-flu-costs-idUSKBN1I23DL

510,CVS,"CVS beats on higher prescription drug sales, shares up 4 percent","(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Wednesday, helped by higher sales of prescription drugs at its stores, sending its shares up 4.3 percent in trading before the bell. The company also said that it was sticking with its expectations of closing the $69 billion deal to buy Aetna Inc (AET.N) in the second half of the year. CVS’s total same store sales increased 5.8 percent, while pharmacy same store sales surged 7.3 percent on higher prices of branded drugs and partnerships with other pharmacy benefits managers. Overall revenue from the company’s retail business increased 5.6 percent to about $20.4 billion. However, the company’s retail business accounts for a shrinking share of its total sales, with most revenue now coming from its pharmacy benefits manager, which serves as a middleman between insurance companies, pharmacies and drugmakers. Net revenue from its pharmacy benefit management business rose 3.2 percent to $32.22 billion, driven by higher claims on costlier drugs among other things.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $998 million, or 98 cents per share, in the reported quarter ended March 31 from $952 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 2.6 percent to $45.69 billion. Excluding items, it earned $1.48 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.41, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
