1,BMY,Innate Pharma shares jump on Bristol-Myers deal,"PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Innate Pharma (IPH.PA) climbed 65 percent on Thursday after it agreed what it called the largest biotech deal ever signed in France with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) for a potential cancer treatment.  Innate Pharma said it granted its U.S.-based partner exclusive worldwide rights to develop, make and sell the anti-cancer antibody, known as IPH2102, which uses the body’s immune system to fight tumors.  Bristol-Myers will fund the antibody’s development and will pay Innate Pharma up to $465 million, including a $35 million upfront sum, linked to meeting certain targets.  The French company will also receive double-digit royalty payments on worldwide net sales, the companies said in a statement.  The IPH2102 antibody is still at an early development stage, being tested on cancer patients in a so-called Phase I clinical trial, and analysts described the price paid by Bristol-Myers as impressive.  “Such amounts became rare lately in the French biotech sector and are usually devoted to more advanced molecules,” Aurel BGC analysts wrote in a research note.  “The amounts of the deal are quite significant compared to Innate’s size,” Bryan Garnier analyst Sebastien Malafosse said.  “Bristol-Myers Squibb’s know-how will accelerate the product’s development and we think this announcement reinforces the stock’s attractiveness and visibility,” he added.  Shares in Innate Pharma, based in the southern French city of Marseilles, were trading at 2.2 euros at 1050 GMT in a flat Paris market, giving the company a market value of around 82.5 million euros ($118 million).  Innate Pharma posted sales of 4.3 million euros in 2010, down 44 percent year-on-year, and a net loss of 13.6 million.  The company is focusing on developing monoclonal antibodies, which are tailor-made proteins that can detect the proteins stuck to cancer cells and block their growth.  Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) owns nearly 15 percent of Innate Pharma’s share capital, while France’s FSI sovereign investment fund holds almost 13 percent, according to the company’s website.

3,BMY,"Analysis: Biotech buys seen in cancer, immunology, neurology","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Biotech companies focused on cancer treatments are some of the hottest acquisition targets in the drug industry, growing in value with novel drugs that have the potential for high price tags.  Other takeover candidates include companies with promising drugs for immunological or neurological disorders  The group already has lofty valuations, partly fueled by takeover speculation. But they could still command premiums as high as 30 to 40 percent from larger drugmakers pressed to find new growth, according to investment bankers and industry sources.  “We have seen some very successful oncology drugs,” said Fariba Ghodsian, chief investment officer at hedge fund DAFNA Capital. “Novel drugs with novel targets are in demand.”  Current takeover candidates — all of which operate at a loss — include Dendreon DNDN.O, Pharmacyclics PCYC.O, Synta Pharmaceuticals SNTA.O, Threshold Pharmaceuticals THLD.O, Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O) and Exelixis (EXEL.O), analysts and industry bankers said.  “Over the next year or two, you’d be right on at least half of these names (getting sold),” said one investment banker who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  Past successes in oncology-related deals include Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) 2009 purchase of Medarex, which has yielded the first successful treatment for melanoma, but the field is riddled with risk when it comes to the actual value of medical breakthroughs and regulatory scrutiny.  Seattle Genetics is a case in point. Shares in the company are up 32 percent this year, on hopes for its experimental drug to treat two rare types of blood cancer, compared with an 11 percent gain for the Amex Biotechnology Index. The medicine, Adcetris, is up for review this week by U.S. health regulators who cautioned on Tuesday it may be suitable for a smaller-than-expected patient group.  “Seattle Genetics I feel is very highly valued,” Ghodsian said, adding that because the drug would be the company’s first commercial product, potential acquirers are likely to hold off until they see how it does in the marketplace.  Another cancer drug developer with an expensive share price is Dendreon, which last year launched sales of Provenge, a novel vaccine treatment for prostate cancer that costs $93,000 per year. The company’s shares have gained 10 percent in 2011.  “They have strong pricing power with Provenge,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “A deal could hit the bottom line (of an acquirer) a lot quicker than some of the other firms out there.”  Ghodsian said Dendreon will also likely “have to show that the launch is going really well for a period of time,” before any buyers step up.  The allure of new cancer drugs is high — growth in the global oncology market is expected to be twice that of the overall pharmaceutical market, reaching up to $80 billion in sales by 2012, according to IMS Health.  The drug research firm also estimates that $25.4 billion in U.S. drug sales are at risk of generic competition this year as patents expire on iconic drug brands like Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) Lipitor or Bristol and Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) Plavix.  At the same time, large drug makers are cutting research and development, giving them a greater appetite for buying products with significant sales potential.  In addition to cancer, Alzheimer’s, rheumatoid arthritis and other “old age ailments” are cornerstone areas that all big pharma need to have more exposure to, bankers said.  Targets range from Biogen Idec (BIIB.O), with a price-to-earnings ratio near 25, to smaller companies like InterMune ITMN.O, which trades at around 17 times trailing 12-month earnings. Shares in the S&P 500 trade, on average, at around 16 times earnings.  Conover said Biogen is an attractive buyout candidate given its relatively robust drug development pipeline combined with the profit-boost of existing products like multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri.  “There is at least a 30 percent chance of Biogen being taken out in the next three years,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said, citing the company’s diversified product lines and capacity for manufacturing biotech drugs.  Full data from a key trial of the company’s experimental MS drug, BG-12, will be presented this fall. Positive initial results, announced in April, sent Biogen shares up as much as 24 percent to an all-time high.  Two other biotechs with recently launched drugs — Human Genome Sciences HGSI.O with lupus treatment Benlysta and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX.O) with hepatitis drug Incivek — have new drugs that will define their value.  “They have to prove that they can deliver on the blockbuster potential of these franchises,” said RBC’s Yee.  He named Pharmasset VRUS.O as another potential buyout target involved in development of hepatitis drugs.  Ghodsian cited InterMune, which saw its pulmonary fibrosis drug Esbriet approved by European regulators in March, as a strong takeover candidate, even though the company said in April that it was not considering a sale.  “The feedback from physicians is that it (Esbriet) will be used extensively in Europe,” she said. “The valuation is relatively low.” InterMune is conducting a separate pivotal trial of the drug for review by U.S. regulators.

The pill, with the chemical name dapagliflozin, could also be less effective if patients had kidney problems, reviewers from the Food and Drug Administration said in documents released on Friday.   Some analysts still think the FDA’s panel of outside experts will recommend the drug for approval on Tuesday. But analysts said the drug’s problems for the liver could be the biggest obstacle to approval for sale in the United States.   Bristol-Myers shares were down 0.8 percent in morning New York Stock Exchange trading, while AstraZeneca dipped 0.1 percent. The Standard & Poor’s pharmaceutical index .GSPCARD fell 0.7 percent.   Dapagliflozin could be the first in a new class of diabetes drugs designed to block glucose from being absorbed into the bloodstream through the kidneys, allowing more sugar to be excreted with urine.   People with diabetes have inadequate blood sugar control, which can lead to heart disease and stroke, damage to the kidneys or nerves, and blindness.   However, FDA reviewers said the pill probably caused at least one person - and possibly two — to develop a potentially life-threatening liver injury. According to FDA guidelines, two confirmed cases of drug-induced liver injury mean the pill is probably linked to this problem.   “At the least, we expect a strong warning in the label for the possibility of liver injury, and we also think there could be a requirement for liver function monitoring,” said ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum.   “This could reduce the competitiveness of (the drug) in the real world.”   Schoenebaum earlier said a rejection of the drug would cut Bristol-Myers’ 2015 earnings by 3 percent to 6 percent.   On average, analysts have forecast dapagliflozin’s annual sales at $631 million by 2015, according to Thomson Pharma.   In clinical trials, the drug has been linked to a higher number of bladder and breast cancer. [ID:nN1E75O04E]   However, the FDA said in the documents that the trials did not determine whether less than 10 patients with cancer were statistically significant, out of more than 5,000 taking the experimental drug. They asked the advisory panel to consider the issue next week.   The reviewers also mentioned some smaller potential issues with bone safety, and the long-term effects of urinary and genital infections.   Dapagliflozin leads to more sugar in the urine, which may serve as a nutrient for bacteria and pathogens that can cause infections, Bristol-Myers said earlier.

8,BMY,Brain swelling may be common with Alzheimer's drugs,"PARIS (Reuters) - Three patients treated with an experimental Bristol-Myers Squibb Alzheimer’s drug have developed a type of brain swelling known as vasogenic edema, but the side effect may be common in Alzheimer’s patients, researchers said on Monday.  Vasogenic edema may even be a sign that drugs are clearing a protein tied to Alzheimer’s from the brain, researchers said at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris.  The results could have bearing on the closely watched drug bapineuzumab, being developed by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Vasogenic edema became a major concern after a 2008 mid-stage study of 240 patients on bapineuzumab found a dozen cases.  But while previous cases of swelling were seen in drugs that use antibodies to remove clumps of the Alzheimer’s-related protein beta amyloid from the brain, the Bristol drug BMS-708163 is a gamma-secretase inhibitor that targets the disease with a different mechanism.  “No one had thought this was likely in a trial of a gamma-secretase inhibitor,” Dr. Reisa Sperling of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston told the meeting. She added that the presence of the effect in different classes of drugs showed the side effect may be more common than previously thought.  Sperling said the side effect may be related to the clearing of amyloid from the brain, or it may be these side effects occur spontaneously in patients with Alzheimer’s.  Although vasogenic edema was visible on brain scans, none of the patients in the Bristol-Myers study had clinical symptoms and all three had a mutation in the APOE4 gene which raises the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  One of the three patients had signs of brain swelling at the beginning of the study, and Sperling said brain scans showed that patient’s condition continued to worsen over the course of the six-month study.  “Whether the treatment increased it, I don’t know,” she said in an interview.  The field of Alzheimer’s research is littered with drug failures, providing little hope to the nearly 36 million people who suffer from it worldwide. Eli Lilly and Co last year halted two studies of its gamma-secretase drug, called semagacestat, after it worsened patients’ symptoms of dementia in late-stage clinical trials.  In January, Lilly said one patient in an ongoing trial of its antibody drug solanezumab temporarily developed vasogenic edema, although it was not clear whether the patient was taking the Lilly drug or a placebo.  Concerns over the bapineuzumab study in 2008 prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue stricter safety guidelines for clinical trials of drugs that alter amyloid in the brain.  But researchers said last week the FDA agreed to modify those restrictions after a year-long study that showed these types of events may be common in people with Alzheimer’s disease.  Sperling said the FDA has been working with researchers and companies to allow more patients to be involved in drug trials for Alzheimer’s.

The Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 9-6 on Tuesday against recommending approval of the once-a-day drug, called dapagliflozin, for adults with Type 2 diabetes.   People with diabetes have inadequate blood sugar control, which can lead to heart disease and stroke, damage to the kidneys or nerves, and blindness.   Dapagliflozin belongs to a new class of diabetes drugs designed to allow more sugar to be excreted with urine.   Analysts, on average, have forecast annual dapagliflozin sales at $631 million by 2015, according to Thomson Pharma.   Panel members said the clinical data did not provide enough certainty about the drug’s cancer, liver and kidney risks, as well as its effectiveness — especially for the elderly.   “There are a whole host of questions that we need to know more about,” said panel member Dr. Peter Savage, senior adviser to the director of the diabetes division at the National Institutes of Health.   “The problem is that if you make a mistake, making a drug widely available that causes cancer would cause much more harm than designing another study that could give a quick answer.”   An estimated 200 million people across the world, and close to 26 million in the United States, have diabetes. Most have Type 2 diabetes, the kind linked to poor diet and lack of exercise.   Since patients now live for decades with the disease, the safety profile of treatments has become even more important. Panel members called for more clinical studies.   Seamus Fernandez, pharmaceutical analyst at Leerink Swann, said the panel’s decision was not a big surprise given the safety problems in previous clinical trials.   “For both companies, it’s a bit of a disappointment,” he said. “(But) this probably ends up as a delay, not death of a drug, and I think they live to fight another another day.”   The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels and is due to make a decision on the drug by Oct. 28.   Given the panel’s call for more studies, Fernandez said FDA approval was one to two years away.   In a two-year study, nine cases of bladder cancer were observed in 5,478 patients treated with the experimental drug, compared with one bladder cancer seen in the 3,156 patients assigned to control groups.   Similarly, nine people got breast cancer in the treatment group, versus one person in the control group. [ID:nN1E75O04E]   The drug also caused at least one person , and possibly two, to develop a potentially life-threatening liver injury.   Panelists also said it was unclear whether the drug would be effective in elderly patients, many of whom already have kidney problems. FDA staff reviewers said the drug was less effective in patients with kidney problems. [ID:nN1E76E0MH]   Advisory panel members were divided on whether clinical studies should happen before or after the drug is approved.   “It was the closest of calls,” panel member Dr. Erica Brittain, mathematical statistician at the National Institutes of Health, said of her negative vote.   “I changed my mind about four times in the last 10 seconds. I think the level of evidence about the cancer is fairly weak evidence. It’s just that the uncertainty is still there.”   The panel’s recommendation came out minutes before the close of regular trading. U.S.-traded shares of AstraZeneca finished unchanged at $48.73, while Bristol-Myers shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $28.81.

15,BMY,AstraZeneca shares jump as U.S. approves Brilinta,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca shares jumped 3.5 percent on Thursday, buoyed by U.S. approval for its new heart drug Brilinta as a rival to Plavix, the world’s second-biggest selling medicine.  But industry analysts warned the London-based drugmaker still had a battle on its hands to sell the product in the world’s top market, given its interaction with aspirin and expected launch of cheap generic copies of Plavix next year.  Investors had been on tenterhooks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision, and the positive verdict more than offset a setback just 24 hours earlier for a diabetes pill being developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Deutsche Bank analysts Mark Clark said he had factored in only a 50 percent chance of U.S. approval, and removing this risk-adjustment to U.S. Brilinta sales would lift his 2015 earnings per share forecast by 4 to 5 percent.  Brilinta is a new competitor to Sanofi’s and Bristol-Myers’ $9 billion-a-year seller Plavix, which is now facing cut-price generic competition in many markets.  Analysts, on average, expect global sales of Brilinta of about $1.4 billion in 2015, according to the latest Thomson Reuters Pharma data. That may rise in light of the FDA decision.  The fate of the new medicine is critical for AstraZeneca which, unlike more diversified Big Pharma rivals, is betting everything on its ability to bring such new prescription drugs to market. It badly needs new products as older drugs lose patent protection.  Despite being approved in more than 30 other countries, Brilinta’s U.S. prospects had been uncertain because North American patients taking the drug did worse than those on Plavix in a big study.  One explanation was that Brilinta interacts adversely with aspirin, typically given in much higher doses to U.S. heart patients — a hypothesis the FDA accepted by warning Brilinta should only be used with low-dose aspirin.  The issue is still not resolved decisively, however, and analyst Tim Anderson of Bernstein said AstraZeneca may run confirmatory studies to “strengthen the image of the brand.”  “Without putting this issue to rest, and with the label warning as it currently reads, payers in the U.S. will have ammunition to disadvantage Brilinta, especially knowing that U.S. generic Plavix will launch in May 2012,” he said in a note.  AstraZeneca spokeswoman Abigail Baron said the U.S. price for Brilinta had yet to be finalized, but on the basis of the clinical evidence the company believes the drug should be priced at a premium to branded Plavix.  AstraZeneca faces a lengthy process of negotiating with hospital formularies, protocol committees, government and managed care reimbursement bodies to bring its new medicine to patients.  “Navigating these steps, which are necessary before Brilinta will be available to a substantial number of incident ACS (acute coronary syndrome) patients, will be a key focus for the next 12 months,” AstraZeneca said.  Analyst JeffreyHolford of Jefferies, a long-term skeptic of Brilinta’s prospects, said he expected the medicine to have a poor launch, adding the 12-month roll-out would mean it faced therapeutic substitution pressure from generic Plavix before it could really get going in the U.S.  Jefferies believes Brilinta’s peak sales are unlikely to exceed $1 billion.

16,BMY,UPDATE 3-Gilead 2nd quarter profit rises with HIV drugs," * Q2 EPS $1.00 excluding items vs Street view $0.99   * Revenue $2.14 billion   * Still sees full-year product sales $7.9 bln to $8.1 bln   * Shares flat after hours  (Adds forecast, company comment, share price)   By Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) reported higher second-quarter profit as sales of its most important HIV drugs topped Wall Street estimates, bouncing back from a disappointing first quarter.   Sales of Atripla, which combines Gilead’s Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s (BMY.N) Sustiva into a single pill, rose 15 percent to $822 million, topping analysts’ forecasts of between $810 million and $812 million.   Sales of Truvada rose 11 percent to $711.3 million, also exceeding Wall Street estimates of about $708 million.   First-quarter sales of the two drugs had missed analysts’ estimates as they were hit by temporary cutbacks in state-funded AIDS drug assistance programs in Florida and Texas.   Gilead is expected to unveil key data on its Quad HIV pill later this quarter and said it plans to file its application seeking U.S. approval in the first quarter of 2012.   Quad, which will combine four medicines, is considered to be Gilead’s most important future growth driver by many analysts.   The company said it is also planning to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to amend the Truvada label to include data from recent studies showing the drug can help prevent new HIV infections.   The world’s top maker of HIV medicines posted net profit of $746.2 million, or 93 cents per share, compared with a profit of $712.1 million, or 79 cents per share, a year ago.   Excluding special items, Gilead earned $1.00 per share, beating analysts’ average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   “The sales were a little bit above consensus and our estimates,” said Cowen and Co analyst Philip Nadeau, calling the results “solid.”   “It looks like business did bounce back from the first quarter,” he said.   The company maintained the full-year forecast it provided earlier this year for product sales of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion.   Total revenue for the quarter rose to $2.14 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $2.07 billion.   Revenue from royalties and collaboration fell 19 percent to $97.7 million, primarily due to a drop in royalties from Roche Holding AG ROG.VX for its Tamiflu flu treatment. Tamiflu sales have been lower as fears and flu pandemic preparation subsided from a year ago.   Gilead shares were relatively unchanged in extended trading, slipping 3 cents to $42.13 from their Nasdaq close at $42.16.

17,BMY,Astra's Brilinta to be priced at premium to Plavix," * Brilinta wholesaler cost to be $7.24 per day   * Plavix wholesaler cost $6.08 per day   * Generic Plavix expected in U.S. in May 2012   By Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) said it will price its recently approved blood thinner Brilinta at a premium to widely used rival Plavix in the United States.   The British drugmaker confirmed on Wednesday a wholesaler acquisition cost for Brilinta of $7.24 per day, about 19 percent higher than Plavix, which is sold by Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) Co.   “Brilinta will be priced to reflect the label and its value in treating patients with acute coronary syndrome,” said AstraZeneca spokesman Tony Jewell.   “We believe Brilinta should be priced at a premium because if its label and the safety and efficacy versus clopidogrel,” Jewell said, using the chemical name for Plavix.   In a huge global clinical study that was the basis for Brilinta’s approval, the anti-clotting drug proved safer and more effective than Plavix, although the results among North American patients in the study were less clear cut.   Plavix, the world’s second biggest-selling prescription  drug with annual sales of about $9 billion, has a wholesaler acquisition cost (WAC) of about $6.08 per day.   Eli Lilly’s (LLY.N) Effient, another rival blood clot and stroke preventer that has been slow to gain traction against Plavix, has a WAC of about $5.78 per day, or 5 percent cheaper than Plavix.   “The cost (of Brilinta) to an individual patient will differ depending on that patient’s insurance status,” Jewell said.   Brilinta, which is already available in Europe and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week, is expected to start selling in the United States next month.   “This price seems high to us given the competitive dynamics in the antiplatelet category,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.   He noted that AstraZeneca has a very short window to get Brilinta established in the United States before it finds itself competing with much cheaper generic versions of Plavix.   The blockbuster drug is set to lose U.S. patent protection in May of 2012.   “Coming out with a premium price seems like it will give payers one more reason to push Plavix ahead of Brilinta,” Anderson said.

U.S. regulators approved Yervoy in March for patients with advanced melanoma. Some analysts expect its annual sales to reach up to $6 billion eventually, as it is the first approved drug shown to extend survival of such patients.   Yervoy, given by infusion and costing $120,000 for a full course of treatment, chalked up second-quarter sales of $95 million — well above industry forecasts.   “To come up with nearly $100 million in sales right out of the gate is fantastic,” said Credit Agricole Securities analyst David Maris, who had projected Yervoy sales of $20 million.   Bristol-Myers, whose shares rose 2 percent, is counting on Yervoy to help cushion the blow from an expected plunge in revenue from Plavix, the world’s second-biggest medicine. The blood clot preventer, which has annual sales of $7.5 billion, loses U.S. patent protection in May.   “Bristol provided an overall quality beat, from top to bottom” without cutting back on spending necessary to promote Yervoy and develop its pipeline of experimental drugs, Maris said.   The company plans to seek U.S. approval later this year for a newer blood clot treatment called apixaban that is deemed a potential multibillion-dollar blockbuster. It prevents strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation.   “Bristol-Myers remains hands down the best pipeline story among the U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies we cover,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note on Thursday.   But Standard and Poor’s analyst Herman Saftlas said Bristol-Myers shares trade at a big premium to the drug sector, at almost 13 times expected 2011 per-share earnings, because the company has had more success developing new drugs than most rivals.   “The stock is expensive; we think it is adequately priced,” said Saftlas, who has a “hold” rating on Bristol-Myers.   The company nudged up its full-year 2011 profit forecast to between $2.20 and $2.30 per share, excluding special items. Its prior outlook was $2.10 to $2.20.   “The real good news today is that the company is raising its 2011 forecast by 10 cents, when they beat by only a penny in the quarter,” Maris said. “That shows underlying strength and the company’s belief in its business.”   Bristol-Myers provided no outlook for 2012, but affirmed its 2013 forecast of $1.95 per share, which would represent about a 3.5 percent decline from 2012 based on Wall Street projections of $2.02 for next year. That suggests relatively stable earnings in the first full year after Plavix goes generic.   Bristol-Myers earned $1.31 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $1.27 billion, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier.   Excluding special items, it earned 56 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 55 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Bristol-Myers’ effective tax rate jumped to 27 percent in the quarter, from 20.4 percent a year earlier, holding back results.   Revenue jumped 14 percent to $5.43 billion, but would have risen only 10 percent if not for the weaker dollar, which boosts the value of sales in overseas markets. Sales sped past Wall Street expectations of $5.04 billion, helped by strong growth for Plavix, schizophrenia drug Abilify and other top company products, as well as Yervoy’s debut.   Plavix sales jumped 15 percent to $1.87 billion, underscoring the importance of the medicine to Bristol-Myers and French partner Sanofi (SASY.PA).   Sales of Abilify, which doesn’t cause the weight gains seen with rival medicines, rose 12 percent to $706 million. Revenue from Sprycel, a relatively newer treatment for leukemia, rose 46 percent to $193 million.   But sales of blood pressure treatment Avapro, already facing generic competition overseas and girding for it in the United States in March, fell 18 percent to $251 million.   Shares of Bristol were up 1.9 percent at $29.15 late on Thursday afternoon.

20,BMY,UPDATE 3-Astra pledges more cash back as times get tougher," * Core EPS target now $7.05-7.35, up from $6.95-7.25   * 2011 share repurchases could reach $5 bln   * Q2 sales $8.43 bln vs consensus $8.24 bln   * Q2 core EPS $1.73 vs consensus $1.72   * Shares up 0.8 pct in weak market   (Adds latest shares, comments from CFO and analyst)	   By Ben Hirschler	   LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca raised its 2011 earnings outlook and promised to hand more cash back to shareholders, following the sale of its Astra Tech dental unit, as times get tougher for the pharmaceuticals group.	   Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker faces dwindling sales of heartburn pill Nexium and challenges to cholesterol fighter Crestor, which is likely to be hit by the arrival of generic copies of Pfizer’s Lipitor later this year.	   Despite this, Chief Executive David Brennan said on Thursday he now expected 2011 core earnings per share (EPS), which exclude some charges, to be in the range of $7.05 to $7.35, up from $6.95-7.25 forecast previously.	   Share repurchases this year could increase to $5 billion, from $4 billion targeted previously, depending upon timing of the proceeds from the sale of Astra Tech.	   “Although more than 50 percent of the increase in guidance is driven by increased share buyback, in our view this reflects strong financial and strategic discipline from management,” said MF Global analyst Justin Smith. 	   AstraZeneca shares gained 0.8 percent by 0740 GMT in a weak London stock market.	   Sales rose a modest 3 percent in the second quarter to $8.43 billion and the company generated core pretax profit of $3.22 billion, equivalent to core EPS down 3 percent at $1.73.	   Analysts had expected sales of $8.24 billion and core EPS, of $1.72, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   AstraZeneca received a significant boost last week when U.S. regulators approved its new heart drug Brilinta, but investors remain concerned that the group lacks enough new drugs to make up for those losing patent expiry.	   In addition to Nexium, which is already off-patent in key European markets, U.S. protection for schizophrenia medicine Seroquel will expire next year and the patent on Crestor runs out in 2016.	   Over the next five years, analysts forecast a steady decline in overall sales at the London-based group because of heavy losses to generics — a trend that contrasts with cross-town rival GlaxoSmithKline , where sales are set to increase.	   AstraZeneca lost another new drug from its pipeline with the discontinuation of zibotentan for prostate cancer, although hopes had not been very high for the medicine.	   Quarterly sales of Crestor, the company’s biggest-selling product, were 15 percent higher at $1.71 billion, which was better than the market had expected and puzzled some analysts.	   Mark Clark of Deutsche Bank said there was “a big disconnect” between U.S. Crestor prescription growth of just 2 percent and sales growth in that market of 17 percent. 	   This was unlikely to be fully explained by price rises and business mix, and could perhaps reflect wholesaler stocking, he said.	   Nexium generated global sales of $1.11 billion, down 14 percent.	   Brilinta sales were only $2 million in the quarter but Chief Financial Officer Simon Lowth told reporters it was too early to assess the new drug’s performance, since the company is still negotiating reimbursement and other issues in many markets.	   Brilinta will be sold for 19 percent more than Sanofi  and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s hugely successful Plavix in the key U.S. market — a bold pricing strategy that Lowth said was justified by strong cost-effectiveness data.	   AstraZeneca trades on the lowest multiple of any major European drug company, with the shares fetching 7 times this year’s expected earnings against 12 times for GSK, which gave an upbeat outlook at its results on Tuesday. 	   Given its long-term growth profile, some analysts have speculated AstraZeneca may seek a sizeable acquisition to help fill the sales gap. 	   CEO Brennan, however, has said in the past that his focus is on smaller deals and alliances — and Lowth reiterated that the group was not interested in large-scale deals.

22,BMY,Lawmakers may relax FDA drug conflict rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers likely will change the criteria for advisers reviewing new medicines next year because of complaints that the rules meant to prevent conflicts of interest make it harder to find real experts.  Congressional lawmakers may require the Food and Drug Administration to relax the rules that bar advisers from reviewing a drug if they have even indirect financial ties to related manufacturers, as part of an FDA funding bill.  Senators raised the issue during a hearing last week at the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.  “Based on today’s hearing and the comments from Senators Franken and Enzi, I think there is a good chance that this issue could end up in the final FDA user fee bill,” said a congressional staff member familiar with the matter. The staff member was referring to Mike Enzi, the top Republican on the committee and Al Franken, a Democratic committee member.  Fees from makers of drugs and medical devices provide more than a third of the FDA’s funding, which means that the bill often serves as a vehicle for broader FDA-related changes.  The agency often must delay panel meetings while it searches for experts without conflicts, lawmakers and FDA officials say. Top doctors are usually the ones drugmakers hire as speakers or consultants.  “We have had difficulty in recruiting highly qualified people. And we’ve had delays in having panels because of this,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA’s drugs center, told a House of Representatives hearing earlier this month.  The result is that 23 percent of FDA advisory panels have vacancies, more than double the agency’s stated goal, according to the FDA’s quarterly report at the end of May.  The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisers, but it usually does, leading to scrutiny of who is providing advice.  The FDA tightened guidelines in 2007 to minimize industry ties that could sway a panelist’s view, partly inspired by the scandal with Merck’s pain reliever Vioxx.  Ten of the 32 panelists advising the FDA on the drug consulted for drugmakers. Nine of the 10 recommended putting the drug back on the market after it was pulled in 2004 over concerns about heart risk.  The restrictions go too far, say lawmakers who want the FDA to approve more new medicines, in part because they promote American jobs.  “No longer can we deny experts simply because they have ties to industry,” said Georgia Representative Phil Gingrey during a House of Representative hearing on FDA funding last month. The committee’s chairman, Fred Upton from Michigan, called the conflict of interest rules “rigid and unrealistic.”  Industry executives, who want the FDA to speed drug approvals, also support relaxing the rules. Biogen Idec CEO George Scangos said the guidelines “exclude a lot of people who would be the best qualified.”  Dr. Abraham Thomas, a specialist in diabetes, obesity and bone and mineral disorders, would seem to be the perfect expert to advise the FDA about a new AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb diabetes pill, which was also tied to some cancer risks and liver and bone injury.  But Thomas works at Henry Ford Hospital, which received as much as $50,000 to study a competing diabetes medicine.  Under the guidelines, even indirect financial links to a competitor barred Dr. Thomas from participating in an advisory panel for the diabetes pill, called dapagliflozin, without a waiver. The FDA decided to grant him one of six waivers given this year, citing his expertise.  Limits on the number of waivers the agency can issue mean the FDA must exclude some experts, which critics say means settling for advice from second-tier specialists who make uninformed decisions.  Ira Loss of Washington Analysis calls the current rules “overkill” for lumping together those with a direct financial relationship to a company or competitor with those who have more indirect links, such as Dr. Thomas.  “If a doctor is involved in a clinical trial, he shouldn’t be allowed on the panel,” he said. “But the rules about the institution where you work. I think that’s ridiculous. ... The result is that you have people on the advisory committee who have no idea what they’re talking about.”  Others say that the agency is not looking hard enough.  A March study from the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine found that 44 percent of cardiologists do not have industry ties.  The study “flat out dismisses this idea that there are no experts who don’t have relationships,” said Eric Campbell, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and one of the study’s authors.  “There are lots of people out there who are smart and who don’t have conflicts of interest,” said Sid Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. “It just takes much more work for the FDA to find them. But the result is you have much less tainting of the panel discussion.  Advocates of stronger rules say the agency lacks the power to force full disclosure, and defines conflicts too narrowly. Members with past financial ties to a company are not considered under the rules, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families.  “Those ties affect their voting, whether or not they currently are on the payroll,” she wrote in an email. “Research shows that even small gifts, such as an expensive meal or a $500 honorarium, will affect how a doctor or faculty member feels about a company and could affect how they vote.”  Consumer advocates and lawmakers are more likely to agree when it comes to reviewing drugs for rare diseases.  “If waivers need to be granted, we hope that the FDA will limit them to rare and neglected diseases where there are truly few experts available,” Consumers Union wrote in comments to the FDA’s conflicts of interest regulation.  FDA Commissioner Hamburg said calls to relax some conflict of interest rules were “a valid concern.  “Especially when you’re talking about rare and unusual diseases, getting new experts is more challenging, as many were involved in the development or trials of drugs under consideration,” she told the Senate hearing last week.  “I’m not surprised this issue keeps coming up,” Hamburg said after the hearing.

As the economy improves, manufacturers of machine parts, cars and other goods ramp up production and pay Deutsche Post to transport parts and finished products.	   Europe’s biggest express delivery and mail company said on Tuesday it now expects full-year operating profit to reach the upper end of the outlook range of 2.2-2.4 billion euros ($3.2-3.5 billion), compared with consensus of 2.36 billion.	   The positive earnings trend would last into 2012 if the global economy continues to recover, Deutsche Post said.	   “The cyclical divisions showed an excellent performance in particular in view of slowing economic growth and what we saw from competitors,” WestLB analyst Raimon Kaufeld said.	   “Express showed roughly twice the margin reported by TNT (Express) as underlying development, forwarding matched the strong earnings growth reported by DSV , and the progress at supply chain is significantly better than that seen from almost any competitor.”	   FedEx Corp and Dutch TNT Express have both reported better than expected quarterly results as cost controls offset high fuel prices.  	   Deutsche Post’s supply chain business, which generates about a quarter of group revenue, agreed new contracts representing about 540 million euros in annual revenue in the first half and more than doubled its operating margin to 3.6 percent.	   Deutsche Post will run a high-security warehouse for Philips  , distribute drugs made by Bristol-Myers Squibb  in the United States and deliver cars to dealerships in Scotland for BMW , which earlier reported consensus-busting quarterly profits. 	   Deutsche Post’s second-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) more than doubled to 562 million euros, beating consensus of 542 million.	   Its shares gained 1 percent to 12.14 euros by 0815 GMT, while Germany’s blue-chip DAX index fell 0.5 percent.	   Aside from demand for supply chain services, results were also helped by the sale of unprofitable express businesses in Britain and France last year and by Deutsche Post’s ability to pass on higher fuel costs to customers.	   The company has raised prices for express delivery in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa this year, and Rosen said it was able to fully pass on higher costs in the second quarter.	   Deutsche Post also sent more express shipments with a guaranteed delivery time — the most profitable category — driven by demand in Asia, where it generates about a fifth of group revenue.	   The company has benefited from growth in emerging markets as its customers grew there, and finance chief Larry Rosen said on Tuesday he saw good growth prospects for regions such as China, India and Latin America in the second half of this year.

24,BMY,Pfizer interested in over-the-counter Lipitor: report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is interested in selling a non-prescription version of its Lipitor cholesterol drug after it loses U.S. patent protection, but would likely face a battle with regulators because of safety concerns, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.  The report, citing people familiar with the matter, said Pfizer is hopeful that regulators will allow an over-the-counter form of Lipitor. It would help Pfizer squeeze new sales out of Lipitor once the nearly $11 billion-a-year drug begins facing competition from generic prescription forms of the medicine in November, the Journal said.  The report said rival drugmaker Merck & Co in recent years failed to convince the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow it to sell an over-the-counter version of its older Mevacor cholesterol drug.  Mevacor, Lipitor and other top-selling cholesterol fighters belong to a class of medicines called statins that can cause liver and muscle damage in a small percentage of patients.  Pfizer spokesman Ray Kerins declined to comment on the report, when asked by Reuters, but said Pfizer has “strategic plans in place for Lipitor’s loss of exclusivity.”  ",8032011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-lipitor/pfizer-interested-in-over-the-counter-lipitor-report-idUSTRE7726G420110803

28,BMY,Bayer eyes Pfizer's animal health business: report,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Bayer (BAYGn.DE) is considering whether to bid for the animal health unit of Pfizer (PFE.N) should the world’s largest drugmaker divest a business valued at as much as $16 billion.  “If it is up for sale, we will have a look at it,” Bayer Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers told German business weekly WirtschaftsWoche.  Animal health is a lucrative market since people in developed economies spend a lot on their pets. Moreover, in comparison to human drugs, the business is not as strictly regulated.  Pfizer’s animal health business develops products for livestock and pets, and operates in more than 60 countries. It posted revenue of about $3.6 billion last year, making it one of the world’s largest in the field. Analysts put the value of the business at $10 billion to $16 billion.  Bayer had net financial debt excluding pension liabilities of 7.40 billion euros at the end of the June, which is some 300 million euros more than it earned last year before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and special items.

30,BMY,CORRECTED - US approval of Roche melanoma drug may come early,"  (Corrects FDA review deadline in paragraph 4 to Oct. 28 from Nov. 11)  * FDA approval could come as early as this week-source   * Simultaneous approval of diagnostic test expected   * Roche drug would compete with Bristol’s Yervoy   By Deena Beasley   LOS ANGELES, Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are moving quickly with Roche’s ROG.VX application for targeted melanoma drug vemurafenib, which could receive approval as early as this week, according to a source familiar with the situation.   A pivotal trial found that advanced melanoma patients taking the experimental pill, being developed in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo (4568.T), were 63 percent less likely to die from the disease than patients given chemotherapy.   Vemurafenib, whose brand name is Zelboraf, is designed for patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas, the deadliest form of skin cancer, have the genetic aberration.   Roche filed for U.S. approval of the drug in May and the Food and Drug Administration is slated to decide on the application no later than Oct. 28. Approval of a test to detect the BRAF mutation is expected at the same time.   “We are getting the sense that approval is imminent,” said the source familiar with the matter.   An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing of a decision, but did say the November deadline is “a performance goal post” for the agency, which in the past has approved medicines ahead of time.   In late April, the FDA approved Johnson and Johnson’s (JNJ.N) prostate cancer drug Zytiga about two months before the scheduled deadline.   In March, the FDA approved the first treatment to help patients with advanced melanoma live longer. The drug Yervoy, or ipilimumab, is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N).   Yervoy, which posted better-than-expected sales in the second quarter and costs about $120,000 for a course of therapy, is an antibody designed to spur the immune system to fight off the melanoma.   Analysts have forecast annual Zelboraf sales for Roche of $732 million by 2015, while Bristol’s Yervoy sales are expected to reach $1.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Roche and Bristol have also agreed to collaborate on a novel clinical trial to see if the two melanoma drugs are safe and effective if taken together, potentially allowing them to be prescribed as a drug cocktail. [ID:nN06254719]   Roche’s Genentech unit, which will market the cancer drug in the United States, declined to comment on price. The company estimates that around 9,500 of the 70,000 new cases of melanoma expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year will be advanced forms of the skin cancer, with the BRAF mutation found in about half of all melanoma cases.  The diagnostic test will cost around $150, according to Paul Brown, president of Roche Diagnostics.  “This is really now the exemplar of personalized healthcare ... science and our understanding of disease has fundamentally changed and grown over the last 5 to 10 years,” he said.   If approved, the medicine would be the first new oncology product from Genentech since 2004’s launch of lung cancer drug Tarceva.   Dr. Jeffrey Sosman, director of the melanoma program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee and a vemurafenib trial investigator, said the drug “will have an immediate impact on many patients with melanoma,” particularly those with aggressive disease.   “Ipilimumab has very different characteristics, and in patients with disease that is not so aggressive and you have a much longer period in which to follow them, ipi is a good alternative and could be given initially,” he said.   Sosman also said patients eventually become resistant to Zelboraf, and there is a need for more investigation of combination therapies.   “I’m alive,” said 52-year-old melanoma patient Susan Steel. “I probably wouldn’t be without this drug.”   Diagnosed with melanoma in 2005, Steel has been on vemurafenib since January under an expanded access program and seen her tumor volume shrink as much as 80 percent.   Side effects have included rash, slight hair loss, extreme photosensitivity and joint pain.   “All of this is irrelevant,” Steel said. “I can still talk. I can still make speeches, take care of my children ... I can listen to all the reasons why my daughter doesn’t want to complete her college applications. That was a gift.”   (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Michele Gershberg)  ",8092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/roche-melanoma/corrected-us-approval-of-roche-melanoma-drug-may-come-early-idUSN1E77323B20110809
31,BMY,FDA approves Gilead's once-daily HIV pill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Regulators approved a once-daily HIV pill by Gilead Sciences Inc, giving a new source of revenue to the leading maker of HIV medicines as it faces expiring patents.  The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday gave a nod to the pill Complera for patients who have not received prior treatment for the virus that causes AIDS. The $1,705-a-month drug combines Gilead’s Truvada with Johnson & Johnson’s Edurant, which received FDA approval in May.  Gilead currently sells another once-daily pill, Atripla, that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Sustiva, but the California drugmaker earns no profit from the Bristol drug and all of the Atripla components lose patent protection in the next few years.  Under the deal with J&J, Gilead would keep up to 30 percent of what it will make off the Edurant component in Complera.  The company’s sales of AIDS drugs have benefited from new U.S. health guidelines calling for wider screening for the disease and its earlier treatment, but the magnitude of growth has slowed and the company is under pressure to bring new drugs to the market.  U.S. regulators first rejected Gilead’s application for Complera in January, citing insufficient information.  Shares of Gilead rose 2.6 percent to $36.26 on Wednesday in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq after closing at $35.34.  Also on Wednesday, the company said it has resolved all issues raised in an FDA warning letter from September. The FDA at the time raised concerns about manufacturing problems and product quality at a San Dimas, California, plant where Gilead makes many of its drugs.  Now, the company’s response and actions have “sufficiently addressed” FDA’s concerns, Gilead said.  Gilead last month became the first drugmaker to sign up for a new patent pool, where it plans to share intellectual property rights on its medicines with a goal of making treatments more widely available to the poor.  Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, that causes AIDS, most living in Africa and Asia.

33,BMY,"Analysis: New drugs add mileage to Bristol, Vertex and Amgen","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are selling fast out of the gate, and their recent share sell-offs provide investors with a new opportunity to profit from the medicines’ bright futures.  Bristol’s melanoma drug Yervoy and Vertex’s hepatitis C treatment Incivek, as well as Amgen’s Xgeva for preventing bone fractures in cancer patients stormed past early sales projections because they are simply too good to be ignored, industry experts said.  “Vertex doubled the cure rate and Yervoy is the only drug approved ever that improved survival in melanoma,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst for ISI Group. “It becomes immediately medically unacceptable to not use them in patients whom you are treating, and there’s no debate around it.”  “Xgeva is not quite as dramatic, but they did do a head-to-head trial with the current standard of care and they beat it,” Schoenebaum added.  All three medicines are expected to generate eventual annual sales in excess of $1 billion, with some analyst estimates for Incivek running north of $3 billion.  All arrived to doctors and patients clamoring for new treatments, proving the value of innovative medicines as many drugmakers stand to lose billions of dollars of revenue as older products come off patent.  “They are all first in class drugs for diseases that have not been well treated prior. If companies can deliver drugs that deliver the goods they are going to be successful,” said Les Funtleyder, portfolio manager for Miller Tabak & Co.  Bristol shares are off about 9 percent since a year-high on July 21, Amgen shares are down more than 17 percent since touching a year-high in mid-May and Vertex has fallen 25 percent since reaching a high in May just prior to Incivek’s approval — all dragged down along with broader market plunges.  Analysts believe there is money to be made betting on any of these companies, especially with shares in their current beaten down state.  Schoenebaum said Amgen was a bargain at its current price, and that the ease of tracking Incivek prescription growth makes Vertex attractive. His Amgen price target of $68 is well above the current share price of around $48, while his Vertex price target of $54 leaves room to grow from its current price of about $43.  “Bristol is clearly right now the best company within the U.S. large pharma arena,” he added.  The most bullish Wall Street price targets see Amgen rising as much as 63 percent, Vertex nearly doubling and Bristol-Myers with room to grow by 47 percent, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.  All three recently approved medicines soared past most initial Wall Street sales estimates in the second quarter, defying the typical slow launch for most new medicines.  “There are demographic trends that would suggest that these drugs are going to see more demand,” said Funtleyder, who agreed that it was not too late to jump on the bandwagon.  In just its first five weeks on the market, Incivek sales reached $74.5 million.  “What this means is there are a lot of patients out there waiting for treatment with new hepatitis C drugs,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.  “This is a genuine breakthrough. It’s dramatically altering the outlook for these patients and they’re lining up at physicians’ offices,” Porges said.  Much the same can be said for Yervoy, which in March became the first FDA approved treatment to offer real hope to patients with the deadliest form of skin cancer.  Yervoy, which spurs the immune system to fight the cancer, posted sales of $95 million in its first quarter on the market, helping Bristol to a better-than-expected second quarter profit.  Xgeva, which offers potential for a better quality of life to advanced cancer patients in danger of serious bone problems, nearly doubled expectations in its first full quarter on the market and recorded $75 million in second quarter sales, sailing past analysts’ average estimates of $66 million.  They stand in stark contrast to Dendreon Corp’s year-old prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, which was approved with great fanfare but has yet to catch on with physicians. The company last week pulled its bullish 2011 sales forecast, saying doctors were balking at dealing with reimbursement for its high price tag.  While Amgen and Bristol are looking to their new drugs to help replace fading sales of older products or those about to face generic competition, Incivek is the first commercial product for far smaller Vertex. But the biotech company was well prepared for its foray into uncharted territory.  Two years prior to Incivek approval, Chief Executive Joshua Boger — long the soul of Vertex and the visionary behind the medicine — stepped aside to make way for Matthew Emmens, a sales savvy CEO with several drug launches under his belt.  “They are lucky to have him. He’s got a very good track record,” Funtleyder said of Emmens. “Drug development and drug sales are two different skill sets and not everyone has both.”  That move, as well as the drug’s superior efficacy, appears to be paying off. Early Incivek prescriptions are outpacing those for a similar new rival drug from Merck & Co by a rate of better than three-to-one.  Investors may also do well to get behind companies with a new class of drug for preventing blood clots and strokes in heart patients.  The first of the new blood thinners, Pradaxa, comes from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim. But demand for that drug — more than 250,000 patients prescribed in its first seven months — bodes well for others, including apixaban from Bristol and Pfizer that may prove to be superior.

34,BMY,Bayer anti-clot drug gets cautious journal welcome,"LONDON (Reuters) - An anti-clotting pill from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson offers a new way of preventing stroke although further studies will be needed to refine treatment options, according to a review in a top medical journal.  Wednesday’s editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) will be read closely by doctors and industry analysts, who have been grappling with results from a difficult-to-interpret clinical trial of Xarelto.  Gregory Zoppo of the University of Washington, and Misha Eliasziw of the University of Calgary, said the mix of statistical analyses used to assess the once-daily drug had “muddied the waters” over its benefits.  Xarelto, known generically as rivaroxaban, was hailed last November as being 21 percent better at preventing stroke in patients with a form of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation (AF) than the standard treatment, warfarin.  But this conclusion was based on an analysis that excluded certain patients. When all those who entered the trial were evaluated, no superiority was established for Xarelto.  “I think we can say safely that rivaroxaban is not inferior to warfarin. I don’t think we can say it is superior,” Zoppo said in a telephone interview. “Non-inferiority is not a bad thing.”  The editorial also highlighted the fact warfarin, which requires patients to have regular blood tests to ensure correct dosing, was not used as effectively as it might have been in the study.  And the authors said an “important concern” was that new anticoagulants such as Xarelto did not have antidotes to rapidly reverse their anti-coagulation effects in the event of serious bleeding. Patients on warfarin can be given vitamin K.  The full results of the so-called ROCKET-AF study were published in the NEJM alongside the editorial.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Xarelto for preventing blood clots after knee and hip surgery, and it is expected to decide whether to approve it in the much larger stroke-prevention market later this year.  A similar drug called Pradaxa, or dabigatran, from Boehringer Ingelheim is on the market and several others are under development, including apixaban from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer.  All aim to replace warfarin, a problematic drug, in the lucrative market for millions of mainly elderly patients with AF. Zoppo said their arrival was a notable advance.  “What’s really exciting about rivaroxaban and dabigatran is now we have some alternatives to warfarin that are relatively easy to take and their control seems to be pretty straightforward,” he said.  “Is everybody going to switch from warfarin? I think the answer is ‘No’. Patients who are managed very well on warfarin should stay on it.”  He said there was scope for further trials looking at the relative merits of existing drugs and other, even newer ones still in earlier stages of development.

Zoppo said their arrival was a notable advance.	   “What’s really exciting about rivaroxaban and dabigatran is now we have some alternatives to warfarin that are relatively easy to take and their control seems to be pretty straightforward,” he said.	   “Is everybody going to switch from warfarin? I think the answer is ‘No’. Patients who are managed very well on warfarin should stay on it.”	   He said there was scope for further trials looking at the relative merits of existing drugs and other, even newer ones still in earlier stages of development.

36,BMY,Analysis: Mead Johnson -- more than just a takeover target,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After more than a few baby steps, infant formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN.N is finally being valued in the market as more than just a takeover target.  The maker of Enfamil products has even been named by analysts as a possible suitor for the nutrition business of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which the pharmaceutical company expects to sell in the next two years.  Other logical buyers for Pfizer’s $1.9 billion business, which sells formula and other nutritional products for babies and young children, include Similac maker Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) and giant food firms Nestle NESN.VX and Danone (DANO.PA), which also have infant nutrition businesses.  Mead Johnson, which had $3.14 billion in revenue last year, had largely been seen as a takeover candidate following its 2009 spin-off from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). Yet the company’s strong balance sheet and profit margins, leading market share and emerging market exposure have investors in the stock even without any takeover premium.  Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow raised his target price on the shares to $80 from $74 after Mead reported better-than-expected quarterly profit in late July and raised its full-year outlook, helped by market share gains in China, its second-largest market after the United States.  “Given the company’s accelerating fundamentals, we believe the company’s valuation stands on its own even without a take-out from a strategic acquirer,” Moskow wrote at the time.  And analysts say any acquisition the company itself might do would only make it more attractive to potential acquirers and investors.  “It would likely, I believe, make it a more attractive ... target or opportunity, just in terms of a company that would have more options,” said Frank Maher, managing director of KeyBanc Capital Markets’ food and beverage investment banking team.  Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark LLC, a food and beverage advisory firm, said bigger players like Nestle or Danone might welcome an acquisition by Mead Johnson of Pfizer’s business, as a step toward their own consolidation.  “The bigger you get in the world of global consolidation, the more attractive you become for the fish above you in the school,” Pirko said. “You welcome deals below you because then you get an appetizer and an entree when it’s your time.”  Company spokesman Chris Perille said Mead Johnson’s focus is on organic growth and geographic expansion, but management “has expressed willingness to consider an incremental ‘tuck-in’ acquisition, if it were a good fit for our business and footprint.” Beyond that, he said the company does not comment on speculation regarding acquisitions.  Mead Johnson shares were down 2.5 percent at $66.55 on Wednesday, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX was down 2.0 percent.  Mead Johnson has a market capitalization of $13.9 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding on July 22 and Tuesday’s closing price of $68.26 per share.  That price was down 6 percent from the all-time high of $72.83 the shares touched on July 28. The stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at $26 in February 2009.  Deutsche Bank analyst Eric Katzman raised his rating on the shares to “buy” from “hold” on Monday, saying Mead should be able to support a stock price in the low-to-mid $70 range, based on a typical packaged food multiple of about 14 to 15 times earnings for its North America/Europe business and a multiple of 25 to 30 times earnings for the Asia/Latin America unit.  When compared with a peer group that includes names such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) and Colgate Palmolive Co (CL.N), Mead Johnson’s valuation is in line or slightly higher, Katzman said in a client note, adding that it compares favorably with the group on metrics such as revenue growth, profitability and balance sheet quality. He also included Mead in a “sub-group of companies that enjoy particularly strong, long-term investment characteristics.”  D.A. Davidson analyst Tim Ramey said Mead Johnson’s rich valuation was likely propped up by both the strength of its fundamentals and the possibility of a takeout, which he thinks is unlikely given the strong market positions of its larger competitors.  “It would take a pretty special company to buy it,” Ramey said, calling its business “terrific.” “I’m not particularly in the camp that says it gets taken out.”  Mead Johnson, based in Glenview, Illinois, was founded in 1905 by one of the brothers who co-founded Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N). Its first infant formula was launched in 1911 and became the first doctor-recommended infant feeding product in the United States. Bristol-Myers acquired Mead Johnson in 1967.

37,BMY,FDA approval of Roche melanoma drug may come early,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are moving quickly with Roche’s application for targeted melanoma drug vemurafenib, which could receive approval as early as this week, according to a source familiar with the situation.  A pivotal trial found that advanced melanoma patients taking the experimental pill, being developed in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo, were 63 percent less likely to die from the disease than patients given chemotherapy.  Vemurafenib, whose brand name is Zelboraf, is designed for patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas, the deadliest form of skin cancer, have the genetic aberration.  Roche filed for U.S. approval of the drug in April and the Food and Drug Administration is slated to decide on the application no later than October 28. Approval of a test to detect the BRAF mutation is expected at the same time.  “We are getting the sense that approval is imminent,” said the source familiar with the matter.  An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing of a decision, but did say the deadline is “a performance goal post” for the agency, which in the past has approved medicines ahead of time.  In late April, the FDA approved Johnson and Johnson’s prostate cancer drug Zytiga about two months before the scheduled deadline.  In March, the FDA approved the first treatment to help patients with advanced melanoma live longer. The drug Yervoy, or ipilimumab, is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Yervoy, which posted better-than-expected sales in the second quarter and costs about $120,000 for a course of therapy, is an antibody designed to spur the immune system to fight off the melanoma.  Analysts have forecast annual Zelboraf sales for Roche of $732 million by 2015, while Bristol’s Yervoy sales are expected to reach $1.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Roche and Bristol have also agreed to collaborate on a novel clinical trial to see if the two melanoma drugs are safe and effective if taken together, potentially allowing them to be prescribed as a drug cocktail.  Roche’s Genentech unit, which will market the cancer drug in the United States, declined to comment on price. The company estimates that around 9,500 of the 70,000 new cases of melanoma expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year will be advanced forms of the skin cancer, with the BRAF mutation found in about half of all melanoma cases.  The diagnostic test will cost around $150, according to Paul Brown, president of Roche Diagnostics.  “This is really now the exemplar of personalized healthcare ... science and our understanding of disease has fundamentally changed and grown over the last 5 to 10 years,” he said.  If approved, the medicine would be the first new oncology product from Genentech since 2004’s launch of lung cancer drug Tarceva.  Dr. Jeffrey Sosman, director of the melanoma program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee and a vemurafenib trial investigator, said the drug “will have an immediate impact on many patients with melanoma,” particularly those with aggressive disease.  “Ipilimumab has very different characteristics, and in patients with disease that is not so aggressive and you have a much longer period in which to follow them, ipi is a good alternative and could be given initially,” he said.  Sosman also said patients eventually become resistant to Zelboraf, and there is a need for more investigation of combination therapies.  “I’m alive,” said 52-year-old melanoma patient Susan Steel. “I probably wouldn’t be without this drug.”  Diagnosed with melanoma in 2005, Steel has been on vemurafenib since January under an expanded access program and seen her tumor volume shrink as much as 80 percent.  Side effects have included rash, slight hair loss, extreme photosensitivity and joint pain.  “All of this is irrelevant,” Steel said. “I can still talk. I can still make speeches, take care of my children ... I can listen to all the reasons why my daughter doesn’t want to complete her college applications.

The decision from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests a cautious approach to a wave of new treatments for preventing stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, a common heart arrhythmia.	   Other drugs chasing Pradaxa to market include Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson’s  Xarelto and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer’s Eliquis.

NICE said on Wednesday that its expert committee accepted evidence that Pradaxa was more effective than warfarin but wanted additional information from Boehringer in a number of areas, including the cost-effectiveness of switching patients from a high to lower dose of Pradaxa after the age of 80.	   It also said the drug company’s estimation of the cost of monitoring patients on warfarin appeared to be on the high side.	   NICE, whose decisions are closely followed by other agencies around the world, expects to issue final guidance in December on whether Pradaxa should be paid for on the National Health Service.

40,BMY,UK's NICE backs cut-price Novartis leukaemia drug," LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Leukaemia drug Tasigna has been backed by Britain’s healthcare cost watchdog after its maker Novartis agreed to discount the treatment’s cost of more than 30,000 pounds ($49,000) per patient per year.	   The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) had previously rejected Tasigna, along with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s similarly priced product Sprycel, for treating chronic myeloid leukaemia on the state-funded National Health Service.	   It also said in draft guidance in May that it was not able to recommend high-dose Glivec, another Novartis drug for chronic myeloid leukaemia, following a price increase. 	   Chronic myeloid leukaemia affects about 560 people in the UK a year, most of whom are treated with a drug called imatinib.	   Tasigna and Sprycel were equally effective in treating both imatinib-intolerant and imatinib-resistant forms of the disease, NICE said, and the reduction in cost of Tasigna meant it could recommend the drug for use on the NHS.	   Novartis had requested that the level of the discount was not disclosed, NICE said on Thursday.	   The draft recommendation is open for public consultation.

41,BMY,UPDATE 3-U.S. FDA approves Roche skin cancer drug Zelboraf," * Diagnostic test to target drug to patients also approved   * Roche to charge $56,400 for course of treatment in U.S.   * Analyst sees peak sales of Zelboraf at $1.5 bln   * Roche shares up nearly 2 pct on Swiss stock exchange  (Adds foundation, analyst comment, price, details)   By Anna Yukhananov   WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators approved a targeted skin cancer drug from Roche Holding ROG.VX, offering new hope for patients with the deadliest form of cancer after years of few options.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was two months ahead of schedule in approving the drug, under the brand name Zelboraf, along with a companion diagnostic test that identifies which patients have a specific genetic mutation that means they will benefit from the treatment.   Zelboraf was developed in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo (4568.T) and is the second drug to be approved for melanoma this year, after Yervoy from Bristol-Myers Squibb(BMY.N). Prior to 2011, the FDA had not approved a new melanoma drug in 13 years.   Both are expected to top $1 billion in sales for their manufacturers, and analysts at Sanford Bernstein predict that Yervoy will capture 60 percent of the U.S. market versus 40 percent for Zelboraf.   “The FDA’s quick action on this drug approval is important because it gives melanoma patients a new way to fight this deadly disease,” said Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, about the Roche drug.   “We have seen evidence that targeting gene mutations works. But it also demonstrates the very real challenges researchers still face in offering patients lasting results.”   Advanced melanoma patients taking the Roche twice-daily pill were 63 percent less likely to die from the disease than patients given chemotherapy. However, some patients eventually become resistant to Zelboraf.   “The FDA clearly made it a priority to approve Zelboraf based on the strong clinical data,” said Helvea analyst Karl-Heinz Koch. “Roche will now get the sales from this drug earlier and that’s going to be a bonus for the stock in the second half of the year.   Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss sees Zelboraf peak sales of 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion).   Shares in Roche rose 1.7 percent in Zurich. Bristol gained 0.5 percent in New York trading.   Melanoma globally afflicts nearly 160,000 new people each year. It can spread quickly to internal organs and average survival is six to nine months.   Roche estimates that around 9,500 of the 70,000 new cases of melanoma expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year will be advanced forms of the skin cancer.   Zelboraf, known clinically as vemurafenib, is designed for patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas have the genetic aberration the drug targets.   Yervoy, or ipilimumab, sold more quickly than expected after its approval in March. It is an antibody designed to spur the immune system to fight off the melanoma.   The 10 percent of patients who respond to Yervoy often get benefit that can last for many years, in contrast to the relatively short-lived effect of Zelboraf.   While the drugs will compete for market share, Roche and Bristol are also collaborating on a novel clinical trial to see if a combination of the two will yield a more effective treatment for some patients. [ID:nN02237555]   Roche said Zelboraf would cost about $56,400 for a six-month course of treatment in the United States. Bristol’s Yervoy costs $120,000 for a course of treatment. The diagnostic test will cost around $150, according to Paul Brown, president of Roche Diagnostics.   Side effects from Zelboraf include rash, slight hair loss, extreme photosensitivity and joint pain.   Roche filed for U.S. approval of the drug in April and the FDA had to make a decision by Oct. 28.

And Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss sees peak sales of 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion).  “Today’s approval of Zelboraf and the (companion) test is a great example of how companion diagnostics can be developed and used to ensure patients are exposed to highly effective, more personalized therapies in a safe manner,” said Alberto Gutierrez, head of the FDA’s Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety.  The FDA said in July that targeted drugs would have to be reviewed at the same time as the diagnostic devices they rely on.  The Roche drug, known clinically as vemurafenib, is designed for patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow.  A pivotal trial found that advanced melanoma patients taking the experimental pill were 63 percent less likely to die from the disease than patients given chemotherapy.

43,BMY,Japan warns on Boehringer's anti-stroke pill," FRANKFURT, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Japanese regulators told Boehringer Ingelheim to issue a strong warning to physicians of potentially deadly bleeding as a result of use of its stroke prevention pill Prazaxa, the first in a promising new class of medicines.	   The country’s health ministry MHLW said in a so-called Blue Letter earlier this month that between March 14 and Aug. 11, 81 of the almost 64,000 mainly elderly patients taking the Prazaxa pill suffered heavy bleeding, leading to five deaths.	   That would be equivalent to about one in 330 patients suffering serious bleeding, mostly in the digestive tract, over a one-year period.	   The ministry said in the letter that the unlisted German company needs to tell doctors about these risks and that a lower dose may have to be given to certain patient groups, such as those over 70 or with kidney damage.    	   A Boehringer spokesman told Reuters on Thursday it was complying with Japanese requests and it was in the company’s interests that the medicine be prescribed strictly within the guidelines.	   The pill, called Pradaxa outside Japan, has been on the U.S. market since late last year and is one of three new anti-blood-clotting pills expected to replace the decades-old, and potentially dangerous, stroke preventer warfarin. 	   Analysts estimate the total annual market for such oral drugs at as much as $20 billion. 	   The ministry also told the company to make Japanese doctors aware there was no medicine capable of reversing its anti-coagulation effect. 	   The lack of an antidote could also be a concern for rival anti-clotting drugs, such as Xarelto from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson , Eliquis from Bristol-Myers Squibb  and Pfizer , and Daiichi Sankyo’s  Lixiana, as the New England Journal of Medicine pointed out last week. 	   This is the negative flip side of a major advantage of the new generation of drugs: they do not interact with certain foods like warfarin does.	   The effect of warfarin, a so-called Vitamin K inhibitor, is damped if patients eat certain vegetables with that vitamin such as spinach, cauliflower or broccoli. By the same token, bleeding due to warfarin can simply be addressed by giving Vitamin K.	   Boehringer earlier this month won European clearance for its stroke prevention pill.	   But Britain’s healthcare cost-effectiveness watchdog on Wednesday demanded more information on Boehringer Ingelheim’s anti-clotting pill before deciding whether to recommend it for use on the state-funded National Health Service. 	   Bayer and development partner J&J in January filed for U.S. and European approval of its Xarelto pill, based on the active ingredient rivaroxaban, for stroke prevention.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday gave its nod to Adcetris, the first drug specifically indicated for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and the first one approved for Hodgkin’s lymphoma since 1977. [ID:nN1E77I14K]   Seattle Genetics on Monday said the drug will cost $4,500 per vial. In its clinical trials, the company said, patients on average received three vials per dose and between seven and nine doses per treatment.   The total price would then generally vary from $94,500 to $121,500 per patient, within Wall Street’s expected range.   The drugmaker’s shares were down 2.3 percent to $14.70 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq, underperforming the Nasdaq Biotech index .NBI, which was down 0.3 percent.   “Seattle Genetics’ decision to price Adcetris north of $100,000 seems to be causing some concern in the investment community following the recent failure of Dendreon’s Provenge to live to up to sales expectations,” said Morningstar Inc analyst Lauren Migliore.   Adcetris is the latest cancer drug to hit the market with a hefty pricetag to the discontent of patient groups.   Earlier this month, Dendreon Corp DNDN.O lost two-thirds of its market value when it could not deliver on promised sales of its prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, which costs about $93,000 per course, as doctors weren’t confident enough about getting reimbursed. [ID:nL6E7J50H0]   “I think you get a reason for pushback (against highly-priced cancer drugs) because many of these cancer drugs are really not that effective, but in this case I think it’s one of the most effective drugs out there,” Leerink Swann analyst Howard Liang said of Adcetris.   “I would think that the pricing is high but it’s not outrageous compared to other cancer drugs.”   In March, U.S. regulators approved Bristol Myers Squibb Co’s (BMY.N) Yervoy for patients with advanced melanoma, a deadly skin cancer. A course of treatment with Yervoy costs about $120,000.

46,BMY,Data may prove Bristol and Pfizer drug a winner,"LONDON (Reuters) - Despite being third to market, a new bloodthinner from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer may become the biggest seller in an emerging multibillion-dollar class of drugs for preventing strokes in heart patients.  Eliquis, or apixaban, is set to steal the limelight at Europe’s top medical meeting next week — and if the data are as strong as many industry analysts expect, sales forecasts for the medicine are likely to jump.  Excitement over Eliquis has been growing since June when headline results showed it was better and safer than the decades-old warfarin in preventing strokes in patients with dangerously irregular heart rhythms.  Just how much better will become clear on August 28 when detailed data from a 18,000-patient clinical trial are presented at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting in Paris.  In addition to reducing stroke and bleeding risk, there is a chance that Eliquis could be the first oral anticoagulant to show a statistically significant improvement in mortality over warfarin in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.  That would be “the icing on the cake,” according to drug industry analysts at Jefferies, while the team at Barclays believes it would allow Eliquis to grab 50 percent of a likely $9 billion-a-year AF stroke prevention market by 2021.  Industry analysts, on average, currently expect 2015 sales of $1.6 billion for the product, which is due to be submitted for regulatory approval this year, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.  That is less than the $3 billion forecast for Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, suggesting the competitive landscape will realign if Eliquis lives up to its promise in Paris.  “What’s at stake is whether or not they are going to be best in class for atrial fibrillation,” said Damien Conover, analyst at Morningstar.  “Given that it’s such a giant market, it’s important to know whether or not they are going to be splitting it more equally or if they really do have best-in-class status which means they’ll get the lion’s share of the market.”  Confirmation of strong efficacy and low bleeding risk could boost Bristol-Myers shares some 5 percent and lift Pfizer by 2-3 percent, according to Chris Schott of JP Morgan.  On the flipside, confidence may start to ebb away in prospects for Xarelto and a third drug, Pradaxa, which is sold by privately held Boehringer Ingelheim and is currently the only approved oral alternative to warfarin in stroke prevention.  Xarelto and Pradaxa are both already approved for stopping clots after knee and hip surgery but stroke prevention in AF is the biggest opportunity for the new oral coagulants, which are also being studied for other heart conditions.  In all, the warfarin replacement market could be a $10-20 billion opportunity, analysts estimate, although low-cost warfarin — a notoriously problematic drug — is not going to disappear altogether, with patients who are well controlled on the old medicine likely to stay on it.  Success with Eliquis would be a boon for Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, which together face more than $30 billion in revenue loss due to patent expiries through 2016, according to Barclays.  It would underpin broader confidence that Big Pharma can still discover promising new medicines, despite the pipeline drought of recent years.  Also in focus at the Paris congress will be Roche’s dalcetrapib, which is being developed to raise “good” HDL cholesterol.  The Swiss drugmaker is still more than a year away from being able to generate definitive data on the medicine, but doctors and analysts will be watching closely for news from two relatively small trials. A promising scientific abstract was released for one of these at the weekend.

47,BMY,Separate paths lead to promising cholesterol drug,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Discovery of one of the most promising cholesterol fighters in decades began in 1999 with Catherine Boileau, a Paris scientist who was seeking a genetic reason why 19 members of two French families she was studying had sky-high levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.  Their LDL levels were in the 300 to 400 range, making them prone to early heart attack and death. Using gene-mapping, Boileau and colleagues at Paris-Ouest Medical School theorized that a gene in a specific area of Chromosome 1 was responsible.  She published her limited findings in the American Journal of Human Genetics the same year, an important step in what may pave the way for the next big breakthrough in treating heart disease.  For the following three years, Boileau and doctoral student Marianne Abifadel painstakingly analyzed about 50 genes in the chromosome, but none emerged as the likely culprit. With scores of other genes left to examine, her phone rang one day.  “I know you don’t know me, and I don’t know you, but we seem to be working on something similar,” said biochemist Nabil Seidah from the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, who had read Boileau’s 1999 paper.  Seidah, in conducting unrelated research, had discovered a gene on Chromosome 1 which he quickly speculated might regulate cholesterol. He found the gene produced a protein highly present on the surface of liver cells, which are responsible for most of the body’s production of cholesterol.  “Catherine asked me, ‘How do you know this is the same gene I’m looking for?’ And I said, ‘I don’t, but I have a hint because it’s very rich in the liver.’”  Boileau then turned her full attention to the gene and its protein, an enzyme later named PCSK9. It was the ninth member of a family of enzymes Seidah had discovered, all of which were involved in activating hormones and cell-surface proteins.  “It was a very bewildering new protein, also found in the kidney and the brain, but we didn’t know what it does,” Boileau said.  Further analysis showed that all affected members of one French family had an identical mutation in the PCSK9 gene, while members of a smaller affected family shared a different mutation.  Although the mutations were different, they both appeared to have the same effect of creating LDL levels in the bloodstream five to 10 times higher than levels found in the general population. Some family members began showing signs of heart disease in their teenage years.  Boileau and Seidah published their joint findings in June 2003, but were still unaware of just how the gene functioned.  An answer came the following year from Rockefeller University in New York, where researcher Jan Breslow and his doctoral assistant Kara Maxwell had conducted mouse studies of the newly discovered gene and protein.  “We took the gene and put it into a virus, and then injected the virus into normal mice,” thereby elevating their PCSK9 beyond normal degrees, recalls Breslow. “Within just a day or two, the mice went from having very low levels of bad cholesterol to high levels that resemble what we see with familial hypercholesterolemia. It was a result that was so clear, and that doesn’t come along every day with research.”  Breslow’s studies showed that PCSK9 wipes out LDL receptors, proteins that bind to LDL cholesterol in the liver and remove the artery-clogging substance from the bloodstream.  The mechanism is just one of many ways the body regulates levels of LDL — to make sure there is enough of it to perform vital body functions, although not more than is necessary. By destroying LDL receptors, PCSK9 allows LDL to build in the bloodstream.  The specific mutations in PCSK9 found in the French families — called “gain-in-function” mutations — made the protein 10-fold more active than natural PCSK9 in destroying LDL receptors. It was doing its job far too well.  A separate discovery in Dallas, Texas, supplied remaining pieces of the PCSK9 puzzle in 2005.  It came from a laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, where Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein had won Nobel Prizes in 1985 for discovering the LDL receptor.  Helen Hobbs and Jonathan Cohen, colleagues of Brown and Goldstein, discovered that 2 percent of African-Americans in their study group had a far different inherited mutation in the PCSK9 gene.  Instead of elevating their LDL levels — as seen with the mutations in Boileau’s study — it led to LDL levels a third lower than those seen in the general population. And the mutation, by largely disabling PCSK9, had have greatly shielded the group from heart disease.  The surprise findings suggested that blocking PCSK9 with drugs might offer similar benefits.  “The therapeutic implications are immense,” Brown said after Hobbs’ and Cohen’s conclusions were published, calling them the most important work in cholesterol metabolism since his and Goldstein’s discoveries a generation earlier.

49,BMY,Insight: Next big drug against cholesterol takes shape,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of drugmakers are racing to develop a new class of medicines they believe could be the biggest weapon against heart disease since statins were introduced in the 1980s.  The contest is taking place largely out of public view, but researchers and industry analysts say excitement is building over the injectable medicines. They work by blocking PCSK9, a protein whose natural function is to preserve levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream.  Researchers in Paris, Montreal and Dallas, through experiments with thousands of patients that began in 1999, discovered the gene behind PCSK9 and deciphered its function.  Biotechnology company Regeneron and its big pharmaceutical partner Sanofi are now ahead of the pack in developing a drug that goes after PCSK9. A single injection of their medicine, called REGN727, slashed LDL levels by more than 60 percent for a month in an early trial. Results from mid-stage studies are expected later this year.  “The PCSK9 mechanism is perhaps one of the best examples we have in all of medicine of how the study of genetics can identify new targets for developing new therapies,” said Dr. Daniel Rader, a noted heart researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.  Although no serious side effects have been seen with REGN727, larger trials are needed to rule out problems such as liver toxicity or raised blood pressure that have wrecked other promising heart drugs, including Pfizer Inc’s experimental torcetrapib.  Rader, who is a consultant to several of the companies developing PCSK9 inhibitors, said most drugmakers are working on once-a-month injections that would likely be self-administered by patients using very small needles. Some drugs might eventually be administered every two to three months, he said.  Amgen Inc, Merck & Co, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and a partnership between Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc are in hot pursuit, with rival drugs of their own.  The anti-PCSK9 medicines are expected to be used alongside statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor, for patients who do not achieve cholesterol-lowering goals with statins alone.  They would also be used on their own for a much smaller group who cannot tolerate statins — oral drugs with global annual sales of $20 billion that inhibit the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol.  In the United States, more than 10 million patients could ultimately be candidates for the new family of medicines. Industry analysts say the products could command $1,000 a month or more because of their potential importance to high-risk patients. Statins cost about $130 a month for branded pills like Lipitor, which is due to lose U.S. patent protection later this year, or far less for other products already available as generics.  For a graphic on top-selling cholesterol fighters, see: r.reuters.com/wuq43s The clearest advantage so far has been seen in Regeneron’s new drug. Data from initial studies suggests REGN727 may be able to reduce LDL by another 50 percent when used in combination with statins, which themselves can cut LDL in half.  “Regeneron’s anti-PCSK9 antibody really looks like a magic bullet against LDL cholesterol” said Ziad Bakri, a biotechnology analyst with T. Rowe Price. His firm is one of Regeneron’s largest shareholders, with a 9.5 percent stake as of the end of June.  Assuming longer-term studies demonstrate the drug is safe and prevents heart attacks and stroke, Bakri estimates it could capture annual sales “in the billions of dollars” if approved.  “Taking advantage of this pathway is a creative leap forward,” said Dr. Kristin Newby, a Duke University heart researcher who has no involvement in PCSK9 research.  But she cautioned that other classes of novel medicines have stumbled because of unexpected safety problems.  She cited torcetrapib, a drug to raise “good” HDL cholesterol that Pfizer had expected to reap annual sales of more than $10 billion. Meant to drive down the incidence of heart attacks, the drug instead was linked to deaths and was scrapped in 2006 after costly late-stage trials.  Data from a similar HDL-raising drug being developed by Roche Holding AG will be released on Sunday at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Paris. But cutting LDL cholesterol remains the most proven way of reducing heart attacks and stroke, and is the industry’s prime focus.  Should PCSK9 inhibitors stumble, it would be a keen disappointment for some of the world’s biggest drugmakers.  Amgen, the largest global biotech company, is wrapping up early-stage trials of its PCSK9 inhibitor and will soon advance it into Phase II studies.  “There’s a real opportunity to change the paradigm of treating cardiovascular disease with this therapy,” said Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s global project leader for cardiovascular medicines.  Andrew Plump, head of cardiovascular discovery for Merck, cautions that long-term trials must confirm the value of PCSK9 blockers. But he predicts that when used with statins, they could reduce heart attack and stroke risk 25 to 30 percent beyond the 25 to 30 percent reduced risk seen with statins alone.  “PCSK9 is one of the most interesting proteins in the human body,” Plump said. “We didn’t know anything about it a decade ago, and the speed at which drug programs have progressed is astounding.”  Merck has not disclosed details of its PCSK9 program, but Plump said the company is interested in developing injectable and pill formulations.  Former Merck chief executive Roy Vagelos, who introduced the world’s first statin Mevacor in 1987, is helping oversee development of Regeneron’s product as chairman of its board.  Two Nobel Prize winners whose research directly led to discovery of statins, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, are members of Regeneron’s board, as is Christine Poon, former head of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceuticals group.  “This is a big, enormous opportunity,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in an interview. “It could become one of the biggest drugs in biotechnology.”  Regeneron also hopes to benefit from the expertise of partner Sanofi, whose Plavix blood clot preventer has annual sales of more than $9 billion. The companies aim to split any profits evenly from their PCSK9 medicine.  In a series of experiments conducted separately by four research teams, scientists showed that PCSK9 wipes out LDL receptors, proteins that bind to LDL cholesterol in the liver and remove the artery-clogging substance from the bloodstream.  The mechanism is one of many ways the body regulates LDL to make sure there is enough of it to perform vital body functions, although not more than is necessary. But when PCSK9 goes overboard in destroying LDL receptors, LDL rises to harmful levels.  While early studies focused on patients with genetic mutations that triggered sky-high production of LDL, Helen Hobbs and colleague Jonathan Cohen theorized in 2005 that other mutations in PCSK9 might exist and have the opposite effect: of inactivating the gene and thereby leading to lower LDL levels.  They examined the structure of the gene in African-Americans who had low LDL. Their research showed that 2 percent of them had an inherited mutated form of the gene, and that their LDL levels were about a third lower than individuals without the mutation. The two researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center went on to show that the subjects were protected from heart disease.  The findings strongly suggested the possible benefits of blocking PCSK9 or its activity.  “We knew what we had right away: the potential for a new way to lower LDL levels in humans,” Hobbs said.  Two young women found to have no PCSK9 at all had LDL levels of just 14 to 16 — one-eighth normal levels. Yet they were deemed to be in good health, suggesting to Hobbs and others that blocking PCSK9 may not pose great safety risks.  “The reaction to Dr. Hobbs’ findings was electric among those who understood the field,” said Dr. Daniel Steinberg, professor emeritus at the University of California-San Diego. “The science was solid and suggested that blocking PCSK9 could be as important as statins in terms of controlling coronary artery disease.”  Steinberg, who has written extensively on PCSK9, said that patients with the protective mutation were shown to have an almost 90 percent reduced risk of coronary artery disease, compared with the general population.  “That’s probably because their LDL has been low from birth,” he said. Steinberg said anti-PCSK9 drugs could save tens of thousands of lives a year, as statins now do.  Statins actually raise levels of PCSK9, thereby undermining their own effectiveness in reducing LDL. “So if you give a statin, plus a PCSK9 inhibitor, you could get a bigger bang for your buck,” Steinberg said.  Patients taking PCSK9 inhibitors might also be able to take lower doses of statins, and thereby avoid their side effects, such as muscle weakness and liver toxicity.  Some studies suggest PCSK9 may help regenerate liver tissue, so drugs that block it theoretically could pose a risk to alcoholics or others with existing liver damage.  Studies will test the liver risk, and also show whether the new medicines affect HDL cholesterol or cause side effects in other organs where PCSK9 is concentrated.  While safety must be established, Alnylam research executive Akshay Vaishnaw is betting on PCSK9 drugs.  “There’s no question that this is going to be the greatest intervention, following statins, for treatment of high cholesterol. It’s absolutely going to be the next big thing.”  ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cholesterol/insight-next-big-drug-against-cholesterol-takes-shape-idUSTRE77P53O20110826
50,BMY,"New Bristol, Pfizer clot drug saves lives in study","PARIS (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer saved more lives than standard treatment warfarin in a major study, giving it an edge over rivals in an emerging multibillion-dollar market.  Although Eliquis will be third to market among a wave of new oral anticoagulants, the data presented Sunday at Europe’s biggest medical meeting means it could now be viewed as the best in class.  People with dangerously irregular heart rhythms given Eliquis were 21 percent less likely to suffer strokes than those on decades-old warfarin, a problematic drug first developed as rat poison that requires regular blood tests.  It also produced a 31 percent relative reduction in the risk of major bleeding — especially bleeding in the brain — and an 11 percent reduction in risk of death from any cause, results from a 18,000-patient study lasting nearly two years showed.  The mortality benefit only just reached statistical significance but the finding puts Eliquis ahead of its two key rivals by demonstrating superiority to warfarin on all three counts of effectiveness, safety and saving lives.  That is likely to be seized on by Bristol and Pfizer in an upcoming marketing fight with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa — currently the only approved alternative to warfarin in stroke prevention — and Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, which is expected to be approved shortly.  “It gives a lot of confidence when you see a drug that reduces mortality. That’s another feather in the cap,” Dr Chris Granger of Duke University Medical Center, who led the study, told Reuters.  The result means that giving Eliquis rather than warfarin for 1.8 years — the average length of the study — would prevent eight deaths for each 1,000 people treated.  All three new drugs are vying for a share of a warfarin-replacement market that industry analysts estimate could be worth $10-$20 billion a year by the end of the decade.  Currently, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters Pharma expect 2015 sales of $1.6 billion for Eliquis, or apixaban, which is due to be submitted for approval later this year.  That is less than the $3 billion forecast for Xarelto and some predict the balance will now shift toward Eliquis.  “The bleeding profile is spectacular and that’s what is going to drive market share,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, who sees Eliquis taking at least 60 percent of the stroke prevention market.  Excitement over Eliquis has grown since June when headline results showed it was better and safer than warfarin. How much better, however, only became clear Sunday when the data was unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  In an editorial in the journal, Dr Jessica Mega of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital said the results were “impressive” but she cautioned it was difficult to make comparisons between different drugs, due to variations in the clinical trials.  Doctors attending the ESC meeting said the new drugs would upend the landscape for treating patients with atrial fibrillation, whose irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes.  “It is another dagger in the heart for warfarin as an anticoagulation treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke,” said Dr Ralph Brindis.  Brindis, a senior adviser for Northern California Kaiser Permanente and immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology, said Eliquis had scored a “home run,” although it and the other new anticoagulants still faced challenges.  In particular, he is concerned about adherence to medical treatment among elderly patients, as doctors may be less able to ensure they are taking drugs correctly once they do not need regular blood tests. For such patients, once-daily Xarelto may be a better bet than twice-daily Eliquis or Pradaxa, providing a niche market opportunity for Bayer and J&J.  Seamus Fernandez, an industry analyst at Leerink Swann, said Eliquis was now “extremely well-positioned” to be the top drug and Pradaxa was the product most likely to lose out. He expects stroke prevention to be a $7-9 billion market globally, with other uses of the new oral anticoagulants worth $3-6 billion.  In a discussion at the congress, Dr Michael Ezekowitz of the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research in Pennsylvania said the Eliquis trial results were a “landmark” that confirmed a new wave of drugs was about to change the medical landscape.  “We’re in a new era,” Ekekowitz, who was not involved in the latest research, told a packed conference hall in Paris.  Still, many cardiologists said they would not rush to switch existing patients who are well-controlled on warfarin — a cheap generic medicine — to the new and expensive branded products.  Pradaxa costs $6.75 wholesale for a day’s treatment in the United States, although it is less in other markets.

In a discussion at the congress, Dr Michael Ezekowitz of the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research in Pennsylvania said the Eliquis trial results were a “landmark” that confirmed a new wave of drugs was about to change the medical landscape.	   “We’re in a new era,” Ekekowitz, who was not involved in the latest research, told a packed conference hall in Paris.	   Still, many cardiologists said they would not rush to switch existing patients who are well-controlled on warfarin — a cheap generic medicine — to the new and expensive branded products.

52,BMY,"New Bristol, Pfizer clot drug saves lives in study"," * Eliquis reduces stroke risk 21 pct vs warfarin   * Bleeding risk reduced 31 pct, mortality 11 pct   * Drug vying for share of $10-$20 bln a year market   * Rival to products from Bayer/J&J and Boehringer    By Ben Hirschler	   PARIS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer reduced deaths more than standard treatment warfarin in a major study, giving it a potentially important edge over rivals.	   Although Eliquis will be third to market among a wave of new oral anticoagulants, the data presented at Europe’s biggest medical meeting on Sunday means it could now be viewed as the best in class.	   People with dangerously irregular heart rhythms given Eliquis were 21 percent less likely to suffer strokes than those on decades-old warfarin, a problematic drug first developed as rat poison that requires regular blood tests.	   It also produced a 31 percent relative reduction in the risk of major bleeding — especially bleeding in the brain — and an 11 percent reduction in risk of death from any cause, results from a big 18,000-patient clinical study showed.	   Although the mortality benefit only just reached statistical significance, the finding puts Eliquis ahead of its two key rivals by showing superiority to warfarin when it comes to saving lives.	   That is likely to be seized on by Bristol and Pfizer in an upcoming marketing fight with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa — currently the only approved alternative to warfarin in stroke prevention — and Xarelto, from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson , which is expected to be approved shortly.	   “It gives a lot of confidence when you see a drug that reduces mortality. That’s another feather in the cap,” said Dr Chris Granger of Duke University Medical Center, who led the study.	   The result means that giving Eliquis rather than warfarin  for 1.8 years — the average length of the study — would prevent eight deaths for each 1,000 people treated.	   All three new drugs are vying for a share of a warfarin-replacement market that industry analysts estimate could be worth $10-$20 billion a year by the end of the decade.	  Currently, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters Pharma expect sales of $1.6 billion for Eliquis, or apixaban, which is due to be submitted for regulatory approval later this year.	   That is less than the $3 billion forecast for Xarelto and some predict the balance in future may shift more towards Eliquis and away from Xarelto given the latest strong data.	   Excitement over Eliquis has grown since June when headline results showed it was better and safer than warfarin. How much better, however, only became clear on Sunday when the actual data was unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.	   In an editorial in the journal, Dr Jessica Mega of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital said the results were “impressive” but she cautioned it was difficult to make comparisons between different drugs, due to variations in the clinical trials.	   Doctors attending the ESC meeting said the new drugs would upend the landscape for treating patients with atrial fibrillation, whose irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes.	   “It is another dagger in the heart for warfarin as an anticoagulation treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke,” said Dr Ralph Brindis.	   Brindis, a senior adviser for Northern California Kaiser Permanente and immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology, said Eliquis had scored a “home run”, although it and the other new anticoagulants still faced challenges.	   In particular, he is concerned about adherence to medical treatment among elderly patients, as doctors may be less able to ensure they are taking drugs correctly once they do not need regular blood tests. For such patients, once-daily Xarelto may be a better bet than twice-daily Eliquis or Pradaxa.	   Dr Michael Boehm from Germany’s University Hospital of Saarland, who chairs the ESC’s scientific programme committee, said the advent of new oral anticoagulants would change clinical practice “immensely”.	   Still, many cardiologists in Paris said they would not rush to switch existing patients who are well-controlled on warfarin — a cheap generic medicine — to the new and expensive branded products.

54,BMY,Astellas clot drug raises bleeding in heart study," * Darexaban causes two- to four-fold more bleeding   * Phase II study raises doubts about use in ACS    By Ben Hirschler	   PARIS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting drug from Japan’s Astellas increased bleeding two- to four-fold in a mid-stage clinical study of heart patients, raising questions about its role in treating those with acute coronary problems.	   The new oral anticoagulant, known as darexaban or YM150, also showed no sign of reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes, although researchers said the 1,279-patient Phase II study was too small to evaluate efficacy with any certainty.	   While the results are disappointing, the outcome does not necessarily mean darexaban has no future, Dr Gabriel Steg of the Hospital Bichat in Paris, who led the research, said on Tuesday.	   The Astellas medicine belongs to the same so-called Factor Xa inhibitor drug class as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer’s Eliquis, which on Sunday produced impressive results in another group of patients — those at risk of stroke because they have dangerously irregular heart rhythms.	   Before succeeding in this atrial fibrillation (AF) population, Eliquis had also failed in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to excessive bleeding.	   Patients with ACS, which typically involves chest pain and risk of heart attack due to blocked arteries, are given antiplatelet bloodthinners to reduce their risk danger of clots. But doctors are interested to find out if the new generation of oral anticoagulants might also help.	   The latest study raises fresh doubts about the strategy.	   “I think we have a series of mixed signals. It is probably a little too soon to forgo the idea of adding anticoagulants to anti-platelet therapy,” Steg told reporters at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting.	   Various doses of darexaban were tested on top of dual antiplatelet therapy in the Phase II trial and bleeding increased as dosing increased.	   Dr David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic, who is also president of the American College of Cardiology and was not involved in the research, said it was still worth investigating the use of anticoagulants in ACS, although a low dose of darexaban would be needed in any future tests.	   Darexaban is also being studied for stroke prevention in AF patients and it has already produced good results in preventing the risk of blood clots after orthopaedic surgery.	   Still, it is a late entrant into an increasingly crowded marketplace, with rivals including Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson’s  Xarelto, and Bristol and Pfizer’s Eliquis — as well as a late pipeline product call edoxaban from Daiichi-Sankyo .	   Last February, Astellas withdrew its Japanese filing for darexaban for use after surgery, following a request from regulators for additional clinical studies. The company has said it will decide on future plans for the drug based on the outcome of discussions with potential global partners.

55,BMY,"Bayer, J&J; clot drug seen winning U.S. panel nod","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - An experimental stroke preventer from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson is likely to win a recommendation from U.S. health advisers next week, but not without concern over risks seen when patients come off the drug.  A key issue for the Food and Drug Administration advisers may be the so-called rebound effect of the medicine Xarelto. When patients stopped taking it and resumed older drug warfarin, higher risk of stroke was seen in trials.  “We think the FDA advisory panel will be concerned that there’s a ‘rebound’ effect with discontinuing Xarelto,” Wells Fargo analysts said in a research note on Thursday. “However, our consultants do not believe this will be a deal breaker.”  Xarelto’s shortcomings may also relegate it to second place in the marketplace behind a rival treatment being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc, in an anti-clotting market that could top $10 billion a year, analysts say.  The advisory panel is set to consider the data on Xarelto next Thursday, after the FDA releases its initial findings on the drug on Tuesday.  “Key opinion leaders expect a panel recommendation for Xarelto, but not without controversy,” analysts at Leerink Swann wrote in a note on Thursday.  The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels, and Xarelto could be approved by November if the pill wins support at the meeting.  Xarelto is one of several promising entrants angling to replace risky clot preventer warfarin for people with dangerously irregular heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation (AF).  AF patients’ irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes. But many are unwilling to take warfarin, which requires regular blood tests, or are unable to tolerate the old medicine.  Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa is already approved in stroke prevention, while Eliquis, from Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, has so far shown the best clinical data, especially for reducing the risk of major bleeding.  Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, predicted the advisory panel will recommend Xarelto because of its effectiveness and acceptable bleeding risk, and its advantages over warfarin.  “Xarelto will be overshadowed by apixaban (Eliquis), but it is going to be a decent drug and could generate $1 billion to $2 billion in annual sales, with the marketing muscle of J&J and Bayer,” he said. Bristol and Pfizer plan to submit Eliquis for U.S. approval later this year for preventing stroke.  Another issue is some inconsistent data. A clinical trial last November showed Xarelto, known generically as rivaroxaban, was 21 percent better at preventing stroke in patients with AF compared with warfarin.  But when all those who entered the trial were evaluated, no superiority was established for Xarelto, a fact that is likely to come up in panel discussions.  “A superiority claim over warfarin ... is unlikely in our view and is not widely anticipated,” said Barbara Ryan, analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a research note on Friday.  Panelists may also focus on the fact that warfarin was not used as effectively as it might have been in the study, making it more difficult to compare it with Xarelto.  Xarelto’s advantage over rivals may come in its dosing, since it needs to be taken only once a day as opposed to twice for Eliquis and Pradaxa, a key factor for elderly patients taking multiple medications.  Gabelli & Co’s Jonas said Eliquis is likely to capture 50 percent or more of the warfarin-replacement market, with Xarelto in second place comfortably ahead of Pradaxa.  “Pradaxa is being dismissed; it will be relatively small,” he predicted.  Even though Pradaxa was the first to market, having been approved by U.S. regulators last year, it causes gastrointestinal side effects in a significant percentage of patients and has special storage requirements.  Pradaxa works by directly blocking a protein called thrombin that plays a key role in the clotting process, while Eliquis and Xarelto block the Factor Xa protein.  The three medicines — and a fourth from Daiichi-Sankyo called edoxaban that is due to report pivotal results in 2012 — will greatly expand the number of patients with AF taking anticoagulants.

58,BMY,Bayer/J&J; stroke drug not ready for approval-US FDA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators said an experimental stroke preventer from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is not ready for approval and raised questions about its effectiveness, sending Bayer shares down more than 7 percent.  “There is a lack of substantial evidence that rivaroxaban will have its desired effect when used as recommended in labeling,” Food and Drug Administration staff in documents released on Tuesday.  The FDA staff recommended that the agency issue a so-called complete response letter for the drug, also known by its proposed trade name Xarelto, which means it cannot be approved without more data from the companies.  Even if approved, the agency staff said the drug should be used as a third option behind other treatments, unless the companies submit more data on effectiveness and safety.  “The wording is quite critical,” said Karl-Heinz Scheunemann, an analyst with LBBW. “Should the committee agree with the recommendation - which is not always the case - it’s safe to assume that there will be a delay in the market approval.”  The FDA will make its final decision after taking into account the views of an advisory panel, which considers Xarelto on Thursday.  Xarelto is one of several promising entrants angling to replace risky clot preventer warfarin for people with dangerously irregular heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation (AF).  AF patients’ irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes. But many are unwilling to take warfarin, which requires regular blood tests, or are unable to tolerate the decades-old medicine.  Bayer shares fell as much as 13 percent before paring losses. J&J shares were mostly flat on a down day for U.S. markets. Bayer, a smaller company than Johnson & Johnson, is more reliant on Xarelto.  The drug is approved in the United States and Europe for anti-clotting in patients after knee and hip surgery, a much smaller market than stroke prevention for AF patients.  Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said Xarelto’s prospects have now significantly dimmed. Even if approved, Purkiss said, the drug will now likely only be used if patients do not benefit from warfarin and Pradaxa, a newly approved stroke medicine from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim.  The FDA review appeared to be good news for a rival treatment called Eliquis being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), in an anti-clotting market that could top $10 billion a year.  Pfizer shares were up 0.7 percent, while Bristol-Myers was up 0.4 percent, with both stocks were outperforming the broader U.S. market and the Arca Pharmaceuticals Index .DRG.  Eliquis, also called apixaban, showed superiority over warfarin in effectiveness, safety and saving lives in a clinical trial presented last month at a scientific meeting in Paris, affirming its place as the potential leader of the pack.  “The prospects for apixaban and Pradaxa just got better,” Purkiss said after the Xarelto review.  THIRD-LINE STATUS?  FDA reviewers questioned whether Xarelto was as effective as warfarin, saying that in a trial comparing the two, warfarin was not given in the proper dosing.  They said for conditions such as stroke, which can cause irreversible harm, new drugs must be shown to be at least as effective as older treatments.  They also focused on risks for patients when they come off the drug. When patients stopped taking Xarelto and resumed warfarin at the end of the main clinical trial, higher risk of stroke was seen, a so-called “rebound” effect.  However, bleeding risk was the only significant issue with Xarelto on its own, the FDA staff said.  They asked the companies to conduct further trials to show Xarelto was as safe and effective as warfarin, or as compared to Pradaxa.  “It seems advisable to make rivaroxaban a third-line agent, behind both warfarin and dabigatran (Pradaxa),” FDA staff said in the documents, until the companies submit more data on Xarelto.  Johnson & Johnson said the FDA staff documents did not represent the agency’s final recommendation.  “We’re confident in the effectiveness of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with AF,” said Ernie Knewitz, a spokesman for J&J. The two companies co-developed the drug, and J&J has marketing rights in the United States.  Analysts from Sanford Bernstein forecast Xarelto sales of $948 million for J&J in 2015, and 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for Bayer, which has much greater sales outside the United States.  They said the market overreacted in its initial sharp drop, especially as European regulators often reach different conclusions than the FDA.  “We accept ... that the reviewers in this case are unusually directive, recommending a complete response rather than simply raising questions,” Bernstein analysts said in a note.  “(But) all is not lost for Xarelto in the advisory committee on Thursday,” the analysts said. “Panels do not always follow the recommendations of the FDA reviewers.”  ",9062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fda-xarelto/bayer-jj-stroke-drug-not-ready-for-approval-us-fda-idUSTRE78550220110906

Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said Xarelto’s prospects have now significantly dimmed. Even if approved, Purkiss said, the drug will now likely only be used if patients do not benefit from warfarin and Pradaxa, a newly approved stroke medicine from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim.   The FDA review appeared to be good news for a rival treatment called Eliquis being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), in an anti-clotting market that could top $10 billion a year. [ID:nN1E7811E3]   Pfizer shares were up 0.7 percent, while Bristol-Myers was up 0.4 percent, with both stocks were outperforming the broader U.S. market and the Arca Pharmaceuticals Index .DRG.   Eliquis, also called apixaban, showed superiority over warfarin in effectiveness, safety and saving lives in a clinical trial presented last month at a scientific meeting in Paris, affirming its place as the potential leader of the pack. [ID:nL5E7JT0KV]   “The prospects for apixaban and Pradaxa just got better,” Purkiss said after the Xarelto review.   THIRD-LINE STATUS?   FDA reviewers questioned whether Xarelto was as effective as warfarin, saying that in a trial comparing the two, warfarin was not given in the proper dosing.   They said for conditions such as stroke, which can cause irreversible harm, new drugs must be shown to be at least as effective as older treatments.   They also focused on risks for patients when they come off the drug. When patients stopped taking Xarelto and resumed warfarin at the end of the main clinical trial, higher risk of stroke was seen, a so-called “rebound” effect.   However, bleeding risk was the only significant issue with Xarelto on its own, the FDA staff said.   They asked the companies to conduct further trials to show Xarelto was as safe and effective as warfarin, or as compared to Pradaxa.   “It seems advisable to make rivaroxaban a third-line agent, behind both warfarin and dabigatran (Pradaxa),” FDA staff said in the documents, until the companies submit more data on Xarelto.   Johnson & Johnson said the FDA staff documents did not represent the agency’s final recommendation.   “We’re confident in the effectiveness of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with AF,” said Ernie Knewitz, a spokesman for J&J. The two companies co-developed the drug, and J&J has marketing rights in the United States.   Analysts from Sanford Bernstein forecast Xarelto sales of $948 million for J&J in 2015, and 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for Bayer, which has much greater sales outside the United States.   They said the market overreacted in its initial sharp drop, especially as European regulators often reach different conclusions than the FDA.   “We accept ... that the reviewers in this case are unusually directive, recommending a complete response rather than simply raising questions,” Bernstein analysts said in a note.   “(But) all is not lost for Xarelto in the advisory committee on Thursday,” the analysts said. “Panels do not always follow the recommendations of the FDA reviewers.”  (Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Lewis Krauskopf in New York, and Ludwig Baker in Frankfurt; Editing by Derek Caney, John Wallace, Dave Zimmerman)  ",9062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/fda-xarelto/update-3-bayer-jj-stroke-drug-not-ready-for-approval-us-fda-idUSN1E7850CD20110906
60,BMY,Will bargain Bayer attract a buyer after setback?," FRANKFURT, Sept 7 (Reuters) - One day after a damning appraisal by U.S. regulators of Bayer’s (BAYGn.DE) Xarelto pill, analysts took stock of what the group could be worth without its most important pipeline drug, and some now see it as a takeover target.	   The prevailing view is that the share rout that followed the Food and Drug Administration’s preliminary verdict on Tuesday made Bayer quite a bargain, even in the worst case that Xarelto wins no or only a small inroad in the world’s largest drug market.	   One analyst even suggests that industry rivals, Sanofi  in particular, stand to gain from buying Bayer outright.	   U.S. drug regulators said Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s  experimental stroke preventer Xarelto, an anti blood-clotting agent, was not ready for approval and questions were raised about its effectiveness, sending Bayer shares down more than 7 percent. 	   Xarelto is Bayer’s most important pipeline drug by far, and the company eyes more than 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in annual sales from it.	   On Wednesday, the shares had recouped 2 percent, hitting 38.49 euros by 1337 GMT.	   “On average the European Pharma companies would stand to increase their (2015 estimated earnings per share) by 50 percent even in the scenario of zero contribution from Xarelto globally,” J.P. Morgan analysts Alexandra Hauber and Richard Vosser said in a note issued on Wednesday.	   “We believe the best strategic fit is with Sanofi, Novartis  and AstraZeneca ,” they said, basing their analysis on a hypothetical 20 percent takeover premium over Tuesday’s close.	   Bayer would be a “very strong fit” across Sanofi’s oncology, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, animal health and consumer health businesses, they added.	   For its part, Sanofi on Tuesday again ruled out major transactions. 	   Apart from the deal size — Bayer has a market value of more than 30 billion euros even after the slump — Bayer’s chemicals-to-drugs hybrid structure would make a takeover a highly complex transaction.	   A healthcare buyer seeking to preserve its “pure play” bonus would have to divest Bayer’s pesticides and chemicals business, which according to J.P.Morgan could be a 20-25 billion euro deal.	   Still, UniCredit analysts echoed J.P. Morgan in saying that Bayer was now a “compelling acquisition target” with a fair value of 76.08 euros per share, more than double Tuesday’s close.	   Both Bayer’s alpharadin, a drug against bone metastases, and eye drug Eylea, previously known as VEGF Trap-Eye, make for an attractive pipeline without Xarelto, several brokerages said.   	   Of the 36 Bayer analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters StarMine, 23, or more than 60 percent, rate the stock “buy” or the equivalent of “strong buy”. Their average price target is 61.07 euros per share.	   The FDA’s recommendation, however, took most analysts by surprise.	   “This view is significantly different from the consensus of cardiologists presenting at the European Society of Cardiology conference last week,” said Craig Maxwell at UniCredit.	   Many of his peers stressed that the FDA advisory committee of independent experts due to vote late on Thursday could still take a different view from the FDA’s initial statement, but peak sales estimates were slashed or put in doubt across the board.	   Equinet analyst Martin Possienke cut his estimate of maximum annual sales from Xarelto to 500 million from 3 billion euros. Barclays Capital’s Mark Purcell said he was bracing for “commercial failures” of the Xarelto franchise.	   Even if approved, Xarelto’s use in the United States might be limited to those patients for whom the established stroke prevention drug warfarin and Boehringer Ingelheim’s new Pradaxa pill is not advisable.	   Rival treatment Eliquis, under development by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer , is currently viewed as the drug with potentially the best benefit-risk profile in a stroke prevention market that could top $10 billion a year.

61,BMY,UPDATE 2-US FDA panel gives nod to Bayer/J&J; anti-clot drug," * Panelists split on whether Xarelto as good as warfarin   * Call for more data on how to transition off of Xarelto   * Xarelto market share could fall to 10 pct-Morningstar   * FDA decision expected by Nov. 4  (Adds company and analyst comments, sales)   By Anna Yukhananov   COLLEGE PARK, Md., Sept 8 (Reuters) - A new stroke preventer from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) moved one step closer to U.S. approval, but questions remained about restrictions on labeling and the need for more studies.   A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 9-2 on Thursday to recommend approval of the once-a-day anti-clotting pill, called Xarelto.   Xarelto is one of several promising entrants angling to replace warfarin for people with dangerously irregular heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation (AF).   Warfarin is a problematic decades-old clot preventer originally developed as rat poison.   “I’ve seen the problems many patients face with warfarin,” said Dr. Philip Sager, a panel member and executive committee member of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium in San Francisco. “I think there’s a tremendous unmet medical need for new therapies.”   Analysts estimate the stroke-fighting market could top $10 billion annually. Xarelto may lose out on market share if the FDA asks the company to conduct further trials, delaying approval, analysts said.   AF patients’ irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes. But many are unwilling to take warfarin, which requires regular blood tests, or are unable to tolerate it.   Panelists were divided on whether Xarelto, with the clinical name rivaroxaban, was as effective as warfarin.   In clinical trials that compared Xarelto to warfarin, panelists and the FDA said the older drug was not always given in the proper dosing, making it more difficult to determine if Xarelto was just as good.   “I’ve heard nothing that convinces me that rivaroxaban should be first-line treatment for many patients,” said Allan Coukell, the patient representative on the panel and director for medical safety at Pew Health Group, adding that Xarelto’s label should reflect that.   Earlier this week, FDA reviewers said for conditions such as stroke, which can cause irreversible harm, new drugs must be shown to be at least as effective as older treatments, and called for the agency to delay Xarelto’s approval. [ID:nN1E7850CD]   In Thursday’s meeting, panel members also focused on risks for patients when they come off the drug. Patients who stopped taking Xarelto and resumed warfarin at the end of the main clinical trial had a higher risk of stroke, a so-called “rebound” effect.   “Additional data probably should be obtained regarding how to transition (off of Xarelto) prior to approval,” said Dr. Michael Lincoff, chair of the panel and professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.   The FDA is set to make the final decision on Xarelto by Nov. 4, Johnson & Johnson said.   “Given the relatively risk-adverse nature of the FDA, even with this panel’s recommendation of Xarelto, the agency may want a number of additional studies” before granting approval, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.   “So there could be a one-to-two-year delay,” he predicted, saying that would greatly hurt the drug’s ultimate sales potential.   He said the FDA might be willing to take its time because another effective blood clot preventer, Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, was approved last year and is already available as an alternative to warfarin.   Conover said he had expected Xarelto to eventually capture 15 percent of the stroke-prevention market among AF patients, but he now expects its market share to be below 10 percent.   Dr Peter Dibattiste, global head of J&J’s cardiovascular and metabolic division, said the company will discuss with the FDA the need for additional studies. A study looking at how long Xarelto lasted in patients could be relatively quick, “probably months,” he told reporters.   A delay for Xarelto could give the edge to a rival treatment called Eliquis being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). If Eliquis is approved, Morningstar’s Conover predicted, it could have four times the sales of Xarelto.   Eliquis, also called apixaban, showed superiority over warfarin in effectiveness, safety and saving lives in a clinical trial presented last month at a scientific meeting in Paris, affirming its place as the potential leader of the pack. [ID:nL5E7JT0KV]   Xarelto is approved in the United States and Europe for anti-clotting in patients after knee and hip surgery, a much smaller market than stroke prevention for AF patients.   Earlier this week, analysts from Sanford Bernstein forecast Xarelto sales of $948 million for J&J in 2015, and 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for Bayer, which has much greater sales outside the United States.   Bayer said it sees peak sales of Xarelto at more than 2 billion euro ($2.8 billion), “irrespective of the decision by the FDA in early November,” according to a statement.   Bayer, which co-developed the drug with J&J, sold exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Xarelto to J&J in 2005. As part of that agreement Bayer stands to receive royalty payments of up to 30 percent on U.S. sales.   Bayer said it expects approval of Xarelto in Europe in the third or fourth quarter of this year.

62,BMY,PREVIEW-Lofty hopes confront Gilead's 4-drug HIV pill," * Key trial results expected this month   * May need to show superiority to rivals to boost stock   * Sales forecasts vary widely   By Deena Beasley   LOS ANGELES, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) experimental four-drug HIV pill may need to do more than simply match the safety and effectiveness of existing therapies to meet its lofty sales expectations.   Results for the second pivotal clinical trial for the combination drug are expected this month. The pill is likely to meet the study’s goal of working as well as a combination of other medicines, analysts said, but it may need to show superiority to convince investors of its commercial potential and send Gilead shares higher.   The biotechnology company said in August that its first pivotal trial of the pill, known as the Quad, met the goal of showing that it worked as well as Atripla, Gilead’s current three-drug combination HIV pill.   But shares of the Foster City, California-based company fell as much as 3 percent after the news and the stock has dropped more than 10 percent over the past seven weeks.   “There were some investors who were hoping the trial would show superiority to Atripla,” said Needham & Co analyst Alan Carr.   The Quad is seen as Gilead’s most important pipeline product — all of the components are owned by the company, and the Quad would extend the life of the company’s lucrative HIV franchise.   As of early 2011, about 80 percent of U.S. HIV patients and 72 percent of European HIV patients were treated with a Gilead drug. Combination drugs are particularly important for HIV patients, who must juggle a huge amount of pills on a daily basis.   The Quad combines experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada, a pill consisting of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread.   Most of the company’s current drug sales — which totaled $7.4 billion last year — come from Atripla, a once-daily pill that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) Sustiva.   Gilead earns no profit from the Bristol drug, and all of the Atripla components lose patent protection in the next few years.   The second pivotal trial of the Quad is designed to show that it works as well as a combination of ritonavir-boosted Reyataz, a protease inhibitor sold by Bristol-Myers, and Truvada.   RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee puts the odds that the Quad will show superiority to the Reyataz regimen at 25 percent.   A lower-cost generic version of Atripla could be on the market in 2018, and Gilead will need a compelling case to convince doctors that the Quad will benefit patients more than existing HIV drugs.   If approved, the Quad would be the first single-tablet regimen for HIV to include an integrase inhibitor — a new class of drugs designed to block the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus to replicate.   The four-drug pill is also seen as potentially safer than Atripla, but Gilead said initial results from the first pivotal trial showed similar rates of adverse side effects and patient drop-out rates for both treatment groups.   Full safety data from the first trial will be presented at a medical conference in March, and Gilead plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval of the Quad in the first quarter of 2012.   U.S. regulators last month approved Gilead’s Complera, a  three-drug combination of Emtriva, Viread and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Edurant. Under its deal with J&J, Gilead will keep up to 30 percent of what it makes off the Edurant component.   Analysts expect Gilead’s Complera sales to reach $916 million by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sales of the Quad are forecast as high as $1.53 billion by 2015, but estimates vary widely.   “While Gilead remains the dominant market leader in HIV ... we believe the overall market trends are slowing and that trends toward earlier treatment have been close to fully realized,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a research note this week.   He forecasts 2015 Quad sales of just $367.3 million.   Gilead licensed elvitegravir from Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in March 2005. The U.S. company has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug everywhere except Japan.   Currently, the only integrase inhibitor approved by regulators is Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) Isentress, or raltegravir, but it must be taken twice a day.   ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture between GlaxoSmithkline Plc (GSK.L) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is testing a combination of experimental integrase inhibitor dolutegravir and Epzicom, which consists of HIV drugs Ziagen and Epivir.   Yee at RBC Capital Markets said the Glaxo drug could be competition for the Quad, but noted that dolutegravir will not be co-formulated with Truvada.   He also said Epzicom use is associated with higher cardiovascular risks.

63,BMY,Bayer gains as U.S. hopes revive for stroke drug,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Bayer (BAYGn.DE) shares rose 2.5 percent on Friday after its stroke-prevention drug Xarelto was recommended by a U.S. panel, moving it a step closer to approval in the world’s biggest market.  But analysts said the drug, being developed with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (JNJ.N), was only likely to carry a claim of non-inferiority, rather than superiority, over the established product warfarin and there may be a need for further studies.  “(The vote) should aid recovery in the stock although investors should be aware that Xarelto could still be delayed in the United States for stroke prevention,” JP Morgan analysts said in a note.  Xarelto’s place in the global stroke-fighting market, which could top $10 billion annually, had looked in serious jeopardy just three days ago.  On Tuesday, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers called for the agency to delay approval in an initial assessment, sending Bayer shares on a one-day slump of 7.5 percent.  They recovered on Friday to be up 2.2 percent at 1114 GMT.  Now, with the backing of the advisory panel, the medicine seems likely to get to the U.S. market, though it could face delays and may well end up with labeling that puts it at a disadvantage to rivals.  WestLB analyst Norbert Barth said Xarelto’s commercial potential appeared limited, even if it was approved in the U.S. by the target date of early November.  Other analysts were not convinced approval would come so quickly.  Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies said it seemed likely the FDA would require a further small clinical study to assess risks for patients when they come off the drug, delaying its launch by around 12 months.  A delay for Xarelto could give a further edge to a rival treatment, Eliquis, being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which is considered to have the strongest profile among the new rivals to warfarin.  Another blood clot preventer, Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, was approved last year and is already available in the U.S. as an alternative to decades-old warfarin.  All three drugs are designed for patients with atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat mainly affecting the elderly that can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes.  Tim Race of Deutsche Bank said it seemed likely Xarelto’s label would disadvantage the drug relative to Pradaxa and Eliquis, denting commercial expectations.  That could cut Deutsche’s 2015 U.S. Xarelto sales forecasts to 300-400 million euros from a current assumption of 900 million, he added.  Bayer said in a statement it continued to see worldwide peak sales of Xarelto at more than 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion), “irrespective of the decision by the FDA in early November.”  The German chemicals-and-drugs group sold exclusive U.S. rights for Xarelto to J&J in 2005. As part of that pact, Bayer stands to receive royalty payments of up to 30 percent on U.S. sales, while retaining exclusive rights outside the U.S.  In Europe, Bayer expects approval of Xarelto in the third or fourth quarter of this year.

Earlier this week, analysts from Sanford Bernstein forecast Xarelto sales of $948 million for J&J in 2015, and 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for Bayer, which has much greater sales outside the United States.   Bayer said it sees peak sales of Xarelto at more than 2 billion euro ($2.8 billion), “irrespective of the decision by the FDA in early November,” according to a statement.   Bayer, which co-developed the drug with J&J, sold exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Xarelto to J&J in 2005. As part of that agreement Bayer stands to receive royalty payments of up to 30 percent on U.S. sales.   Bayer said it expects approval of Xarelto in Europe in the third or fourth quarter of this year.

66,BMY,UPDATE 3-Gilead's 2nd trial of 4-drug AIDS pill meets goal,"   * 90 pct of Quad patients achieved target viral load  * More patients on Reyataz dropped out of the trial  * U.S. FDA filing planned by end of year  * Shares close down 0.9 percent  (Adds analyst comment, background)   Sept 19 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) four-drug experimental HIV pill worked as well as a regimen containing protease inhibitor Reyataz in the second pivotal trial of the drug, the company said on Monday.   But while the trial succeeded, it did not show that the experimental pill, called the Quad, was superior to the Reyataz regimen and Gilead shares fell about 0.9 percent.   “Overall the data are good ... mostly in line with investor expectations,” said Cowen and Co analyst Philip Nadeau.   “I think there might have been a little bit of expectation for statistical superiority, but only from a few outliers.”   The trial found that 90 percent of patients taking the Gilead drug achieved target levels of HIV in the blood, or viral load, compared with 87 percent of patients on ritonavir-boosted Reyataz, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N).   The four-drug pill — which combines experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada, a pill consisting of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread — is seen as the biotechnology company’s most important pipeline product.   “While Quad may become the drug of choice for new patients, we see limited impetus for switching well-controlled patients ... and as such view the Quad as a modest mitigant of generic risk emerging between 2017 to 2021,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a research note, referring to the years when key Gilead patents will expire.   The most bullish sales estimates for the Quad assume that it will be prescribed for both newly diagnosed and existing HIV patients.   Wall Street analysts, on average, have forecast Quad sales of $1.53 billion by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Gilead said 5.1 percent of Reyataz patients dropped out of the trial, mainly due to elevated bilirubin levels, compared with a drop-out rate of 3.1 percent for patients treated with the Quad pill.   The company said it planned to file for U.S. regulatory approval of the Quad by the end of this year — earlier than its previous estimate of a filing in the first quarter of 2012.   Gilead Chief Operating Officer John Milligan, speaking on a conference call, said the company would request a “priority review” by the Food and Drug Administration, which could clear the way for an approval as early as mid-year 2012.   The company said last month that its other Phase 3 trial of the Quad showed that the pill worked as well as Atripla, Gilead’s currently marketed three-drug HIV pill.   The company’s shares, which closed at $40.05 on Nasdaq, were trading at $39.81 after hours.

68,BMY,"Scientists find way to ""disarm"" AIDS virus","LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have found a way to prevent HIV from damaging the immune system and say their discovery may offer a new approach to developing a vaccine against AIDS.  Researchers from the United States and Europe working in laboratories on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) found it is unable to damage the immune system if cholesterol is removed from the virus’s membrane.  “It’s like an army that has lost its weapons but still has flags, so another army can recognize it and attack it,” said Adriano Boasso of Imperial College London, who led the study.  The team now plans to investigate how to use this way of inactivating the virus and possibly develop it into a vaccine.  Usually when a person becomes infected with HIV, the body’s innate immune response puts up an immediate defense. But some researchers believe HIV causes the innate immune system to overreact. This weakens the immune system’s next line of defense, known as the adaptive immune response.  For this study — published on Monday in the journal Blood — Boasso’s team removed cholesterol from the membrane around the virus and found that this stopped HIV from triggering the innate immune response. This in turn led to a stronger adaptive response, orchestrated by a type of immune cells called T cells.  AIDS kills around 1.8 million people a year worldwide. An estimated 2.6 million people caught HIV in 2009, and 33.3 million people are living with the virus.  Major producers of current HIV drugs include Gilead Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.  Scientists from companies, non-profits and governments around the world have been trying for many years to make a vaccine against HIV but have so far had only limited success.  A 2009 study in Thailand involving 16,000 volunteers showed for the first time that a vaccine could prevent HIV infection in a small number of people, but since the efficacy was only around 30 percent researchers were forced back to the drawing board.  An American team working on an experimental HIV vaccine said in May that it helped monkeys with a form of the AIDS virus control the infection for more than a year, suggesting it may lead to a vaccine for people.  HIV is spread in many ways — during sex, on needles shared by drug users, in breast milk and in blood — so there is no single easy way to prevent infection. The virus also mutates quickly and can hide from the immune system, and attacks the very cells sent to battle it.  “HIV is very sneaky,” Boasso said in a statement. “It evades the host’s defenses by triggering overblown responses that damage the immune system. It’s like revving your car in first gear for too long — eventually the engine blows out.  He said this may be why developing a vaccine has proven so tricky. “Most vaccines prime the adaptive response to recognize the invader, but it’s hard for this to work if the virus triggers other mechanisms that weaken the adaptive response.”  HIV takes its membrane from the cell that it infects, the researchers explained in their study. This membrane contains cholesterol, which helps keep it fluid and enables it to interact with particular types of cell.  Normally, a subset of immune cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) recognize HIV quickly and react by producing signaling molecules called interferons. These signals activate various processes which are initially helpful, but which damage the immune system if switched on for too long.  Working with scientists Johns Hopkins University, the University of Milan and Innsbruck University, Boasso’s team found that if cholesterol is removed from HIV’s envelope, it can no longer activate pDCs. As a result, T cells, which orchestrate the adaptive response, can fight the virus more effectively.",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aids-hiv-disarm/scientists-find-way-to-disarm-aids-virus-idUSTRE78I5O820110919
69,BMY,Sanofi CEO says drug industry undervalued,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanofi SA’s (SASY.PA) chief executive has already put his company’s patent expiration woes in the rear view mirror and believes that the French drugmaker and the pharmaceutical industry are undervalued.  “We’re not in a market that’s really looking at fundamentals right now. Personally, I think this is an industry that is getting ready for a re-rating,” Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher told Reuters in an interview in New York.  He said that could take place once investors digest the anticipated sales declines for huge selling drugs like Sanofi’s Plavix and Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Lipitor that are bracing for imminent generic competition.  Sanofi’s price-to-earnings ratio is about 7.5 times next year’s projected earnings. Several rival drugmakers are also in the high single digits.  “You typically have low double-digit PEs for the market and my ambition for Sanofi, and I think for what the industry would be too, is to at least close the discount,” he said.  Viehbacher, whose company makes a top-selling diabetes drug Lantus, is a bit envious of companies whose products have been accused of contributing to such health problems.  “I’d like to have the same P/E as people who make sodas and potato chips,” quipped the charismatic 51-year-old CEO. The soft drink sector has an average P/E ratio of 16.3, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The Paris-based company, whose Plavix blood clot preventer and Avapro blood pressure drug face generic competition next year, has taken steps to shore up investor confidence by diversifying product offerings and promising its dividend will go from a current 35 percent payout rate to the 50 percent range by no later than 2014.  The company plans to maintain that higher rate — the proportion of net company business income that is given to investors in the form of dividends — for years to come.  “If you are going to make commitments on dividend policy, you have to be prepared to make those long term,” he said.  Viehbacher said studies have shown that companies that provide higher dividend payouts “do better versus the broader market than those who do buybacks, in terms of share price.”  Sanofi is relying on vaccines, animal health and consumer health products, as well as emerging markets, for sustained profit growth in the post-blockbuster era for drugmakers.  “You don’t have to come up with the ‘son of Plavix’ to make your company succeed,” he said. He already views drugs about to lose patent protection like Plavix as “discontinued business”.  Viehbacher is no stranger to such cycles in the drug business. He became Sanofi’s CEO in 2008 after heading pharmaceuticals in North America for GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L).  “This is the fourth time I’ve been through a patent cliff in my career and the objective of this is to avoid a fifth one,” he said.  Viehbacher said the company’s recent $20.1 billion purchase of U.S.-based Genzyme and its biotech drugs for rare diseases dovetails with that strategy. He said integration of Genzyme was going well, and that he did not plan more large deals.  “The company is nicely balanced, so I don’t particularly see any reason to go out and do big deals, so that’s completely off our radar screen,” Viehbacher said. “We’re going to continue to spend about 1 to 2 billion euros ($1.36 billion to $2.7 billion) per year on acquisitions.”  Viehbacher said he expects Genzyme’s manufacturing woes to be largely resolved by the middle of next year with the opening of a new plant in Framingham, Mass. the most critical step.  Genzyme failed to ship its drug for Fabry disease, Fabrazyme, in August despite prior assurances, and will have limited supplies of Gaucher disease drug Cerezyme through January, opening the door to further inroads by rivals.  Viehbacher, who described his company as “a cash machine” said Sanofi’s resources had helped get several delayed Genzyme projects back on track, including three Phase III trials.  He expressed confidence in Genzyme’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug Lemtrada, which will have critical Phase III data this year after reducing MS relapses by 60 percent in Phase II trials. And he is excited about a new diabetes treatment from the GLP-1 class that Sanofi is developing and also plans to combine with Lantus.  Sanofi plans to file for approval of six new drugs over a nine month period, Viehbacher said. He said the success of Lemtrada and other new drugs would restore faith in the company’s research and development reputation.  Meanwhile Viehbacher said Lantus, Sanofi’s $5.2 billion-a-year long-acting insulin, was not likely to see generic rivals in the foreseeable future.  “You’re going to have other competitors,” he said, citing new products coming from rivals Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) and Eli Lilly (LLY.N), “but at this stage we don’t see anything that causes us great concern.”  He also appeared to shrug off concerns that Sanofi’s Multaq drug for irregular heartbeat could face sales limitations or even be pulled from the market over safety concerns.  A European regulatory panel will discuss Multaq safety this week after heart problems surfaced in a study of patients with a more serious permanent form of atrial fibrillation. The drug is now typically given to patients whose incidence of irregular heart rhythms comes and goes.  “All of the conversations we’ve had with the agencies to date have been very positive,” he said. “We believe that the benefits clearly are there for the patients.”  ",9202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi/sanofi-ceo-says-drug-industry-undervalued-idUSTRE78J22C20110920
70,BMY,"Spooky theory, leukemia drugs top Nobel tips: Thomson Reuters","LONDON (Reuters) - Researchers who developed ground-breaking leukemia drugs, discovered dendrimers and delved into the intricacies of what Einstein dubbed “spooky action” are among Thomson Reuters 2011 top tips to win Nobel prizes for science.  Nobel prediction expert David Pendlebury’s annual forecast is made using the company’s “Web of Knowledge” data on how often a scientist’s published papers are used and cited as a basis for further investigation by other researchers.  “In the scientific community, citations ... can serve as another form of peer review,” said Pendlebury, a citation analyst at Thomson Reuters research services.  “The more cited a scientist is, the more well-respected the author tends to be amongst his or her peers, which can be a predictor of awards like the Nobel prize.”  Winners of the 2011 Nobels are due to be announced in early October and at least one of the picks from Pendlebury’s prediction list has won every year. He makes predictions for the four science prizes, not for Peace and Literature.  Among Thomson Reuters favorites for the Medicine prize are three scientists from the United States — Brian Druker, Nicholas Lydon and Charles Sawyers — who discovered and developed ground-breaking new drugs called imatinib and dasatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).  So-called tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs such as imatinib, marketed by Swiss drugmaker Novartis as Glivec or Gleevec, and dasatinib, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb as Sprycel, have transformed treatment of CML and are credited with turning it from a fatal cancer into a manageable condition.  “This was a fundamental discovery in medicine ... with a fantastic result which is often referred to in terms like ‘magic bullet’,” said Pendlebury. “It has really given a new paradigm for the treatment of cancer.”  He noted that Druker, Lydon and Sawyers won the 2009 Lasker award, widely considered a good predictor of Nobel winners, for their work. “It seems to me that all things are in alignment for a Nobel prize for this discovery.”  Also on Pendlebury’s Medicine list are Robert Langer and Joseph Vacanti, who pioneered work in regenerative medicine and who in 2005 founded the company InVivo Therapeutics to develop stem cell treatments for people with spinal cord injuries.  For Chemistry, Pendlebury points to Jean Frechet and Donald Tomalia, who discovered dendrimers — a class of tiny synthetic compounds that can be designed for use in medicine, electronics and materials industries — and to Martin Karplus for pioneering simulations of the molecular dynamics of biomolecules.  Nobels often go to groups of three researchers, so French scientist Alain Aspect, American John Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger may be in with a chance of the Physics prize for their work on quantum entanglement, a notion that an exasperated Albert Einstein once described as “spooky action at a distance.”  Quantum entanglement involves the theory that particles can be connected in such a way that changing the state of one instantly affects the other, even when they are miles apart.  Entanglement plays an important role in the development of super-fast quantum computers, which scientists believe could outperform conventional computers by being able to test many possible solutions to a problem at once.  Aspect, Clauser and Zeilinger confirmed the entanglement phenomenon in a series of sophisticated experiments during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and in 2010 won the Wolf Prize in Physics for their work.  “While a full description of the kind that Einstein wanted is still not in anybody’s pocket, these experiments have been fundamental in physics in the 20th century,” said Pendlebury.  “They have confirmed spookiness at a distance. And I think Einstein would continue to be annoyed that there is not a better explanation for how this occurs.”  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nobels-predictions-thomsonreuters/spooky-theory-leukemia-drugs-top-nobel-tips-thomson-reuters-idUSTRE78K1OL20110921

74,BMY,Advisers urge FDA to address antipsychotics in kids,"GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. pediatric health advisers on Thursday urged drug regulators to continue studying weight gain and other side-effects of antipsychotic drugs as they are increasingly taken by children.  The pediatric advisory committee voted 16-1 to support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s routine safety monitoring of the new generation of antipsychotics.  But they did so with a caveat that the agency specifically looks at how to clarify the drugs’ labels to highlight concerns of their impact on children, namely the risks of weight gain and diabetes.  “We ask that with this upcoming revision that you carefully consider the language around pediatric use and adverse events,” said Dr. Geoffrey Rosenthal, the committee’s chair and director of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.  The FDA in the next month to six weeks will release a revised label for Abilify, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Otsuka Pharmaceutical, which is one of the antipsychotic drugs approved for use in children.  The new label will detail the drug’s latest clinical trials, warn of metabolic concerns and remind doctors to monitor patient weight and symptoms of diabetes, said Dr. Tom Laughren, FDA’s psychiatry products chief.

76,BMY,"Bristol CEO says ""pure pharma"" strategy paying off","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Chief Executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said the company intends to remain “100 percent” in prescription medicines and is prepared to use its $10 billion cash hoard to gain new drugs through moderate size deals with other drugmakers.  Lamberto Andreotti also told scores of industry executives and analysts that the company’s recently approved Yervoy medicine for metastatic melanoma continues to generate good initial sales.  “We will continue to remain 100 percent pharma,” Andreotti said at the Pharmaceutical Strategic Alliances Conference in New York. He said it was beneficial to have “the entire management team strictly focused on one business.”  “We can continue to be successful as 100 percent pharma,” said Andreotti, whose company is deemed by many analysts to have the strongest lineup of recently approved drugs and medicines in the late stages of development in the industry.  The 153-year old company now focuses completely on prescription medicines after having divested its consumer product, medical devices and nutritional products divisions. Its former brands include Excedrin and Bufferin headache medicines and Convatec wound-healing products.  Two years ago the company spun off its majority stake in Mead Johnson, a leading nutritionals company that sells Enfamil baby formula, to focus on traditional prescription pills and sophisticated biotech drugs.  Meanwhile, big rivals such as Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Novartis AG, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi SA say they get more reliable profit growth from an array of product lines, including animal health, consumer healthcare products and low-cost generics.  And unlike larger drugmakers such as Pfizer and Merck that have grown by gobbling up rivals through huge deals, Andreotti says Bristol has avoided going down that path.  “We didn’t have to go through the disruption of mergers,” he said, noting that the 1989 Bristol-Myers tie up with Squibb was many years before his time at the helm.  Bristol-Myers has captured attention for Yervoy, a biotech drug that spurs the immune system to fight advanced melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer. It was approved in March and some analysts expect it to eventually generate annual sales of $6 billion as the first approved drug shown to extend survival of such patients.  Yervoy, which costs $120,000 for a full course of treatment, chalked up second quarter sales of $95 million — its first quarter on the market.

77,BMY,"Bristol CEO says ""pure pharma"" strategy paying off"," * Yervoy sales still doing well   * $10 bln cash holdings will back drug deals   * Large deals not necessary   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Chief Executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) said the company intends to remain “100 percent” in prescription medicines and is prepared to use its $10 billion cash hoard to gain new drugs through moderate size deals with other drugmakers.   Lamberto Andreotti also told scores of industry executives and analysts that the company’s recently approved Yervoy medicine for metastatic melanoma continues to generate good initial sales.   “We will continue to remain 100 percent pharma,” Andreotti said at the Pharmaceutical Strategic Alliances Conference in New York. He said it was beneficial to have “the entire management team strictly focused on one business.”   “We can continue to be successful as 100 percent pharma,” said Andreotti, whose company is deemed by many analysts to have the strongest lineup of recently approved drugs and medicines in the late stages of development in the industry.   The 153-year old company now focuses completely on prescription medicines after having divested its consumer product, medical devices and nutritional products divisions. Its former brands include Excedrin and Bufferin headache medicines and Convatec wound-healing products.   Two years ago the company spun off its majority stake in Mead Johnson, a leading nutritionals company that sells Enfamil baby formula, to focus on traditional prescription pills and sophisticated biotech drugs.   Meanwhile, big rivals such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), Novartis AG NOVN.VX, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) say they get more reliable profit growth from an array of product lines, including animal health, consumer healthcare products and low-cost generics.   And unlike larger drugmakers such as Pfizer and Merck that have grown by gobbling up rivals through huge deals, Andreotti says Bristol has avoided going down that path.   “We didn’t have to go through the disruption of mergers,” he said, noting that the 1989 Bristol-Myers tie up with Squibb was many years before his time at the helm.   Bristol-Myers has captured attention for Yervoy, a biotech drug that spurs the immune system to fight advanced melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer. It was approved in March and some analysts expect it to eventually generate annual sales of $6 billion as the first approved drug shown to extend survival of such patients.   Yervoy, which costs $120,000 for a full course of treatment, chalked up second quarter sales of $95 million — its first quarter on the market.   Andreotti declined to discuss Yervoy sales for the third quarter, but said the drug “continues to do well.”   Bristol-Myers acquired Yervoy through its $2.4 billion purchase of Medarex Inc in 2009.

81,BMY,U.S. advisers urge FDA to address antipsychotics in kids,"GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. pediatric health advisers on Thursday urged drug regulators to continue studying weight gain and other side-effects of antipsychotic drugs as they are increasingly taken by children.  Significant numbers of U.S. children are receiving drugs to tame aggression, attention deficit disorder and other mental problems, even though there is little conclusive data to show exactly how the medications work or whether they damage kids’ health.  The pediatric advisory panel on Thursday listened to preliminary results of a study sponsored in part by the FDA that, inconclusively still, compared whether some antipsychotic drugs put children at a higher risk of developing diabetes than others.  Similar to the recommendations the panel has made in previous years, it voted 16-1 to support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s routine safety monitoring of the new generation of antipsychotics.  But the panel did so with a caveat that the agency specifically look at how to clarify the drugs’ labels to highlight concerns about their impact on children, namely the risks of weight gain and diabetes.  “There is serious concern that children may be at a higher risk for serious adverse effects and we just don’t have sufficient data to answer that question,” said Dr. Jonathan Mink, a child neurology expert from the University of Rochester Medical Center.  Dr. Jeffrey Wagener, a pediatric pulmonologist from the University of Colorado Medical School, was the one adviser to vote “no” out of concern that wouldn’t get regulators closer to dealing with the risks of using antipsychotics in children.  “I don’t see how the FDA is responding to the December 8, 2009 request by this committee in a thorough fashion,” he said. “It’s taken them two years to not respond to that that we need to be more than in the observational role.”  The FDA in the next month to six weeks will release a revised label for Abilify, a drug sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Otsuka Pharmaceutical and approved to treat schizophrenia in adolescents, bipolar disorder in children 10 to 17 years old and irritability associated with autism in those as young as six.  “We ask that with this upcoming revision that you carefully consider the language around pediatric use and adverse events,” said Dr. Geoffrey Rosenthal, the committee’s chair and director of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.  Abilify’s new label will detail the drug’s latest clinical trials, warn of metabolic concerns and remind doctors to monitor weight and symptoms of diabetes in all patients, said Dr. Thomas Laughren, FDA’s psychiatry products chief. The pediatric section of the label would contain a reference to those warnings, he said..  Such revisions, which are already incorporated into Johnson & Johnson’s antipsychotic medication Invega Sustenna, are being considered for other similar drugs on a case by case basis, Laughren said.  The new generation of antipsychotic medications has raised a wave of concerns as they are increasingly being prescribed for a host of uses and for younger and younger patients, with little conclusive research addressing their impact on children and sometimes with little evidence they work.  Newer antipsychotics include J&J’s Risperdal, known generically as risperidone; Eli Lilly & Co’s Zyprexa or olanzapine; AstraZeneca’s Seroquel or quetiapine; and Abilify, known generically as aripiprazole.  U.S. researchers have found that the drugs’ use in children increased by 65 percent from 2002 to 2009, primarily through prescriptions for teenagers.  From fall 2009 to spring of this year, 1.9 million prescriptions of Abilify alone were dispensed to patients under 18, including even 875 prescriptions for toddlers younger than 2, according to FDA research.  Most commonly, the prescriptions were for bipolar disorder in teenagers and preschoolers, and for affective psychoses in children between the ages of seven and 12.

87,BMY,"Targacept depression drug: high risk, high reward","BOSTON (Reuters) - Targacept Inc, a small drugmaker that began life inside the bowels of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, has for years been using its understanding of nicotine to develop experimental treatments for depression, schizophrenia and, yes, smoking cessation.  Now it is poised to release data from a crucial trial of its depression drug, TC-5214, an event that, in the view of Leerink Swann analyst Joshua Schimmer, represents “one of the most important catalysts in biotech through year-end.”  Targacept, which is developing the drug with Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, could see its stock rise by 100 to 200 percent if the results are positive, Schimmer said in a recent research report, and fall as much as 50 percent if they are negative. He gives the trial, the first of five late-stage studies, a 65 percent probability of success.  TC-5214 is thought to work by modulating neuronal nicotinic receptors in the brain. Overstimulation of these receptors, or proteins, is thought to be associated with depression.  A mid-stage trial showed that when TC-5214 was given to patients who did not respond well to citalopram, an antidepressant sold under the name Celexa, patients experienced a significantly greater lessening of their depression than those who took citalopram plus a placebo.  The key now is whether those results can be replicated in a bigger, phase III trial. Targacept will announce the results of the first such trial by the end of the year. Investors are most eagerly awaiting this data as it is expected to offer clues as to whether the other four trials, whose results are expected in the first half of next year, will be successful.  TC-5214 is a tweaked version of mecamylamine, a drug introduced in the 1950s to treat high blood pressure. Researchers at the University of South Florida later began testing mecamylamine in the hope it would help children with Tourette’s syndrome. It didn’t, but research showed that it seemed to lessen depression in those children.  Targacept acquired a license to the drug and began tweaking and developing it as a treatment for depression. Initial results have shown promise, but many depression drugs fail in late-stage trials, especially those that address new molecular targets.  “It may be difficult for them to replicate their Phase II results with a Phase III trial because it’s a new mechanism of action and therefore very high risk,” said Natalie Taylor, an analyst at the research firm Decision Resources.  Indeed, “short” interest in Targacept has doubled since January. By mid-September, some 5.5 percent of Targacept’s shares — a notable but not overwhelming amount — had been sold “short” by investors betting the stock will fall.  Most new depression drugs today work by increasing the chemicals serotonin, or serotonin and norepinephrine, in the brain. TC-5214 targets a different set of receptors, known as neuronal nicotinic receptors. According to Patrick Lippiello, co-founder of Targacept, the drug regulates an overactivity in the brain of the chemical messenger acetylcholine. It blocks the activity of its receptors to bring their activity down.  Ironically, modulating neuronal nicotinic receptors has been shown in some cases to increase suicidality. The first drug to modulate these receptors was Pfizer Inc’s anti-smoking drug Chantix, which was approved in 2006.  Chantix, however, has been plagued by safety concerns, including reports of a heightened risk of heart attack and of suicidal thinking, and while it appears to help some people stop smoking it is unclear exactly how the drug works.  “We don’t really know the mechanism except that it changes the activity of the nicotinic receptors,” said Stephen Heinemann, a professor and scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a pioneer in the identification and cloning of the nicotinic receptors.  It seems clear that nicotine, which activates the same receptors, can have antidepressant effects and boost cognition, Heinemann said. It is thought that many smokers and schizophrenics use cigarettes to “self-medicate.”  TC-5214 targets the same receptors but works in a different way and appears to have a more benign safety profile as well as a greater antidepressant effect.  “My prediction is TC-5214 will have very few side effects,” said Decision Resources’s Taylor.  Harry Tracy, an industry consultant and publisher of NeuroPerspective, a monthly publication focusing on central nervous system disorders, argues that it doesn’t really matter whether the drug’s mechanism of action is understood — as long as it works and is relatively safe.  “I am actually pretty confident about the Phase III trial,” he said, of TC-5214. “Of all the programs I follow, this is one where I think the rationale and data hold together pretty well.”  Targacept, which is based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is developing TC-5214 with AstraZeneca Plc, which is 2009 agreed to pay as much as $1.24 billion for rights to the drug, including an upfront payment of $200 million.  TC-5214 is one of the few potential bright spots in AstraZeneca’s pipeline. It is initially being designed as an add-on therapy for patients who have failed to respond to existing depression treatments, but the companies are also testing it as a single agent in patients who fail to respond adequately to a prior therapy.  Analysts expect the drug, if successful, to generate more than $1 billion a year as an adjunctive therapy; much more if approved for wider use.  If used as an add-on therapy, TC-5214 would compete with Abilify, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca’s own Seroquel XR. The two drugs are atypical antipsychotics, a class of drugs initially developed to treat schizophrenia.  Physicians are reluctant to use antipsychotics in patients with depression since they can have serious side effects. Abilify, among other things, can cause restlessness, while Seroquel can cause significant weight gain.  If TC-5214 fails, it would be, at most, a black eye for AstraZeneca, which generated more than $33 billion in sales last year. The stakes are far higher for Targacept, which has a market value of roughly $500 million and does not yet have a product on the market.  A positive result would give further credence to the science behind the company’s broader pipeline of experimental products, which include treatments for schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Alzheimer’s disease.  TARGACEPT SPIN-OFF  Targacept grew out of R.J. Reynold’s extensive research into the pharmacology and toxicology of nicotine. Donald deBethizy, Targacept’s chief executive, was a toxicologist who was hired by RJR in the mid-1980s to work on safer cigarettes in the company’s R&D department. He also managed a separate basic research program to study the biological effects of nicotine, later to become known as the Nicotine Research and Analog Development program (NRAD).  The scientists within NRAD gradually began to expand their research beyond nicotine, and to develop compounds that could capture the positive benefits of nicotine while dialing out the negative impact on heart rate and blood pressure. They discovered that compounds targeting nicotinic receptors appeared to have the potential for therapeutic benefit in a variety of diseases. But by the mid-1990s, “the demonization of the tobacco industry began,” said deBethizy, placing tobacco companies on the defensive.  RJR retrenched and lost interest in funding a pharmaceutical discovery business. It decided to spin NRAD off as an independent company. DeBethizy, who at that time was RJR’s overall vice president of research and development, stepped in to head NRAD, which by 1997 had dozens of patents in an industry entirely unrelated to the sale of tobacco.  NRAD renamed itself Targacept and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of RJR. By the middle of 2000 it had raised $30.4 million in venture capital funding, and in August its spin-off from RJR was complete. It first sold shares to the public in 2006 at $9 each.  By March this year the shares had risen to a high of about $30. Since then, they have dropped almost 50 percent after GlaxoSmithKline dropped out of a partnership and AstraZeneca failed to exercise its option to help develop Targacept’s schizophrenia drug TC-5619, even though it met the main goal of a mid-stage trial.  For the time being, investors and physicians alike are focused on TC-5214.  “Developing drugs based on different neural pathways is really important because most of the drugs we have now are derived from the same neural pathways,” said Dr. Srijan Sen, assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, and a specialist in the genetics of depression. Still, he said, “I’m skeptical.”  ",10032011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-targacept/targacept-depression-drug-high-risk-high-reward-idUSTRE79268Z20111003

The British drugmaker said on Tuesday that the heart drug — sold as Brilinta in the United States — had received a positive preliminary medical benefit assessment for the majority of German patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).	   ACS includes symptoms such as chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. 	   Germany’s Federal Joint Committee, or G-BA, decided AstraZeneca’s new drug offered “important additional benefit” for patients with non ST-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina — a group representing 72 percent of the total ACS population.	   Brilique was approved in Europe in December but its launch in Europe has been slow as AstraZeneca awaits decisions on its use in individual countries. The drug is a rival to Sanofi  and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s blood thinner Plavix, the world’s second biggest selling prescription drug.	   Under Germany’s new system, known as AMNOG, introduced from Jan. 1, drugs are only allowed free pricing for one year, during which time a benefit assessment must be carried out. If a drug is deemed to offer additional therapeutic benefits, an appropriate price is negotiated. If not, it is grouped into a pricing band alongside existing cheaper products.

89,BMY,FDA warns Bristol's leukemia drug may raise lung risks,"(Reuters) - Health regulators warned on Tuesday that Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s leukemia drug Sprycel may raise the risk of a rare, but serious condition characterized by abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. The condition, known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), makes the heart work harder to pump blood into the lungs. Over time, the overworked heart muscle may become weak and lose its ability to pump enough blood through the lungs. Sprycel was initially approved in the United States in June 2006. Since approval, cases of PAH have been identified in Bristol-Myers’ global pharmacovigilance database. No fatalities from the condition have been reported, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on its website. Twelve cases of PAH from the manufacturer’s database were confirmed, and Sprycel was identified as the most likely cause, FDA said. FDA said that if PAH is confirmed in a patient, Sprycel should be permanently discontinued.

90,BMY,UK cost agency rejects Bristol-Myers' skin cancer drug,"* Melanoma treatment Yervoy costs around 80,000 pounds a patient * NICE says costs too high, longer-term benefits not clear enough * Cost watchdog says draft guidance subject to appeal, revision By Kate Kelland LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb’s  Yervoy — the first drug to help patients with advanced melanoma live longer — is not cost effective for use in the taxpayer-funded National Health Service (NHS), Britain’s health costs watchdog said on Friday. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said Yervoy, or ipilimumab — which costs an average of around 20,000 pounds ($31,550) per dose and is given in four-dose courses — could not be recommended because its longer-term benefits were not clear enough. “We need to be sure that new treatments provide sufficient benefits to patients to justify the significant cost the NHS is being asked to pay,” NICE’s chief executive Andrew Dillon said in a statement. He said BMS may want to “consider whether it wishes to reduce the acquisition cost to the NHS of the drug”, since Yervoy costs around 80,000 pounds ($126,000) per patient whether the treatment is effective for them or not. Advanced melanoma, a type of skin cancer, can quickly spread from the skin to internal organs, such as the brain. Yervoy is the first approved therapy to clearly demonstrate that patients with metastatic melanoma live longer. The treatment was approved by drugs regulators in the United States in March and was in May recommended for approval in Europe by the European Medicines Agency. But Dillon said NICE was not convinced by the data BMS submitted. He said the key numbers came from a trial which did not compare Yervoy with the drugs currently used to treat people with advanced or metastatic melanoma, although he added that “the results did show the drug could potentially be very effective for a small percentage of patients”. “However, the follow up from the trial was too short to determine how long this effect would last,” he said. “Clinical specialists also told the independent appraisal committee that only around 30 percent of people treated with ipilimumab would have improved survival, with only 10 percent potentially experiencing long-term benefits,” he added. The drug is also linked with a number of adverse reactions including diarrhoea, rash, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain, Dillon said. “The committee considered all these factors and concluded that ... ipilimumab could not be considered a cost effective use of NHS resources,” he said. NICE said this decision was initial draft guidance and would be open for consultation — including input from the manufacturer, healthcare professionals and members of the public — before being issued to the NHS.

91,BMY,UPDATE 1-UK cost agency rejects Bristol-Myers' skin cancer drug,"* Melanoma treatment Yervoy costs around 80,000 pounds a patient * NICE says costs too high, longer-term benefits not clear enough * Cost watchdog says draft guidance subject to appeal, revision By Kate Kelland LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb’s  Yervoy — the first drug to help patients with advanced melanoma live longer — is not cost effective for use in the taxpayer-funded National Health Service (NHS), Britain’s health costs watchdog said on Friday. In a move which angered patient groups, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said Yervoy, or ipilimumab — which costs around 20,000 pounds ($31,550) a dose and is given in four doses — could not be recommended because its longer-term benefits were not clear. “We need to be sure that new treatments provide sufficient benefits to patients to justify the significant cost the NHS is being asked to pay,” NICE’s chief executive Andrew Dillon said in a statement. He said BMS may want to “consider whether it wishes to reduce the acquisition cost to the NHS of the drug”, since Yervoy costs around 80,000 pounds ($126,000) per patient whether the treatment is effective for them or not. Advanced melanoma, a type of skin cancer, can quickly spread from the skin to internal organs, such as the brain and often kills its victims in months. Yervoy is the first approved therapy to clearly demonstrate that patients with metastatic melanoma live longer, and patient groups said NICE’s decision against it was like handing down a “death sentence” to patients who could benefit from the drug. The treatment was approved by drugs regulators in the United States in March and was in May recommended for approval in Europe by the European Medicines Agency. According to Thomson Reuters Pharma data, market analysts see worldwide sales of Yervoy reaching $1.46 billion in 2016.

They accused NICE of handing a “death sentence” to patients and urged it to reconsider its preliminary decision. “Patients waiting for this decision were all hoping and praying that it would be favourable,” they said in a joint statement. “They are completely shattered, but have vowed, in the time they have left, to try and counter the decision.”",10142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bms-yervoy-nice/update-1-uk-cost-agency-rejects-bristol-myers-skin-cancer-drug-idUSL5E7LE06A20111014
92,BMY,UPDATE 1-U.S. appeals court upholds $442 mln Plavix award,"* Apotex must pay Sanofi and Bristol-Myers * Prejudgment interest award tossed out * Litigation stretches back to 2002 * Plavix revenues $1.87 billion in 2nd quarter Oct 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court upheld a ruling requiring Apotex to pay Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb $442 million for infringing a patent for the blood thinner Plavix, but tossed out $108 million in interest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears most appeals related to patents, ruled on Tuesday that Apotex, a privately held Canadian drugmaker, was required to pay the damages but said the lower court erred in awarding prejudgment interest. Apotex briefly sold a generic version of Plavix in a so-called at-risk launch, while challenging the validity of a patent for the anti-clot drug used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. But the lower court ruled that the Canadian company had infringed the patent and forced Apotex to stop selling its version. Sanofi filed its suit against Apotex in 2002. Plavix, known chemically as clopidogrel bisulfate, is the world’s second biggest selling prescription drug. It generated $1.87 billion in sales during the second quarter, underscoring its importance to Paris-headquartered Sanofi and New York-based partner Bristol-Myers. The case had come from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which issued the order for Apotex to pay the $442 million in damages plus the additional interest in October 2010. Sanofi is in the middle of its patent cliff years as patents for several key medicines including Plavix and cancer drug Taxotere expire and cheaper generics come onto the market. The patent for Plavix expires in May 2012. Sanofi has been branching out into areas including vaccines and animal health in a bid to maintain its revenues. Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb said in a statement that while they were pleased with the damages award, they were disappointed with the court’s decision with respect to the prejudgment interest. The Federal Circuit case is Sanofi-Aventis et al v. Apotex Inc et al. No. 2011-1048 The underlying case is Sanofi-Aventis et al v.

The company will offer some Bridgewater-based researchers the opportunity to transfer to Boston, spokesman Jack Cox said. Research changes in other countries have not been announced, but Sanofi is planning other research hubs in France, Germany and Asia, Cox said. The company is creating a new North American Development Center based at the Bridgewater office that is home to its North America Pharmaceuticals headquarters. The development center will include clinical development, regulatory affairs and other development platforms, the company said.

The final draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) comes just six months after Eliquis was licensed in Europe, marking an unusually rapid decision by the agency that determines which drugs are paid for on the state health service. Eliquis will compete in the post-surgery setting with established injectable anti-coagulants, such as Sanofi’s  Lovenox, as well as other new oral anti-coagulants like Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. These other drugs are also recommended by NICE for use after hip and knee replacement procedures. However, the really big commercial opportunity for new anti-clotting pills lies in their long-term use for preventing strokes in patients with irregular heartbeats. So far, only Pradaxa has been approved in this setting in Europe, although Xarelto was recommended for approval in September. NICE said the cost of Eliquis treatment was estimated to be 41.16 pounds ($63.82) for knee replacement surgery, based on 12 days of treatment, and 116.62 pounds for hip replacement, based on 34 days.",11252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristol-pfizer-britain/uk-cost-agency-backs-bms-pfizer-anti-clot-drug-idUSL5E7MO29C20111125
100,BMY,"Bristol-Myers, J&J; team up against hepatitis C","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Johnson & Johnson plan to jointly develop experimental treatments for hepatitis C in a market worth billions of dollars. The drugs being developed by the two companies work by blocking different proteins than those attacked by traditional treatments for the serious liver disease, which is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus. Bristol-Myers said on Friday its drugs daclatasir (BMS-790052) and its NS5A replication complex inhibitor would be tested in combination with a NS3 protease inhibitor called TMC435 being developed by J&J;’s Tibotec pharmaceuticals unit. Beginning in the first half of 2012, the medicines will be tested in various combinations in patients with genotype 1, the most common and most difficult-to-treat viral strain of hepatitis C. J&J; currently has the European rights to distribute Incivo (telaprevir), one of the most promising new hepatitis C treatments on the market. The recently approved drug, which can nearly double prior cure rates, was developed and is sold in the United States by Vertex Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Incivek. Any drug that comes out of the Bristol/J&J; collaboration would likely be a rival to the Vertex medicine, which is taken in combination with the older drugs ribavirin and pegylated interferon. Several companies are racing to develop hepatitis C treatment regimens that do not include interferon, which causes severe flu-like symptoms and leads many patients to discontinue or avoid treatment. Pharmasset Inc, which is being acquired by Gilead Sciences Inc and Abbott Laboratories, are among the companies developing promising all oral, interferon-free treatments for hepatitis C, a market some analysts have said could be worth $20 billion by 2020.

While Inhibitex has no marketed products, it does have a potentially highly effective 	 treatment for Hepatitis C infection, INX 189, in the second stage of clinical 	 testing. The currently approved treatments are only appropriate for a minority 	 of infected patients, presenting a large, unmet medical need. We believe the 	 product will require at least three more years of development before reaching 	 the market, if approved, and there will not be any meaningful benefit to BMS 	 in the near term. Still, BMS has maintained a nearly unleveraged financial 	 posture for several years now and has ample cash resources that eliminate the 	 need for new borrowings. We expect debt to EBITDA, adjusted for surplus cash, 	 to rise to only 0.2x for 2012. The ratings on New York-based BMS reflect Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services’ 	 view that the company has a strong business risk profile because of its 	 well-established position in the high-margin, patent-protected market for 	 prescription drugs. The key uncertainty facing BMS is the extent to which its 	 diverse pharmaceutical product portfolio and new product introductions will 	 offset losses from an approaching patent cliff. Our view of the financial risk 	 profile as modest incorporates the expectation that BMS will use its 	 substantial financial resources to continue acquiring products. Given partial 	 credit to its substantial reserves of cash and investments, we expect leverage 	 to remain near zero.",1092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA111820120109

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said data provided so far by Bayer on the drug, known generically as rivaroxaban, were not enough to judge whether it would be cost effective for prevention of strokes and embolisms in people with a heart condition known as atrial fibrillation. “Evidence of rivaroxaban’s cost-effectiveness was not reflective of all the people with atrial fibrillation in the UK who would be eligible for treatment with the drug,” the watchdog said in a statement on Monday. Germany’s Bayer is developing Xarelto with the U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson. NICE’s decision suggests a cautious approach to a wave of new treatments for preventing stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, a common heart arrhythmia.

105,BMY,TEXT-Fitch comments on Bristol Myers Squibb's acquisition of Inhibitex,"Jan 11 - Fitch Ratings believes that Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s (Bristol Myers Squibb) purchase of Inhibitex, Inc. (Inhibitex) for approximately $2.5 billion is consistent with the current rating rationale for the company. Fitch rates Bristol Myers Squibb’s as follows: —Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured debt rating ‘A+’; —Bank loan ‘A+’; —Short-term IDR ‘F1’; —Commercial paper ‘F1’. The ratings apply to approximately $4.9 billion of debt. The Rating Outlook is 	 Negative. Clinical-Stage Research Portfolio Expanded: The acquisition of Inhibitex brings a portfolio of developmental projects 	 focused on treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. The research 	 pipeline includes vaccines, and anti-viral therapies including the lead drug 	 candidate, INX-189, an oral nucleotide polymerase inhibitor currently in Phase 	 II investigation for the treatment of hepatitis C. Under the definitive merger 	 agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay $26.00 for outstanding shares of 	 Inhibitex, equating to total consideration for the acquisition of $2.5 billion 	 in cash. The companies plan to finalize the transaction approximately 30 days 	 after the commencement of the tender offer. Funding from Available Cash: Fitch expects current domestic cash and securities balances will provide the 	 funding necessary to complete the transaction, and that incremental debt 	 borrowings will not be utilized. Bristol-Myers Squibb had a cash balance and 	 short-term marketable securities totaling $8.2 billion, and long-term 	 investments of $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2011. 	 Bristol-Myers Squibb had improved its liquidity position in the U.S. at the end 	 of 2010 through an international legal entity restructuring. Plavix Patent Expiration Nearing: Bristol-Myers Squibb will get no immediate relief from the Inhibitex assets as 	 the company contends with the patent losses in the U.S. in 2012 of Plavix and 	 Avapro, which together represented 38.9% of sales for the latest 12-month (LTM) 	 period ending Sept. 30, 2011. The negative outlook reflects continued concern 	 for the company’s credit profile reflecting to the negative affects to 	 profitability and free cash flow generation from an expected dramatic fall in 	 revenues in 2012 and 2013. The revenue declines include the partial offset from 	 estimated sales of newly-launched products and commercialization of the 	 late-stage pipeline. Bristol-Myers Squibb has taken a multi-faceted approach to improve its credit 	 profile given a key drug patent expiration period starting in 2012, including 	 increasing R&D; productivity, restructuring operations, reducing debt, and 	 ensuring U.S. liquidity. Over the past two years, four new medicines (including 	 three potential blockbusters) were launched - Yervoy, Eliquis, Kombiglyze, and 	 Nulojix; $800 million in debt was paid down; international legal entities were 	 restructured to increase U.S. cash; and another significant ‘pearl’, 	 ZymoGenetics, was acquired. Fitch does recognize Bristol-Myers Squibb’s efforts since 2007 to strengthen the 	 operating structure prior to the patent cliff including a $2.5 billion 	 restructuring program and non-pharmaceutical business divestitures. By the end 	 of 2010, the company had achieved targeted annual savings of $2.5 billion 	 driving the expansion of EBITDA margins to 35.6% for the LTM period ending Sept. 	 30, 2011 from 22.3% in 2007. Fitch expects the positive margin trend to reverse 	 in the next one to two years as operating cost decreases do not pace rapid sales 	 declines. Strong Leverage ahead of Patent Cliff: Bristol-Myers Squibb has streamlined operations and reduced debt such that 	 leverage is anticipated to be consistent with the current rating category, 	 despite the top-line stresses over the intermediate term. Leverage as measured 	 by total debt to EBITDA and by total adjusted debt to EBITDAR has fallen to 0.7 	 times (x) and 0.8x, respectively, for the LTM period ending Sept. 30, 2011, 	 through a combination of margin expansion and debt reduction. Indeed, leverage 	 will be negatively affected by margin compression upon the patent cliff but 	 Fitch expects leverage to remain consistent with the current rating category in 	 the apex of the patent cliff in 2013 at 1.2x and 1.4x on a gross and adjusted 	 debt basis, respectively. Moreover, Bristol-Myers Squibb is favored by a 	 long-term debt maturity schedule that does not include significant maturities 	 during the patent cliff as approximately $600 million of senior notes mature in 	 August 2013.",1112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA123420120111
106,BMY,Amylin rejected $3.5 billion Bristol offer: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Shares of Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc AMLN.O rose as much as 51 percent on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported the company rejected a $3.5 billion unsolicited takeover bid from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). Bristol-Myers proposed an acquisition at $22 a share in a letter to Amylin, which the board turned down last month, according to Bloomberg, which cited two people with knowledge of the matter. Bloomberg said Bristol-Myers has not approached Amylin, which makes the diabetes drugs Byetta and Bydureon, since the rejection. Spokeswomen for Bristol-Myers and Amylin said they “do not comment on market rumors or speculation.” Amylin has been considered a possible takeover target for some time, with some analysts speculating AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) might be an interested buyer. Tim Anderson an analyst at Sanford Bernstein said recently he believed an Amylin acquisition would fit well and work financially assuming AstraZeneca paid a 30 percent premium to the stock price plus $1.5 billion for an outstanding promissory note and convertible debt, which would have valued Amylin at $4.5 billion. The diabetes sector is one of the fastest-growing in the drug industry due to rising rates of obesity. More than 300 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, including nearly 26 million Americans. They run a high risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and limb loss. Joshua Schimmer, an analyst at Leerink Swann, said in a research report on Wednesday that he believes Bristol-Myers “may not be the strongest bidder, given its weaker presence in the diabetes space in Europe and emerging markets.” Companies like AstraZeneca could drive greater value of Amylin’s diabetes franchise on a global basis. “As such, we believe shares have a reasonable floor, the company has a legitimate chance of finding a higher bidder,” he said. In November, Amylin ended a nearly decade-long partnership with Eli Lilly and Co. Amylin’s shares fell more than 11 percent on that news amid concern the company might not be able to market the products on its own. Amylin and Lilly introduced Byetta in 2005. Bydureon, a longer-acting version, was approved recently. The dissolution of Amylin’s partnership with Lilly made Amylin responsible for selling its products in the United States, while leaving the company to find a new partner outside the United States. Schimmer said he believes the “leaking” of the Bristol-Myers story serves the purpose of tying Amlyin’s hands and preventing the company from forming a partnership outside the United States instead of a sale. “At this valuation and with this information in the public domain, management will have a hard time justifying an extreme level of downside to shares, which would almost certainly come from an ex-U.S. partnership,” he said. Bernstein’s Anderson said on Wednesday in a research note that while it is still plausible that AstraZeneca could pursue Amylin, what would shoot down the idea of Amylin as an acquisition target is if Amylin does indeed sign up a partner to help market its products outside the United State. Amylin’s shares were up 45.7 percent to $22.43 in late-morning trading on Nasdaq. Earlier in the session they rose to a year-high $23.26.

107,BMY,"Icahn lashes Amylin board, urges sale of company","(Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn lashed out at the board of Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc AMLN.O on Wednesday, urging it to put the company up for sale, or potentially face a proxy fight. Icahn, the company’s third-largest shareholder with an 8.9 percent stake, criticized Amylin for failing to confirm or deny media reports that it had rejected a $22-a-share takeover offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). Bristol has also declined to comment on the reports. The Bristol offer would have valued Amylin at about $3.5 billion, excluding debt. Amylin’s shares have risen 55 percent since news of the offer was reported by Bloomberg News on March 28, giving the company a current market value of nearly $3.9 billion. In an open letter to Amylin, Icahn also criticized the board for approving a public offering of 10 percent of the company at an assumed price of $15.62 a share on March 8, without disclosing any Bristol offer in the registration statement, and for granting options to the company’s executive officers with an exercise price of $16.02 a share on March 6. “These actions make absolutely no sense to me in light of a Bristol-Myers bid and have served to substantially dilute shareholders who owned the stock when these actions were taken,” Icahn wrote. A spokesman for Amylin, which makes the diabetes drugs Byetta and Bydureon, said: “We disagree with Mr. Icahn’s characterizations and strongly believe his allegations are without merit. Amylin’s Board is fully aware of its fiduciary duties, and is committed to always acting in the best interests of all stockholders.” Icahn said a proxy contest right now would be a costly distraction, “but I would not shy away from that possibility if I felt that the Board was not pursuing seriously the opportunity to sell the company.” In 2009, Icahn and the hedge fund Eastbourne Capital Management succeeded in placing two nominees on the Amylin board: Alexander Denner, who was nominated by Icahn and previously worked for him, and Kathleen Behrens, a former managing director of RS Investments, who was nominated by Eastbourne. Icahn said in his letter that Denner and Behrens have been a positive force for change, “but apparently their influence has not been enough to keep this board from mishandling a Bristol-Myers proposal.” In November Amylin ended a nearly decade-long partnership with Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N), sending Amylin shares down 11 percent amid concern the company might not be able to market its products on its own. The company has been seeking a partner to help market its products outside the United States. “We think that pursuing an international partnership would be an egregious error because it would make it more difficult for the company to be sold to a third party that would not want to be saddled with that relationship,” Icahn wrote. Several drug companies have been suggested by investment analysts as potential buyers for Amylin, including AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T). In his letter, Icahn said that while the deadline has passed for shareholders to notify Amylin of their intent to nominate directors at the company’s annual meeting, the revelation of the Bristol-Myers bid and stock issuances at prices well below the $22 offer price constitute a “dramatic change in circumstances” and require the board to permit shareholders another opportunity to nominate directors. “I hereby demand that the Board announce, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Thursday, that shareholders will be provided a new 10-day period” within which to provide notice to Amylin, Icahn wrote. The diabetes market is one of the fastest-growing due to rising rates of obesity. The disease affects more than 300 million people worldwide, including nearly 26 million Americans. Diabetics run a high risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and limb loss. Analysts have said that now the Bristol offer is in the open, management will have a difficult time justifying the search for a partner, given the run-up in the shares due to acquisition hopes.

108,BMY,"UPDATE 3-Icahn lashes Amylin board, urges sale of company","* Icahn threatens proxy battle if board refuses sale * Criticizes board for approving public offering of stock * Amylin says Icahn characterizations “without merit” * Amylin shares fall 1.2 percent in afternoon trading April 4 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn lashed out at the board of Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday, urging it to put the company up for sale, or potentially face a proxy fight. Icahn, the company’s third-largest shareholder with an 8.9 percent stake, criticized Amylin for failing to confirm or deny media reports that it had rejected a $22-a-share takeover offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Bristol has also declined to comment on the reports. The Bristol offer would have valued Amylin at about $3.5 billion, excluding debt. Amylin’s shares have risen 55 percent since news of the offer was reported by Bloomberg News on March 28, giving the company a current market value of nearly $3.9 billion. In an open letter to Amylin, Icahn also criticized the board for approving a public offering of 10 percent of the company at an assumed price of $15.62 a share on March 8, without disclosing any Bristol offer in the registration statement, and for granting options to the company’s executive officers with an exercise price of $16.02 a share on March 6. “These actions make absolutely no sense to me in light of a Bristol-Myers bid and have served to substantially dilute shareholders who owned the stock when these actions were taken,” Icahn wrote. A spokesman for Amylin, which makes the diabetes drugs Byetta and Bydureon, said: “We disagree with Mr. Icahn’s characterizations and strongly believe his allegations are without merit. Amylin’s Board is fully aware of its fiduciary duties, and is committed to always acting in the best interests of all stockholders.” Icahn said a proxy contest right now would be a costly distraction, “but I would not shy away from that possibility if I felt that the Board was not pursuing seriously the opportunity to sell the company.” In 2009, Icahn and the hedge fund Eastbourne Capital Management succeeded in placing two nominees on the Amylin board: Alexander Denner, who was nominated by Icahn and previously worked for him, and Kathleen Behrens, a former managing director of RS Investments, who was nominated by Eastbourne. Icahn said in his letter that Denner and Behrens have been a positive force for change, “but apparently their influence has not been enough to keep this board from mishandling a Bristol-Myers proposal.” In November Amylin ended a nearly decade-long partnership with Eli Lilly and Co, sending Amylin shares down 11 percent amid concern the company might not be able to market its products on its own. The company has been seeking a partner to help market its products outside the United States. “We think that pursuing an international partnership would be an egregious error because it would make it more difficult for the company to be sold to a third party that would not want to be saddled with that relationship,” Icahn wrote. Several drug companies have been suggested by investment analysts as potential buyers for Amylin, including AstraZeneca Plc, Merck & Co and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd . In his letter, Icahn said that while the deadline has passed for shareholders to notify Amylin of their intent to nominate directors at the company’s annual meeting, the revelation of the Bristol-Myers bid and stock issuances at prices well below the $22 offer price constitute a “dramatic change in circumstances” and require the board to permit shareholders another opportunity to nominate directors. “I hereby demand that the Board announce, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Thursday, that shareholders will be provided a new 10-day period” within which to provide notice to Amylin, Icahn wrote. The diabetes market is one of the fastest-growing due to rising rates of obesity. The disease affects more than 300 million people worldwide, including nearly 26 million Americans. Diabetics run a high risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and limb loss. Analysts have said that now the Bristol offer is in the open, management will have a difficult time justifying the search for a partner, given the run-up in the shares due to acquisition hopes. Any deal with a partner outside the United States would almost certainly lead to a sell-off said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, in a recent report.

Icahn, whose 8.94 percent stake has made him Amylin’s third-largest shareholder, faulted the company for failing to reveal its rejection of a $3.5 billion unsolicited takeover bid, or $22 per share, from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. In a complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court, Icahn urged that Amylin not be allowed to enforce a bylaw requiring shareholders to provide advance notice of board candidates. The activist investor said shareholders deserve another chance to nominate directors who could push for a sale, given developments since the original January 25 deadline. Based in San Diego, Amylin makes diabetes medications that include Bydureon, Byetta and Symlin. “Amylin is at a crossroads — it can be sold, now, at a significant premium, or it can continue to attempt to market its products, which may be lucrative if successful, but which entails substantial risk,” the complaint said. “Stockholders of Amylin should be given the choice.” Icahn has a long history of activism in healthcare, including engineering a $6.5 billion sale of ImClone Systems Inc to Eli Lilly & Co and winning two board seats at biotechnology company Biogen Idec Inc. “We believe Mr. Icahn’s lawsuit is without merit,” Amylin said in a statement. “Amylin’s board is fully aware of its fiduciary duties, and is committed to always acting in the best interests of all stockholders.” The Bristol-Myers bid valued Amylin at $22 per share, a person familiar with the matter said last week. Shares of Amylin have risen more than 50 percent since news of the bid surfaced on March 28. The shares peaked two days later at $25.84, their highest since August 2008, and Icahn said the company “can and should” be sold at a premium. Analysts at Jefferies & Co and BMO Capital Markets have set respective price targets of $32 and $31 for Amylin, citing sales prospects for Bydureon. The type 2 diabetes treatment became available by prescription in U.S. pharmacies in February. In the complaint, Icahn attacked Amylin’s board for publicly offering 13 million shares for $15.62 each on March 8 without revealing it had earlier rejected the Bristol-Myers bid.

112,BMY,"Exclusive: Amylin explores sale, hires bankers: sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc AMLN.O, which spurned a $3.5 billion takeover bid from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and is fending off a lawsuit from activist investor Carl Icahn, started reaching out to potential buyers last week, sources familiar with the situation said on Sunday. Amylin, maker of diabetes drugs Byetta and Bydureon, has hired Credit Suisse CSGN.VX and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) as its financial advisers and Skadden Arps as its legal adviser, the sources said. Amylin and its advisers declined to comment. Analysts have said several drug companies could be potential buyers for Amylin, including AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T). The move comes amid broader consolidation in the healthcare sector. Big pharmaceutical companies have been making aggressive bids for promising biotech firms and other targets as they look to find new products and replenish their pipelines. These big firms are also flush with cash and have easy access to debt to do deals. But often they find the targets, whose shares are sometimes depressed, holding out for a better price. Other such bids in the healthcare sector in recent months include an aborted $6.8 billion hostile takeover attempt by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG ROG.VX for genetic specialist Illumina Inc (ILMN.O), and a bid by GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) to buy long-time partner Human Genome Sciences Inc HGSI.O for about $2.6 billion. Human Genome rejected the bid and launched a sales process, inviting GSK to participate. Human Genome is being advised by Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Skadden and DLA Piper. Amylin has been considered a possible takeover target for some time. The diabetes market is one of the fastest-growing due to rising rates of obesity. The disease affects more than 300 million people worldwide, including nearly 26 million Americans. Diabetics run a high risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and limb loss. Pressure on Amylin increased after news of the failed Bristol-Myers bid leaked and prompted Icahn to turn his sights on the company. Icahn, whose 8.94 percent stake has made him Amylin’s third-largest shareholder, has called for a sale and sued the company, demanding the right to nominate directors. Amylin has said that it believes Icahn’s lawsuit is without merit and that its board “continually considers all options available and is relentlessly focused on creating the greatest value for our stockholders.” In 2009, the billionaire investor and the hedge fund Eastbourne Capital Management succeeded in placing two nominees on the Amylin board: Alexander Denner, who was nominated by Icahn and previously worked for him, and Kathleen Behrens, a former managing director of RS Investments, who was nominated by Eastbourne. The opportunity for bidders to make their move on Amylin also got a boost when in November last year, Amylin ended a nearly decade-long partnership with Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N). Amylin and Lilly introduced Byetta in 2005. Bydureon, a longer-acting version, was approved recently. The dissolution of the partnership with Lilly made Amylin responsible for selling its products in the United States, while leaving the company to find a new partner outside the country. While Amylin is still talking to companies for a partnership outside the United States, a sale is looking more likely, the sources said. The board, heartened by early results from the Bydureon launch, wants to make sure that it can get the highest price through a sale, one of the sources said. Analysts at Jefferies & Co and BMO Capital Markets have set respective price targets of $32 and $31 for Amylin, citing sales prospects for Bydureon. The type 2 diabetes treatment became available by prescription in U.S. pharmacies in February. The Bristol-Myers bid valued Amylin at $22 per share, a source said previously. Shares of San Diego-based Amylin are up nearly 50 percent since news of the Bristol-Myers bid surfaced on March 28. Its shares closed up 0.7 percent at $22.92 on Nasdaq on Friday.

115,BMY,"Bristol profit rises, patent cliff to worsen","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) said first-quarter profit rose 10 percent, helped by higher sales for its diabetes and leukemia drugs that cushioned the blow from generic competition to its Avapro blood pressure treatment. Avapro marks the beginning of Bristol’s “patent cliff,” which is expected to worsen next month when its $7 billion-a-year Plavix blood clot preventer loses U.S. marketing exclusivity and faces copycat rivals. Company sales will come under additional pressure between 2013 and 2015, with the arrival of generic forms of its Sustiva treatment for HIV and its Abilify schizophrenia drug, which together now have annual sales of $4 billion. But unlike many drugmakers whose earnings have been battered in recent years due to loss of patent protection on their biggest products, Bristol-Myers has a growing roster of new medicines. They include Yervoy, a new drug for melanoma, diabetes treatment Onglyza, promising hepatitis C medicines and an experimental blood clot preventer called Eliquis that could be approved by late June and reap annual sales of more than $4 billion for Bristol-Myers and partner Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). “Bristol has a great drug pipeline and is doing a lot better than many other companies in having a next-generation of drugs to weather its patent storm,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “We’re expecting relatively flat growth over the next three years, with earnings bouncing back and forth” as older drugs lose patent protection and newer ones come to the fore, Conover said. Bristol-Myers said it expects full-year 2012 earnings of $1.90 to $2.00 per share, which would reflect a decline of 12 to 16.5 percent from last year. Wall Street then expects flat earnings in 2013. Separately on Thursday, the company said it had received a subpoena from securities regulators regarding its sales and marketing practices in various foreign countries. Bristol-Myers shares have risen sharply in the past few years due to excitement about the company’s drug pipeline, but have become slightly overvalued given the company’s limited earnings-growth potential in coming years, Conover said. He said company shares trade at about 17 times the company’s expected 2012 per share earnings, too big a premium to the average price-to-earnings ratio of 11 for other large drugmakers. Bristol’s global first-quarter revenue rose 5 percent to $5.25 billion, matching Wall Street expectations, even as Avapro sales fell 29 percent to $207 million, the company said on Thursday. Earnings rose 10 percent to $1.1 billion, or 64 cents per share, 1 cent above the average analyst forecast compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $986 million, or 57 cents per share. Sales of Plavix, marketed in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA), slipped 4 percent to $1.69 billion in the quarter.

117,BMY,Bristol subpoenaed over foreign sales practices,"April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  said on Thursday that it received a subpoena from securities regulators regarding  its sales and marketing practices in various foreign countries. Bristol-Myers, in a filing, said it received the subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month in connection with an investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The company said it was cooperating with the government in its investigation. It declined to divulge what countries or products were involved in the probe or to give any details beyond the brief statement in the filing. Foreign practices among major pharmaceutical companies have come under increasing scrutiny by government regulators as the drugmakers look to expand business into emerging markets. A Reuters examination of U.S. SEC filings by the world’s top 10 drug companies has found that eight of them recently warned of potential costs related to charges of corruption in overseas markets. But drug companies are far from alone in such scrutiny by federal investigators. The FCPA has been in the spotlight since a recent New York Times report said senior Wal-Mart Stores Inc executives stymied an investigation into alleged bribery by its Mexican affiliate, which involved suspect payments of $24 million. In October, cosmetics company Avon Products Inc  disclosed that it was being probed by the federal government for potential FCPA violations.",4262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristolmyers-probe/bristol-subpoenaed-over-foreign-sales-practices-idUSL2E8FQBV620120426

119,BMY,"TEXT-Fitch:Pure pharmaceuticals players,such as AstraZeneca,most under pressure","Apr 30 - Fitch Ratings says pharmaceuticals companies which 	 focus on pure pharmaceuticals, such as AstraZeneca (‘AA-‘/Stable), Bristol Myers 	 Squibb Company (BMS; ‘A+’/Negative) and Eli Lilly & Co.’s (‘A’/Stable) are 	 likely to show the highest pressure on sales and EBITDA over the next three 	 years compared to more diversified pharmaceuticals players, such as Johnson & 	 Johnson (‘AAA’/Stable) or Bayer (‘A-‘/Stable). “With the challenging economic environment and government cost-containment 	 expected to continue, the pressure for pure pharmaceuticals is expected to 	 remain high,” says Britta Holt, a Director at Fitch Ratings in London. “As the 	 key factor to success for pure pharmaceuticals players is the R&D; product 	 pipeline, cash rich companies with a relatively weak R&D; pipeline, such as 	 AstraZeneca might be tempted to acquire,” adds Holt. Fitch expects the ongoing period of drug patent expiration to significantly 	 erode revenues and earnings from the rated pharmaceuticals companies over the 	 next three years, with the pure pharmaceuticals players Eli Lilly, BMS and 	 AstraZeneca belonging to those most affected by patent expiration. The agency 	 calculates that Eli Lilly and BMS stand to lose more than a third of their sales 	 and AstraZeneca more than 20% of their sales in the US sales due to US patent 	 expiration over the next three years. Sales of US prescription drugs and consumer-confidence-sensitive sales of 	 branded over-the-counter (OTC) products are expected by Fitch to suffer from 	 lower demand in 2012. Pressure on drug manufacturers’ profitability is also 	 expected in the US as the drug coverage gap - known as the “donut hole” - will 	 continue to be closed by 50% in 2012 (implying a continued 50% discount on 	 brand-name drugs in the coverage gap) while the industry’s annual fee (leading 	 to payments for individual manufacturers allocated according to individual US 	 market shares) of USD2.5bn, which had to be paid for the first time by the 	 industry in 2011, will be increased to USD2.8bn in 2012. The negative impact on sales and profit from cost-containment policies in 	 Europe, such as reference pricing, and restrictions on prescriptions and 	 reimbursement in major European markets, is likely to continue in 2012. As government authorities, particularly in Europe and the US, are increasingly 	 looking to reduce drug costs and are not willing to reimburse drugs with 	 uncertain clinical evidence at launch, pharmaceuticals companies are likely to 	 continue responding by offering conditional pricing deals. These deals take 	 place between pharmaceuticals companies and payors, such as those executed 	 between Pfizer Inc. (‘A+’/Stable) and US drug-benefit plans with regard to 	 Lipitor. To encourage continued use of branded Lipitor and to maintain its 	 market share to some degree after its genericization, Pfizer offered rebate 	 deals to drug-benefit plans and provides discounts to patients. In general, 	 arrangements like this can reduce costs and risks for the health payor and have 	 the advantage for the drug manufacturer that it is able to sell its medicines - 	 albeit with lower profitability compared to a traditional reimbursement 	 situation.

121,BMY,"As governor, Romney picked winners and losers of his own","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It would be a triumphant moment for any governor: A cutting-edge company announces plans to build a new plant that will create hundreds of high-paying jobs and bolster one of the state’s most prominent industries. For Mitt Romney, the June 2006 announcement by drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb served as a signature accomplishment as his four-year stint as Massachusetts governor drew to a close and a U.S. presidential bid beckoned. The new facility came with a price tag: Romney and other state officials agreed to $67 million in tax breaks and other inducements to ensure the New York-based company picked Massachusetts over rival states like North Carolina. Now as he mounts his second White House bid, Romney is hammering President Barack Obama for playing favorites with green-tech companies rather than letting businesses succeed or fail on their own. Romney is the presumptive Republican challenger to face Obama, a Democrat, in the November 6 election. “Obama is giving taxpayer money to big donors and then watching them lose it,” Romney’s campaign said in an Internet video released on Tuesday. It’s a powerful line of attack that connects failed ventures like Solyndra, the bankrupt California-based solar panel maker that defaulted on a $535 million loan from the U.S. Energy Department, with the trillion-dollar budget deficits and sluggish U.S. economy of the past four years. But it might invite unfavorable comparison with Romney’s tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. During that time, Romney pursued a hands-on approach to economic development that favored some industries over others and, in some instances, singled out individual firms for special favors. Romney, a former private equity executive, backed tax breaks for film makers and biotech and medical-device manufacturers. His administration promoted venture capital-style funds that extended loans to start-up companies, some of which subsequently went out of business. As the state’s top salesman, he led the effort to lure desirable employers through tax breaks and other incentives. “That’s what governors do - they have to pick winners and losers,” said Boston University professor Fred Bayles. “It’s a calculated risk that governors and state politicians take in an effort to get jobs.” Sometimes, as with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Romney’s efforts panned out. Other times they did not. A $2.5 million state loan helped lure Rhode Island biotech firm Spherics Inc across the state line to Massachusetts in 2005. Romney’s economic development secretary, Ranch Kimball, touted the move as “a tangible result of the combined and coordinated efforts of the public and private sectors to highlight the benefits of locating in Massachusetts.” The company shut down three years later, laying off all of its employees and defaulting on $1.5 million of the loan, according to MassDevelopment, the state development authority. Critics on the left say Romney would have been better off investing in education and transportation to boost the state’s business climate over the long term. Critics on the right say he should have concentrated on lowering business taxes overall, rather than aiding selected industries or companies. “It makes no sense to give tax breaks to some companies and not others when the solution lies in making the tax code m ore investment friendly,” said David Tuerck, who heads the Beacon Hill Institute, a conservative Massachusetts think tank. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic research group, noted that while Romney the candidate opposes government intervention in business, many of the companies he owned during his time as head of private equity firm Bain Capital took advantage of government subsidies. “In many ways Romney’s whole approach to the economy is hypocritical,” said American Bridge president Rodell Mollineau. Romney’s defenders say he was just doing his job as governor. Though a hub of innovation and research, Massachusetts has a high cost of living and a reputation for being hostile to business that often put it at a disadvantage compared with other states. In such an environment, incentives are sometimes needed to lure marquee employers, but they were never the primary emphasis of Romney’s salesmanship, Romney backers say. “States are different from the federal government in that we are absolutely competing for businesses with other states,” said Jim Stergios, who worked to streamline regulations as a member of Romney’s administration. “Do you go back to Bristol-Myers Squibb and say, ‘I know North Carolina is offering you $70 million and we’re not going to offer you anything?’ You’ve got to be in the game.” Campaigning for governor in 2002, Romney said he would not rely on special breaks or other “corporate welfare” to stem an exodus of manufacturing jobs. “There are some companies that are only interested in tax breaks. Let them go to Alabama,” Romney said at a news conference in October 2002. Less than three weeks after taking office in 2003, Romney announced a new $15 million green-energy fund to help renewable-energy businesses in the state. A solar-panel company, two fuel-cell firms, a methane-gas facility and another firm got a total of $9 million in state funds in help. In remarks at Konarka, a Lowell solar-panel firm that got a $1.5 million state loan, Romney said he hoped the green-energy fund “can become a major economic springboard in the renewable energy sector,” according to a news release at the time. Romney also signed off on a $12.5 million Emergency Technology fund for the state to help high-risk technology startups. The program since then has aided companies like E Ink, which developed the technology used in Amazon.com’s Kindle e-reader, but has also lost money on some of its investments. Along with Spherics, the program lost an undisclosed amount of money on a $2 million loan to biotech firm Acusphere, according to MassDevelopment. Romney campaign officials say it is inaccurate to compare either fund with the Obama administration’s loan program that backed Solyndra and other green-tech companies. Republicans have criticized Obama’s program as a costly boondoggle that rewarded politically connected businesses and interfered with market forces. Romney campaign officials point out that both funds were overseen by independent agencies, not political appointees. Romney used existing money from an underused trust to set up the green-energy fund, and he vetoed the venture-capital portion of the technology fund before it was restored by the Democratic-controlled state legislature. “Governor Romney is proud of the record he had of making Massachusetts a pro-business environment that added jobs,” said a Romney campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Romney also centered a 2003 economic-development bill around tax credits for biotech and medical-device manufacturers that create jobs. It is hard to tell if they had an impact. Employment in the biotech sector rose 25 percent from 2002 to 2006, according to the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, a trade group. But federal statistics indicate that the state lost 4 percent of its pharmaceutical-manufacturing jobs and 20 percent of its medical-equipment manufacturing jobs during that period. Overall, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation under Romney’s tenure. Romney’s economic-development efforts did not move the needle much one way or the other, said Leigh McIlvaine, an analyst with Good Jobs First, a left-leaning research group that tracks economic-development subsidies. “He was betting just as blindly as anyone else was during that time,” McIlvaine said. Romney backed a much bigger tax break for the movie industry in November 2005, signing a bill that would give tax credits of up to $7 million for productions that film in the state. Subsidies like these have been criticized as inefficient, while backers say they are needed to support a home-grown film industry and can boost tourism. The program had generated about 1,700 in-state jobs through 2010, costing the state $142,500 in lost tax revenue for each job, according to the Massachusetts tax office. The state had gotten back 13 cents for every dollar it gave up in tax revenue. In the case of Bristol Myers-Squibb, backers can point to tangible results. The $750 million facility, completed in 2011, now employs 350 people. It employed 1,000 contractors at the height of construction, according to the company. The state issued $34 million in bonds to build new sewage facilities at the site, a former Army base, and agreed to modify an existing tax credit so the company could get back $33 million from the state. Labor leaders agreed to build the facility at reduced rates. The town where the plant was built agreed to allow it to be taller than local limits would have permitted. Robert Lynch, an economics professor at Washington College in Maryland, said that broadly speaking these types of incentives have not been shown to make a difference. “They probably could have spent the money more effectively in other ways,” Lynch said.

122,BMY,Bristol urges combo hepatitis C study with Gilead,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co renewed calls for biotechnology company Gilead Sciences Inc to test one of its hepatitis C drugs in late-stage trials alongside Bristol’s own promising medicine, following impressive results from a mid-stage trial that combined the experimental products. Bristol’s daclatasvir is from a new class of drugs known as NS5A inhibitors. Gilead’s GS-7977 is a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. Both are designed to block enzymes essential to replication of the hepatitis C virus. Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Lamberto Andreotti, speaking on Thursday at the Sanford Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York, said patients and both drugmakers stand to benefit if combined Phase III trials of the two medicines are pursued. “We have a different point of view about whether to enter Phase III (trials) with that combination,” Andreotti said. “We believe, for both patients and companies, it is better to move forward” in the short term. But Andreotti said Gilead instead seemed intent on looking “in-house” — focusing on combinations of its own products. Gilead officials could not immediately be reached to comment. Andreotti said there was a “huge, unmet need” for better treatments among an estimated 170 million to 180 million people worldwide believed to be infected with the virus. Transmitted by blood transfusions, sexual contact or shared drug needles, the virus invades the liver and can steadily destroy the organ over decades. It is the most common reason for liver transplants in the United States. Data from the mid-stage trial combining Gilead’s GS-7977 and Bristol’s daclatasvir showed a 100 percent response rate in previously untreated patients with the most common form of hepatitis C. Shares of Gilead jumped 11 percent on April 19 when the data were released, showing the profound benefits of combining its 7977 — acquired through Gilead’s $11 billion purchase of Pharmasset — with daclatasvir. At the time, Bristol said Gilead had balked at further collaboration on the combination under study, which was begun while 7977 was owned by Pharmasset. The results of the mid-stage study were accomplished without interferon, an injected drug that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that often lead patients to discontinue or delay treatment. Nor did the study use ribavirin, an older antiviral drug that is also currently part of all treatment regimens. Instead of working with Bristol-Myers, Gilead is forging ahead with a study of 7977 in combination with its own experimental NS5A inhibitor. In the meantime, Bristol-Myers is testing daclatasvir with a drug similar to 7977 that it acquired with its $2.5 billion purchase of Inhibitex, as well as with other experimental drugs in its development pipeline. In other remarks at the Sanford Bernstein meeting on Thursday, Andreotti said he expects some form of U.S. healthcare reform to emerge, even if the U.S. Supreme Court rules against extensive reforms approved by Congress and signed into law by President Obama. The High Court is expected next month to render a decision on the sprawling legislation, which would greatly expand healthcare coverage to uninsured Americans but require bigger fees and rebates from drugmakers and medical device makers. Andreotti said the enacted reforms “started out on the right foot” but became too complicated for Bristol-Myers and the American people. The Bristol-Myers CEO said he expects rapidly declining sales of Plavix, a blood-clot preventer which has long been the company’s biggest product, due to loss of U.S. patent protection earlier this month and ensuing competition from a number of cheaper generics. The pill, sold in partership with French drugmaker Sanofi, had revenue last year of more than $7 billion — making it one of the world’s top-selling medicines. Despite expected plunging sales of Plavix, Andreotti said Bristol-Myers has no plans to “downsize” its research spending, having already closed down many company facilities in previous cost-cutting efforts. Bristol-Myers will adjust future R&D; spending in accordance with company performance, and expects significant sales gains to come from Asia but not from Europe, Andreotti said. He said the company plans over the next few years to concentrate on developing medicines to treat cancer, viral infections and blood clots — calling those therapeutic areas “the three pillars” of company growth.

126,BMY,Bristol-Myers to buy Amylin for about $5.3 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co will buy biotechnology company Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $5.3 billion in cash, helping Bristol-Myers extend its portfolio of diabetes treatments with the addition of drugs Byetta and Bydureon. Bristol-Myers said late on Friday it had also reached a follow-on deal with UK-based AstraZeneca Plc to collaborate on developing Amylin’s products once the buyout is completed, expanding upon an existing partnership between the two pharmaceutical makers in diabetes treatments. AstraZeneca will pay $3.4 billion in cash for these rights. Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca already collaborate on several diabetes treatments including Onglyza, and aim to strengthen their position in a growing, multibillion-dollar market. More than 360 million people worldwide have diabetes, with the overwhelming majority suffering from type 2 diabetes, a condition partly attributable to the rise in obesity in many countries. In a statement, Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Lamberto Andreotti described the deals as a unique way to build on its relationship with AstraZeneca, which “demonstrates Bristol-Myers Squibb’s innovative and targeted approach to partnerships and business development.” The boards of directors at Amylin, Bristol and AstraZeneca have approved the two transactions, the companies said. Amylin began approaching potential buyers in April after rejecting a previous $3.5 billion takeover bid from Bristol-Myers, and facing pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn. In all, five pharmaceutical giants including AstraZeneca, Novartis AG and Sanofi SA were in the running for Amylin, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. Bristol-Myers will pay $31 per share for Amylin, a premium of 10 percent to the company’s closing price on Friday. Amylin’s shares had already tripled in value from a low of nearly $8 last October. Amylin and Eli Lilly Co introduced Byetta for type 2 diabetes in 2005, and the longer-acting version Bydureon, which can be taken once a week, was approved by U.S. regulators earlier this year. Both contain the active ingredient exenatide. Amylin scrapped its partnership with Lilly in November last year after the two became embroiled in a legal dispute. Bristol-Myers has agreed to pay an additional $1.7 billion to cover Amylin’s debt and its obligations to Lilly from ending their collaboration. Bristol-Myers will finance the purchase from its existing cash resources and credit facilities. Amylin has agreed not to solicit competing offers. The transactions are expected to be dilutive to Bristol-Myers’ adjusted earnings in 2012 and 2013 by about 3 cents per share, and become slightly accretive in 2014. Citi and Evercore are serving as financial advisers to Bristol-Myers and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal adviser. AstraZeneca’s financial adviser on the deal is Bank of America Merrill Lynch, while Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Covington & Burling LLP are its legal advisers. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs & Co. are acting as financial advisers to Amylin Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is its legal adviser.

127,BMY,Icahn return on Amylin tops 35 percent: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn made a profit of more than 35 percent on his investment in Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday, higher than an earlier estimate of a 22 percent return based on his publicly disclosed filings. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said late on Friday it would buy Amylin, in which Icahn is the third-largest shareholder with an 8.8 percent stake, for about $5.3 billion in cash to extend its portfolio of diabetes treatments. Bristol-Myers also struck a deal with AstraZeneca Plc, under which AstraZeneca will pay it $3.4 billion and collaborate on developing Amylin’s products. Icahn became an investor in Amylin in early 2008 and was instrumental in driving the company’s management to consider a sale. Although his efforts in 2009 to engineer a sale to its then diabetes drug partner, Eli Lilly and Co, failed, he won a proxy fight against the company at the time. Icahn’s returns from his Amylin investment beat the S&P; healthcare index, which is up 22.16 percent over the last four years. But it took more work, including a bitter proxy fight and litigation, for Icahn to make his profit. Icahn’s average cost for the stake was about $23 per share, the source said, and added that he boosted his profits further by borrowing about 80 percent of the money for the investment. Bristol agreed to pay $31 per share for Amylin. It wasn’t clear exactly by how much the leverage increased Icahn’s returns. “It’s not great. But if you margin it, then it is pretty good,” the source said, referring to the returns, and who declined to be identified because the material was confidential. Earlier, a Reuters analysis showed that his average cost for his Amylin stake was likely to be around $25.40 per share. The Reuters analysis is based on his disclosed holdings and the average Amylin share price in each of the quarters the disclosures were made. The actual returns disclosed by the source differ from the estimate because of variations in the stock price during any given quarter. The price at which an investor buys into a stock is not typically disclosed in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, making the average price in a quarter a proxy for such estimates. For Icahn, whose healthcare investments have generated more than $2 billion in profits over the past six years, the returns on Amylin are a far cry from his triumph with ImClone Systems Inc, for example, where he engineered a $6.5 billion sale to Eli Lilly in 2008. The billionaire investor has said he made a 112 percent return on ImClone, in which he first showed interest in 1995. His returns on Amylin will add to the debate about Icahn’s record as a stock picker and the effect he has on a company he targets. It could also play into the dynamics of his next high-profile battle in the healthcare sector with Forest Laboratories Inc. In a letter to Forest on Monday, Icahn touted his record at Amylin, ImClone and other biotech companies, arguing that “without our candidates’ presence on the boards of these companies these stellar results would not have been obtained.” Icahn said Amylin’s stock had returned more than 175 percent since his representatives first joined the board in June 2009. He said the share prices of Biogen, Genzyme Corp, and ImClone increased by about 180 percent, 48 percent, and 132 percent, respectively, since the date his representatives joined - or announced they were joining - those boards. The Amylin deal again shows that Icahn is persistent and proves that eventually he often gets what he wants. Last year, for example, after a lengthy battle in which Icahn agitated for change and a sale of Genzyme Corp, the company was sold to Sanofi SA for about $20 billion. The deal was the second-largest ever in the sector. Amylin’s price tag meets Icahn’s earlier stated expectations. “I do not sell cheaply and would certainly not recommend selling Amylin unless we were offered at least over $30 per share, at which time I might recommend selling it,” Icahn wrote in a letter to Amylin’s top management in April 2009. If the deal goes through at $31 per share, Icahn’s returns will be down to timing. He bought 44 percent of his current stake in the first quarter of 2008 when the average share price was $33.11, according to Reuters data and SEC filings. Other investors who bought Amylin’s shares later are in for much more lucrative returns. Even before the deal was announced on Friday, the company’s shares had already more than tripled in value from a low of nearly $8 last October. The Amylin investment could have turned out worse for Icahn. In a survey of investors carried out by Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, 53 percent of the respondents said Bristol-Myers overpaid, while 45 percent said it paid about the right price. With Amylin in the bag, the focus of Icahn followers is likely to turn to Forest, where the 76-year-old financier recently started round two of a war after losing a proxy battle last year. So far he has not said what he wants Forest to do, but has criticized the company mostly over corporate governance issues, including succession planning and asked for more information on other issues. Icahn owns about 26.4 million shares, or 9.92 percent, of Forest, making him the second-largest investor in the U.S. drugmaker. In a lawsuit against the company, he revealed his Forest stake cost him around $912 million, implying an average price of about $34.55 per share. Forest shares closed at $34.99 on Friday, meaning the investor is just above water in his Forest investment. Icahn has struck a deal with Eric Ende, his nominee to lead the proxy battle against Forest, to share 1 percent of his profits above $47.50 per share under certain conditions, including Ende’s election to the board of Forest. Ende can share in Icahn’s profits for up to two-and-a-half years after Forest’s annual meeting next month. At $47.50, Icahn will make a profit of roughly $340 million, or a 37 percent return. But the unusual arrangement with Ende could also raise governance questions and play into the hands of Forest as it formulates its defense.

Last Friday’s rally on Wall Street, boosted by hopes that the euro zone was a step closer to solving its debt crisis, ran out of steam on Monday as the Institute for Supply Management’s June manufacturing index showed the U.S. factory sector suffered its first contraction since July 2009. Euro zone manufacturing shrank again in June and factories are preparing for worse, according to business surveys showing jobs were cut at the fastest pace in two-and-a-half years. The data showed factories in Germany and France are succumbing to a downturn that started in southern Europe. Manufacturing in China, the world’s second-biggest economy, also worsened in June with export orders, usually an indicator of global economic health and trade flows, posting their biggest fall since December. “This is clearly very, very troubling. It indicates that at least in the month of June the manufacturing sector of the (U.S.) economy contracted and there is meaningful evidence of, at a minimum, disinflation,” said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany. Separate data showed U.S. construction spending rose to its highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in May, but market reaction was muted. Also adding to concerns, UBS cut its year-end target on the S&P; 500 index to 1,375, from 1,475. Jonathan Golub, strategist at UBS, cited the following reasons: deterioration in incoming U.S. economic data; the Supreme Court’s healthcare ruling, which is believed to contribute to greater partisanship ahead of year-end fiscal discussions; and a more contentious tone among European policymakers, despite some success at the most recent Euro summit. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 50.55 points, or 0.39 percent, at 12,829.54. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 3.16 points, or 0.23 percent, at 1,359.00.

Bristol  Myers Squibb also announced that upon completion of the acquisition, the  existing diabetes alliance with AstraZeneca will be expanded to include Amylin’s product portfolio, at which time, AstraZeneca will pay $3.4 billion for the  change to the collaboration agreement. The acquisition of Amylin adds two  diabetes treatments, Byetta and Bydureon, to Bristol Myers Squibb’s current  maturing drug offering. The companies plan to finalize the transaction  approximately 30 days after the commencement of a tender offer. Fitch  anticipates that the purchase will be funded through cash on hand and new debt  issuance.         Share Repurchases Pressure Credit Profile  In addition, last week, Bristol Myers Squibb announced that the Board of  Directors approved additional authorization of $3 billion to the company’s  present share repurchase program from May 2010.  Fitch forecasts aggressive  share repurchase activity over the ratings horizon despite the acquisitions of  Amylin and Inhibitex Inc. that will total more than $6 billion this year.  Coupling increased share repurchasing with the asset purchases made this year,  Fitch expects Bristol Myers Squibb’s leverage to remain in the range of 1.5  times (x) to 1.7x on a gross debt basis in the height of the patent cliff, a  level consistent with the new rating category. Bristol Myers Squibb’s long-term  debt maturity schedule is favorable and does not include significant maturities  during the patent cliff as only $597 million of senior notes mature in November  2013.    Plavix Patent Expiration to Pressure Revenues  Bristol Myers Squibb is at the beginning of its patent cliff that is expected to negatively impact sales during 2012 - 2013 of two top-selling pharmaceuticals,  Plavix and Avapro, which represented 36.7% of total sales for the latest  12-month (LTM) period at the end of the first quarter of 2012. In the first half of 2012, U.S. market exclusivity was lost for Avapro at the end of March and for Plavix in May. Just ahead of the company’s patent expiration period, revenues  increased 9.1% for the LTM period ending March 31, 2012. Fitch believes the  company cannot overcome top-line pressure with the addition of Amylin’s product  offering as well as the growth of the current portfolio of drug products,  including the promising cancer treatment Yervoy.      Patent Cliff Creates Operational Uncertainty  Since 2007, Bristol has been preparing for the inevitable patent lapse of Plavix through operational restructuring actions, debt reduction, cash repatriation,  divestiture of non-pharmaceutical businesses, and solid R&D; productivity. As  such, EBITDA margins have expanded to 36.7% for the LTM period ending March 31,  2012 from 22.3% in 2007, and, in the same timeframe, total debt leverage dropped to 0.6x from 1.5x. However, the operational success will reverse over the  ratings horizon due to generic competition to Bristol’s bestseller Plavix. The  uncertainty of the effect on operations due to generic competition concomitant  with more aggressive shareholder-friendly activities have led Fitch to maintain  the Negative Rating Outlook.    Liquidity to remain Strong  Fitch recognizes Bristol Myers Squibb’s effort to maintain U.S. cash as  international legal entities were restructured in late 2010. Domestic liquidity  provides the flexibility to fund a portion of the purchase price for Amylin with available cash. Bristol Myers Squibb had a cash balance and short-term  marketable securities totaling $5.0 billion, and long-term investments of $3.6  billion at the end of the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, free cash flow  has strengthened to over $2.0 billion for the LTM period ending March 31, 2012  from as low as $97 million in 2007 as the company preserved capital and  restructured operations ahead of the Plavix patent expiry. Despite the patent  cliff, Fitch anticipates free cash flow to remain above $600 million annually  through the ratings horizon.     Ratings Triggers  Negative rating action the intermediate-term would stem from operational  pressures on margin and cash flow as Bristol Myers Squibb contends with the  negative effects in 2012 and 2013 of the Plavix and Avapro patent expirations.  Total debt leverage (gross debt to EBITDA) sustained above 1.8x and significant  free cash flow contraction resulting from greater-than-anticipated margin  compression and incremental debt would drive the rating one notch lower to ‘A-‘.",7032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA032720120703

136,BMY,"Drugmakers Lilly, Bristol weather patent cliffs","(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co beat profit forecasts and vowed to bounce back by 2015 from its steep patent cliff due to cost cutting and new medicines, while rival U.S. drugmaker Bristol-Myers signaled it is weathering its own painful patent expirations as well as expected. But hopes for 2012 deteriorated at British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which on Wednesday warned that full-year sales will be flat as pressure on drug prices intensifies in Europe due to government austerity measures aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Its shares fell 1.3 percent. Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said some dozen company drugs now in late-stage trials and many others in mid-stage studies will drive Lilly’s comeback. “We’re seeing pieces of the puzzle coming together,” Rice said in a conference call with industry analysts. Company earnings plunged 23 percent in the quarter, months after its biggest product —Zyprexa for schizophrenia — lost U.S. patent protection. The pain intensifies late next year, when $5 billion-a-year depression drug Cymbalta goes generic. Analysts welcomed Rice’s show of confidence but said it was too early to know whether cost-cutting might be a bigger contributor than the introduction of Lilly prescription drugs. “The key controversy remaining is: Can they really improve margins if the pipeline fails to deliver?” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said. “So what if the revenue doesn’t grow?” Bristol-Myers Squibb Co reported lower quarterly sales and earnings as cost-cutting and sales gains for newer drugs only partly offset plunging sales of its Plavix blood clot preventer and Avapro blood-pressure medicine, now facing generic rivals. Industry analysts said the Bristol-Myers earnings report produced no significant surprises and came in roughly in line with expectations. But they were impressed that the company, whose shares were little changed, was able to reaffirm its 2012 profit view despite Plavix’s freefall and a stronger dollar that hurts sales in overseas markets. Lilly’s quarterly earnings handily beat Wall Street forecasts, helped by surging sales of Cymbalta. The company said profit margins should improve after 2014, once the damage from patent expirations on its top drugs has abated. The Indianapolis drugmaker, whose shares rose almost 3 percent, raised its 2012 profit outlook because the stronger U.S. dollar has reduced the cost of overseas goods used to produce the company’s products. It earned $924 million, or 83 cents per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned 83 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global sales of $5.6 billion were in line with Wall Street expectations of $5.59 billion. Lilly said it now expected full-year 2012 earnings of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, excluding special items. It had previously forecast $3.15 to $3.30. That would represent a 23 percent decline from 2011 results. Quarterly global sales of Zyprexa fell 73 percent to $380 million. Sales of Cymbalta, now Lilly’s top product, jumped 22 percent to $1.22 billion. Bristol-Myers said it still expects a full-year 2012 profit, excluding special items, of $1.90 to $2.00 per share. That would reflect a decline of 12 percent to 17 percent from 2011, when Plavix held sway as the world’s second-biggest-selling medicine. The pill lost U.S. patent protection in May. The company reported net earnings of $808 million, or 38 cents per share, down from $1.31 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 48 cents per share, in line with analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global sales fell 18 percent to $4.44 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations. Plavix sales fell 60 percent to $741 million in the quarter, while sales of Avapro dropped 53 percent to $117 million. Many newer drugs did well, including Baraclude, a treatment for hepatitis B infections, whose sales jumped 22 percent to $357 million. Sales of leukemia drug Sprycel rose 26 percent to $244 million.

143,BMY,Bristol-Myers executive charged with insider trading,"(Reuters) - A Bristol-Myers Squibb Co executive was criminally charged with insider trading, accused of trading options in three companies that the large drugmaker was looking to buy. Prosecutors said Robert Ramnarine, 45, made $311,361 in illegal profit from August 2010 to July 2012 by buying call options in ZymoGenetics Inc and Pharmasset Inc and call and put options in Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc, and selling his positions once takeovers were announced. Ramnarine, who was promoted in July to assistant treasurer for capital markets, was charged with three counts of securities fraud, according to a complaint made public on Thursday by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil fraud charges against Ramnarine, and seeks both to recover illegal profit and to freeze the East Brunswick, New Jersey, resident’s brokerage account assets. Ramnarine was released on $250,000 bond at an afternoon hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney said. It is unclear whether Ramnarine has hired a lawyer for his defense. Peter Carter, an assistant federal public defender who represented him at the hearing, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ken Dominski, a Bristol-Myers spokesman, said the New York-based company is cooperating with the government and has put Ramnarine on administrative leave. “Bristol-Myers Squibb has clear and strict policies prohibiting trading on material non-public information,” he said. According to the complaint, Ramnarine learned confidential information about potential takeovers while working as a director and later as an executive director in Bristol-Myers’ pension and savings investments office in Princeton, New Jersey. The complaint suggested that Ramnarine was concerned about his activities, saying that before buying the Pharmasset options, he had conducted several Internet searches on Yahoo from his office concerning detection of insider trading. These searches included “can option be traced to purchaser” and “insider trading options traceillegal (sic),” and included a review of an August 2005 SEC press release over alleged insider trading in Reebok International Ltd call options. Bristol-Myers bought ZymoGenetics for $885 million in October 2010. It expects to complete its $5.3 billion purchase of Amylin this month. Gilead Sciences Inc agreed in November to buy Pharmasset after Bristol-Myers dropped out of talks. Gilead completed the $11 billion acquisition in January.

The drug, known as BMS-986094, was acquired by Bristol earlier this year through its $2.5 billion purchase of Inhibitex Inc. It belongs to a promising new class of hepatitis C drugs known as nucleotide polymerase inhibitors, or nucs. The mid-stage trial was halted early this month after the initial case of heart failure, which subsequently resulted in death. Bristol said it was working closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and trial investigators to follow up on all patients in the trial, nine of whom have been hospitalized. The company said two patients remain hospitalized, citing issues of heart and kidney toxicity. “We will also work expeditiously to share the results of our further investigations more broadly in the medical and scientific community,” Elliott Sigal, Bristol’s chief scientific officer, said in a statement. The FDA last week placed a partial hold on a trial of Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug, citing the heart-related problems seen with Bristol’s compound. Shares of Bristol, which closed at $32.15 on the New York Stock Exchange, were trading at $32.18 after hours. Shares of Idenix, which closed at $6.09, were down 6 percent at $5.74 after hours. Hepatitis C, which is transmitted through the blood, kills more than 15,000 Americans each year, mostly from illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently called for all baby boomers to be tested for the disease, especially in light of newly available therapies that can cure around 75 percent of infections. The field has attracted broad interest with two new hepatitis C drugs, Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc and Merck & Co’s Victrelis, reaching the U.S. market in the past year. Along with Bristol and Idenix, companies aiming to improve on existing treatments by developing pill-only regimens to combat the virus include Gilead Sciences Inc and Vertex.

151,BMY,UPDATE 1-Bristol to take $1.8 bln charge on hep C drug failure,"* To record charge in Q3 * Does not see charge resulting in future cash expenses Aug 24 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said it would record a $1.8 billion charge related to the discontinuation of its much-anticipated hepatitis C drug that was dropped after a patient died of heart failure. The company will recognize the charge in the third quarter of 2012, it said in a regulatory filing on Friday. It does not expect the charge to result in future cash expenses. The pharmaceutical company said on Thursday it would drop development of the drug, called BMS-986094, after a patient who was treated with the drug in a mid-stage trial died of heart failure and several others had to be hospitalized. Bristol had voluntarily stopped the mid-stage trial earlier this month. The drug, which was acquired by Bristol through its $2.5 billion purchase of Inhibitex Inc, belongs to a promising new class of hepatitis C drugs known as nucleotide polymerase inhibitors, or nucs. Nucs work by targeting polymerase, an enzyme essential for the replication of the hepatitis C virus, and are expected to be a game changer. Thursday’s news will also cast a shadow on Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing a hepatitis C treatment that belongs to the same class as Bristol’s. Idenix’s drug was put on partial hold by the U.S. health regulator last week, just two weeks after Bristol stopped its hepatitis C trial. The hepatitis C virus is the most common cause of viral hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver. It affects about 170 million people worldwide and the market for its treatments is expected to reach around $15 billion by 2019. Bristol shares were marginally up in premarket trade. They closed at $32.15 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Idenix shares were down 6.7 percent in premarket trade.

152,BMY,"Sanofi, Bristol shake up alliance as patents end","PARIS (Reuters) - Drugmakers Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb plan to revamp their 15-year-old alliance from January 1 in response to lost exclusivity on two key drugs and the arrival of generic competition in major markets. The move will see Bristol-Myers return rights to blood clot preventer Plavix and blood pressure treatment Avapro/Avalide to the French drugmaker in all markets, the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday. This will give Sanofi sole commercial control of the two treatments, although Bristol-Myers will keep rights to Plavix in the United States and Puerto Rico, which will continue unchanged through 2019. In return, Sanofi will pay Bristol-Myers royalties through 2018 on sales of Plavix worldwide, excluding the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and on sales of Avapro/Avalide. Sanofi will then make a $200 million terminal payment to Bristol-Myers, the groups said. The French and U.S. drug giants have both had to wrestle with so-called patent cliffs, which have seen top-selling drugs previously protected by patents hit by competition from cheap copies. Plavix, designed to help reduce the risk of a future heart attack or stroke, had been the world’s second-biggest selling prescription medicine for several years with annual revenue reaching about $9 billion at its peak. Earlier this year, Sanofi predicted a $1.85 billion dent in net income from the impact of generics on Plavix and Avapro. The company is now banking on emerging markets, diabetes, vaccines, animal health, its takeover of biotech Genzyme and new products in the hunt for alternative growth. Late on Tuesday, Sanofi announced it would buy Genfar, Colombia’s second-largest manufacturer of generic drugs with sales of $133 million last year, of which 30 percent were generated outside the country. Sanofi is also reshuffling its research operations and said last month it could shed some 900 jobs in France. The company is due to discuss details of the cuts with staff representatives later on Wednesday. Bristol-Myers is bracing for additional pressure between 2013 and 2015 with the arrival of generic forms of its Sustiva treatment for HIV and its Abilify schizophrenia drug, which together have annual sales of $4 billion. Among its new medicines, diabetes treatment Onglyza has struggled to register substantial sales in the face of tough competition, while experimental blood clot preventer Eliquis is due to be reviewed in March after U.S. health regulators declined to approve it in June. Bristol-Myers in August dropped a much-anticipated hepatitis C drug after a patient died of heart failure. The U.S. group said on Wednesday that the revised agreement with Sanofi would simplify operations and help it focus on delivering drugs in development. The French company said the change “further supports Sanofi’s strategic priorities”. The companies added that they had resolved disputes relating to the alliance, and that Bristol-Myers would as a result pay Sanofi $80 million in relation to Avalide supply disruption in the U.S. last year. Shares in Sanofi, which is France’s second-biggest company by market value, were 0.8 percent lower at 67.50 euros by 3.26 a.m. EDT. The stock is up some 19 percent this year.

154,BMY,Bristol-Myers results lag as Plavix sales evaporate,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s quarterly sales and earnings missed Wall Street expectations as cheaper generics nearly wiped out sales of its blood clot preventer Plavix, sending its shares down 2 percent in premarket trading. Global sales of Plavix, sold in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi, plunged 96 percent in the third quarter to $64 million, the company reported on Wednesday. The pill was the world’s second-biggest-selling medicine until its U.S. patent lapsed in May. A slew of generics rushed in when Plavix lost its U.S. marketing exclusivity in May, a departure from the common practice of only one generic being allowed on the market during the first six months after a patent expiration. But multiple generics were allowed because a generic form of Plavix was briefly sold in the United States by Apotex Inc in 2006, before a federal court ruled the privately held Canadian company had infringed the Plavix patent and forced Apotex to stop selling its version. Bristol-Myers said it lost $711 million, or 43 cents per share in the third quarter, including a charge of $1.8 billion for an experimental treatment for hepatitis C called BMS-986094, which showed disappointing results in clinical trials. In the year-earlier quarter the company earned $969 million, or 56 cents per share. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 41 cents per share in the latest quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected 42 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales, also hit by generic competition for the company’s Avapro blood pressure treatment, fell 30 percent to $3.74 billion, well below Wall Street expectations of $3.98 billion.

The move underscores the growing pressure on drug companies to cut deals with austerity-hit European governments in order to prove their expensive new medicines offer value for money. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said on Friday it had issued final draft guidance recommending both Roche’s Zelboraf and Bristol’s Yervoy after the companies offered undisclosed discounts. NICE, which determines if products should be used by the National Health Service (NHS), had initially rejected both medicines, despite acknowledging that they represented a breakthrough in treating melanoma.

The drug, also known as apixaban, was approved by European health regulators last month. Eliquis belongs to a new class of medicines designed to replace decades-old warfarin for preventing blood clots in heart patients, or after a hip- or knee-replacement surgery. Eliquis would compete against approved blood clot preventers such as Xarelto from Johnson & Johnson and Bayer , and Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim. Treating atrial fibrillation, which greatly raises the risk of strokes, is considered by far the largest and most important use for these new drugs. The oral tablet Eliquis, like Xarelto, works by inhibiting a protein called Factor Xa that plays a critical role in blood clotting. Pradaxa has a slightly different mechanism of action. However, Eliquis should not be taken by patients with prosthetic heart valves or those with atrial fibrillation caused by a heart valve problem, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.

The company said it expects earnings this year of $1.78 to $1.88 per share before special items. That would represent a decline of as much as 11 percent from 2012, mainly because of generic competition for its Plavix blood clot preventer and Avapro blood pressure treatment. Although the 2013 forecast is in line with the average Wall Street estimate of $1.83 per share - thanks in part to a highly favorable tax rate this year - the company conceded it would not reach its more ambitious earlier goals. In March 2010, riding high from approvals of new medicines and confidence in other ones in development, Bristol-Myers said 2013 earnings would be “at minimum $1.95” per share, adding it was “well positioned to deliver on the promise of our pipeline.” “Bristol today finally owned up to what most analysts were already aware, that they are unlikely to hit the minimum guidance they set a couple of years ago,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss. “Various things have made that unlikely.” In January 2012, U.S. regulators rejected dapaglifozin, a new type of treatment for type 2 diabetes, citing safety concerns. Just months later, the company’s experimental brivanib oncology drug failed in a late-stage trial to prolong survival in liver cancer patients. The most spectacular setback came last August, when Bristol-Myers scrapped BMS-986094, a high-profile treatment for hepatitis C, after a patient died of heart failure in a mid-stage trial and others were hospitalized. The company took a charge of $1.8 billion in the 2012 third quarter for the failed medicine. Although the drug would not have reached the market for several years, the failure tarnished the company’s research prowess. Bristol-Myers has agreed to pay $80 million to patients hurt in the hepatitis C study, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The drugmaker confirmed it had an “agreement in principle” to settle the matter but said terms of the pact were confidential. Despite its research setbacks, Bristol-Myers shares are trading at 19 times expected 2013 earnings per share, well above the average multiple of 12.5 for other large drugmakers. Purkiss said the premium is partly warranted because of huge sales potential of Eliquis, a new type of blood clot preventer developed with Pfizer Inc that was approved by U.S. regulators last month. He said several Bristol-Myers cancer drugs in late-stage trials also have blockbuster sales potential. “Hopes for those drugs, and Eliquis, could justify a premium, but probably not the current premium,” Purkiss said, adding that Bristol-Myers shares could be vulnerable to new setbacks. The company’s new 2013 profit outlook assumes a company tax rate this year of 16 percent, far below a rate of up to 23 percent that some analysts had expected. Bristol-Myers officials said the rate is coming down due to a new federal tax credit for research and development and other factors. The drugmaker said it earned $925 million, or 56 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, up from $852 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, such as a $411 million tax benefit from the write-off of the failed hepatitis C drug, the company earned 47 cents per share. On that basis, analysts’ average forecast was 43 cents per share. Revenue plunged 23 percent to $4.19 billion following U.S. patent expirations last year on Plavix and Avapro. Wall Street had expected $4.12 billion. Plavix sales plunged 97 percent to $49 million, while Avapro sales fell 57 percent to $84 million. Soaring growth of newer drugs helped cushion those declines. Sales of arthritis treatment Orencia jumped 26 percent to $325 million, and combined revenue from diabetes drugs Onglyza and Kombiglyze rose 29 percent to $198 million. Leukemia treatment Sprycel rose 24 percent to $281 million.

Hortas said the drug’s chemical patent lapses in February 2015, but declined to comment on whether U.S. regulators might allow Teva’s generic onto the market before then. Teva officials could not immediately be reached for comment. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would have to approve Teva’s marketing application before its generic could be introduced, and that it was unclear when the FDA might act. Schoenebaum said Baraclude is expected to have U.S. sales this year of about $260 million. Even if the Teva generic arrives this year and hurts Baraclude’s U.S. sales, he said Bristol-Myers will probably not need to lower its current full-year profit forecast. Shares of Bristol-Myers were down 0.6 percent at $36.69 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning. Teva shares were down 0.4 percent in Tel Aviv.

173,BMY,Reckitt in $482 million deal to sell Bristol drugs in Latin America,"LONDON (Reuters) - Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) is paying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) $482 million for the right to sell some of its non-prescription remedies in Brazil, Mexico and other parts of Latin America. The deal, which includes a $44 million option fee that gives RB the right to buy the brands outright after three years, boosts the British consumer goods group’s footprint in over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and allows BMS to rationalize its portfolio. The transaction is the latest example of a large drug company shedding a non-core business to focus its operations. RB will initially license the brands from BMS, which will continue to manufacture them during the three-year collaboration, with the UK firm buying products from BMS and paying royalties on sales, the two companies said on Tuesday. The brands include Naldecon for coughs and colds, Picot for stomach acid, Tempra for pain relief, anti-gas medicine Luftal and Dermodex for nappy rash. Together, the various products had sales last year of $102 million. “This transaction creates a material consumer healthcare platform, infrastructure and distribution network for RB in both Brazil and Mexico,” said RB Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor. “As such it is an important step in building our consumer healthcare presence in Latin American emerging markets.” RB forecast the deal would boost earnings per share from 2014. The British group also makes popular cleaning products such as Cillit Bang but it is increasingly a health and hygiene company, having built up this side of the business through a string of acquisitions in recent years. Last November, it clinched a deal to acquire U.S. group Schiff Nutrition for $1.4 billion, winning an entry into the vitamins and nutrition supplements market after beating out Germany’s Bayer (BAYGn.DE). Past takeovers include the acquisition of Boots’s OTC drugs business, cough medicines company Adams and Durex condoms group SSL. For BMS, the transaction means it will focus in future on research-based, innovative new medicines in Latin America, reflecting its strategy of biopharmaceutical development. The U.S. drugmaker has previously taken steps to divest other non-core businesses, including the spin-off of its baby food unit Mead Johnson Nutrition MJN.N in 2009.

The French drugmaker said in its annual report it became aware of the probe in June 2012 and was cooperating with the DoJ. Plavix, once the world’s second-best selling drug, was co-marketed by Sanofi and U.S. drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb before it lost patent protection in May 2012. The U.S. FDA added a so-called boxed warning to Plavix in 2010 to highlight that the drug could be less effective in certain patients who could not metabolize it properly.

177,BMY,BDR Pharma seeks India license for Bristol-Myers drug,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - BDR Pharmaceuticals said on Monday it has applied to India’s patent office for a compulsory license to sell a generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s cancer drug dasatinib, after unsuccessfully seeking a voluntary license from Bristol-Myers. Under a global Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement, countries can issue compulsory licenses for certain drugs that are deemed unaffordable to a large section of their populations. If approved, a compulsory license for dasatinib, a blood cancer drug, would be another setback for global drugmakers in India. German company Bayer AG lost an appeal earlier this month challenging the first such Indian license, which was granted to Natco Pharma for cancer drug Nexavar. Dasatinib is sold as Sprycel by U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb and costs about 165,000 rupees ($3,050) for a month’s treatment in India. BDR Pharma filed its application seeking a compulsory license on March 4 and has offered to sell the drug at 8,100 rupees for a month’s dose, Aravind Badiger, technical director at BDR, an Indian pharmaceuticals company, said. “We expect the patent office to respond at the earliest,” he said in an email response to a Reuters query. BDR had unsuccessfully sought a voluntary license from Bristol-Myers to sell a copycat version of the drug, Badiger said. Bristol-Myers Squibb said in a statement that it does not comment on ongoing proceedings. The company said it “has and will continue to pursue all appropriate avenues to protect its intellectual property rights in India.” It said Sprycel is protected by a composition of matter patent from the Indian Patent Office.

180,BMY,UPDATE 1-Bristol-Myers names Cuss to replace Sigal as R&D; chief,"April 7 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  said on Sunday it has named Francis Cuss to become its next chief scientific officer after Elliott Sigal retires as head of research and development on June 30. Sigal, 61, who has led Bristol’s research efforts since 2004 and has overseen the approval of 14 new medicines on his watch, will also resign from the company’s board of directors, the company said. Bristol had not previously announced Sigal’s retirement plans. Cuss, 58, is set to take over the top scientific post on July 1. He joined Bristol-Myers in 2003 after spending 14 years working at Schering-Plough and three with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline. “As our company embarks on the next phase of pipeline execution, this is a natural time for Francis to lead our R&D; team,” Chief Executive Lamberto Andreotti said in a statement, adding that Cuss has been a key member of the R&D; team with experience in both drug discovery and development. The Bristol-Myers news comes a month after Merck & Co  announced that its research chief, Peter Kim, would retire and be replaced by Roger Perlmutter, who had previously been head of research and development for biotechnology company Amgen. That transition is set to take place next week. Cuss has been instrumental in advancing development of some of the company’s highest profile experimental medicines, the company said, including drugs being tested against hepatitis C and cancer, such as a promising cancer immunotherapy from a new class called PD-1 inhibitors. Sigal joined Bristol-Myers in 1997 as vice president of the department of applied genomics and has held several posts since. He was elected to the board of directors in 2011. Under Sigal’s leadership, new Bristol-Myers products have been introduced for a wide variety of illnesses, including medicines to treat cancer, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, organ transplant rejection and heart disease. Andreotti thanked Sigal for his service, saying he had “a significant impact on the transformation of our company.” Bristol-Myers shares are up nearly 25 percent this year and more than 60 percent since Andreotti took over as CEO in 2010.",4072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristolmyers-sigal/update-1-bristol-myers-names-cuss-to-replace-sigal-as-rd-chief-idUSL2N0CU0FS20130407

187,BMY,Bristol-Myers oral hepatitis C regimen looks competitive: study,"(Reuters) - A combination of three experimental Bristol-Myers Squibb hepatitis C drugs appeared to be highly effective, according to data from a mid-stage clinical trial, keeping the company in the race for developing an all-oral treatment regimen for the serious liver disease. The combination therapy, which involves three direct acting antiviral drugs that each attack different targets needed for replication of the hepatitis virus, achieved cure rates as high as 94 percent when given for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks, according to results of the small study. Current treatment regimens for the disease still include the older, difficult-to-tolerate drugs interferon and ribavirin and are typically taken for either 24 weeks or 48 weeks. When used with newer drugs, they have cure rates as high as about 80 percent. Several companies are developing hepatitis C regimens that do not include interferon - which is given intravenously and often causes miserable flu-like symptoms - while also pursuing much shorter treatment durations. Gilead Sciences Inc and Abbvie Inc are widely seen as ahead of the pack with treatments that could reach the market as soon as next year. But those will likely, at least initially, include ribavirin, which many patients also have difficulty tolerating. Data from the Bristol-Myers combination, to be presented this week at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) meeting in Amsterdam, does not include ribavirin, potentially giving the company a competitive advantage. Bristol-Myers said it expects to begin Phase III testing of its combination by late 2013, so it is still playing catch-up. “The speed of drug development is moving quicker than any of us would have thought and the potency of these regimens with high (cures) is very good for the field and for patients,” Dr. Eric Lawitz, one of the investigators who worked on the trial, said in a telephone interview from Amsterdam. The multi-pronged study included 66 patients with the most common and difficult to treat genotype 1 form of the disease who had not previously been treated. It tested a combination of daclatasvir, from a promising new class of drugs called NS5A inhibitors, a protease inhibitor called asunaprevir, and either 75 milligrams or 150 milligrams of BMS-791325 (‘325), a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. The combinations were tested for either 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatment. With the lower dose of ‘325, the sustained virologic response 12 weeks after completing treatment (SVR 12) was 94 percent, and that was essentially maintained through 24 weeks. Patients in whom the virus is undetectable 24 weeks after completing treatment (SVR 24) are considered to be cured. If data was excluded from the few patients who either missed a planned doctor visit and could not be tested or withdrew consent to participate, then all 28 patients in the lower dose arms of the trial were cured, Bristol-Myers said. “It looks overall very promising,” said Lawitz, medical director of the Texas Liver Institute in San Antonio. “Anytime we can hit 90 percent SVR, we’re very interested.” There was less available data ready in time for the EASL meeting from patients who got the 150 mgs of ‘325, but that dose appeared to be a bit less promising than the lower dose. The SVR 12 rate for those who received 12 weeks of treatment was 89 percent. But there was one patient who had viral breakthrough, in which the virus comes back during treatment after initially responding, and one patient who relapsed after completing treatment. There was also one viral breakthrough reported in the 24-week treatment group. There were no patient discontinuations due to intolerance to the drugs or adverse events and no serious elevations in liver enzymes reported, the company said. Two serious adverse events were reported. One patient suffered from kidney stones, which was deemed unrelated to the Bristol-Myers drugs by researchers, and one case of cerebral vasoconstriction (a narrowing of blood vessels in the brain) in a patient taking interferon and ribavirin following viral breakthrough. The most commonly reported side effects were headache, diarrhea, muscle weakness and nausea, the company said. “There hasn’t been any safety signal that has been concerning from what’s been reported to date,” said Lawitz, adding that much larger studies with more diverse patient populations, such as those with cirrhosis, must be conducted to confirm the findings. An estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. If untreated it can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or the need for a liver transplant.

189,BMY,Boehringer anti-clotting pill gains blockbuster status,"INGELHEIM, Germany, April 24 (Reuters) - Boehringer Ingelheim said its anti-blood-clotting drug Pradaxa reached blockbuster status in 2012, helping the world’s largest unlisted drugmaker to an 11.5 percent rise in sales for last year. Sales of the pill, which competes with Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto as well as Bristol Myers-Squibb and Pfizer’s Eliquis, jumped 76 percent to 1.1 billion euros ($1.43 billion) in its second year of market approval, the group said on Wednesday.

191,BMY,"REFILE-UPDATE 3-Bristol-Myers Squibb sales disappoint, shares fall","By Ransdell Pierson April 25 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb reported disappointing first-quarter sales, prompting a drop in shares that have risen sharply this year on enthusiasm for its lineup of promising experimental drugs. The company on Thursday said sales plunged 27 percent to $3.83 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations of $3.88 billion, as its Avapro blood pressure drug and Plavix blood clot preventer faced competition from cheaper generics. Bristol-Myers, whose stock was down 2.5 percent by midday, earned $609 million, or 37 cents per share in the quarter. That was down from $1.1 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 41 cents per share, matching the analysts’ average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company managed to meet the earnings forecast because its effective tax rate fell to 11 percent from 26.7 percent a year earlier, due to a new federal credit for research and development. Wall Street had been expecting a tax rate in the 15 percent range. “The (results) were a bit disappointing, and Bristol-Myers didn’t talk about their expectations for 2014,” said Herman Saftlas, an analyst with S&P; Capital Inc. Even after Thursday’s sharp decline, company shares trade at 18 times Bristol-Myers’ expected per share earnings for 2013, well above the price-to-earnings ratio of 14 for the drug sector. Saftlas said even a slight miss of sales expectations was enough to convince many investors to unload shares. “With a premium like that, you can’t disappoint on anything, and even a small disappointment leads to a correction,” Saftlas said. Bristol-Myers said it still expected full-year earnings of $1.78 to $1.88 per share, which would be a decline of up to 11 percent from 2012. Plavix sales dropped 95 percent to $91 million in the quarter, but J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott said that was about $45 million above expectations. Avapro’s fell 78 percent to $46 million. Most of the company’s newer drugs showed strong growth, although slightly below estimates, Schott said. Sales of melanoma treatment Yervoy jumped 49 percent to $229 million, while sales of leukemia drug Sprycel rose 24 percent to $287 million. Combined sales of diabetes drugs Onglyza and Kombiglyze increased 25 percent to $202 million, while sales of rheumatoid arthritis medicine Orencia rose 26 percent to $320 million. “The main takeaway message is that a lot of new products are helping mitigate the Plavix loss, so Bristol-Myers is pretty well positioned,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Analysts expect Bristol-Myers’ earnings to rebound next year, growing by a mid-teen percentage rate, as the Avapro and Plavix declines level off and newer drugs continue to grow. Investors have especially high hopes for Eliquis, a blood clot preventer approved in December to prevent strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. They expect the pill, developed in partnership with Pfizer Inc , to become a preferred alternative to the standard treatment, warfarin. Eliquis  had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, below the $36 million that Wall Street expected, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said. “But it’s very early days, and we think the company will get a pass for another quarter or two,” Schoenebaum said, giving sales representatives more time to drive up sales. Morningstar’s Conover predicted Eliquis will eventually capture annual sales of $6.5 billion, to be split with Pfizer. Bristol-Myers is developing a slate of other potentially lucrative drugs, including treatments for hepatitis C and various forms of cancer. One cancer drug, which blocks a protein called PD-1, could claim the spotlight next month at a major cancer meeting in Chicago. If approved, Conover said the drug could generate annual sales of $2.5 billion. “We think Bristol-Myers has one of the best pipelines in the industry,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark. But some of Bristol-Myers’ experimental drugs have recently fallen by the wayside. U.S. regulators rejected dapaglifozin, a new type of treatment for type 2 diabetes, early last year due to safety concerns. Six months later, its brivanib drug failed in a late-stage trial to prolong survival in liver cancer patients. Bristol-Myers pulled the plug last August on another treatment for hepatitis C after a patient died of heart failure in a mid-stage trial. The company, with a charge of $1.8 billion in the 2012 third quarter, wrote off the once-promising drug.

196,BMY,Bristol melanoma drug combo marks new advance in immunotherapy,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Melanoma patients treated with two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs fared much better than those who received either of the medications individually, a new advance for treatments that harness the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Bristol released preliminary data from the early-stage trial on Wednesday, with more detailed results expected to highlight the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting in Chicago that starts at the end of the month. Patients in the study received Bristol’s immunotherapy Yervoy, which is already on the market, and an experimental treatment called Nivolumab that attacks an immune-system-inhibiting protein called PD-1. The combined treatment shrank tumors in a majority of patients. “We have never seen this with immunotherapy before,” said Dr Jedd Wolchok of New York’s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. “The vast majority of patients have a decrease in tumor burden. In melanoma, we’re used to seeing the opposite,” he said of the notoriously difficult-to-treat form of skin cancer. Investors have been eager to see results of the study, with Bristol shares reaching a 10-year high on Wednesday in advance of the data release. Both drugs are designed to target different parts of the immune system that act as brakes even when cancer is present, preventing immune cells from attacking tumors. By gumming up these brakes, the drugs free the immune system to attack and kill tumor cells. Approved in 2011, Yervoy, or ipilimumab, was the first drug to significantly extend survival in patients with advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. It boosts the immune system by blocking the action of a protein called CTLA-4. Nivolumab, which is in late-stage testing, targets a protein called PD-1, or Programmed Death receptor, a new class of immune-system drugs that shows promise not only in melanoma but also in lung and kidney cancer. Typically, only about 11 percent of patients respond to Yervoy, and recent studies in melanoma suggest Nivolumab produces a response rate of about 41 percent, Wolchok told a news briefing. The current study looked at the combination of the two drugs based on animal studies suggesting that together they might work better than either drug alone. Wolchok reported results for 86 patients in the trial as of February 2013, including 52 patients who were on both drugs at the same time. In one of the treatment groups, which will likely advance to late-stage trials, 53 percent of patients treated with both Yervoy and Nivolumab simultaneously had an objective response - defined as at least a 50 percent reduction in tumor size. Dr Sandra Swain, president of ASCO, called the findings remarkable. “This combination treatment led to a very rapid and profound lasting tumor shrinkage. Ninety percent of patients are still responding,” she said. Three out of four patients who responded to the dual treatment had tumor shrinkage in the first three months. Among the most advanced melanoma patients, Wolchok said the combination of the two drugs produced “rapid and deep regressions, with many showing more than 80 percent tumor regression by the time of the first scan.” Overall, most patients had some decrease in tumor size. In 31 percent of all patients taking the dual therapy, tumors shrank by greater than 80 percent, Wolchok said. In 18 percent of patients, the drug combination produced a complete response, meaning tumors were no longer detectable, Wolchok said in an interview. He said they do not yet have any data on relapse because 90 percent of patients who responded to the treatment are continuing to benefit. The combination also appeared to be safe. About half of patients who got both treatments had a drug-related side effect, but in most cases it was linked to elevations in enzymes related to the pancreas and liver. “These are reversible, sometimes without treatment,” Wolchok said, although some patients did need a short course of the steroid prednisone. There were no drug-related deaths. “We really didn’t see anything new with the combination” related to safety, he said. Bristol-Myers plans a late-stage clinical trial that looks at both drugs in combination, as well as each separately, in patients with melanoma. It has also begun testing the same combination in lung cancer and renal-cell cancer. “We view the combination of immunotherapy as a significant one that we’ll be pursuing,” Michael Giordano, Bristol-Myers’ senior vice president of global development for oncology and immunology, said in an interview. So far, Bristol-Myers is furthest ahead in its development of a PD-1 inhibitor, but Merck & Co Inc last month won designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a “breakthrough therapy,” which could speed development and regulatory review of the product. In a recent note, Bernstein Research analyst Tim Anderson said Bristol’s anti-cancer drug PD-1 “is the major driver of investor interest at the moment,” but said awareness is building that competitors “may not be very far behind.” Last November, Merck reported results from a trial of its drug in patients with advanced melanoma and saw a 47 percent response rate. In that trial, the drug benefited patients who had previously been treated with ipilimumab but had not responded, said Dr. Gary Gilliland, a Merck senior vice president for oncology. Merck plans to present an update of this study on June 2 at the ASCO meeting. Gilliland said the company also is studying its treatment in so-called triple-negative breast cancer, a hard-to-treat form of the disease, as well as head and neck cancer and bladder cancer. Other companies pursuing the PD-1 or related pathways include Roche, GlaxoSmithKline and Teva. “PD-1 is arguably the most exciting breakthrough in cancer therapy in a decade,” said ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum. “There is speculation that it might offer a cure for some patients with solid tumors. This is unprecedented.” ",5152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-bristolmyers-melanoma/bristol-melanoma-drug-combo-marks-new-advance-in-immunotherapy-idUSBRE94E1C320130515

201,BMY,UPDATE 1-Former Bristol-Myers executive admits to insider trading,"* Robert Ramnarine pleads guilty to securities fraud * Defendant accused of buying options in takeover targets By Jonathan Stempel June 10 (Reuters) - A former Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  finance executive on Monday pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge, admitting to buying stock options in a biotechnology company that the drugmaker was preparing to buy. Robert Ramnarine, 46, admitted to one count of securities fraud for trading in Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc options before Bristol-Myers agreed to buy that company last June for $5.3 billion, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey said. Federal prosecutors had last August charged Ramnarine with three counts of securities fraud. They said he made $311,361 of illegal profit from August 2010 to July 2012 from options trading in Amylin and two other companies that Bristol-Myers sought to buy - Pharmasset Inc and ZymoGenetics Inc. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil fraud case against Ramnarine. Investigators said Ramnarine learned about the takeovers while working as a director and later as an executive director in Bristol-Myers’ pension and savings investments office in Princeton, New Jersey. They also said the East Brunswick, New Jersey resident did Internet searches on insider trading detection prior to some of his trades, including a review of an article titled “Ways to Avoid Insider Trading.” Ramnarine entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson in Trenton, New Jersey. He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and $5 million fine when he is sentenced on Sept. 26. Ramnarine agreed to forfeit $311,361, and Fishman said the sentence can take into account his trades in Pharmasset and ZymoGenetics, as well as Amylin. Douglas Jensen, a lawyer for Ramnarine, declined to comment. Ramnarine had worked for New York-based Bristol-Myers for 15 years, ending as assistant treasurer for capital markets. Frederick Egenolf, a Bristol-Myers spokesman, said employees are required to comply with the company’s securities trading policy. He said Ramnarine’s employment ended last Aug. 13. Bristol-Myers bought ZymoGenetics for $885 million in October 2010. Gilead Sciences Inc bought Pharmasset for about $11.2 billion in January 2012 after Bristol-Myers dropped out of talks. The cases are U.S. v. Ramnarine, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 12-mj-08121; and SEC v.

204,BMY,"UPDATE 2-Astra, Bristol diabetes drug disappoints in key test","* Onglyza fails to show cardiovascular benefit in study * Positive results might have added $1 bln to peak sales * Drug achieves non-inferiority goal versus placebo By Ben Hirschler LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s diabetes drug Onglyza failed to reduce heart risks in a large clinical study, disappointing investors who had thought it might demonstrate an edge over rivals. The companies, which jointly sell several diabetes drugs, said on Wednesday the SAVOR trial showed that patients on Onglyza had no fewer adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, than those on placebo. Doctors and investors had been awaiting results of the SAVOR trial with keen interest, since a positive result could have encouraged increased use of the drug and others from its class, which also includes Merck & Co’s Januvia, the market leader. The study found Onglyza was no worse than placebo or standard care in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, but it failed to meet the goal of demonstrating superiority. Heart risks are particularly important in diabetes, since patients with the disease are at increased risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke. Regulators are also stepping up scrutiny of diabetes drugs to make sure they do not add to cardiovascular or other health risks. “We see this news as removing a potential positive catalyst that could have reinvigorated growth for the class as a whole,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said he does not expect the non-inferiority finding to alter physician prescribing habits. A similar heart study of Merck’s Januvia in more than 14,000 patients, called TECOS, is being conducted with results expected next year. Januvia and the related combination treatment Janumet have combined annual sales of about $5 billion, but sales unexpectedly declined in the first quarter. “If TECOS were to somehow show superiority on cardiovascular  safety it would be a differentiated win for the company,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The Onglyza clinical trial evaluated more than 16,000 adult patients with type 2 diabetes with either a history of established cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors. Onglyza, which had sales of $709 million in 2012, is a crucial product in a diabetes joint venture established by Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker and U.S.-based Bristol-Myers, but its sales have recently stalled in the United States. Analysts at Berenberg Bank said in a note last week that a demonstrable cardiovascular benefit for Onglyza could have reinvigorated demand, leading to eventual peak sales of $3 billion by 2020 - $1 billion more than the broker’s base-line forecast. AstraZeneca and Bristol gave only the headline results from the SAVOR clinical study, since detailed findings have been submitted to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for potential presentation at the ESC Congress in September.

206,BMY,Release of Eliquis blood clot preventer story,"(Reuters) The blood clot preventer Eliquis, sold by Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, proved as effective as widely used warfarin in treating a dangerous condition known as venous thromboembolism and caused far less bleeding, according to data from a large clinical trial. The Pfizer and Bristol-Myers pill met the main goal of the study by showing it worked just as well as conventional treatment with warfarin, a generic blood thinner, in reducing recurrence of the condition and related deaths. Eliquis also led to a nearly 70 percent reduction in the risk of major bleeding and more than a 50 percent reduction in a category known as clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Bleeding is typically the most troubling side effect of extended use of blood thinning drugs. Dr. Giancarlo Agnelli, the study’s lead investigator, called the bleeding results “a remarkable real advantage” for Eliquis. “This is to me the most striking finding of this study in terms of potential changes to clinical practice,” Agnelli, who presented the data on Monday at the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) meeting in Amsterdam, said in a telephone interview. The results were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. “This really makes apixaban a really safe compound,” he added, using the chemical name for Eliquis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially fatal condition consisting of blood clots in the leg, known as deep vein thrombosis, and clots in the lungs, known as pulmonary embolism. About 900,000 Americans and 1 million patients in the European Union are diagnosed with the condition each year. The condition recurs in up to 10 percent of patients. Eliquis belongs to a new class of blood clot preventers meant to replace warfarin, which has been in use for decades and requires rigorous monitoring. It competes directly with Xarelto from Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson, and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Some doctors have been reluctant to switch to the new medicines in part because their blood-thinning effect is not easily reversed in case emergency medical treatment, such as surgery, is needed. Companies are testing agents that could be used to reverse the blood thinning effect if necessary. Eliquis is already approved to prevent strokes and blood clots in patients with a common, but dangerous irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation - by far the largest market for the new blood thinners. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum forecast eventual peak annual sales of $3 billion for the drug. If approved for venous thromboembolism, it would add an important, if smaller, use for the medicine. While doctors are comfortable using warfarin, it requires careful patient monitoring of levels of the drug in the blood and dose adjustments, as well as patient dietary and lifestyle changes to prevent dangerous bleeding. Eliquis and its rivals are a fixed dose treatment with little or no patient monitoring required. “Even if you show just non-inferiority, the advantage (of Eliquis) in terms of increased practicality is huge,” said Agnelli, the director of the Department of Internal and Cardiovascular Medicine and Stroke-Unit of University Hospital in Perugia, Italy. The nearly 5,400-patient trial tested 10 milligrams of Eliquis given twice a day for seven days followed by 5 mg twice daily for six months against the conventional use of initial injections of Sanofi’s Lovenox (enoxaparin) followed by daily use of warfarin. For the composite goal of recurrence of VTE and VTE-related death there were 59 cases for Eliquis, or 2.3 percent, versus 71 cases for warfarin, or 2.7 percent. For the primary safety goal of the study, there were 15 reports of major bleeding among Eliquis patients, or 0.6 percent, compared with 49 major bleeds among warfarin patients, or 1.8 percent. The 69-percent reduced major bleeding risk was deemed to be highly statistically significant, researchers said. There were 103 reported cases of clinically relevant non-major bleeding with the Pfizer and Bristol drug versus 215 cases in the warfarin group, or a risk reduction of 52 percent.

207,BMY,Fitch Downgrades Bristol Myers Squibb's IDR to 'A-'; Outlook to Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s  (Bristol Myers Squibb) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A-' from 'A'.  See a full list of affected ratings  below.  The ratings apply to approximately $7.3 billion of debt.  The Rating Outlook is  revised to Stable from Negative. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Operational pressure peaking in 2013: Plavix and Avapro patent expirations  have negatively affected total company sales, operating margins and cash flows  more than expected. Fitch sees operational improvement in 2014 due to a lull  period in patent losses. Recovery will be short-lived, however, as another wave  of patent losses representing over 35% of present revenues arrives in 2015.   --Debt leverage reflective of 'A-' category: Fitch expects debt could trend  higher, net of refinancing maturing securities, during the second half of 2013  as the company seeks additional liquidity in the U.S. Fitch sees leverage in the  range of 1.7x to 2.0x EBITDA over the long term, fluctuating due to timing of  key drug patent lapses. --Free cash flow moderates: Dampened profitability from patent losses is  expected to hinder free cash flow generation (FCF; cash from operations less  dividends and capital expenditures); however, Fitch anticipates FCF to remain  above $400 million annually in 2013 and 2014.  --Coming patent cliff less daunting: Fitch anticipates that continued market  uptake of promising new medicines, growth of core therapeutics, and successful  commercialization of key research projects may minimize patent expirations of  Sustiva, Baraclude, and Abilify in 2015.  Fitch anticipates revenue growth in  the long term as drug patent expirations ease. --Capital deployment eases: Fitch sees capital uses ease for business  development and share purchasing this year following heavy spending in 2012. The  company spent more than $12 billion to buy new assets and return value to  shareholders via dividends and share repurchases in 2012.   Operational Pressure from Plavix Expiration The dramatic decline in Plavix sales following patent expiration in May 2012 was  the main driver of overall revenue decreases of 24.6% and 17.1% for the latest  12-month (LTM) period ending March 31, 2103, and 2012, respectively.  Concomitantly, EBITDA margin compressed more than expected to 23.3% for the same  LTM period, from 35.8% in 2011, In addition, FCF fell to $537 million in 2012  and turned negative for the LTM period after excluding $3.57 billion received  from AstraZeneca plc (AstraZeneca) for the shared purchase of Amylin. Fitch sees  some margin improvement and modest FCF growth over the next year as the company  recovers from the Plavix patent loss. However, the company faces another patent  expiration period in 2015-2016. Moderate Impact from Patent Losses in 2015  A second wave of drug patent expirations hits in 2015 when Sustiva, Baraclude,  and Abilify lose market exclusivity in the U.S. The maturing medicines generated  sales of $5.69 billion for the LTM period or 35.1% of total revenues. The patent  expiration of Baraclude in the U.S. is immaterial; however, the potential loss  of exclusivity in international markets in October 2016 presents the main  challenge.  Market uptake of Bristol-Myers Squibb's most promising new  therapeutics - Yervoy, Eliquis, Bydureon, and Forxiga - and continued growth of  core blockbuster medicines, notably Sprycel, Reyataz, and Orencia, provides  support during the coming patent cliff. As such, the impact from patent lapses  during 2015 may be more moderate than that experienced in the present patent  expiration period. Fitch forecasts revenues to 'recover' from the patent losses  as shown by a compound annual growth of 2.3% in 2012 to 2017. Leverage to Vacillate in the Long Term Gross debt leverage has risen to 1.94x for the LTM period ending March 31, 2013  from 1.38x in 2012, and is expected to remain above 1.8x in 2013, a level  reflective of the current rating category. Margin contraction and an increased  debt load led to the increase in total debt leverage since the end of the year.  Fitch assumes that Bristol-Myers Squibb will seek new financing to pay down $600  million in maturing debt in the second half of the year. Fitch anticipates  improvement in debt leverage in 2014 following annualizing the Plavix patent  loss; however, the decrease will reverse in 2015 in conjunction with the next  patent expiration period, yet remain below 2.0x. The next significant debt  maturity is $650 million in 4.375% unsecured notes due in November 2016.    Margins Pressured by Partnered Medicines In addition to margin pressure from key drug patent losses, a product-mix shift  to promising lower margin partnered products - Eliquis, Onglyza/Kombiglyze,  Forxiga, and Bydureon - will dampen overall margin despite the benefit of  sharing the marketing and development costs. Potentially affecting the sales mix  positively in the long term is successful commercialization of internally  developed all-oral Hepatitis C treatments and first-in-class oncology treatment,  nivolumumab. Fitch expects sequential improvement in margins during 2014, but  compression in 2015 accelerated by key drug patent losses.    Free Cash Flow Moderates Excluding the cash received from AstraZeneca for its share of the Amylin  acquisition in 2012, FCF was $537 million or 3.1% of revenues in 2012 and -$271  million for the LTM period. Working capital uses plus significantly lower Plavix  and Avapro sales resulted in $1.1 billion less operating cash flow in the first  quarter of 2013 versus the prior year first quarter. As such, Fitch anticipates  FCF to fall to around $450 million in 2013 and $550 million in 2014, assuming a  continued commitment to dividends and higher capital spending. Capital to Be Preserved Fitch expects Bristol-Myers Squibb will refrain from devoting significant  capital toward business development and share repurchasing activities in 2013  following a year of heightened spending. During 2012, the company returned $4.69  billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, while adding two  significant assets to its 'String of Pearls' for approximately $6 billion ($7.5  billion including assumed debt). The main lever for returning value to  shareholders this year in Fitch's opinion will be dividends, which increased  2.6% for 2013. The company paid out $2.29 billion for the LTM period.    RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch views an upgrade as unlikely given anticipated operational pressure from  expiring drug patents through 2016. However, positive action would be warranted  if Bristol-Myers Squibb circumvents the negative effect on earnings and cash  flows from lost revenues from expiring products such that gross leverage returns  and stays below 1.7x and FCF margin is maintained at 8%. Operational improvement  is likely to result from continued market demand for new therapeutics as well as  successful commercialization of promising oral Hepatitis C treatments and the  potential first-in-class oncology drug, Nivolumab.  Further ratings pressure would stem from the company's inability to mitigate the  negative effects in 2015-2016 of the Abilify, Sustiva, and Baraclude patent  expirations. A one-notch downgrade could follow a sustained increase in total  debt leverage to greater than 2.0x together with significant FCF contraction  resulting from higher-than-expected margin compression and incremental debt.   Fitch has downgraded the following ratings:   --IDR to 'A-' from 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt to 'A-' from 'A'; --Bank loan to 'A-' from 'A'; --Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'; --Commercial paper to 'F2' from 'F1'.

209,BMY,U.S. FDA puts hold on Vertex hepatitis study; shares fall,"(Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc said U.S. health regulators placed a partial clinical hold on its mid-stage study of an experimental oral hepatitis C treatment because of potential liver problems, sending its shares sharply lower on Thursday. Vertex said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took the action on the Phase II study of its VX-135 in combination with the standard hepatitis drug ribavirin after elevated liver enzymes were observed in three patients taking the 400 milligram dose of its drug. As a result of the hold, the U.S. biotechnology company said it was unable to evaluate results of the trial, even for those patients who had been getting the 200 mg dose of VX-135. “We are committed to continuing to work closely with the FDA to provide the data needed to support evaluation of a 200 mg dose of VX-135 in the U.S.,” Robert Kauffman, Vertex’s chief medical officer, said in a statement. The halted trial was being conducted in Europe. The 400 mg arm of the study was discontinued and the patients’ liver enzymes returned to what they had been prior to entering the trial, Vertex said. A U.S. study evaluating 100 mgs of VX-135 was not affected, the company said. VX-135 is also being studied at 100 mg and 200 mg in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s daclatasvir, a highly promising hepatitis drug from a different class of oral medicines. Vertex has the market leading hepatitis C treatment with Incivek. But that drug must be taken with the difficult to tolerate injected drug interferon to provide high cure rates. Incivek sales have been declining sharply as patients wait for new all oral treatment regimens that promise very high cure rates without the need for interferon and the miserable flu-like symptoms that come with it. The first of those are expected to become available in 2014 from other companies and Vertex has been playing catch-up. “With our ongoing studies in the U.S., Europe and now New Zealand with VX-135 and daclatasvir, our strategy in hepatitis C is unchanged - to develop an all-oral therapy that provides a high cure rate across multiple hepatitis C genotypes,” Kauffman said. Vertex shares were down more than 9 percent at $80 in after hours trading after closing at $87.62 on Nasdaq.

210,BMY,UPDATE 1-Albany Molecular says Bristol-Myers stops developing depression drug,"* Says Bristol-Myers stopped two mid-stage studies of the drug * To discuss future plans for the drug with Bristol-Myers- CEO * Albany says third-quarter and full-year outlook not affected * Shares fall as much as 22 pct   (Adds details, background, CEO comment) By Vrinda Manocha Aug 12 (Reuters) - Drug developer Albany Molecular Research Inc said partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Co would stop developing its experimental drug to treat depression, sending Albany’s shares down as much as 22 percent. Albany said Bristol-Myers stopped two mid-stage studies of the drug after it failed to show superiority over two other antidepressants. (link.reuters.com/fax32v) The drug, codenamed BMS-820836, is targeted at Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD), a condition in which patients fail to respond to approved antidepressants. New York-based Albany Molecular entered into the license agreement with the pharmaceutical giant in 2005, allowing Bristol-Myers to develop and market products using Albany’s technology to treat depression and other disorders of the central nervous system. Bristol-Myers identified four compounds under the agreement and BMS-820836 was the furthest along in development, Albany Chief Executive Thomas D’Ambra told Reuters. As of Dec. 31, Albany had received $15.5 million as a part of the deal, according to a regulatory statement filed on March 18. “We expect to have further discussions at some future date to decide about their plans for this compound or any other compound,” D’Ambra said, adding that Bristol-Myers’ decision was taken recently. The company said the decision would not have an impact on its forecasts for the third quarter and 2013. Albany reported second-quarter revenue of $59.3 million last week and forecast third-quarter revenue of $51 to $53 million. Shares of the company were down 14 percent at $10.80 in the afternoon on the Nasdaq.

213,BMY,UPDATE 2-Doctors get good and bad safety news on diabetes drugs,"* Astra/BMS and Takeda drugs do not raise heart attack risks * Studies also clear Onglyza and Nesina on pancreatic safety * But more heart failure hospitalisations seen with Onglyza * Data won’t alleviate pressures on DPP-4 class - analyst By Ben Hirschler AMSTERDAM, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Diabetes pills known as DPP-4 therapies got a mixed safety report on Monday as studies showed they did not raise the risk of heart attacks but might be linked to heart failure, where the heart fails to pump blood adequately. Reassuringly, the medicines were not associated with increased rates of either inflammation of the pancreas or cancer - something that has been a worry in the past. However, in the case of AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s approved drug Onglyza, there was a small increase in hospitalisations for heart failure. “It is a little bit concerning,” said Dr. Christopher Grainger of Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the research. “I’m sure the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) will want to know more about it.” Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum, who forecasts Onglyza sales of $2.47 billion in 2018, said the latest data would not ameliorate growing pressures on the DPP-4 drug class in terms of winning reimbursement and achieving wider use. Doctors and regulators are wary of the cardiovascular safety profile of diabetes drugs following past problems, including with GlaxoSmithKline’s Avandia pill, since patients with diabetes are at increased risk of heart troubles. Researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who studied Onglyza over two years in 16,492 patients, said the heart failure finding was unexpected and deserved further investigation. AstraZeneca and Bristol had already given headline results from the study in June, showing Onglyza did not increase heart attack risk - although it did not reduce it either, as the companies had initially hoped. To date, researchers have been unable to identify any diabetes drug that is not only safe but actually beneficial to the heart. Some doctors were disappointed that Onglyza and Takeda’s  rival drug Nesina did not reduce heart risks. However, Dr. Heinz Drexel, a heart specialist at Feldkirch Hospital in Austria and a spokesman for the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), said the idea of such a benefit from taking the medicines was “not logical”. Drexel said DPP-4s still offered several advantages, including a lack of weight gain seen with some other antidiabetics, which would offset the heart failure worries. Detailed results of the Onglyza study were presented at the ESC annual congress in Amsterdam, alongside a 5,380-patient study of Nesina. Both studies showing no overall increase in cardiovascular risks were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. The co-principal investigator on the Onglyza study, Dr. Deepak Bhatt, said he believed the heart failure issue seen with Onglyza was very likely a class effect common to all DPP-4s, adding it had probably not shown up in the Nesina trial because it was far smaller. Still, he said the increase in heart-failure hospitalisations with Onglyza was small, affecting 3.5 percent of those taking the drug compared with 2.8 percent for the control group. Dr. Anthony DeMaria, editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said the absence of severe adverse events was reassuring but it might be that DPP-4s were best avoided for certain patients at high risk of heart failure. Drugs like Onglyza and Nesina work by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4, or DPP-4, to enhance the body’s ability to lower elevated levels of blood sugar. DDP-4s are not the most powerful agents for lowering blood sugar levels but they are well tolerated and have proved an attractive option for doctors looking for new oral drugs. The DPP-4 market is dominated by Merck’s Januvia, which has annual sales of around $5 billion, including a related combination treatment called Janumet. But growth of the class has slowed this year, partly on concerns over pancreatic safety. Onglyza, which had sales of $709 million in 2012, is a crucial product for AstraZeneca, which is banking on diabetes to help revive falling group sales due to patent expiries on several of its biggest-selling drugs. Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca’s head of global medicines development, said the overall results of the latest trial were reassuring and the small increase in heart failure hospitalisations did not change the risk profile of the drug. A similar heart study of Merck’s Januvia in more than 14,000 patients is being conducted with results expected next year.",9022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/heart-diabetes/update-2-doctors-get-good-and-bad-safety-news-on-diabetes-drugs-idUSL6N0GY0S720130902

215,BMY,UPDATE 1-Novo could see U.S. sales hurt after losing two contracts,"(Adds dateline, rewrites first paragraph, adds analyst comment, updates shares) By Teis Jensen COPENHAGEN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S has lost two contracts to supply a U.S. pharmacy group with its insulin and diabetes treatments, taking a bite out of expected earnings. The world’s biggest insulin producer said it had lost two contracts with Express Scripts Holding Co - a contract for its diabetes drug Victoza, won by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , and a deal for insulin Novolog, taken by Eli Lilly & Co . A spokesman on Tuesday confirmed the lost business but had no further immediate comment. Express Scripts is a purchasing organisation for a number of prescription programmes serving between 40 and 45 million Americans. “This is a serious blow for Novo Nordisk. I think it will hit earnings per share by closer to 3 percent in 2014,” analyst Soren Hansen at Sydbank said. Shares in Novo Nordisk traded 2.9 percent lower at 934.50 crowns by 1103 GMT on Tuesday against a 0.5 percent fall in the Danish benchmark index OMXC20CAP. The stock fell as low as 926 crowns, its lowest since late July. Hansen said he still expected sales of Victoza to grow but at a lower rate than previously foreseen. Jyske Bank said in a note the loss of the two contracts would impact total sales by 1 percent and operating profit by 1.8 percent in 2014. Analyst Rune Dahl at DNB Markets estimated that the Express Scripts contract for Victoza accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of the company’s Victoza prescription sales in the United States. Novo’s sales of Victoza in North America amounted to 3.56 billion Danish crowns ($629.4 mln) out of a total of 21.35 billion in the second quarter of this year.

216,BMY,Bristol's Yervoy falls short in prostate cancer study,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s immunotherapy drug Yervoy failed to significantly prolong survival among patients with advanced prostate cancer who had previously received chemotherapy, according to limited data from the first late-stage study of the drug for the condition. Yervoy (ipilimumab) frees the immune system to attack and kill cancer cells by blocking the action of a protein called CTLA-4. The closely followed drug was approved in 2011 to treat melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, and is well on its way to achieving annual blockbuster sales of $1 billion. An abstract, or limited summary, of findings from the prostate cancer study was released on Thursday. The trial involved almost 800 patients that had failed to benefit from drugs that lower the amount of testosterone - the male hormone that fuels prostate cancer - and from treatment with a standard chemotherapy called docetaxel. Half the patients in the trial received Yervoy after treatment with a dose of radiation, while others received a placebo after radiation. Patients taking Yervoy lived, on average, 11.2 months, compared with 10 months for those in the placebo group, a difference that was deemed slightly below statistical significance. Drug-related side effects, including gastrointestinal problems, were similar to those seen with Yervoy in melanoma trials. Researchers are slated to present full results of the trial, nicknamed the “043” study, late this month at a medical meeting in Amsterdam. The best responses to Yervoy in the prostate cancer study were in patients with less-advanced disease, including those whose cancer had not spread to the lung and liver, according to the abstract. That could bode well for a second Phase III trial of Yervoy, expected to be completed by 2015, which has enrolled patients who are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms of prostate cancer, and whose cancer has not spread to the lungs or liver. Although previously treated with anti-testosterone drugs, they have not taken chemotherapy. One of the leading approved treatments for prostate cancer is Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga. In trials of patients that had not previously been treated with chemotherapy, those taking Zytiga, on average, lived five months longer than those who received a placebo. The American Cancer Society last year estimated that more than 28,000 U.S. men would die from prostate cancer in 2012, making it the second leading cause of cancer death behind lung cancer. Bristol-Myers is also testing Yervoy, which is given by infusion, in a variety of other cancers, including those of the lung, stomach and ovaries.

217,BMY,Bristol-Myers melanoma drug boosts survival for 22 pct of patients,"Sept 27 (Reuters) - Yervoy, the melanoma drug sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, improves survival for around 22 percent of patients, according pooled results from 12 clinical trials to be presented by the company at a European conference this weekend. The results, from trials involving 1,861 patients, show that the number of survivors plateaus at around 3 years of treatment, with some patients so far followed for up to 10 years. “This pooled analysis is encouraging, particularly when considering that metastatic melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer and historically, average survival was just six to nine months,” Dr. F. Stephen Hodi, of Boston’s Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, said in a statement. Yervoy, also known as ipilimumab, is designed to unleash the body’s own immune system to fight tumors. Bristol-Myers is testing the drug against a variety of other cancers, including those of the lung, stomach and ovaries. The company said last month that initial results from a late-stage trial showed that Yervoy failed to significantly prolong survival among patients with advanced prostate cancer who had previously received chemotherapy.

219,BMY,"RPT-Immune drugs hold hope of ""clinical cure"" for deadly skin cancer","* New data on BMS drug show some patients survive 10 years * Immunotherapy drugs arm immune system to fight tumours * In some patients, disease held in check in “clinical cure” By Kate Kelland AMSTERDAM, Sept 27 (Reuters) - A new generation of drugs designed to trigger the immune system to fight cancer is offering the prospect of a “clinical cure” for some melanoma skin cancer patients who until a few years ago were more likely to be facing a swift death. Cancer specialists gathering for a European conference at the weekend said the so-called immunotherapy drugs, a class led by Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy, or ipilimumab, have transformed an area of oncology in which until recently doctors barely had time to get to know their patients. Stephen Hodi, assistant professor of medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in the United States, said he was cautious about using the term cure, but described recent advances as a “paradigm shift”. At the least, he said, the success of this new generation of medicines means some melanoma patients would now be living with a chronic disease, rather than facing imminent death. “This is a really amazing time ... A few years ago we could never have imagined using the C-word, cure, in melanoma,” he said. “But we are headed that way.” “Ipilimumab opened a door, and now the field is moving extremely fast,” he told Reuters at the European Cancer Congress (ECC) in Amsterdam. Yervoy, approved by regulators in 2011, was hailed as a breakthrough treatment in melanoma after it became the first drug ever to extend survival in patients with advanced forms of the melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. A type of drug known as a human monoclonal antibody, it activates the body’s immune system to fight the cancer by targeting a protein receptor called Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4, or CTLA-4. On average, Yervoy added only about four months of life in pivotal trials, but around 20 percent of patients had an impressively durable response to the drug. Hodi presented new data at the ECC from the largest and longest study of overall survival for patients treated with Yervoy which showed some of them can survive for up to 10 years. Alexander Eggermont of the Institut Gustave Roussy Comprehensive Cancer Center in France, who specialises in the treatment of melanoma, said Hodi’s results suggested some patients could be effectively cured of their cancer - a concept known as a “clinical cure” - with the drug helping the immune to keep the disease in check. “Patients apparently can keep residual tumours under control for a long time when the immune system is properly ‘reset’, and the concept of ‘clinical cures’ becomes a reality,” he said in a statement to the conference. And with a next generation of immunotherapy drugs - designed to disable proteins called PD1 and PDL1 that prevent the immune system from spotting and attacking cancer cells - already being tested alone and in combination with Yervoy, there is “tremendous promise” in the treatment of melanoma, said Hodi. Bristol-Myers Squibb is conducting late stage trials of its next-generation drug, nivolumab, in advanced melanoma, while rival U.S. drugmaker Merck is developing a competitor, lambrolizumab, which in early-stage trials helped shrink tumours in 38 percent of advanced melanoma patients. Swiss drugmaker Roche’s also has a leading contender - MPDL3280A - in this class. “These (Yervoy) survival results could even double or triple with anti-PD1/PDL1 monoclonal antibodies, and metastatic melanoma could become a curable disease for perhaps more than 50 percent of patients over the coming five to 10 years,” Eggermont said.",9282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cancer-melanoma-immunotherapy/rpt-immune-drugs-hold-hope-of-clinical-cure-for-deadly-skin-cancer-idUSL5N0HN2IH20130928
220,BMY,Ex-Bristol-Myers executive gets one year in prison for insider trading,"(Reuters) - A former Bristol-Myers Squibb Co finance executive who pleaded guilty to insider trading was sentenced on Wednesday to one year and one day in prison, federal prosecutors said. Robert Ramnarine of East Brunswick, New Jersey, admitted in June to one count of securities fraud for trading in Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc stock options before Bristol-Myers agreed to buy the biotechnology company in June 2012 for $5.3 billion. Prosecutors accused the 46-year-old Ramnarine of making $311,361 of illegal profit from options trading in Amylin and two other companies that Bristol-Myers sought to buy. Investigators said he learned about the takeovers while working in Bristol-Myers’ pension and savings investments office in Princeton, New Jersey, and did Internet searches on detecting insider trading prior to some of his trades. Ramnarine had worked for the New York-based drugmaker for 15 years, ending as assistant treasurer for capital markets. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey announced the sentencing of Ramnarine by U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson in Trenton, New Jersey. Thompson also sentenced Ramnarine to serve two years of supervised release and pay a $10,000 fine, Fishman said. The defendant also forfeited $324,777, which includes interest, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a parallel civil case. Ramnarine had faced 30 months to 37 months in prison under recommended federal sentencing guidelines, but prosecutors agreed to a shorter term because of his health, according to Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Fishman. “Mr. Ramnarine is gratified that the court imposed a sentence significantly below that recommended by the sentencing guidelines,” his lawyer Douglas Jensen said in an email. “He has fully disgorged the profits from the trading at issue, and accepts the Court’s judgment.” The cases are U.S. v.

222,BMY,"Bristol beats forecasts, but blood-clot drug disappoints","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, fueled by strong sales of cancer and diabetes drugs, but weak demand for its new Eliquis blood clot medicine dampened investor enthusiasm. The company on Wednesday said it earned $692 million, or 42 cents per share in the third quarter. That compared with a loss of $711 million, or 43 cents per share, in the year-earlier period when the company took a big charge for an experimental hepatitis C drug that showed disappointing results in clinical trials. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 46 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 44 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Eliquis, which was approved in December to prevent strokes caused by an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, posted sales of $41 million. Analysts said that was a disappointing showing for a drug expected to eventually claim annual sales of $5 billion or more. “Eliquis is working against Bristol at the moment,” Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark said, but added that overall company results were “solid.” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said many investors are becoming nervous about the slow ramp-up for Eliquis, a twice-daily pill sold in partnership with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). It was approved on the heels of two other new blood clot preventers that have become blockbuster products, Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim and Xarelto from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). Xarelto is favored by many patients because it is only taken once a day. “But we think Eliquis will eventually be the leader because of its superior data” from clinical trials, Conover said, referring to Eliquis’ ability to prolong lives of patients - a finding not seen in trials of Pradaxa and Xarelto. Global Bristol-Myers revenue rose 9 percent to $4.07 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $3.99 billion. The company reaffirmed it expects earnings for full-year 2013 of $1.70 to $1.78 per share, excluding special items. It earned $1.99 per share last year. Diabetes drug Onglyza and a related drug called Kombiglyze had combined sales of $211 million, up 19 percent from the year-ago period. Sales of Orencia, for rheumatoid arthritis, rose 22 percent to $375 million. Sales of leukemia drug Sprycel jumped 20 percent to $316 million, while sales of Yervoy - a new type of treatment for melanoma that works by spurring the immune system - soared 33 percent to $238 million. Double-digit sales gains of such newer drugs helped offset plunging sales of blood clot preventer Plavix, and blood pressure medicine Avapro, which are both facing competition from cheaper generics. The company’s shares fell 1.4 percent to $49.01 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a moderate downturn for the drug sector.

226,BMY,Bristol seeks Japan approval of all-oral hepatitis C treatment,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co has filed with Japanese health regulators seeking approval of its experimental all-oral combination of hepatitis C treatments, the U.S. drugmaker said on Saturday. The submission with Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency marks the first time that any drugmaker has filed for approval of a hepatitis C treatment regimen that does not include either of the standard older treatments - the injected, difficult-to-tolerate interferon, or ribavirin, a pill. Gilead Sciences Inc, widely seen as the leader in a crowded race to develop highly effective, interferon-free treatments for the serious liver disease, has sought U.S. approval of its highly regarded anti-viral drug sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel last week voted unanimously to recommend its approval. The Bristol-Myers filing was based on data from a Phase III study of Japanese patients who either could not tolerate interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms, or those who had previously failed to be helped by treatment with the older drugs - a particularly tough-to-treat patient population. Patients in the trial were given a combination of daclatasvir, from a promising new class of drugs called NS5A inhibitors, and the protease inhibitor asunaprevir for 24 weeks. Those who had no detectable levels of the virus in their blood 24 weeks after completing the therapy were deemed to be cured, a measure known as SVR24, for sustained virologic response. The overall cure rate in the 222-patient study was 84.7 percent, according to the data to be presented next week at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Washington. Of those who were either ineligible for or intolerant of treatment with interferon, the cure rate was 87.4 percent, while 80.5 percent of past nonresponders to the older drugs were deemed cured. “The Phase III study results of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir are exciting to see, especially in this difficult-to-treat patient population,” Kazuaki Chayama, the study’s lead investigator from Hiroshima University, said in a statement. Twenty-eight patients dropped out of the study - a 12.6 percent discontinuation rate - and about 6 percent, or 13 patients, reported serious side effects, primarily elevated liver enzymes, an indication of inflammation. Bristol-Myers has made Japan a particular focus of its all-oral efforts at tackling the hepatitis C virus, which if left untreated can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer or the need for a transplant. About 1.2 million people in Japan suffer from hepatitis C. The patients tend to be older than those in other developed countries and about 70 percent have Genotype 1b, a form of the virus with very low response rates to the older treatments. Several other companies are also developing all-oral hepatitis C treatments, including AbbVie Inc, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson, and expect to be able to shorten treatment duration to 12 weeks from the current 24- or 48-week regimens. Bristol early next year plans to begin Phase III testing of an all-oral, three-drug combination that adds BMS791325 - a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor - to the two drugs tested in the Japanese study. The company envisions that its three-drug therapy will involve one combination pill taken twice a day for a 12-week course of treatment. About 170 million people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis C virus. Some analysts believe the market for all-oral hepatitis C treatments could reach $20 billion as many more people get tested for the virus, given new testing recommendations, very high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and tolerable side effects seen with the newer drugs in clinical trials. It is believed that tens of thousands of hepatitis C patients have delayed treatment while awaiting the new drugs expected to start reaching the market next year in order to avoid the unpleasant side effects of interferon. Physicians would also like to see regimens that do not require ribavirin, which can cause anemia, rash and other side effects.

228,BMY,Bristol to stop early research in three disease areas,"Nov 7 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday that it would no longer conduct research to discover new drugs for hepatitis C, diabetes and neuroscience, but will increase spending on medicines that harness the immune system to fight cancer. Company spokeswoman Laura Hortas said the shift in its research and development focus was “slight” and not geared toward cost cuts. But she said 70 to 75 R&D; positions will be eliminated, or less than 1 percent of its research workforce. The company, in an emailed statement, said it will continue with all ongoing late-stage trials of its medicines, including treatments for hepatitis C, and with trials exploring new potential uses of its drugs that are already on the market. Hortas said early-stage trials of some neuroscience drugs might be scrapped, although Bristol-Myers will continue with one such trial involving the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Otherwise, she said ongoing early-stage and mid-stage trials of its many medicines will continue as planned. The company said it will continue to conduct discovery research, meaning the earliest stages of research before drugs are tested in people, to find new treatments for HIV, hepatitis B, heart failure, oncology, immunoscience and fibrotic diseases. “We are focusing our R&D; organization on delivering the opportunities where the value is greatest to patients,” Francis Cuss, Bristol-Myers’ chief scientific officer said. Bristol-Myers is considered a leader in the field of immuno-oncology, in which drugs are used to unlock the immune system to go after cancer cells. Its approved Yervoy treatment for melanoma has provided durable benefits to patients, and the company aims to eventually pair the drug with other therapies that also harness the immune system. Rival drugmakers are also racing to develop immuno-oncology medicines, which industry analysts expect to garner eventual combined annual sales of up to $50 billion.",11072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristolmyers-research/bristol-to-stop-early-research-in-three-disease-areas-idUSL2N0IS2QX20131107
229,BMY,AstraZeneca could buy Bristol stake in diabetes JV: analyst,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca may seek to increase its stake in a diabetes joint venture with Bristol-Myers Squibb, following a decision by the U.S. firm to exit diabetes drug research, according to Citi. Bristol said on Thursday it would no longer conduct research to discover new drugs for diabetes, hepatitis C and neuroscience, but will increase spending on medicines that harness the immune system to fight cancer. That refocusing suggests Bristol could seek to sell its share in the non-U.S. part of the diabetes joint venture to its partner AstraZeneca, Citi analyst Andrew Baum said in a note on Friday. Citi estimated Bristol’s stake in the business outside the United States could be worth $4 billion to $6 billion and the acquisition would boost AstraZeneca’s earnings per share by between 1 percent and 5 percent over the medium term. A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca, Britain’s second biggest drugmaker, said the company did not comment on speculation. The Bristol-AstraZeneca diabetes joint venture includes the oral medicines Onglyza, Kombiglyze and Forxiga, as well as the injectable treatments Bydureon and Byetta. Demand for many of these products has been relatively slow to build up and Forxiga was rejected by U.S. regulators in 2012.

231,BMY,"Bristol drug for fat disorder may work, but risky -FDA staff","Dec 9 (Reuters) - An experimental Bristol-Myers drug to treat rare and potentially fatal disorders involving loss of body fat appears effective for some patients although with considerable safety risks, staff members of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday. The staff observations were posted on the FDA Website ahead of a planned meeting on Wednesday by a panel of medical experts, who will advise the FDA on the drug, called metreleptin. The briefing document, meant to flag potential safety concerns about the drug, noted it has been tested since 2000 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Bristol-Myers, which has commercial rights to the medicine, is awaiting U.S. approval for metreleptin, to treat diabetes and/or lipodystrophy, a group of rare acquired or inherited disorders associated with loss of body fat. Only a few thousand people worldwide are believed to have the disorders, in which fat builds up in the blood and organs such as liver and muscle, and can lead to diabetes, pancreatitis and fatty liver disease. There are no approved drugs to treat underlying causes of the disease, including deficiencies of the human hormone leptin that occur with loss of fat tissue under the skin. Metreleptin is a form of leptin meant to reduce accumulation of fat in organs, and thereby better control blood sugar and high levels of triglyercides - a type of fat in the bloodstream. Bristol-Myers is developing it in partnership with AstraZeneca Plc. The FDA briefing document noted that all patients in the NIH trial received metreleptin, and there was no separate group receiving placebos. Without a placebo group, it is “challenging to attribute beneficial changes to metreleptin” versus improvements in diet or improved compliance in taking other medicines, the document said. “Nevertheless, a subgroup of patients appears to have achieved benefits from metreleptin that would be unlikely to have been achieved spontaneously,” the report said, including normalization of metabolic control. Benefits were most apparent in patients who had uncontrolled diabetes. Safety of the drug is hard to gauge, the report said, given the array of medical problems that patients with the disorders already have and the possibility that metreleptin may worsen certain conditions. It cited concerns about potentially higher risks of lymphoma, immune-related reactions, hypoglycemia, pancreatitis and liver abnormalities. “It is important to ensure that the appropriate patient population is targeted, given the serious risks that may be associated with the drug,” the briefing report said.

238,BMY,FDA panel backs Bristol diabetes drug after prior rejection,"(Reuters) - By a lopsided vote of 13 to 1, an independent committee of medical experts voted on Thursday to recommend approval of a new type of diabetes drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb that U.S. regulators rejected two years ago due to safety concerns. The advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the benefits of the medicine, called dapaglifozin, appear to outweigh its risks. Bristol-Myers is developing the drug, which is already approved in Europe, in partnership with AstraZeneca Plc. The FDA typically follows the advice of its advisory panels, but is under no obligation to do so. In another vote, by 10 to 4, the panel found the drug appeared to have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile. The FDA rejected the medicine in January 2012 after a previous medical advisory panel said clinical data did not provide enough certainty about its cancer and heart risks. Some members of the panel, in a day-long meeting on Thursday, expressed concern that 10 patients taking dapaglifozin in a large trial were later diagnosed with bladder cancer. But other panel members said six of those cases occurred within months after treatment began, and were therefore probably not related to the drug because the cancer typically takes years to develop. Others noted that the overall incidence of all cancers in patients taking dapaglifozin was similar to the overall incidence seen in patients who received placebos. “I don’t think we can dismiss it,” referring to the bladder cancer risk, said panel member Dr. Milton Packer, a cardiologist and chairman of clinical sciences with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Packer said he was counting on the FDA to require the possible bladder risk to be included in the drug’s package insert label. “I actually really like this drug,” Packer said, noting that the diabetes drug lowers blood pressure and causes weight loss, unlike many diabetes drugs that cause weight gain. Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca Plc in July resubmitted their U.S. marketing application for dapaglifozin for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes that is highly linked to obesity. The revised application included data from several new studies and additional long-term data from studies previously submitted to the FDA. The drug blocks SGLT2, a protein that works independently of insulin to lower blood sugar. By blocking the kidney from reabsorbing blood sugar, the drug spurs removal of glucose through the urine. Dapaglifozin is sold in Europe under the brand name Forxiga. If approved in the United States, Cowen and Co. expects the medicine to generate annual sales of $700 million by 2020, amid competition from similar drugs such as Johnson & Johnson’s recently approved Invokana (canaglifozin). Invokana stirred excitement in one large trial by controlling blood sugar better than Merck & Co’s Januvia, a blockbuster drug that belongs to a different and relatively new class of diabetes treatments called DPP4 inhibitors.

The decision to stop marketing oral drug dapagliflozin in Germany comes just a day after it was endorsed by an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The two companies said in a joint statement on Friday that the new drug, which had already been launched in Europe under the brand name Forxiga, would no longer be delivered to Germany from Dec. 15. The two companies could not agree on a price for Forxiga in negotiations with the German association of statutory medical insurers and are pulling the drug even as a round of mediation is continuing. “AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb will reconsider their decision to stop distribution of Forxiga after the mediation procedure is concluded,” they said, adding that other European countries were not affected by the move. Before price negotiations started, an advisory panel of medical experts and insurance representatives failed to see any additional benefits from the drug compared with standard treatments. Germany in 2011 started comparing the benefits of newly approved drugs with those of existing treatments and gave medical insurers more bargaining power in price talks with drug makers. This has prompted a number of companies to refrain from a market launch in Germany, such as Boehringer Ingelheim and partner Eli Lilly, who chose to not sell their diabetes drug Trajenta there.

AstraZeneca said on Thursday that it would pay Bristol an initial $2.7 billion plus up to $1.4 billion in additional regulatory and sales-related payments. The move will bulk up AstraZeneca’s thin drug portfolio and give Bristol more funds to invest in other areas, such as cancer, where it is developing promising therapies tapping into the immune system. Following the announcement shares in AstraZeneca hit an 11-year high in early morning trading before paring earlier gains to trade up 1 percent at 3,595 pence by 0935 GMT. Speculation that AstraZeneca might look to buy out Bristol was fuelled last month when the U.S.-based company decided to get out of diabetes research. The decision to quit research and now sell out of the joint venture marks a strategic reversal by Bristol, which only last year bought diabetes specialist Amylin Pharmaceuticals for $5.3 billion and folded its products into the alliance with AstraZeneca. “Today’s announcement reinforces AstraZeneca’s long-term commitment to diabetes, a core strategic area for us and an important platform for returning AstraZeneca to growth,” Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in a statement. Soriot, who took over in October last year, has focused on diabetes as a key area for growth, hoping to tap into rising demand for medicines to deal with an epidemic of the disease, which is closely tied to obesity. Buying the Bristol stake in the venture will boost his company’s sales and profits, even as Soriot continues the long-term quest to improve the pipeline of promising experimental medicines. “To us this looks a sensible deal,” Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said. “Even with a staged earn-out which could rise to $1.6 billion, the price would appear to be good business particularly as it also includes full rights to Onglyza and dapagliflozin.” For Bristol, the deal means it will become an even more focused specialist drugmaker. In a separate announcement, Bristol said it would raise its quarterly dividend by about 3 percent starting in the first quarter of next year, resulting in an indicative full-year payout of $1.44 per share. The share price closed on Wednesday at $52.59. The U.S.-based company, which will continue to receive royalty payments from the diabetes unit through to 2025, forecast that earnings per share in 2014 would be between $1.65  and $1.80, broadly in line with the $1.70 to $1.78 it is forecasting for this year. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note that a price of $4 billion would imply a multiple of 4.8 times sales for the half of the joint venture that AstraZeneca does not already own. AstraZeneca said the acquisition, which it will finance from existing cash resources and short-term credit facilities, would be neutral to its core earnings in 2014. A worse than expected performance by Bydureon, one of the diabetes treatments, prompted AstraZeneca to also say that it would incur a non-core impairment charge of around $1.7 billion. The Bristol-AstraZeneca diabetes joint venture includes the oral medicines Onglyza, Kombiglyze and Forxiga, as well as the injectable treatments Bydureon and Byetta.

245,BMY,AstraZeneca to buy Bristol out of diabetes venture for up to $4.1 billion,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) has agreed to buy Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) stake in the companies’ diabetes joint venture for up to $4.1 billion in a deal that will help return the group to growth, sending its shares to a new high. AstraZeneca said on Thursday that it would pay Bristol an initial $2.7 billion plus up to $1.4 billion in additional regulatory and sales-related payments.

249,BMY,Pace of Bristol-Myers' cancer trial spooks investors,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Friday reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results, but its shares fell because of investors’ jitters about the pace at which the company is developing a promising new combination of cancer drugs. The stock dropped as much as 6.7 percent after company officials said on a conference call with investors that they were not yet planning a late-stage trial that would combine two of its high-profile drugs as a treatment for lung cancer. Instead, Bristol-Myers said it would continue a mid-stage study of the drugs - an experimental medicine called nivolumab and an approved melanoma treatment called Yervoy - before moving them into a larger Phase III lung cancer trial. Both drugs enhance the immune system’s ability to fight cancer. “Many investors expected Bristol-Myers to rapidly advance the Nivo-Yervoy combo to Phase III, with the plans for such a move perhaps being announced as early as today,” BMO analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. The company’s slower timetable might be interpreted as a sign of caution or suggest a lack of “synergy” between the two drugs when targeting lung cancer, he said. Results of the mid-stage trial, called Checkmate-012, are expected to be released at a cancer meeting in late May or early June. “We believe today’s news is incrementally positive for Merck & Co,” (MRK.N) Arfaei said, which is developing a rival drug in the same PD-1 inhibitor class as nivolumab. Shares of Bristol were down 3.7 percent at $51.93 in afternoon trading after dropping as low as $50.35. Merck was up 0.2 percent at $51.71 amid a sharp downturn for the broad stock market. In announcing its fourth-quarter results, Bristol-Myers said it had benefited from cost cuts and growing sales of its treatments for cancer, blood clots and diabetes. Sales increased sharply for Eliquis, a closely watched new blood clot preventer, but the product is off to a far slower start than Wall Street had hoped. Eliquis, which is used to prevent strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat condition called atrial fibrillation, generated sales of $71 million, up from $41 million in the prior quarter. But when the pill was approved in late 2012, analysts had predicted sales would eventually reach $3 billion to $5 billion a year. “We’re waiting for Eliquis to hit an inflection point, but it hasn’t hit that big pop yet,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “It will still get there, to $5 billion.” Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers markets with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), proved safer and more effective in clinical trials than the standard oral treatment, warfarin, in preventing strokes among patients with atrial fibrillation. Many patients instead are taking two new blood clot preventers that were approved before Eliquis - Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim and Xarelto from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). But many industry analysts and doctors consider Eliquis to be the best of the new crop of oral agents. Other Bristol-Myers drugs that stood out in the quarter include Yervoy, whose sales rose 23 percent to $260 million, and leukemia treatment Sprycel, whose sales jumped 30 percent to $365 million. And sales of HIV treatment Sustiva increased 11 percent to $427 million. The company reported quarterly earnings of $726 million, or 44 cents per share. That compares with $925 million, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when it took a big write-off for a failed hepatitis C drug. Excluding special items, the profit was 51 cents per share, above the analysts’ average estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 6 percent to $4.44 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $4.3 billion. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses fell 7 percent, and research spending shrank 12 percent. “Bristol-Myers’ execution on cost structure continues to impress, with lower-than-expected spending” that helped the company handily beat earnings estimates, Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said. Bristol said it still expected 2014 earnings of $1.65 to $1.80 per share, excluding special items. The forecast assumes current foreign exchange rates and the closing of a deal with British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) in the first quarter. AstraZeneca last month agreed to buy Bristol-Myers’ stake in a longstanding diabetes joint venture between the two drugmakers for an initial $2.7 billion, up to $1.4 billion in additional milestone payments, and royalties on net sales through 2025. The joint venture includes oral medicines Onglyza, Kombiglyze and Forxiga, as well as injectable treatments Bydureon and Byetta.

The drug has been approved as a replacement therapy to treat complications caused by leptin hormone deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.

Leptin deficiency causes serious imbalance in the body, leading to fat accumulation in muscles and organs such as the liver. The deficiency can lead to diabetes, pancreatitis and fatty liver disease. The drug, Myalept (metreleptin), is a form of leptin meant to reduce accumulation of fat in organs to better control blood sugar and high levels of triglycerides - a type of fat in the bloodstream associated with increased risk of heart disease.

263,BMY,Bristol-Myers hepatitis C treatment cures up to 90 percent: study,"(Reuters) - A combination of two anti-viral drugs developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co cured 90 percent of previously untreated hepatitis C patients and 82 percent of those who failed to respond to prior therapy, according to results from a late stage study presented on Thursday. The Phase III trial of more than 700 patients called Hallmark-Dual tested a combination of Bristol’s daclatasvir and asunaprevir over 24 weeks of therapy in patients with genotype 1b of the virus that causes progressive liver disease. The cure rate was also 82 percent among patients unable to tolerate treatment with the older standard drugs interferon and ribavirin and 84 percent in patients who had cirrhosis, which accounted for nearly a third of those in the trial. Patients for whom the virus was undetectable in the blood 12 weeks after completing 24 weeks of treatment were deemed to have achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured. “Not only was the daclatasvir and asunaprevir regimen highly effective among study participants, it was also very well tolerated, even among sicker patients with more advanced liver disease,” Professor Michael Manns, the study’s lead investigator from Hannover Medical School in Germany, said in a statement. The study results were presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in London. Genotype 1 is the most prevalent and considered the most difficult to treat form of the virus. Genotype 1b tends to be more common in Europe and 1a is more widely seen in the United States. Several drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences Inc, AbbVie and Merck & Co are developing a new generation of all-oral hepatitis C treatments that do not include interferon or ribavirin, which cause miserable side effects that have led thousands of patients to put off treatment to wait for the highly touted new drugs. In clinical trials, the new drugs have demonstrated cure rates in excess of 90 percent while cutting treatment duration to 12 weeks with few side effects, leading to Wall Street forecasts of multibillion-dollar annual sales in what is shaping up to be a fiercely competitive market. Prior to the recent approval of the first of Gilead’s new drugs, standard treatments cured about 75 percent of patients and required either 24 or 48 weeks of therapy. Bristol this week applied for U.S. approval of the two drug combination and said it expects to file for approval of a three-drug combination early next year. Based on earlier studies, Bristol’s three-drug combination is likely to further boost cure rates with 12 weeks of treatment, which would be more competitive to results seen so far from rival drugmakers. Patients in the Hallmark-Dual trial received 60 mg of daclatasvir once a day and 100 mg of asunaprevir twice daily. The drugs belong to new classes of medicines that work in different ways to prevent the virus from replicating. The discontinuation rate due to adverse side effects was between 1 and 3 percent, the company said. Headache was the most common side effect, and serious side effects, such as elevations in liver enzymes, were seen in 5 percent to 7 percent of patients. Liver enzyme elevations were reversible and resolved following treatment, the company said. About 170 million people are believed to be infected with hepatitis C worldwide. If left untreated the disease can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or need for a liver transplant.

Excluding gains from the recent sale of its diabetes drug business to longtime partner AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and other special items, Bristol-Myers earned 46 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters Bristol-Myers said it would begin its U.S. marketing application for lung cancer treatment nivolumab within a few days but would not complete the “rolling submission” of clinical trial data until the end of the year. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said the prolonged submission process implied a slight delay and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might be requiring more clarity on results from of the study. “Bristol-Myers would not provide details on what exactly the FDA might want to see,” Anderson said in a research note. But the company, in a conference call with industry analysts, said trial results suggested there were lasting responses to nivolumab among patients receiving it. Deemed a potential blockbuster, nivolumab is a member of a promising new class of cancer treatments called PD1 inhibitors, which allow the immune system to recognize cancer cells and go after them. Despite the year-end timeline for completing the marketing application, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said he remained confident in nivolumab and other immuno-oncology drugs that have become Bristol-Myers’ biggest focus. “In our view, nivolumab development and the broader immuno-oncology opportunity remain the core story for Bristol-Myers shares,” Schott said.

271,BMY,"UPDATE 1-Bristol, Merck, Roche immune therapies are cancer meeting focus","(Adds more information on Bristol-Myers Phase III plan in final paragraph) By Bill Berkrot May 14 (Reuters) - When the world’s leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight. The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor’s ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. They have shown great promise against advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers - as well as advanced lung and kidney cancers, with relatively mild side effects, generating  excitement among researchers and investors. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago beginning May 30, researchers will for the first time present data on Roche’s anti-PDL1 drug in advanced bladder cancer for which there have been few advances in decades. Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer. Brief summaries, or abstracts, of thousands of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday. “This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. “Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies.” The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers  anti PD-1 drug nivolumab. Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years. Three-year survival with advanced melanoma was virtually unheard of prior to the advent of cancer immunotherapy. In a trial of patients whose advanced kidney cancer had progressed following prior treatments, the mean overall survival was 25.5 months for the 2 milligram nivolumab dose. Past kidney cancer studies of drugs currently in use have demonstrated a mean survival of about 14 months, said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of global development for nivolumab. As drugmakers face greater scrutiny over how they price new therapies - with immuno-oncology expected to be among the most expensive - several studies will aim to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the new treatments. Researchers can now perform a test to determine the degree to which the PD-L1 protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. On a 0 to 3 scale, a score of 0 or 1 is considered PD-L1 negative, while 2 or 3 is deemed PD-L1 positive. If early data is confirmed in larger trials, this class of immunotherapies could become standalone treatments for some patients, while PD-L1 negative patients may require combination or alternative therapies, according to some researchers. In a small, Phase I study of Bristol’s nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, five out of 10 PD-L1 positive patients saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. No such responses were seen among 7 PD-L1 negative patients. Roche also saw half of the 20 PD-L1 positive patients in its bladder cancer trial respond to its drug. Namouni said Bristol would focus on PD-L1 positive patients only in a large Phase III lung cancer trial of previously untreated subjects. Its Phase III studies of those who had received prior treatments will include PD-L1 negative patients.

272,BMY,"Bristol, Merck, Roche immune therapies are cancer meeting darlings","May 14 (Reuters) - When the world’s leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight. The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor’s ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. They have shown great promise against advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers - as well as advanced lung and kidney cancers, with relatively mild side effects, generating  excitement among researchers and investors. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago beginning May 30, researchers will for the first time present data on Roche’s anti-PDL1 drug in advanced bladder cancer for which there have been few advances in decades. Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer. Brief summaries, or abstracts, of hundreds of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday. “This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. “Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies.” The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers  anti PD-1 drug nivolumab. Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years.

273,BMY,"CORRECTED-INSIGHT-RPT-Insurers scrutinize drug costs after $84,000 Sovaldi surprise","(Corrects to Reimbursement Intelligence from Intelligence Reimbursement, to Whang as co-president from president, to Steve Miller from Stuart Miller) By Caroline Humer and Deena Beasley NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, May 28 (Reuters) - Shocked by the rapid adoption of a new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, U.S. health insurers are trying to make sure they aren’t blindsided by other drugs being developed and are looking for ways to limit their use from the day they are launched. Manufacturer Gilead Sciences Inc says 30,000 people have received hepatitis drug Sovaldi so far, and that sales hit a record-breaking $2.3 billion within a few months. The treatment, typically 84 pills taken over 12 weeks, completely cures the disease in more than 90 percent of patients. As many as 3.2 million Americans are infected by hepatitis C, and the cost of giving most of them Sovaldi would surpass $200 billion. Some insurers have already put conditions on who can get the drug, and states including California and Texas have slowed or put treatment on hold while they study what to do. Insurers warned that these unforeseen costs will cut 2014 earnings and require rate hikes. Now, at industry conferences, in conversations with investors, and in private, they are pushing Gilead’s rivals, a group that includes AbbVie Inc , Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , to discount their own new hepatitis C treatments when they come to market starting this fall. Such a high-profile campaign by insurers before drugs are even approved is new. They are also signaling they will restrict who can get coverage for new cholesterol drugs being developed by Amgen Inc , Pfizer Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA. By law, insurers cannot deny access to new drugs if they represent a real improvement for patients, leaving drug companies with the upper hand in most price discussions. When comparable competitors, or a generic version is on the market about a decade later, insurers have room to steer patients away from the new drugs, and pharmaceutical companies cut prices steeply and give big discounts. But insurers have not faced such a highly effective drug aimed at a widespread disease that is so expensive and so quickly adopted. The previous record for a drug reaching blockbuster status was set in 2011, when hepatitis C therapy Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals raked in $1.56 billion for the entire year. Sovaldi has sold more in a quarter of the time. As a result, insurers are taking a harder line on which patients should get Sovaldi, based on the drug’s clinical data. Sovaldi is “game-changing” for insurers’ thinking, said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, a consulting firm that helps pharmaceutical companies set prices. The only way for them to respond is to control the volume of treatment used, he said. In a sign of how serious the industry has become, the largest insurer lobby group last week took Gilead to task at a public conference. “The company in this case is asking for a blank check and you can’t give anyone anymore a blank check because it will blow up family budgets, state Medicaid budgets, employer costs and wreak havoc on the federal debt,” said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans. Gilead argues that Sovaldi’s price is worth it, since it will replace even costlier spending on hospital visits and treatments for cirrhosis or liver failure. It has not budged on price for the hepatitis C drug, although Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, acknowledged that insurers are going to start negotiating. U.S. drug spending reached a record $329 billion in 2013, driven by a double-digit increase in prices for new cancer, HIV and hepatitis C therapies. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, expects spending on such specialty drugs to rise an additional 63 percent from 2014 to 2016, driven by an 1,800 percent increase in hepatitis C drug costs. Successful drugs can cost $1 billion to bring to market, including spending on research, development and marketing. Supporters of drug companies say big advances necessitate high prices. “We are the only country in the world that pays exorbitant prices to provide innovation first here, but that’s what we need and that’s what the American people have come to expect,” said Richard Burr, a Republican Senator from North Carolina who has spent decades working on bipartisan health bills. Hepatitis C complications can take years to develop, which gives insurers and government health agencies leeway to determine when treatment should start. Many insurers, which manage most of the 150 million people covered by employer-based plans as well as some government Medicare and Medicaid plans, require patients to get authorization before using Sovaldi. Some limit the drug to patients with a certain genetic type of the disease. Express Scripts has been pushing for all but the sickest patients to wait for new therapies that are expected to compete head-to-head with Sovaldi late this year. It is also pressing rival manufacturers for low prices, hoping to avoid the shock of Sovaldi, which sped through trials and regulatory approval and caught insurers by surprise. “In this particular case there was very little discussion pre-launch. But other companies are now already discussing potential future price points in response,” said Steve Miller, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer. AbbVie and Merck both declined to comment on whether discussions with insurers about their new drugs were underway. Gilead, which says it discussed the Sovaldi launch with insurers, is in talks over which patients should be treated with its next hepatitis C pill. That will be a two-drug combination that will eliminate the need for a companion drug that nearly doubles Sovaldi’s current total cost. Industry analysts expect the company will price it closer to Sovaldi’s $84,000 than to the $150,000 cost of a combination of Sovaldi and a Johnson & Johnson drug that some doctors prescribe. Mick Kolassa, chairman of pricing consultancy Medical Marketing Economics, in Oxford, Mississippi, who advises pharma companies, says insurers are being aggressive. “We are seeing some of them step up and flex their muscles,” he said. More scrutiny of new pricing is likely ahead as the country comes to terms with how it should pay for expensive drugs, according to John Castellani, Chief Executive Officer of leading drug industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Sovaldi has shown that patients are bearing too much of the drug’s costs because of rising co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, he told Reuters, laying the blame on factors controlled by insurance companies. But patient advocates are not choosing sides yet, which may have the effect of giving insurers room for action. “I think the fault lies with both the for-profit insurers and the drug companies,” said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at the San Francisco-based Project Inform, which advocates for hepatitis C patients. The system has not changed to reflect the impact of new effective, expensive drugs, she said. The next big price battle centers on a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which help the liver to clear “bad” LDL cholesterol from the blood. Large-scale studies show the new drugs can help patients who cannot tolerate, or get enough benefit from, the most widely-used cholesterol drugs, statins. The PCSK9 therapies are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the price of statins sold as generics. Drugmakers are expected to push for the new medicines to be used by 7 million to 20 million people, or up to 30 percent of the 71 million Americans with high cholesterol. Insurers already are questioning whether the estimates of use are legitimate. “There is really no need to take these new medications and spread them out across a larger community of people who will respond to existing treatments, many of which are generic,” Aetna Inc’s National Medical Director for Pharmacy Policy Ed Pezalla said in an interview.

275,BMY,U.S. to test immunotherapy drugs on newly diagnosed brain tumors,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. researchers are finalizing plans to test two immunotherapy drugs made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on patients newly diagnosed with the most common form of deadly brain tumors in adults. Dr. Mark Gilbert, a leading brain tumor researcher at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said he got approval last Tuesday from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to start designing the trial, likely to begin this fall, with the melanoma drug Yervoy and an experimental drug called nivolumab. The trial will be run through the nonprofit NRG Oncology, an NCI sponsored cooperative group of cancer researchers.  “We’re really excited about them,” said Gilbert, who spoke in an interview at the American Society of Clinical Oncology  meeting in Chicago. The hope, he said, is that the drugs, which ramp up the immune system to fight cancer, will prove effective in treating the brain tumors known as glioblastomas. Researchers are already testing Bristol’s nivolumab in patients with a glioblastoma that has come back after standard treatment, which involves surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Michael Giordano, head of development for oncology and immunology at Bristol-Myers, said the company’s trial in recurrent glioblastoma is part of its push to test the potential of immunotherpies in a broad range of cancers. Gilbert said he has met with company officials, who still need to give written approval for their drugs to be used in the government-backed study. Initially, the trial in newly diagnosed patients will test the safety of the drugs in some 42 patients, Gilbert said. One concern is that bolstering the immune system in the brain could trigger an autoimmune reaction known as encephalitis, causing swelling and worsening patients’ symptoms.  But so far, the studies in patients with recurrent tumors have not shown that to be a major issue, Gilbert said. “We have to take it slow. We want to understand what we’re doing,” he said.  What is challenging about brain tumors is getting active treatments through a protective membrane called the blood-brain barrier. A major study led by Gilbert, reported at last year’s American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, showed Roche’s antibody drug Avastin failed to prolong life in patients with newly diagnosed disease. But early studies of immunotherapy in melanoma showed the treatments did shrink tumors in patients whose cancer has spread to the brain, suggesting that immune system cells were reaching their target in the brain and raising hope for immunotherapy treatments. Gilbert acknowledged that research on brain tumors has lagged some other fields, especially with new immune system therapies, but he sees that changing. Glioblastomas are the most common and most deadly form of brain and nervous system tumors, which affect an estimated 240,000 adults globally per year. With standard treatments,  average survival is 15 to 17 months.

277,BMY,"Bristol's Yervoy, alone or in combo, improves melanoma results: studies","(Reuters) - New data on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s melanoma drug Yervoy, including updated results from an effort to combine it with another promising cancer immunotherapy, suggest it can improve treatment for patients with both advanced and slightly earlier stage disease, according to findings released on Monday. Yervoy, which takes natural brakes off the immune system to help it more effectively attack cancer, is approved to treat metastatic, or stage 4, melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. Cowen and Co expects the drug to capture annual sales of $1.95 billion by 2020, as it is approved in new indications and combinations with other treatments.  During the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Bristol-Myers presented several studies on Yervoy and nivolumab, its experimental cancer immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors, both as standalone treatments and in combination.  In one late-stage study on Yervoy alone, the drug reduced the risk of melanoma recurrence by 25 percent following surgery compared with a placebo. The median recurrence-free survival (RFS), or average time to disease return, following successful surgery to remove cancerous tumors was 26.1 months for Yervoy compared with 17.1 months for the placebo group. The result was deemed to be statistically significant. Patients in this study had stage 3 disease in which the cancer had spread to regional lymph nodes but not yet to other parts of the body. “This benefit was observed across all patient sub-groups, including those who were at highest risk of recurrence,” Alexander Eggermont, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement. The result could pave the way for the drug’s use earlier in the disease and boost future sales. Current treatment options to reduce the risk of recurrence following surgery are very limited, Eggermont said.  The 951-patient Phase III study was the first large trial to look at Yervoy’s effect following complete resection surgery. Overall survival data was not yet available. But three years after beginning treatment, an estimated 46.5 percent of Yervoy patients were free of disease recurrence compared with 34.8 percent in the placebo group. Nearly half of the Yervoy patients stopped treatment due to side effects, which are common with the drug, and there were five drug-related deaths, or 1.1 percent, researchers reported. Bristol shares were down 2 percent to $48.65 with some experts expressing concern about side effects. “There is a delay in recurrence, however I would argue that the delay … is comparable to interferon. And there was toxicity,” said Dr Steven O’Day, director of the Los Angeles Skin Cancer Institute, noting the five deaths. Ron Peck, Bristol’s global development leader for Yervoy, said a high 10 milligram dose was used in the study and may have contributed to the side effect rate. A 3 mg dose is being used in later studies. LONG-TERM SURVIVAL FOR COMBINATION Data from a separate, early-stage study of advanced melanoma patients demonstrated compelling survival data for Yervoy combined with nivolumab. At two years, the overall survival rate for the first 53 patients in the study was estimated to be 79 percent, down only a bit from the 85 percent survival rate reported after one year. “If this survival data is confirmed in Phase III trials, it’s unprecedented. This is really exciting data,” said Dr. Mario Sznol, a professor of medicine at Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut, and the study’s lead investigator. Among the 17 patients who received the two drug doses that Bristol chose to test in its larger, later stage trials the two-year survival rate was 88 percent.  Seventeen percent of patients in the study had a complete response, or no detectable cancer. Sznol expects that number to rise. Immunotherapy results often improve over time as the immune system learns to fight the disease. The results were consistent whether or not a patient’s tumors expressed the PD-L1 protein, which helps camouflage them against the immune system. Patients who are deemed negative for PD-L1 tend to get little benefit from drugs like nivolumab alone, suggesting the addition of Yervoy may also help them. The incidence of serious side effects among the first 53 patients in the study was about 53 percent and rose to 62 percent with an additional group of 41 more patients. There was a 23 percent discontinuation rate due to side effects and one drug-related death, researchers reported. “These toxicities really are manageable in the clinic,” Sznol said. “If you’re getting 79 percent overall survival at two years, the side effects are clearly worth it.” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei expressed disappointment about separate kidney cancer data for the combination that could be contributing to the Bristol stock downturn. “We remain uncertain that the incremental benefit of adding Yervoy to nivo is worth the additional toxicity,” he said.

In one late-stage study on Yervoy alone, the drug reduced the risk of melanoma recurrence by 25 percent following surgery compared with a placebo. The median recurrence-free survival (RFS), or average time to disease return, following successful surgery to remove cancerous tumors was 26.1 months for Yervoy compared with 17.1 months for the placebo group. The result was deemed to be statistically significant. Patients in this study had stage 3 disease in which the cancer had spread to regional lymph nodes but not yet to other parts of the body. “This benefit was observed across all patient sub-groups, including those who were at highest risk of recurrence,” Alexander Eggermont, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement. The result could pave the way for the drug’s use earlier in the disease and boost future sales. Current treatment options to reduce the risk of recurrence following surgery are very limited, Eggermont said. The 951-patient Phase III study was the first large trial to look at Yervoy’s effect following complete resection surgery. Overall survival data was not yet available. But three years after beginning treatment, an estimated 46.5 percent of Yervoy patients were free of disease recurrence compared with 34.8 percent in the placebo group. Nearly half of the Yervoy patients stopped treatment due to side effects, which are common with the drug, and there were five drug-related deaths, or 1.1 percent, researchers reported. Bristol shares were down 2 percent to $48.65 with some experts expressing concern about side effects. “There is a delay in recurrence, however I would argue that the delay  is comparable to interferon. And there was toxicity,” said Dr Steven O’Day, director of the Los Angeles Skin Cancer Institute, noting the five deaths. Ron Peck, Bristol’s global development leader for Yervoy, said a high 10 milligram dose was used in the study and may have contributed to the side effect rate. A 3 mg dose is being used in later studies. LONG-TERM SURVIVAL FOR COMBINATION Data from a separate, early-stage study of advanced melanoma patients demonstrated compelling survival data for Yervoy combined with nivolumab. At two years, the overall survival rate for the first 53 patients in the study was estimated to be 79 percent, down only a bit from the 85 percent survival rate reported after one year. “If this survival data is confirmed in Phase III trials, it’s unprecedented. This is really exciting data,” said Dr. Mario Sznol, a professor of medicine at Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut, and the study’s lead investigator. Among the 17 patients who received the two drug doses that Bristol chose to test in its larger, later stage trials the two-year survival rate was 88 percent. Seventeen percent of patients in the study had a complete response, or no detectable cancer. Sznol expects that number to rise. Immunotherapy results often improve over time as the immune system learns to fight the disease. The results were consistent whether or not a patient’s tumors expressed the PD-L1 protein, which helps camouflage them against the immune system. Patients who are deemed negative for PD-L1 tend to get little benefit from drugs like nivolumab alone, suggesting the addition of Yervoy may also help them. The incidence of serious side effects among the first 53 patients in the study was about 53 percent and rose to 62 percent with an additional group of 41 more patients. There was a 23 percent discontinuation rate due to side effects and one drug-related death, researchers reported. “These toxicities really are manageable in the clinic,” Sznol said. “If you’re getting 79 percent overall survival at two years, the side effects are clearly worth it.” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei expressed disappointment about separate kidney cancer data for the combination that could be contributing to the Bristol stock downturn. “We remain uncertain that the incremental benefit of adding Yervoy to nivo is worth the additional toxicity,” he said.

279,BMY,"Bristol's Yervoy, alone or in combo, improves melanoma results: studies","(Reuters) - New data on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s melanoma drug Yervoy, including fresh results from an effort to combine it with another promising cancer immunotherapy, suggest it can improve treatment for patients with both advanced and slightly earlier stage disease, according to findings released on Monday. Yervoy, which takes natural brakes off the immune system to help it more effectively attack cancer, is approved to treat metastatic, or stage 4, melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer.

281,BMY,A 4-week hep C cure? Bristol to test drugs with Gilead's Sovaldi,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the race to find a faster cure for hepatitis C, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said it will test its experimental antiviral drug combination with Gilead Sciences Inc’s blockbuster drug Sovaldi, hoping to cut treatment time to four weeks. Bristol-Myers disclosed plans for the exploratory 30-patient trial testing its three-drug combination with Sovaldi in an interview with Reuters. Eric Hughes, the leader of Bristol’s global hepatitis program, said the details were due to be posted on the clinicaltrials.gov website next week.  Sovaldi’s $84,000 price tag for a 12-week treatment has spurred outrage among insurers, state health officials and lawmakers who fear the cost of treating millions of Americans with the progressive liver disease will top $250 billion. Insurers are pushing Gilead’s rivals to offer lower prices when their hepatitis C medicines reach the market.  Using the drug for a shorter course of treatment could, in theory, lower the cost, even when combined with Bristol’s therapies. Rivals Merck & Co and AbbVie are also racing to develop next-generation hepatitis C treatments that cure most people of the virus in a shorter time frame. But drug pricing experts expect Gilead and its rivals may still argue that the quicker cure represents a value to patients, buffering any steep price reductions. “The position and concept of pharma is not ingredient costs or duration of treatment cost. Pharma is looking at it as cost per cure,” said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, which works with pharmaceutical companies and payers to help determine prices for medicines. The cost could come down, he said, “but it’s not going to be proportionate to the degree that the duration of treatment shortens.”  The new generation of oral drugs being developed by several companies has raised hepatitis C cure rates to well above 90 percent from about 75 percent without the need for interferon or ribavirin, which caused miserable side effects that led many patients to delay or drop treatment. The drugs in clinical trials have already cut treatment time to 12 weeks from 24 to 48 weeks.  “We got rid of the tolerability problem. We got rid of the efficacy problem. Now there is a tremendous drive to get down to shorter treatment durations,” Bristol-Myers’ Hughes said in a telephone interview. Bristol’s plan essentially revives an effort to test its drugs in combination with Sovaldi. It previously tested a single compound with Sovaldi, achieving cure rates close to 100 percent in 12 weeks. But Gilead scrapped further testing in 2012, as it  preferred to develop its own combination without a partner. Gilead’s pill that combines Sovaldi with its ledipasvir is expected to gain U.S. approval this year for therapies of eight or 12 weeks, depending on the patient. The company is also testing the combination as a six-week treatment. The go-it-alone strategy has already paid off as Gilead was first to market with Sovaldi, breaking pharmaceutical industry sales records with $2.3 billion in sales within a few months.  The new study, set to begin in late July, will test a trio of Bristol drugs with Sovaldi in previously untreated patients with the most common Genotype 1 form of the virus. It will involve two groups of 15 patients each - one getting four weeks of treatment and the other six.  If Bristol can demonstrate cure rates in excess of 90 percent in four weeks, it plans to conduct larger trials with a more diverse patient population. “We’ll see what the data says,” Hughes said. “Taking this forward will be a very exciting thing.”        With Gilead not involved in the effort, Bristol will pay full price for Sovaldi to conduct the trial. Bristol would not discuss potential pricing of its regimen, since its drugs are not approved. But if treatment can be cut to four weeks from 12, the Sovaldi portion would be closer to $28,000.  Other rivals are also advancing efforts to compete in what is expected to be a huge market. Merck this month agreed to pay $3.85 billion to acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc with the hope that combining the two companies’ most promising drugs will produce cures in four to six weeks across the full spectrum of genotypes. U.S. and European health regulators in the last week said they would accelerate their reviews of AbbVie’s four-drug regimen, meaning it could be vying for market share by early next year.

283,BMY,UPDATE 1-Bristol immunotherapy prolongs survival in melanoma trial,"(Add share price move, background) June 24 (Reuters) - A late-stage trial testing Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s  cancer immunotherapy nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients was halted early after it was determined that the drug was likely to prolong survival, the company said on Tuesday. Bristol-Myers shares rose nearly 3 percent after the company announced the survival benefit finding. The 418-patient Phase III study, called CheckMate -066, was testing nivolumab as an initial, or first line, therapy for patients with advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. An interim analysis performed by an independent data-monitoring committee found evidence of superior overall survival in patients receiving nivolumab compared with those who received the chemotherapy dacarbazine, Bristol said. The committee stopped the study early to allow the dacarbazine patients to switch to the Bristol drug. Nivolumab belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that have generated great excitement for their ability to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer. Analysts have forecast multibillion-dollar sales for the drugs being developed by several companies once they gain regulatory approval. Merck & Co Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Roche Holding AG have similar drugs in development that have shown great promise in treating melanoma and are also being tested against lung, kidney, bladder and other cancers. “The outcome of CheckMate -066 ... represents the first well-controlled, randomized Phase III trial of an investigational PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor to demonstrate an overall survival benefit,” Michael Giordano, Bristol’s head of oncology development, said in a statement. Independent monitors routinely analyze data from blinded trials at various points and can stop a study if a safety problem arises or if the study drug is seen as likely to prove clearly superior to the control medicine. The duration of the survival benefit was not yet available. Bristol said it plans to complete a full evaluation of the trial data and work with researchers on a future presentation of the results. Bristol-Myers shares rose to $49.58 in after-hours trading, a 2.7 percent increase over their New York Stock Exchange close at $48.30.

292,BMY,"Bristol-Myers profit tops forecasts, helped by newer drugs","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co reported better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by cost controls and strong sales of its Eliquis blood clot preventer and Yervoy treatment for melanoma. Sales of Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers co-markets with Pfizer Inc, rose to $171 million. The pill, used to prevent strokes in patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, has had disappointing sales since it was approved in late 2012, but has picked up steam in recent months.    Yervoy sales jumped 38 percent to $321 million.  Company revenue slipped 4 percent to $3.90 billion, but topped Wall Street expectations of $3.85 billion. Revenue would have risen 7 percent if Bristol-Meyers had not earlier this year sold its global diabetes business to longtime partner AstraZeneca.    Bristol-Myers is counting on an array of experimental immuno-oncology drugs to succeed in clinical trials and propel sales growth in coming years. The company, along with Merck & Co and Roche Holding AG, is racing to develop such treatments, which train the immune system to recognize cancer cells and to attack them. Yervoy, one of the first immuno-oncology drugs, was approved in 2011 to treat patients with late-stage melanoma. But most excitement is centered around a drug called Opdivo (nivolumab), which Bristol-Myers is testing against melanoma, lung cancer and blood cancers. It is a so-called PD-1 inhibitor, considered the most promising new class of cancer treatments. In a conference call with investors on Thursday, Bristol-Myers executives said they expect data from those trials to begin rolling out this year and next year. “Overall, we continue to see Bristol-Myers’ immuno-oncology portfolio as an $8 billion to $10 billion (annual sales) opportunity for the company” that is not fully reflected in Bristol-Myers’ share price, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said Thursday in a research note. The U.S. drugmaker said it earned $333 million, or 20 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $536 million, or 32 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, including $458 million in merger-related charges, Bristol-Myers earned 48 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 44 cents per share.  Bristol-Myers stuck to its prior full-year earnings view of $1.70 to $1.80 per share. Company shares were up 0.7 percent to $49.67 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

In a conference call with investors on Thursday, Bristol-Myers executives said they expect data from those trials to begin rolling out this year and next year. “Overall, we continue to see Bristol-Myers’ immuno-oncology portfolio as an $8 billion to $10 billion (annual sales) opportunity for the company” that is not fully reflected in Bristol-Myers’ share price, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said Thursday in a research note. The U.S. drugmaker said it earned $333 million, or 20 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $536 million, or 32 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, including $458 million in merger-related charges, Bristol-Myers earned 48 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 44 cents per share. Bristol-Myers stuck to its prior full-year earnings view of $1.70 to $1.80 per share. Company shares were up 0.7 percent to $49.67 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

295,BMY,ConvaTec owners eye 2015 sale as buyout interest builds-sources,"NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - ConvaTec’s private equity owners plan to explore a sale of the medical device maker next year, even as interest from several healthcare companies in a potential $10 billion acquisition intensifies, according to people familiar with the matter. Amid a wave of mergers in the healthcare sector aimed at reducing corporate tax rates, Luxembourg-based ConvaTec has emerged as a target for U.S. companies looking to move their tax domiciles abroad in a practice known as inversion. Diversified U.S. manufacturer 3M Co and medical equipment makers CareFusion Corp and C.R. Bard Inc  are among the companies exploring a potential deal for ConvaTec, the people said. CareFusion, with a market capitalization of $9 billion, and C.R. Bard, with $11.2 billion, would both be able to achieve an inversion if they use their own stock to pay for ConvaTec. While ConvaTec would review any compelling offer that would come before 2015, the company for now wants to boost its value further before launching an auction or an initial public offering next year, the people said. Still, calls from some U.S. politicians to crack down on inversions could prompt a potential buyer to act sooner rather than later, for fear missing the window of opportunity, one of the people added. ConvaTec reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $502.5 million in 2013, up 15 percent year-on-year. It is hoping to exceed $600 million in EBITDA this year, the people said. The people asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. ConvaTec, Avista Capital, Nordic Capital, 3M, CareFusion and C.R. Bard could not be reached for comment. ConvaTec makes wound care and ostomy care products at 11 manufacturing sites in eight countries, and sells them in more than 100 countries. It is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Private equity firms Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital acquired ConvaTec from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  in 2011 for $4.1 billion. 3M was one of the contenders for ConvaTec at the time, according to people familiar with the matter. Inversion deals so far this year include medical device maker Medtronic Inc’s acquisition of peer Covidien Plc  for $42.9 billion, and drugmaker AbbVie Inc’s  $54.7 billion merger with pharmaceutical company Shire Plc .

296,BMY,"FDA approves use of Eliquis to treat leg, lung clots","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc on Thursday said U.S. regulators have approved an expanded use for their Eliquis blood clot preventer, to treat blood clots in the legs and lungs. The drugmakers said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved use of the pill to reduce risk of recurrent blood clots in the deep veins of the leg, called deep vein thrombosis, and in the lung, called pulmonary embolism, following initial therapy. Leg clots, if untreated, can travel to the heart, lungs and brain, and cause heart attacks and stroke. Lung clots, which can choke off blood flow, are linked to high mortality rates and require immediate treatment.  Eliquis, which works by blocking a protein called Factor Xa that is involved in the clotting process, is already approved to prevent strokes in patients who have an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. It is meant to be an alternative to warfarin, an older oral drug that can cause serious bleeding episodes and comes with strict dietary restrictions and the need for frequent blood checks.  In large clinical trials involving patients with leg and lung clots, Eliquis was shown to cause far fewer cases of major bleeding than standard treatment with blood clot preventer enoxaparin for five days, overlapped by treatment with warfarin. Eliquis was shown to be similarly effective as standard care. Bristol-Myers and Pfizer are hoping the new approved use for Eliquis will significantly boost demand for Eliquis, whose sales have been very disappointing since it was introduced in late 2012. It garnered $171 million in sales in the second quarter.

302,BMY,Bristol immunotherapy gets six month U.S. FDA review for melanoma,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted a six-month, priority review to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s application for immuno-oncology drug Opdivo as a treatment for previously treated melanoma, the company said on Friday. The FDA decision is due by March 30, 2015. Bristol said European regulators have also agreed to an accelerated review of the drug as a treatment for advanced melanoma. Opdivo, or nivolumab, is part of a promising new class of drugs designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells. Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, became the first PD-1 drug available in the United States, when the FDA earlier this month approved its use for patients with advanced melanoma who are no longer responding to other therapies. Companies including Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are also developing PD-1 pathway drugs for a variety of cancers, including lung cancer. Some analysts expect the new class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025. Bristol said Opdivo was also designated by the FDA as a “breakthrough” melanoma therapy. The agency earlier this year designated the drug as a breakthrough therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who had failed other treatments. In April, Bristol initiated a “rolling” submission with the FDA for Opdivo use in certain patients with a type of non-small cell lung cancer. The company said it expects to complete that application by the end of the year.

304,BMY,Bristol immune drug shows strong effect in melanoma study,"MADRID (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy drug Opdivo produced markedly improved response rates with fewer toxic side effects compared to chemotherapy in a major melanoma study, underscoring its potential as a new treatment option. The data has been keenly awaited since this is the first presentation of results from a pivotal Phase III clinical trial of a promising new class of drugs designed to help the body’s own immune system fight cancer. In the study, involving people with advanced melanoma, 32 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink when given Opdivo against 11 percent of those treated with conventional chemotherapy drugs. Importantly, the duration of response was also much longer. Patients on chemotherapy typically responded for 3.6 months, whereas 95 percent of those who responded to Opdivo were still benefiting after six months and the median duration of response was not reached. Patients in the study had previously been treated with the company’s Yervoy immunotherapy, which works in a different way to take natural brakes off the immune system. “I was very nicely surprised,” said Jeffrey Weber of the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, who presented the results at the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress on Monday. “A 32 percent response rate with the majority staying in remission past six months is probably going to turn into a very impressive level of survival,” he said. “I hope this is the death knell for chemotherapy in melanoma.” Opdivo, or nivolumab, is part of a promising new class of drugs designed to block a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumors to evade the immune system’s disease-fighting cells. Industry analysts are waiting next to see how Opdivo performs in another Phase III trial in lung cancer, for which they expect results in the fourth quarter of 2014. Since non-small lung cancer is a much bigger market than melanoma, that trial is viewed as critical to the drug’s commercial outlook. Some investors are nervous about Opdivo’s lung cancer prospects but Weber, for one, is upbeat. “It is highly likely that the lung data will be positive,” he told Reuters.  Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July when Japanese regulators gave it a green light, although it has been beaten to market in the United States by Merck & Co’s rival Keytruda, which was approved earlier this month. On Friday, Bristol-Myers said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted Opdivo a priority review and a decision on approval was due by the end of March.

307,BMY,UPDATE 1-Novartis works with Bristol-Myers Squibb to test lung cancer drugs,"(Adds details) ZURICH, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Swiss pharma group Novartis AG  said on Monday it would work with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to test the U.S. drugmaker’s immuno-oncology drug Opdivo in combination with three of its own experimental lung cancer drugs. The clinical collaboration will help Novartis advance its efforts in the field of immunotherapy, one of the hottest areas in biotech right now, following the acquisition of CoStim Pharmaceuticals Inc this year, the drugmaker said. Novartis currently lags rivals such as Roche, Merck , AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers in the race to develop immunotherapies - drugs that fight cancer by harnessing the body’s immune system. The two companies will test the combination of three molecularly targeted compounds with Bristol-Myers’ investigational PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in phase I and II studies, Novartis said, adding it would conduct both studies. “Preclinical data suggests that combining molecularly targeted agents with immunotherapies such as nivolumab may have synergistic effects and lead to better outcomes for patients,” Alessandro Riva, global head of Novartis oncology development and medical affairs, said in the statement. Opdivo is part of a closely watched class of drugs known as anti-PD-1 therapies, which block a tumour’s ability to camouflage itself from attack by the immune system’s cells. The drug is approved in Japan for the treatment of unresectable melanoma and is under review by the U.S and European health regulators. It is also being tested as a treatment for a range of other cancers. One of the Novartis studies will evaluate Opdivo with Novartis’ Zykadia, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April as a treatment for late-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The second study will test Opdivo with two investigational drugs, INC280 and EGF816. Novartis is also developing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell, or CAR-T, immunotherapies, which involves engineering a patient’s own T-cells to identify proteins on cancer cells.

310,BMY,UPDATE 2-Bristol-Myers pulls U.S. marketing application for hep C treatment,"(Adds comment from Bristol-Myers and analyst, adds background, updates shares) By Bill Berkrot NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  on Tuesday said it is no longer seeking U.S. approval for an oral two-drug combination to treat hepatitis C because of competition from rival drugs that require treatment for half as long and have shown higher cure rates. The drugmaker’s shares fell more than 2 percent. Bristol-Myers’ combination of experimental antiviral drugs daclatasvir and asunaprevir was intended for patients with the genotype 1b form of the liver-destroying virus, which is far less prevalent in the United States than the 1a form. In addition, Bristol-Myers’ drug faced stiff competition from products being developed by rival drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences <GILD, AbbVie and Merck & Co. In late-stage clinical trials, Bristol’s two-drug combination cured about 85 percent of patients with 24 weeks of therapy. The combinations being developed by rival drugmakers have demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with just 12 weeks of therapy, and they are pursuing even shorter treatment durations. “We believe revenue expectations for this two-drug combination in the U.S. were reasonably low given the lower efficacy relative to other regimens from Gilead and AbbVie that are awaiting approval later this year,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. Gilead’s once-a-day, two-drugs-in-one pill combination for hepatitis C is expected to gain U.S. approval as soon as this week. Its already-approved Sovaldi - half of that regimen - has shattered sales records for a new medicine, racking up $3.5 billion in the second quarter alone. Bristol said it will continue to pursue U.S. approval of daclatasvir, a potent drug from a new class called NS5A inhibitors, which could then be combined with other medicines. It is testing that drug in combination with Gilead’s Sovaldi. The company also has a three-drug regimen that, based on earlier studies, is expected to cure more people in 12 weeks and would compete more favorably with rival treatments. A U.S. marketing application for Bristol’s three-drug combination is expected to be filed next year. Bristol’s two-drug combination was approved in July for use in Japan, which it long considered a prime market for the treatment. Genotype 1b is prevalent in Japan, where intolerance to the older medicine interferon is particularly high, creating a big need for new treatment options. “We believe this treatment has the potential to play a major role in curing HCV patients in Japan, as well as in other markets where the HCV patient population is similar to Japan,” Bristol-Myers said in a statement. Bristol-Myers shares were down $1.12, or 2.2 percent, at  $49.98 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

313,BMY,ConvaTec owners appoint banks to explore sale - sources,"LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - ConvaTec’s owners have appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to explore a sale of the medical device maker which could be worth up to $10 billion, sources familiar with the matter said. Private equity firms Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital are preparing the groundwork for a possible sale or initial public offering (IPO) in 2015 for the Luxembourg-based company, said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private. Mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare space have hit a record pace so far this year, in part driven by U.S. companies seeking to redomicile in countries that have a lower corporate tax rate, in a practice known as inversion. Kimberley-Clark and 3M are considered likely bidders for ConvaTec, said the sources, adding that the U.S. firms’ interest was not motivated by tax inversion issues. ConvaTec, Nordic Capital, 3M, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Kimberley Clark and Avista Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters reported in August that some U.S. companies including diversified manufacturer 3M and medical equipment makers CareFusion Corp and C.R. Bard Inc were potentially exploring a deal, but that ConvaTec wanted to boost its value further before launching an auction or IPO. CareFusion has since been swallowed by medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson & Co for $12.2 billion, taking them out of the field. Also, in recent weeks equity markets have stumbled and the market for IPOs has stalled. Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital acquired ConvaTec from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co in 2011 for $4.1 billion. 3M and Kimberley-Clark were among the contenders for ConvaTec at the time, according to people familiar with the matter. ConvaTec reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $502.5 million in 2013, up 15 percent year-on-year. It is hoping to exceed $600 million in EBITDA this year, sources have said. The company makes wound care and ostomy care products at 11 manufacturing sites in eight countries, and sells them in more than 100 countries.

316,BMY,UPDATE 2-Bristol-Myers tops 3rd-qtr estimates as sales of top drugs sizzle,"(Adds analyst comment, details on Opdivo cancer drug, shares) By Ransdell Pierson Oct 24 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, as sizzling sales of its treatments for blood clots, cancer and arthritis helped offset sharply higher taxes, sending the stock up 2.6 percent. The U.S. drugmaker said on Friday it earned $721 million, or 43 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $692 million, or 42 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, the company earned 45 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 42 cents, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The effective tax rate was 27.4 percent, compared with 15.4 percent a year ago. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, who expected a 13 percent tax rate, saw few other material updates on its finances or products in the earnings report. Later Friday, investors will pay close attention to any updates from executives about how Bristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drugs are faring in clinical trials and in an ongoing review by regulators. The medicines include Opdivo (nivolumab), a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that takes the brakes off immune system cells to allow them to recognize and attack cancer cells. Bristol-Myers, along with Merck & Co Inc, Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc  are leaders in PD-1 inhibitors, and analysts say the new class could generate more than $30 billion in annual global sales by 2025. Opdivo was approved in Japan in July to treat melanoma, and Bristol-Myers has begun the process of seeking U.S. marketing approval for the drug to treat the less common “squamous” form of lung cancer as well as melanoma. Bristol-Myers is expected on Oct. 31 at a meeting in Chicago to present clinical trial data on the use of Opdivo as a treatment for squamous lung cancer, after two earlier courses of treatment failed. “Overall, we believe the Street is significantly underestimating (Opdivo’s) potential in lung cancer,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said on Friday. He predicted the stock could jump to the $55 to $65 range, if favorable data are seen at the meeting, the Chicago Multidisciplinary Symposium on Thoracic Oncology. Arfaei noted other Opdivo lung cancer data are expected in coming months and could help support U.S. approval of the drug. Shares were up $1.38 to $53.88. Merck’s Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, last month became the first PD-1 inhibitor available in the United States. It was approved for patients with advanced melanoma. Bristol-Myers’ quarterly revenue fell 4 percent to $3.92 billion, largely due to the recent sale of its diabetes products to longtime partner AstraZeneca, but were above Wall Street estimates of $3.8 billion. Excluding the divested diabetes drugs, revenue rose 7 percent. Despite the third-quarter profit beat, Bristol-Myers stuck to its earlier full-year profit forecast of $1.70 to $1.80 per share.

318,BMY,Bristol immunotherapy shows encouraging survival in lung cancer trial,"(Reuters) - Treatment of a common form of advanced lung cancer with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s experimental immunotherapy nivolumab  led to a one-year survival rate of 41 percent in a midstage clinical trial, according to data to be presented at a medical meeting, sending the drugmaker’s shares up 8.8 percent. While the study, called CheckMate-063, did not compare nivolumab with another drug or placebo, the historical one-year survival rate for patients like those in the trial, whose  squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) had progressed after treatment with two or more prior therapies, is between 5.5 percent and 18 percent, the company said on Thursday. Squamous cell cancer tends to be found in the middle of the lung. “The data today look very, very good,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said, adding that it bodes well for an ongoing  Phase III trial in NSCLC patients following just one prior therapy. He had estimated a 1-year survival rate of about 20 percent as the number to beat. Nivolumab belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that have generated great excitement in the medical community. They work by blocking a tumor’s ability to camouflage itself, allowing the body’s immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. Merck & Co Inc last month received the first U.S. approval of a drug from the class to treat advanced melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. “The Phase II findings from CheckMate-063 are encouraging as there are no effective treatment options for patients with refractory squamous cell lung cancer after their disease has progressed through two prior therapies,” Dr. Suresh Ramalingam, director of medical oncology at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, said in a statement. Bristol-Myers, which has proposed the brand name Opdivo for nivolumab, plans to use the data as part of its rolling submissions seeking U.S. and European approvals. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson sees Opdivo sales reaching $4.6 billion in 2020. Median overall survival was 8.2 months in the 117-patient trial. The median duration of response had not yet been reached. The objective response rate (ORR), which was the primary goal of the trial, was 15 percent as assessed by an independent review committee. That compares with historical expectations in the single digits, the company said. ORR was defined as reduction of the target lesion of at least 30 percent with no new lesions. The results were scheduled to be reported on Friday at a thoracic oncology meeting in Chicago. Fatigue, lung tissue inflammation and diarrhea were among the most common adverse side effects reported. The discontinuation rate due to drug-related side effects was 12 percent, and there were two drug-related deaths, the company reported.   Lung is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, with about 1.5 million each year, according to the World Health Organization. NSCLC accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases. Bristol-Myers shares were up $4.71 at $58.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.

320,BMY,Bristol-Myers immunotherapy shows promise to replace chemo for melanoma,"(Reuters) - Chemotherapy as a treatment for advanced melanoma could soon become obsolete, researchers said on Sunday, after patients taking an experimental immuno-oncology drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co had a much higher survival rate and had other favorable results. The impressive results, compared with chemo, were seen in a late-stage study of the Bristol-Myers drug Opdivo, which helps take the brakes off the immune system by blocking the protein PD-1. The 418-patient-study involved previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. Among those taking Opdivo, 73 percent were alive one year later, compared with 42 percent of those receiving standard chemo treatment dacarbazine.  Moreover, 40 percent of those taking Opdivo had tumor shrinkage, versus 14 percent for the chemo group. The treatment was associated with mild side effects, including fatigue and nausea. “The results were incredibly good and show there will no longer be a role for chemotherapy in advanced melanoma,” said Dr. Georgina Long, an associate professor at the Melanoma Institute Australia who helped lead the study. Findings were presented at a medical meeting in Zurich. Long, reached by phone there, said the findings bode well not only for Opdivo, but for an emerging crop of other PD-1 inhibitors being developed by other companies. They include products being tested by Merck & Co, Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc. Merck’s Keytruda in September received the first U.S. approval of a drug from the class, to treat advanced melanoma.   Opdivo had also shown strong results in a different Phase III trial that involved advanced melanoma patients who had previously been treated with Yervoy, another immuno-oncology drug from Bristol-Myers. Those results, released in September, showed tumors shrank in 32 percent of patients given Opdivo, compared with 11 percent of those receiving chemo. Bristol-Myers is testing Opdivo for many other cancers, with early glimpses of success. Treatment of a common form of advanced lung cancer with the drug led to a one-year survival rate of 41 percent in a midstage clinical trial, according to data presented two weeks ago.

324,BMY,FDA declines to approve Bristol-Myers hepatitis drug,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Wednesday said U.S. regulators had declined to approve the use of its experimental treatment for hepatitis C, daclatasvir, in combination with other antiviral drugs. Bristol-Myers said it had initially sought permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market the drug, a so-called NS5A inhibitor, in combination with asunaprevir, one of the New York-based company’s experimental medicines. But Bristol-Myers abandoned its U.S. marketing application for asunaprevir in October because of potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen.  Bristol-Myers said the FDA has asked it for data involving use of daclatasvir with other drugs, and that the company is in discussions with the agency about the scope of the required information. Most notably, it is testing daclatasvir in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, a blockbuster treatment that is used on its own or as a component of a combination treatment called Harvoni that was recently introduced by Gilead and is expected to quickly become the market leader. Bristol-Myers’ combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir,  however, was approved in July for use in Japan, which it long considered a prime market for the treatment. One strain of the hepatitis C virus, Genotype 1b, is prevalent in Japan, where intolerance to interferon, an older medicine, is particularly high. In late-stage clinical trials, the combination treatment cured about 85 percent of patients with 24 weeks of therapy. The combinations being developed by rival drugmakers have demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with just 12 weeks of therapy, and they are pursuing even shorter treatment durations. Bristol-Myers, meanwhile, is studying a three-drug regimen that, based on earlier studies, is expected to cure more people in 12 weeks and would compete more favorably with rival treatments.

327,BMY,High rate of lymphoma patients respond to Bristol-Myers drug: study,"(Reuters) - Eighty-seven percent of Hodgkin lymphoma patients responded to a  Bristol-Myers Squibb drug that helps the immune system fight the blood cancer, according to data from a small, early stage trial released on Saturday. The study of Bristol-Myers’ immunotherapy drug nivolumab involved 23 patients whose lymphoma had progressed after numerous prior treatments, including chemotherapy, stem cell transplants and the Seattle Genetics drug Adcetris. Of the 23, 16 saw their tumors shrink by at least half and four had a complete response, meaning no detectable sign of the cancer, generating excitement among researchers. The remaining three patients had stable disease. “What makes these results especially encouraging is that they were achieved in patients who had exhausted other treatment options,” said Dr. Margaret Shipp, co-lead investigator of the  Checkmate-039 study from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’re also excited by the duration of responses to the drug,” she said. “The majority of patients who had a response are still doing well more than a year after their treatment.” The results were being presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in San Francisco. A larger Phase II study is underway, the company said, one that will be used to confirm the results and to seek approval. Nivolumab belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking cancer cells’ ability to camouflage themselves from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack the cancer. The drug received a breakthrough designation for Hodgkin lymphoma from U.S. health regulators, given to medicines seen as a potentially important advance.

Opdivo, or nivolumab, belongs to a promising new class of drugs designed to help the body’s own immune system fight cancer by blocking a protein called Programmed Death receptor (PD-1).  The drug is the second PD-1 inhibitor to be approved by the FDA, the first being Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda in September. Opdivo is intended for melanoma patients who have received prior treatment, including those who have been administered Bristol-Myers’ cancer drug, Yervoy. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 76,100 Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, this year and 9,710 will die from the disease. The approval is based on trial data that showed 32 percent of patients receiving Opdivo saw their tumors shrink, compared with 11 percent of those given conventional chemotherapy. The FDA was scheduled to review the drug on March 30. Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are also developing PD-1 inhibitors for different kinds of cancers.

332,BMY,UPDATE 1-Ontario Teachers raises stake in UK's Birmingham Airport,"(Adds comments from Birmingham Airport CEO, Bristol deal) LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan said it had bought a 19.25 percent stake in Birmingham Airport from Australia’s Victorian Funds Management Corporation, taking its investment in the British airport to 48.25 percent. The investment was led by Ontario Teachers’ Infrastructure Group, which manages a global portfolio of $11.7 billion of investments. Its other airport investments include UK’s Bristol, Copenhagen and Brussels. The Canadian pension fund wants to strengthen Birmingham Airport’s position as a regional hub in the UK by tapping into its capacity of around 9.5 million passengers per year. The airport, which hosts a number of low cost airlines such as Ryanair, Flybe, Monarch and Thomas Cook, offers domestic and international flights to destinations in Europe, North America and the Middle East. It ranks as the UK’s seventh busiest airport after Edinburgh and Luton, according to the UK Civil Aviation Authority, while London’s Heathrow and Gatwick are in the top two spots with more than 110 million combined passengers, followed by Manchester Airport with more than 21 million annual passengers. Ontario Teachers first invested in Birmingham Airport in 2001. It then acquired a joint 48.25 percent stake with Victorian Funds Management (VFM) for 420 million pounds in 2007 when Macquarie Airports Group and Aer Rianta made a full exit. The pension fund gave no financial details of their latest buyout. The Canadian pension fund became the sole owner of the UK’s ninth busiest airport, Bristol, after buying out its co-shareholder Macquarie Group in September. Seven West Midlands district councils have kept a significant ownership of Birmingham Airport and will continue investing alongside Ontario Teachers. “The shared goal is to develop Birmingham Airport’s connectivity to benefit both the region and the UK as a whole,” said Birmingham Airport Chief Executive, Paul Kehoe. Ontario Teachers’ is the largest single-profession pension plan in Canada. It pays pensions and invests on behalf of 307,000 working and retired teachers in Ontario.

333,BMY,"Merck, Bristol heat up immunotherapy race in lung cancer","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co broke further away from rival drugmakers in the race to treat lung cancer with a new generation of immune system therapies, adding pressure on the likes of Roche and AstraZeneca to play catch-up. Merck said it would file an application with U.S. regulators in the middle of this year seeking expanded use of its new Keytruda treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the deadly disease.  That followed a late Sunday announcement by Bristol-Myers that independent monitors halted a trial of its Opdivo treatment for lung cancer when it became clear the drug extended survival compared with standard chemotherapy.   While the magnitude of the benefit was not yet known, it marked the first time the new class of immunotherapy demonstrated an overall survival benefit in lung cancer.        Some industry analysts expect this class, known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, to generate more than $30 billion in worldwide annual sales by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative use. Keytruda and Opdivo are already approved to treat advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. They work by blocking a mechanism used by tumors to hide from disease fighting immune system cells. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson sees Merck closing a perceived gap with Bristol-Myers in using their drugs for lung cancer. “The review time for Merck’s application could be on the order of a few months,” implying approval in the second half of 2015, nearly a year earlier than Wall Street had expected, Anderson said in a note. As a result, “Merck may only be about six months behind Bristol-Myers in bringing its product to market.” Bristol has not said when it expects an approval decision for Opdivo as a treatment for lung cancer. Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note that Merck’s rapid advancement may pose a setback to similar programs from Roche and AstraZeneca.  Roche’s timeline for seeking regulatory approval remains unclear, Fernandez noted. AstraZeneca, meanwhile, may not be able to secure an accelerated review in lung cancer if the Bristol-Myers or Merck drug is already on the market, potentially adding several months to a decision on its contender. Roche said it expects pivotal data for its PD-L1 drug in lung and bladder cancer in the first half of this year, with potential filings seeking approval in the second half if the trials are successful.  Bahija Jallal of AstraZeneca’s MedImmune oncology unit, speaking at the JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, said the company’s focus was on testing combinations of its immunotherapy with its own traditional drugs. “I think we’re in a great position because we have biologics on one side and small molecules on the other side,” Jallal said. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, killing more than 1.5 million people each year, according the World Health Organization. Bristol-Myers shares were up 3 percent at $62.17, while Merck shares were off 0.4 percent at $62.27.

Caforio, 50, who has a medical background and led the company’s global oncology operations, will take over Bristol-Myers at a time when it is riding high on its new high-profile cancer drugs that help the immune system fight the disease. Late last year, U.S. regulators approved Bristol’s Opdivo, from a highly promising new class of immunotherapies called PD-1 inhibitors, to treat advanced melanoma. Opdivo is also being tested against lung cancer, with ambitious plans to test it in combination with several other medicines, both from in-house and from other companies, against a variety of cancers. Prior to Opdivo, Bristol’s Yervoy, which uses another mechanism to take the brakes off the immune system, became the first drug to improve overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers. The company has several other immunotherapies in its developmental pipeline, as well as drugs for hepatitis C, fibrotic diseases and cardiovascular medicines.  Andreotti, 64, who has been CEO since May 2010 after a long career with the company, will become executive chairman of the board on May 5 and continue as chairman after his Aug. 3 retirement, the company said. “I have a high level of confidence in Giovanni that is shared by everyone who has seen him consistently and successfully drive performance,” Andreotti said in a statement.

All told, the resurgent U.S. currency could shave up to $12 billion off U.S. companies’ fourth-quarter 2014 revenue alone, according to currency expert Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FireApps, a data analytics company in Phoenix, Arizona, that examines quarterly reports for currency-related losses. The pain is hitting multiple sectors, including industrial companies such as 3M Co, technology companies like Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc, airlines such as American Airlines Group Inc, healthcare companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc , and consumer firms like Procter & Gamble - which all garner a large portion of their sales from outside the United States. “This is a slow-motion crash,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said. After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar  has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand. The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining. “You have companies who don’t normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,” said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. “It’s really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening.” The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors. While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts’ ability to estimate losses. One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates. Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share. The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps. American icon Apple Inc is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations. Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple’s 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report. Apple’s Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a “clear headwind” included in the company’s guidance for the year ahead. Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics. Medical device maker Stryker Corp said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent. Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson and IBM . Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps. But actual losses may be much higher as many firms citing currency impacts did not disclose the amount, it noted.

344,BMY,UPDATE 1-Bristol-Myers issues cautious 2015 forecast due to strong dollar,"(Adds details on 2015 forecast, shares) By Ransdell Pierson Jan 27 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Tuesday said profits could fall as much as 16 percent in 2015, a worse forecast than Wall Street had expected, as the stronger dollar takes a toll on U.S.  drugmakers. Bristol-Myers, whose shares fell almost 2 percent in premarket trading, said it earned $13 million, or 1 cent per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $726 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, including an after-tax charge of 28 cents per share resulting from the transfer of U.S. pension obligations, Bristol-Myers earned 46 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 41 cents. Revenue fell 4 percent to $4.26 billion, coming in above Wall Street expectations of $4.03 billion. Sales would have fallen only 1 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which reduces the value of sales abroad. Bristol-Myers said it expects 2015 earnings of $1.55 to $1.70 per share, assuming current foreign exchange rates. The entire range is below the average analyst forecast of $1.71 per share and reflects earnings as much as 16 percent below those seen in 2014. Many investors expect Bristol-Myers earnings to vault higher in following years thanks to development of potentially lucrative immuno-oncology treatments, drugs that treat cancer by harnessing the immune system. U.S. regulators last month approved its Opdivo medicine to treat patients with advanced melanoma. It competes with Keytruda, a melanoma treatment from Merck and Co that also works by blocking a protein called PD-1 that allows tumor cells to conceal themselves. Rival U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc on Tuesday also provided a 2015 view below Wall Street expectations. It cited competition with cheaper generic drugs and the impact of the stronger dollar.

352,BMY,Bristol hep C drug helps cure 97 percent of HIV coinfected patients: study,"(Reuters) - Ninety-seven percent of hepatitis C patients also infected with HIV were cured of the liver-destroying virus after 12 weeks of treatment with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s daclatasvir and Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi, according to data from a study presented on Thursday. The results could help put Bristol’s hepatitis C program back on track in the United States, following a setback last year. In the Ally-2 study, including new patients and those not helped by prior treatment, 149 of 153 were deemed cured of hepatitis C regardless of what other anti-viral regimens they were on for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. “The results of Ally-2 signaled that nearly all HIV-HCV coinfected patients in the study could be cured of hepatitis C with a 12-week regimen on daclatasvir and sofosbuvir,” Dr. David Wyles, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement, using the chemical name for Sovaldi. There were no reported serious side effects related to the hepatitis drugs, and patients did not require any alteration of HIV medications over potential drug-drug interactions. “This is a paramount consideration for clinicians treating this patient population,” added Wyles, who presented the data at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) meeting in Seattle. About 300,000 Americans with HIV also suffer from hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making them prone to more rapid progression to liver damage. Daclatasvir is approved in Europe, Brazil and Japan as part of combination therapy, but has fallen behind rivals in the world’s most lucrative market. In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve daclatasvir in combination with other antiviral drugs. The company had sought FDA permission to market daclatasvir in combination with another Bristol drug, asunaprevir. But Bristol abandoned its U.S. marketing application for asunaprevir due to potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen. The FDA asked for new data on daclatasvir with other drugs, which the Ally results could help satisfy. Sovaldi is part of Gilead’s market-leading hepatitis C franchise and half of its own one-pill-per-day combination treatment Harvoni. All 26 patients in the Ally-2 study with the less common genotypes 2, 3 and 4 of the virus were cured by the combination. A shorter eight-week regimen tested among 50 patients led to a 75 percent cure rate.

354,BMY,U.S. FDA approves Bristol-Myers immunotherapy for lung cancer,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday swiftly approved a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co drug that helps the immune system fight the most common form of lung cancer, sending the company’s shares up more than 5 percent to a multi-year high. The eagerly anticipated Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug known as Opdivo came only about three months after Bristol provided trial results showing that the medicine extended survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one of the biggest markets in oncology. The decision also came more than three months ahead of an expected action date by the agency. “This approval will provide patients and health care providers knowledge of the survival advantage associated with Opdivo and will help guide patient care and future lung cancer trials,” Richard Pazdur, the FDA’s head of hematology and oncology product evaluation, said in a statement. Opdivo, known chemically as nivolumab, was approved to  treat non-small cell lung cancer after the disease has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy, typically the first-line treatment against the disease. It was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Opdivo belongs to a highly promising new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack cancer cells. Opdivo was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs the agency believes would provide significant improvement in treating a serious condition. Analysts believe lung cancer could add billions of dollars in annual sales for Opdivo.   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with an estimated 224,210 new cases and 159,260 deaths in 2014. Non-small cell lung cancer is by far the most common type of the disease. Bristol-Myers shares were up 5.3 percent at $65.22 on the New York Stock Exchange, a level last reached in 2001.

356,BMY,Bristol's $1 billion Bavarian deal may signal cancer vaccine revival,"LONDON (Reuters) - The idea of using vaccines to fight cancer has received a shot in the arm from a $1 billion deal between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Bavarian Nordic. The agreement gives the U.S. drugmaker an exclusive option to the Danish biotech firm’s therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine Prostvac and signals that such shots may have a bright future when combined with so-called checkpoint inhibitor drugs. Shares in Bavarian Nordic surged 35 percent on Wednesday on news of the Bristol-Myers tie-up, under which it could receive up to $975 million, including an upfront payment of $60 million. Unlike traditional preventative vaccines, therapeutic ones are designed for people with established disease and the aim is to boost the patient’s immune system to keep tumors at bay. Unfortunately, they have run into problems in practice, leading to a series of failures with experimental products such as Merck KGaA’s Stimuvax and GlaxoSmithKline’s MAGE-A3. The one vaccine to make it to market, Dendreon’s Provenge, has not been a commercial success. But Bristol-Myers thinks vaccines, which trigger a response from the immune system’s “foot soldiers”, can play an important role when given in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, like its drug Yervoy, which take the brakes off other immune cells. A week ago, the U.S. company and its Danish partner released early data from a study involving 30 patients showing that 20 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer remained alive 80 months after starting treatment with the most promising dose of Prostvac and Yervoy. The idea of combining therapeutic cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors has gained traction among researchers in recent months and was a talking-point at the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress in Madrid in September. Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan also told Reuters last year that the Swiss group, which is the world’s largest maker of cancer drugs, was exploring ways of combining its checkpoint inhibitors with cancer vaccines.

358,BMY,Bavarian Nordic shares leap on $1 billion Bristol-Myers deal,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Bavarian Nordic (BAVA.CO) has struck a prostate cancer drug deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) that could be worth $1 billion should its trials, part of a new field in cancer treatment, be successful. Shares in the Danish company soared and by 0950 GMT (0450 ET) they were trading at 282 Danish crowns ($42), up 33 percent. The jump added over $260 million to its market value of $880 million. The agreement gives the U.S. company an exclusive option to license Bavarian’s Prostvac drug, an immunotherapy treatment that helps the body’s own immune cells fight tumors. Immunotherapy for cancer is a rapidly evolving field which promises better and longer-lasting treatments, although oncology experts warn financial costs are high.  Under the deal, Bavarian Nordic stands to receive up to $975 million, including $60 million it will get upfront, if it passes trials and sales milestones, and could also receive royalties. Prostvac is currently undergoing Phase III trials — the last set of tests before it can be sold on global markets. “A significant Phase II survival benefit suggests Prostvac immunotherapy has the potential to revolutionize prostate cancer treatment,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note. Last week Bavarian said results from a small early-stage trial conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, showed Prostvac helped extend survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer significantly.  In that trial, patients were treated with Prostvac in addition to escalating doses of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy, an injectable treatment for advanced melanoma that works by taking the brakes off the body’s immune system. Bavarian Chief Executive Paul Chaplin said full results of the Phase III trial are expected by early 2017 but that the company is looking to improve the potential sales position of the drug by combining it with other treatments. “We will be approved as a monotherapy but what our colleagues at NCI have already shown is that there are synergistic benefits of combining Prostvac,” he told Reuters.   “That is where the treatment will be moving.”  The two companies said on Wednesday they were preparing for Phase II trials of Prostvac together with Yervoy. “Scientific rationale exists to evaluate Prostvac in combination with Yervoy and other agents from Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immuno-oncology portfolio,” they said in a statement. The deal follows Bavarian’s agreement last year with a unit of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to trial an Ebola vaccine, as an outbreak spread across West Africa. Chaplin said the two deals would allow Bavarian to invest more aggressively in its pipeline of drugs that cover infectious diseases including smallpox and cancer because a Phase III trial for such a small company is very costly. “Fortunately we had the sales of the smallpox vaccine, which was driving our ability to invest in this space, but it was limiting our ability to do other things,” he said. “We’re spoilt for choice as to where to invest.” ",3042015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bavarian-nordic-bristol-myers/bavarian-nordic-shares-leap-on-1-billion-bristol-myers-deal-idUSKBN0M00R520150304

Under the deal, Bavarian Nordic could receive up to $975 million, including $60 million upfront, if it passes trials and sales milestones, and could also receive royalties from sales. Prostvac is currently undergoing Phase III trials — the last set of tests under U.S. regulations before it can be sold on the market. “It’s a super deal for Bavarian,” analyst Frank Horning Andersen from Jyske Bank said. “Bristol-Myers is the right partner as the company has reorganised recently with cancer as one of its focus areas.” Last week Bavarian said that according to results of a small early-stage trial conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Prostvac helped extend survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer significantly.

More potential blockbusters are expected to be launched this year than last, in an encouraging sign for the pharmaceutical industry, which relies on new products to replenish sales as older medicines go off patent. Regulators have been approving more new drugs in recent years but there remains a debate as to how far this will translate into bigger overall sales and profits, since many modern medicines are for rare diseases. The three biggest potential blockbusters launching this year, however, offer new ways of fighting cancer, high cholesterol and heart failure — all markets targeting relatively large numbers of patients. In total, 11 of the many new drugs set for launch in 2015 are expected to generate $1 billion-plus annual sales within five years, up from three in 2014, Thomson Reuters Cortellis said in its latest “Drugs to Watch” report on Monday.  Bristol-Myers’ cancer medicine Opdivo tops the list, with projected 2019 sales of $5.7 billion, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Cortellis. Opdivo belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack cancer cells. The drug went on sale in Japan in September 2014 but was only approved for melanoma in the United States at the end of December, since when it has also received a green light for lung cancer, underlying the potential that healthcare authorities see in such so-called immunotherapies.

371,BMY,UPDATE 1-Merck says melanoma drug meets goal; study halted,"(Adds details on Keytruda, melanoma, rival Bristol-Myers drug) By Ransdell Pierson March 24 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday that it would stop a large study of its Keytruda melanoma treatment early because an independent monitoring committee determined the drug succeeded in its goal of prolonging survival in previously untreated patients at advanced stage of the disease. The medicine, a PD-1 inhibitor that works by taking the brakes off the immune system, is already approved to treat patients who have failed to benefit from standard treatments, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Yervoy. Patients taking Keytruda showed meaningful improvement in overall survival and in delayed progression of disease, compared with those taking Yervoy, Merck said. The data, if regulators agree, could allow Merck to widen its marketing of Keytruda to people being treated for the first time for the dangerous skin disease. Shares of Merck were up 1 percent at $59.30 in early trading. “Keytruda is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to demonstrate a survival advantage compared to the standard of care for the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma,” Merck said in a release. It noted that data from the study will be presented at a medical meeting next month in Philadelphia. About 76,000 Americans are diagnosed every year with melanoma, which is highly linked to sun exposure, and more than 9,700 die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. Merck said safety of Keytruda in the halted study was similar to that seen in earlier trials, where the most common side effects were fatigue, coughing, nausea and other mostly mild reactions. Keytruda in September became the first PD-1 inhibitor approved by U.S. regulators. Three months later, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo, also for patients with advanced melanoma who no longer respond to other drugs. It also works by blocking the PD-1 protein. AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers are also developing PD-1 inhibitors, or similar drugs known as PD-L1 inhibitors. Wall Street expects the products to generate combined annual sales of more than $30 billion by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative potential use. Merck aims by midyear to seek U.S. approval of Keytruda for non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. Bristol-Myers in January said it was halting a trial of Opdivo for lung cancer, also at the advice of independent monitors, when it became clear the drug extended survival compared with standard chemotherapy.

378,BMY,Bristol's Opdivo proves effective against second type of lung cancer,"(Reuters) - A large study of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Opdivo treatment has been halted after proving the drug is effective against the most common form of lung cancer, the company said, positioning the medicine for far wider use than its already approved lung cancer and melanoma indications. The U.S. drugmaker on Friday said the study, called Checkmate-057, was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee concluded that Opdivo provided a survival advantage over docetaxel, a standard chemotherapy, among patients with previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The so-called PD-1 inhibitor, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, was approved by U.S. regulators last month to treat the less-common “squamous” form of NSCLC that had spread following treatment with chemotherapy.  Opdivo is also approved for use against metastatic melanoma following treatment with Yervoy, another Bristol-Myers immuno-therapy.  Opdivo, whose chemical name is nivolumab, competes with Merck & Co’s Keytruda, a PD-1 inhibitor that is approved to treat melanoma and which is also being tested against NSCLC. Merck, which aims by midyear to seek U.S. approval of Keytruda for both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, must now contemplate the likelihood of Bristol-Myers eventually competing in both arenas.     The rival drugs are also in trials against a variety of other cancers.  AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers are developing their own PD-1 inhibitors, or similar drugs known as PD-L1 inhibitors. Wall Street expects the products to generate combined annual sales of more than $30 billion by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative potential use. Data from several trials of the promising new family of cancer drugs is slated to be released over the coming week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Philadelphia. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson on Friday said Wall Street is expecting Opdivo to be the market leader among the PD-1 inhibitors, with peak annual sales of $7 billion by 2020. But he recommended that investors buy shares in “multiple players in the immuno-oncology category.” He said in a research note, “Because of the size of the I/O opportunity, in our view there will be more than one way to win.” Bristol-Myers shares rose 2.9 percent to $65.55 in midday trading, while Merck shares retreated 1.3 percent to $57.07, also on the New York Stock Exchange.

Opdivo, whose chemical name is nivolumab, competes with Merck & Co’s Keytruda, a PD-1 inhibitor that is approved to treat melanoma and which is also being tested against NSCLC. Merck, which aims by midyear to seek U.S. approval of Keytruda for both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, must now contemplate the likelihood of Bristol-Myers eventually competing in both arenas. The rival drugs are also in trials against a variety of other cancers. AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers are developing their own PD-1 inhibitors, or similar drugs known as PD-L1 inhibitors. Wall Street expects the products to generate combined annual sales of more than $30 billion by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative potential use. Data from several trials of the promising new family of cancer drugs is slated to be released over the coming week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Philadelphia. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson on Friday said Wall Street is expecting Opdivo to be the market leader among the PD-1 inhibitors, with peak annual sales of $7 billion by 2020. But he recommended that investors buy shares in “multiple players in the immuno-oncology category.” He said in a research note, “Because of the size of the I/O opportunity, in our view there will be more than one way to win.” Bristol-Myers shares rose 2.9 percent to $65.55 in midday trading, while Merck shares retreated 1.3 percent to $57.07, also on the New York Stock Exchange.

381,BMY,Bristol wins EU green light for immune system cancer drug,"LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators have recommended approval of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, paving the way for it to become the first of a closely watched group of immune system-boosting cancer medicines to go on sale in Europe. The drug, also known as nivolumab, was given a green light on Friday by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of melanoma. It is already approved in the United States for melanoma and lung cancer. The EMA said Opdivo was recommended for use on its own for the treatment of advanced melanoma, the most aggressive type of skin cancer, in both first-line and previously treated patients. The agency also recommended approval of Daiichi Sankyo’s Lixiana, or edoxaban, for stroke prevention and Vanda Pharma’s Hetlioz, or tasimelteon, to treat a sleep-wake disorder in blind people. Bristol’s Opdivo belongs to a highly promising new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumours use to hide from the immune system. It is expected to be one of the most commercially successful new drugs to reach major markets this year. It competes with Merck & Co’s Keytruda, which is also on the market in the United States but not in Europe. Although Keytruda is still waiting for regulatory approval in Europe, some patients in Britain will soon receive it through a new early-access scheme, under which highly promising new drugs are made available free of charge ahead of formal licensing.

385,BMY,Strong Merck cancer drug sales upstage rival Bristol-Myers,"(Reuters) - Investors betting that Bristol-Myers Squibb will emerge as the leading player in a hot new class of cancer drugs hit the pause button on Tuesday as a rival therapy from Merck & Co showed much higher sales. Bristol shares fell as much as 2.7 percent and closed off 1 percent after reporting sales of Opdivo, a therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, totaled $40 million in the first quarter of the year. That was below Wall Street forecasts of $50 million. Merck said its Keytruda treatment had quarterly sales of $83 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $70 million, helped by early compassionate use patients converting to paying customers following approval. “When investors saw Opdivo’s number was below Keytruda’s, that caused concern,” said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Merck shares closed up 5 percent, though the gains were mostly attributed to positive new safety data on its top-selling Januvia diabetes treatment.        Boris and other industry analysts said the early sales data represent only the first skirmish in a long battle for market share between Bristol-Myers and Merck. Some expect both drugs will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer. In addition, excitement over Bristol-Myers’ cancer treatments have pushed shares to trade at 28.5 times expected 2016 per share earnings, Boris said. That compares with a multiple of 15.1 for Merck and 17.6 for the pharmaceutical sector.  “Based on price per fundamentals, we like the value of Merck versus Bristol at the moment,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for ESquared Asset Management, which currently holds Merck but not Bristol shares. Ori Hershkovitz, a managing partner at Nexthera Capital in New York, said Bristol-Myers is trading more like a high-flying biotech. “The minute biotech gets pummeled, Bristol bears the brunt,” he said, noting biotech stocks have retreated sharply in recent weeks on fears they were overly inflated. Opdivo was approved in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it received clearance to treat a common form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early-mover advantage in a much larger market.  Keytruda has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and awaits regulatory approval in lung cancer.  Both drugs work by blocking a protein called PD-1, helping the immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc are also developing similar treatments. Boris forecast Opdivo annual sales reaching $7 billion by 2020 and said Tuesday’s weakness in Bristol shares represents a buying opportunity. Opdivo has been shown to prolong survival in melanoma and lung cancer, according to clinical trial data. Keytruda has not yet demonstrated a survival benefit but is expected to do so in coming trials. Boris predicted it will capture annual sales of $3.7 billion by 2020. Bristol Chief Scientific Officer Francis Cuss told analysts on Tuesday that strong data on Opdivo along with the U.S. approvals in lung cancer and melanoma and expected European approval “really puts us in a very strong competitive position.” The company recently reported strong results from a combination of Opdivo and its older immunotherapy Yervoy in advanced melanoma. It plans to apply for approval of the combination therapy by mid-year. Merck head of global human health, Adam Schecter, told analysts that the market will be big enough to handle several competitors, “so I don’t think it should be looked at as one company versus the other.” Pfizer is racing to catch up with Merck and Bristol-Myers, by beginning late-stage trials this year of its PD-1 inhibitor and conducting trials of four other immuno-oncology drugs. PD-1 treatments “will be the workhorses for the foreseeable future, but they will need to be added to standard therapies or to (other) immuno-oncology treatments,” Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview. “That’s where the market will be, and we will be well positioned with those combination agents.”   ",4282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bristolmyers-merck-cancer/strong-merck-cancer-drug-sales-upstage-rival-bristol-myers-idUSKBN0NJ2PG20150428
386,BMY,UPDATE 1-FDA approves generic versions of antipsychotic drug Abilify,"(Adds details) April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved the first copycat versions of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s antipsychotic drug, Abilify. The FDA said on Tuesday that it had granted approval for generic versions of Abilify from four companies, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, to treat mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. (1.usa.gov/1EO2DvW) Abilify has an orphan drug designation for the treatment of Tourette’s syndrome, a nervous system disorder, in children. The drug, which is also approved to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, went off patent protection for these indications this month. Japanese drugmaker Otsuka bought Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc  in December for $3.5 billion to expand its offering of neurological products before Abilify went off patent protection. Abilify, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co in the United States, brought in sales of $554 million in the first quarter.

387,BMY,"High-profile Bristol cancer drug disappoints, shares off","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Tuesday reported first-quarter sales of its new cancer immunotherapy Opdivo that were about half of those for a rival medicine from Merck & Co (MRK.N), and its shares fell 2 percent. Opdivo, which is used to treat advanced melanoma and was more recently approved to treat a common form of lung cancer, had sales of $40 million in the quarter. Merck on Tuesday said it Keytruda, a similar new drug that helps the immune system to fight cancer, had first quarter sales of $83 million. “Opdivo sales of $40 million is a little disappointing. We expected $54 million,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a note. Arfaei said he expects a strong Opdivo launch in the much larger lung cancer market as the year progresses. Bristol is counting on potential multibillion-dollar sales of its immunotherapy cancer drugs to help drive future growth. Yervoy, an older immunotherapy for melanoma, saw sales rise 20 percent to $325 million. Bristol-Myers posted better-than-expected quarterly results for the quarter, helped by cost cuts and a higher estimate of royalties owed the company from sales of its Abilify schizophrenia treatment.  The U.S. drugmaker said it earned $1.19 billion, or 71 cents per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $937 million, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 71 cents per share, well above the average forecast of 51 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results were helped by lower spending on marketing and advertising. Company sales rose 6 percent to $4.04 billion, about $200 million above Wall Street expectations. They would have risen 13 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales abroad. Bristol-Myers raised the lower end of its full-year 2015 profit forecast by five cents, to $1.60 per share, while keeping the higher end at $1.70.  Sales of Abilify rose 3 percent to $554 million, but would have been far lower if not for a recalculation of royalties Bristol-Myers receives from partner Otsuka Holdings Co (4578.T). Under a marketing agreement that ended April 20, Bristol-Myers last year recorded sales of Abilify that reflected an estimated 33 percent royalty rate. But in the recent first quarter, Bristol-Myers recorded sales that reflected an actual 50 percent royalty.

392,BMY,Fitch Rates Bristol-Myers Squibb's Euro Bond Issuance 'A-',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s (Bristol- Myers, Bristol, BMY) Euro Bond issuance.  The net proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used to fund, in part, the  redemption of the company's existing 2016 and 2022 senior unsecured Euro notes.  A full list of the company's ratings follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch expects Bristol-Myers to operate with leverage below 2.0 times (x)  following the divestiture of its diabetes business. Leverage at Dec. 31, 2014  was 2.1x.  --Fitch anticipates that continued market uptake of Bristol's medicines with  longer patent protection and the successful commercialization of key research  projects will help offset the effects of the patent expirations of Baraclude and  Abilify during 2015. --Bristol has made progress in advancing a number of late-stage pipeline  candidates that treat various cancers and hepatitis C, which will help  longer-term growth.  --Baraclude and Abilify patent expirations will be a headwind to sales and cash  flows in 2015. Nevertheless, Fitch does see meaningful operational improvement  in 2016 as new and established patent-protected drugs continue to gain traction  and patent expiries are more manageable.  --The sale of the company's diabetes business has reduced EBITDA and left  Bristol less diversified. However, Fitch believes the company will benefit from  its narrower strategic focus from gains in operational efficiency and research  productivity in the intermediate to long term.  --Fitch believes Bristol will use a cash deployment strategy that generally  preserves cash through 2015 by moderating its share repurchases. Leverage Expected to Generally Remain Below 2.0x Fitch expects that Bristol will generally operate with gross debt leverage  (total debt/EBITDA) below 2.0x during the forecast horizon. The company paid  down approximately $755 million in debt during the first quarter of 2014 and has  maintained profitability during the past 12 months.  Patent Protected Products Growing Bristol has a number of growth drivers for the intermediate term that will help  to mitigate the roughly 20% of sales at risk to patent expiries through the end  of 2016. The company's longer-dated patented products continue to generate solid  growth. Sprycel (chronic myeloid leukemia), Yervoy (metastatic melanoma) and  Orencia (rheumatoid arthiritis) are generating strong double-digit growth as  favorable clinical outcomes drive increased utilization. Eliquis (blood clots)  revenues have increased eight-fold over the prior year due to positive clinical  data and improved formulary positioning.  Pipeline Progress Bristol-Myers has made meaningful progress with its late-stage pipeline during  the past year, during which it has advanced treatments for cancer and hepatitis  C through its pipeline. Opdivo/nivolumab (cancer) has had numerous positive  developments, including FDA approval in December 2014 to treat skin cancer.  Moderate Impact from Patent Losses in 2015 - 2016 A second wave of drug patent expirations occurs in 2015 - 2016 when Baraclude  and Abilify lose market exclusivity in the U.S. The maturing medicines account  for roughly 20% of total revenues. The patent expiration of Baraclude in the  U.S. is immaterial, although the expected loss of exclusivity in international  markets in October 2016 poses a moderate challenge, as its international sales  account for roughly 8% of total firm sales.  Expected strong performance of Yervoy and Eliquis and continued growth of core  blockbuster medicines, notably Sprycel, Reyataz, and Orencia, should provide  support during the 2015 -2016 patent expiry period. As such, the negative effect  on sales growth and operating margin should be more moderate than what Bristol  experienced during 2012 when Plavix lost most of its sales because of generic  competition after its U.S. patent expired.  Sharpened Strategic Focus In its effort to narrow its strategic focus, Bristol-Myers sold its diabetes  business to AstraZeneca in the February 2014. Fitch believes, over the long  term, the benefits of an increased strategic focus (improved operational  efficiencies and research productivity) will offset the negative effect of  divestiture-related decrease in product portfolio diversification. Bristol received $2.7 billion cash at closing and will receive $800 million in  potential approval milestones and sales performance milestones of potentially  $600 million payable in 2020. The company will also receive specified royalties  on the diabetes' business net worldwide sales through 2025. Soft Near-Term FCF Fitch forecasts relatively soft annual free cash flow (FCF; cash from operations  less dividends and capital expenditures) generation of roughly 500 million to  $700 million during 2014 -2015, mainly the result of top-line pressure from  patent expiries and the loss of contribution from the diabetes franchise. Steady  improvements should follow in 2016 and beyond as new products, recently-launched  and to-be-launched, gain traction. FCF in the latest 12-month (LTM) period ended  Dec. 31, 2014 was $224 million, compared to $699 million in prior year's LTM  period. Cash Preservation through Patent Cliff Fitch believes that Bristol will deploy cash in a relatively conservative manner  throughout 2015. While Fitch expects that Bristol will continue to support its  dividend, the company will likely lean towards cash preservation over  significant share repurchases. During the LTM period ended Dec. 31, 2014, share  repurchases declined and issuances actually exceeded purchases with net proceeds  of $288 million compared to net issuances of $131 million in the prior year  period. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: Fitch's key assumptions for Bristol-Myer's 'A-'/Stable Outlook include: --Modest revenue decline during 2015, primarily driven by the negative effect of  foreign exchange movement and the patent expiries of Abilify and Baraclude; --Established products such as Orencia, Yervoy and Eliquis as well as recently  introduced Opdivo should mitigate some of the headwinds to top-line growth; --EBITDA margin to increase to 25%-26% as mix improves with newer product growth  and ongoing efforts to rein in costs yield savings; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) to decline to roughly $500 - $600 million during 2015; --Leverage to trend slightly below 2.0x during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near  term, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to such  an action include: Given the anticipated operational pressure from expiring drug patents through  2016, Fitch would consider a positive rating action if it believes gross debt  leverage will be maintained below 1.7x and FCF will remain positive through the  forecast period. Drivers of operational improvement that would support a  positive revision include strong demand for new therapeutics, as well as  successful commercialization of promising oral Hepatitis C treatments and the  potential first-in-class oncology drug, Opdivo/nivolumumab.

400,BMY,"New drugs from Bristol, Merck at forefront of cancer meeting","(Reuters) - New data to be released this weekend should help deepen the understanding of how broadly new drugs that unleash the body’s immune system to fight cancer can be used. Results from key clinical trials will be presented starting Friday in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. These will include studies aimed at defining ahead of time which patients are likely to benefit from the costly drugs.     At the forefront will be rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck and Co designed to block a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1) that is used by tumors to evade the body’s natural defenses. “It’s going to be an important meeting to get some more (details) on the PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.      Bristol’s Opdivo, or nivolumab, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it also received clearance to treat a form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early advantage in the much larger market. Merck’s Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and is awaiting regulatory approval in lung cancer treatment.     First-quarter sales of both drugs surprised Wall Street, with Keytruda sales reaching $83 million, compared to $40 million for Opdivo, suggesting an early advantage for Merck in what many expect will be a years-long battle for market share.  Other drugmakers working on similar treatments include Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc.  Many industry experts expect the entire class will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer.     On Friday, the ASCO conference will feature studies looking at Opdivo’s use against advanced liver cancer and non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Results will also be presented from a trial of Keytruda in head and neck cancer.     “Bristol’s in a really good position,” said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. “My expectation is that they’re going to be and will continue to be the leader in the lung cancer space.” Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, is the largest cause of cancer deaths in the United States.      At the same time, he said, Merck may bolster its argument that Keytruda has proven the broadest possible use to date, with “clear activity in 13 different tumor types.” Other data points that will be closely watched by oncologists and investors include whether the level of PD-1 protein in a tumor can predict how well the new immunotherapies will work. Earlier this month, Roche said that a mid-stage trial of its experimental immunotherapy, MPDL3280A, showed it doubled the likelihood of survival for lung cancer patients with the highest levels PD-L1.     A separate trial of Merck’s Keytruda to be released at ASCO was designed to see whether a higher number of genetic mutations in a tumor can lead to better results in treating colorectal and other cancers. Doctors at the meeting will also hear more on the potential for combining different types of immunotherapies to make them more effective, as well as the high costs associated with multiple treatment regimens. Treatment with Opdivo or Keytruda alone in the United States, for example, costs about $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year. “Really the name of the game is having overall survival data in your label,” said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris.

At the end of April, the FDA approved applications to make  Abilify by several generic drugmakers, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, which immediately announced it would launch its own version. Otsuka sued the FDA saying it had an exclusive right to make Abilify until 2021 because the drug was designated an “orphan drug,” one that treats a rare condition, when it was approved for pediatric Tourette’s syndrome.

404,BMY,Bristol's Opdivo cuts risk of lung cancer death for some,"Chicago (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s drug, Opdivo, improved survival in a trial of patients with the most common form of lung cancer, but it did not work in patients who tested negative for a specific protein in their tumors, leading to a nearly 7 percent sell-off in the company’s shares on Friday. The Phase III trial found that Opdivo, part of a new class of drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, reduced by 27 percent the risk of death from advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), compared with chemotherapy. The benefit reached 60 percent for patients with the highest levels of the PD-L1 protein. “Opdivo did not work in PD-L1 negative patients,” said Amit Roy, an analyst at research group Foveal. “That is nearly half of the non-squamous patients.” He said many investors had expected that the drug might be effective regardless of PD-L1 levels, but the results indicate regulators would likely restrict usage to patients who test positive for the protein. The Bristol drug was approved by U.S. regulators in December to treat advanced melanoma and competes with Keytruda from Merck & Co Inc. The current approvals for both drugs do not require testing patients for PD-L1. Investors have been keeping a close eye on Opdivo’s performance in lung cancer, the most common form of the disease worldwide, and a far larger market. Opdivo was cleared in March to treat the less-common squamous type of NSCLC. Between 85 percent and 90 percent of all lung cancers are NSCLC, and more than two-thirds of those are the non-squamous type, according to the American Cancer Society. Bristol shares fell $4.55, or 6.6 percent, to close at $64.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. This latest trial, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, involved 582 previously treated patients with non-squamous NSCLC. “This marks the end of the chemotherapy era in second-line treatment of lung cancer,” said Fouad Namouni, who oversees Opdivo development at Bristol-Myers. He said the company is talking with the Food and Drug Administration about applying to expand approval for Opdivo, or nivolumab, to include advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Bristol is also studying Opdivo on its own and in combination with another immunotherapy called Yervoy as an initial treatment for lung cancer. The trial results showed median overall survival of 12.2 months for the Opdivo group compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with docetaxel. For the subgroup of patients with high levels of PD-L1, which is used by tumors to evade the body’s defenses, median survival exceeded 17 months with Opdivo, compared with 9 months for chemotherapy patients. One in 10 Opdivo patients in the trial experienced serious side effects, compared with more than half of patients in the chemotherapy group. Roy said eventual use of rival immunotherapy drugs being developed by Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc will also likely be restricted based on biomarker levels. The ASCO conference also featured results from an early-stage study of Opdivo showing that 19 percent of patients with advanced liver cancer responded to the antibody with tumor shrinkage of more than 30 percent. Researchers said that compares with a response rate of just 2 percent for Nexavar, the only currently approved systemic treatment for advanced liver cancer.

He was the leader on research and development of Bristol-Myers immunotherapy cancer treatments and had access to non-public information about the company’s drug pipeline strategies, the documents said. Berman, who held the title of vice president and leader of Bristol’s Immuno-oncology Exploratory Development Team, was not immediately reachable by phone or through his LinkedIn social media account. Documents identified him as living in Princeton, New Jersey. AstraZeneca declined to comment. According to the suit, Bristol and AstraZeneca are directly competing on the development of treatments based on the receptor proteins found on T-cells and in particular, the programmed death receptor, commonly referred to as PD-1. Bristol has asked the court to prevent Berman from working for AstraZeneca for twelve months and to prevent him from using the company’s confidential information at any time. Bristol-Myers spokeswoman Laura Hortas said in a statement that the company “is committed to protecting the confidentiality of proprietary information about its leading immuno-oncology portfolio and business.” ",5292015,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristol-myers-astrazeneca-court/bristol-myers-sues-immunotherapy-exec-who-left-for-astrazeneca-idUSL1N0YK1H220150529

410,BMY,Bristol's Opdivo reduces risk of death from common lung cancer,"Chicago May 29 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s  drug, Opdivo, improved survival for patients with the most common form of lung cancer, nearly doubling survival for those with high levels of a specific protein in their tumors compared with chemotherapy, according to clinical trial results presented on Friday. The trial found that Opdivo, part of a new class of drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, reduced by 27 percent the risk of death from advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), compared with chemotherapy. The benefit reached 60 percent for patients with the highest levels of the PD-L1 protein. The Bristol drug was approved by U.S. regulators in December to treat advanced melanoma and competes with Keytruda from Merck & Co Inc. Investors have been keeping a close eye on Opdivo’s performance in lung cancer, the most common form of the disease worldwide, and a far larger market. Opdivo was cleared in March to treat the less-common squamous type of NSCLC. Between 85 percent and 90 percent of all lung cancers are NSCLC, and more than two-thirds of those are the non-squamous type, according to the American Cancer Society. This latest trial, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, involved 582 previously treated patients with non-squamous NSCLC. “This marks the end of the chemotherapy era in second-line treatment of lung cancer,” said Fouad Namouni, who oversees Opdivo development at Bristol-Myers. He said the company is talking with the Food and Drug Administration about applying to expand approval for Opdivo, or nivolumab, to include advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Bristol is also studying Opdivo on its own and in combination with another immunotherapy called Yervoy as an initial treatment for lung cancer. The trial results showed median overall survival of 12.2 months for the Opdivo group compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with docetaxel. For the subgroup of patients with high levels of PD-L1, which is used by tumors to evade the body’s defenses, median survival exceeded 17 months with Opdivo, compared with 9 months for chemotherapy patients. “While nivolumab appears to be more potent against this most common lung cancer, it is important to note that it is also far easier on patients compared to the standard second-line treatment,” said Dr. Luis Paz-Ares, a professor of medicine at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid, and the study’s lead author. One in 10 Opdivo patients in the trial experienced serious side effects, compared with more than half of patients in the chemotherapy group. The ASCO conference also featured results from an early-stage study of Opdivo showing that 19 percent of patients with advanced liver cancer responded to the antibody with tumor shrinkage of more than 30 percent. Researchers said that compares with a response rate of just 2 percent for Nexavar, the only currently approved systemic treatment for advanced liver cancer.

Dixy already owns 33 percent of Russian company Bristol’s shares. It bought a 31.8 percent stake in May for 1.78 billion roubles ($32 million) from Russian tobacco distributor Megapolis, increasing its interest from 1.2 percent. “We are going to buy the Bristol retail chain, a controlling stake, in the second part (of the year), pretty much soon, in the next couple of months,” Rybasov told a conference call. He added that in connection with the acquisition the company’s total debt could rise by between 6 billion and 8 billion roubles this year although the company did not have a specific target as to how much new debt it would raise. The Bristol chain comprises more than 1,400 stores in some 400 Russian cities. It generated 7.7 billion roubles in revenues last year, according to Renaissance Capital. Dixy Chief Executive Ilya Yakubson told Reuters the acquisition of Bristol, which also sells food, would allow it to expand in a smaller store format of 100-120 square metres. “That is the type of a neighbourhood convenience store which comes in the stead of kiosks, pavilions, etc. A small shop which sells everything you may need to buy quickly,” Yakubson said on the sidelines of a retail conference on Thursday.

427,BMY,Bristol pairs Yervoy safely with Opdivo vs lung cancer,"(Reuters) - An early-stage study shows Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Opdivo treatment can be safely and effectively paired with relatively low and infrequent dosages of the company’s other immunotherapy, Yervoy, for patients with previously untreated lung cancer, researchers said on Monday. Opdivo, whose chemical name is nivolumab, is approved to treat advanced melanoma and the less-common squamous type of non-small cell lung cancer. In a recent late-stage study, it improved survival compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with the more common non-squamous form of lung cancer. To bolster the effectiveness of Opdivo, Bristol-Myers is testing it in combination with Yervoy, which is approved to treat melanoma and, like Opdivo, takes the brakes off the immune system. Company researchers on Monday released updated data from a Phase I study, called Check Mate-12, that involved 148 previously untreated patients with squamous and non-squamous lung cancer. It compared results of four available drug regimens that paired Opdivo and Yervoy. In melanoma studies, Opdivo’s effectiveness has been greatly enhanced by adding Yervoy, but with a worrisome increase in side effects. Yervoy, typically taken in 3 milligram doses every three weeks for melanoma, in the lung cancer trial was given at a 1 milligram dose every six weeks in one arm of the study, and at 1 milligram every 12 weeks in another arm. It was taken with 3 milligram doses of Opdivo every two weeks, the way it is used against melanoma and previously treated squamous lung cancer. Some 39 percent of patients taking Opdivo plus Yervoy every 12 weeks saw some reduction in tumors, similar to the 31 percent reduction for those taking Yervoy every 6 weeks. Importantly, 10 percent or fewer of patients in the two arms dropped out of the study because of side effects, little different from those who have taken Opdivo alone in other study arms and half the dropout rate seen among patients that have taken Opdivo with chemotherapy. “A well tolerated regimen has been achieved, with ability to maintain the additive benefit of (Yervoy)” to Opdivo, Michael Giordano, head of Bristol-Myers’ immuno-oncology program, said in an interview. Opdivo and a similar treatment from Merck & Co called Keytruda block a protein called PD-1 whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. Wall Street expects such drugs to capture combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020.   Results of the study were released at the World Conference on Lung Cancer being held in Denver.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said the FDA had given the green light to combine its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy to treat advanced or inoperable melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, in patients who do not have a mutation of a gene called BRAF. The approval sets the scene for many more such combinations of expensive treatments currently undergoing clinical trials by numerous drugmakers at a time when the soaring cost of prescription medicines have come under intense criticism from politicians, medical societies and patient advocacy groups alike. Merck & Co, for example, is testing its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with other cancer treatments in at least 10 studies. The accelerated approval was based on results of a trial in which far more patients responded to the combination than to Yervoy alone, and is contingent on Bristol-Myers replicating those results in a larger ongoing Phase III study. Four doses of the combination would cost $141,000, about 6 percent more than the cost of Yervoy alone. Those who respond to the combination would continue receiving Opdivo alone, bringing the cost for a year of treatment to $256,000, a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman told Reuters. Opdivo and Yervoy, bought separately, would cost about $295,000 for just under a year’s treatment, according to calculations by cancer specialist Leonard Saltz. The drugs block mechanisms which cancer uses to keep the immune system from attacking tumors. Wall Street analysts forecast sales of immuno-oncology drugs exceeding $20 billion a year by 2020. In the trial that led to approval, 60 percent of combination patients experienced significant tumor shrinkage, including 17 percent who were cancer free, compared with an 11 percent response rate for Yervoy alone. The combination delayed worsening of the cancer for an average of 8.9 months, only four months longer than for Yervoy. Bristol does not yet have data available showing the combination helps patients live longer, likely critical to wide acceptance by doctors. Yervoy was approved in 2011 and Opdivo in late 2014. The two drugs had sales of $783 million in the first half of this year. There are about 11,000 U.S. patients with untreated advanced melanoma. Those without the BRAF gene mutation account for 55 percent to 60 percent of cases, Bristol said. The company is also testing the combination in kidney cancer and the far-larger lung cancer population.

432,BMY,UPDATE 3-U.S. FDA expands approval of Merck's Keytruda to lung cancer,"(Adds analyst comment, updates share prices) By Deena Beasley and Natalie Grover Oct 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Merck & Co Inc’s immunotherapy, Keytruda, for patients with the most common form of lung cancer whose tumors produce a specific biological marker. The FDA approval for Keytruda in advanced non-small cell lung cancer is for patients whose tumors express PD-L1, a protein targeted by the drug, and includes a companion diagnostic, made by a unit of Agilent Technologies Inc, to measure those protein levels. A Merck spokeswoman said clinical trials found that 22 percent of patients with this type of cancer had PD-L1 scores of at least 50 percent. “The restricted label is generally in line with expectations and is likely to broaden over time as data from additional trials support Keytruda’s efficacy in a larger patient population,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. The FDA decision “has the potential to transform the way that lung cancer is treated,” Dr. Edward Garon, associate clinical professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and a lead investigator on Keytruda clinical trials, said in a statement. Merck said the price of Keytruda for health insurers and other payers is around $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year. Keytruda and another similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient’s own immune system to attack the cancer. Wall Street analysts expect cancer immunotherapies to earn combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020. Bristol’s Opdivo is approved by the FDA to treat melanoma as well as squamous non-small cell lung cancer, a smaller subset of the disease, but without a requirement for protein testing. Keytruda, now approved for both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, is also approved to treat patients with advanced melanoma. (1.usa.gov/1P9wW3p) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with an estimated 221,000 new cases diagnosed and 158,000 deaths this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Shares of Merck rose 1.6 percent, or 77 cents, to close at $50.14 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Bristol-Myers rose 3.6 percent, or $2.18, to close at $62.23.

434,BMY,UPDATE 1-FDA expands lung cancer approval for Bristol-Myers' drug,"(Adds approval details, patient population, background, share price, byline) By Bill Berkrot Oct 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday expanded its approval of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s  immunotherapy drug Opdivo for patients with an additional form of advanced lung cancer. The agency said Opdivo may now be used in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Opdivo, known chemically as nivolumab, was first approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, and later for squamous non-small cell lung cancer. While the expanded approval was widely expected based on clinical trial data, the FDA announcement came about three months ahead of the agency’s mid-January action data. Lung cancer has a far larger patient population than melanoma, with NSCLC accounting for up to 90 percent of all cases, and is seen as a more lucrative use for the new medicines like Opdivo that help the immune system fight the disease. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with an estimated 221,200 new diagnoses and 158,040 deaths in 2015, the FDA said. The squamous cell variety accounts about 25 percent to 30 percent of NSCLC cases, with non-squamous accounting for about 45 percent to 60 percent. Squamous and non-squamous refers to the type of cells in which the cancer occurs, and they tend to be situated in different parts of the lung. Opdivo competes with an immunotherapy drug from Merck & Co  called Keytruda. Bristol recently began a high-profile direct-to-consumer ad campaign for Opdivo in lung cancer, with commercials running on prime-time network television shows. Bristol-Myers shares were up 58 cents, or about 1 percent, at $61.09 on the New York Stock Exchange.

441,BMY,FDA expands use of Bristol Myers' cancer drug Yervoy,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the use of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s skin cancer drug, Yervoy, as an additional therapy for patients with late-stage melanoma. This approval extends Yervoy’s use to patients with stage III melanoma, who have a high risk of recurrence after surgery, the agency said on Wednesday.  Due to the potential for fatal adverse reactions and unusual severe side effects with Yervoy, the drug’s label carries a boxed warning - reserved for the most serious of risks. Treatment for stage III patients has historically been challenging, with fewer options available. A diagnosis means that melanoma cells have been found in lymph nodes, and that the patient will require surgery.  Yervoy, administered intravenously, was originally approved in 2011 to treat late-stage melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, and  will lead to an estimated 73,870 new cases and 9,940 deaths this year, the National Cancer Institute estimates.

443,BMY,CORRECTED-WRAPUP 1-Top U.S. drugmakers ride new products to strong results,"(In Oct 27 item, in paragraph 9 corrects number of Ibrance patients to 15,000 from 50,000) By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Growing sales of expensive new cancer drugs and other newer medicines propelled top U.S. drugmakers Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to stronger-than-expected third-quarter profits. The results, announced on Tuesday, demonstrate that the “patent cliff” that had been hurting earnings as huge-selling drugs like Pfizer’s Lipitor and Bristol’s Plavix went generic is now well behind these companies. Shares of all three rose as they also modestly raised their full-year forecasts. Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo, both immunotherapies for advanced melanoma and lung cancer, and Pfizer’s Ibrance for breast cancer are off to strong starts, with Wall Street forecasting eventual multibillion-dollar sales. Keytruda and Opdivo list for about $150,000 for a year of treatment, and Ibrance goes for about $118,000. In addition, blood clot and stroke preventer Eliquis, which Pfizer and Bristol share, has begun to take off and is on track for annual sales of nearly $2 billion. “This is the best innovation-based new product cycle in these companies’ storied histories,” said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. “Eliquis is just knocking the cover off the ball.” Merck and Bristol are testing their new immuno-oncology drugs in numerous combinations and in dozens of different types of cancer. Pfizer said it expected to introduce a drug from the same PD-1 class as Opdivo and Keytruda in 2017, with one or more additional launches each year through 2022. It plans to have 10 new immuno-oncology drugs in clinical testing by next year. The largest U.S. drugmaker said 15,000 U.S. patients had used Ibrance, which is awaiting European approval. It had sales of $230 million for the quarter. “A whole slew of (future) blockbuster drugs are getting traction today,” said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management. “The pipelines look great.” The three drugmakers all invest heavily in research and development, which led to the new medicines. That stands in stark contrast to the business model of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which is known for buying companies and slashing R&D.; The Canadian company has come under fire for its business practices, which include sharply raising prices of the drugs it acquires. The high cost of prescription drugs has become a major topic of the current U.S. presidential campaign, with calls by candidates and others to rein in prices and out-of-pocket expenses to patients. Merck Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier called the pricing discussions “a lot of noise” that he does not believe will tarnish the industry’s reputation. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said he believed that higher co-pays demanded by insurers were more of a problem for patients than prices charged by drugmakers. “We must preserve the market-based system in the U.S. that enables us to develop breakthrough treatments and cures for patients,” Read said. Bristol-Myers shares were up 2.5 percent at midday, while Pfizer rose 2.2 percent, and Merck gained 1.4 percent.

447,BMY,UPDATE 1-Russian watchdog rejects retailer Dixy's plan to buy rival Bristol,"(Adds Dixy comment, share price) MOSCOW, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Russia’s competition watchdog FAS has blocked food retailer Dixy Group’s bid to buy a controlling stake in tobacco and spirits chain Bristol. The statement from the regulator said Dixy had failed to provide requested materials that would allow FAS to reach a conclusion on whether the deal would damage competition. Dixy declined to comment on the FAS decision but said its board would meet soon to discuss further steps. The company, which owns 33 percent of Bristol, said in June it planned to gain control of the 1,400-store Russian chain by buying more shares from a company controlled by its own biggest shareholder. Some analysts have questioned the deal at a time when Dixy’s revenue growth has slowed, hurt by subdued consumer sentiment against a backdrop of high inflation. Dixy Chief Executive Ilya Yakubson flagged in an interview at the Reuters Russia Investment Summit in September that the company might end up scrapping the deal. Its shares closed 1.5 percent higher on Friday against a 0.7 percent drop in the broader market index.

448,BMY,UPDATE 1-Russia's Dixy says likely to sell stake in rival Bristol,"(Recasts with company comments on Bristol investment, adds CEO comments on like-for-like sales in Q4 and view on 2016) By Maria Kiselyova MOSCOW, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Russian food retailer Dixy  said on Friday it could sell its 33 percent interest in tobacco and spirits chain Bristol after Russia’s competition watchdog blocked its attempt to take a bigger stake. “There is a high chance that (our) current stake in Bristol project will be sold back to our controlling stakeholders,” Chief Financial Officer Fedor Rybasov said. He added the board was expected to take a decision in two weeks’ time and that there was “a high chance” that the sale would be done on the same terms as its acquisition. Russia’s No.4 grocery chain by sales, which operates mostly small neighbourhood stores, said in June it planned to gain control of the 1,400-store Bristol after buying 31.8 percent from a firm controlled by its own biggest shareholder. Analysts questioned the deal at a time when Dixy’s revenue growth slowed sharply, hurt by subdued consumer sentiment and intensified competition from the discount stores of X5  and Magnit . Dixy cut its 2015 sales growth forecast in August to 16-20 percent from 20-25 percent, saying it had been slow to react to a drop in consumer purchasing power. Chief Executive Ilya Yakubson told analysts on Friday Dixy was sticking to the guidance and expected like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter to grow after they fell 1.8 percent in July-September. He forecast 2016 to be “much more positive” than 2015 although said he would not give any guidance until March. Russia’s competition watchdog FAS last week blocked Dixy’s  plan to buy more Bristol shares, saying the firm had failed to provide requested materials. Dixy bought 31.8 percent of Bristol for 1.8 billion roubles  ($28 million) from its controlling shareholder, tobacco distributor Megapolis, in May, adding to the 1.2 percent it already owned. It had said it planned to borrow in order to buy more Bristol shares and by October its net debt had risen to around 36 billion roubles from 25 billion at the end of 2014. Dixy said on Friday a resulting spike in finance costs and a share in Bristol’s net losses contributed to its net profit slipping into the red in the third quarter. It made a net loss of 843 million roubles ($13 million) after a profit a year ago, also due to a foreign exchange loss, while its core profit fell because of higher expansion costs.

449,BMY,Bristol-Myers signs deal with U.N. group for generic hepatitis C drug,"(Reuters) - A United Nations-backed organization working to cut the price of HIV drugs said it had signed a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to allow generic versions of the company’s hepatitis C drug to be sold in 112 low- and middle-income countries. The drug, Daklinza, is on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines. Hepatitis C affects about 150 million people globally and kills around half a million each year, the World Health Organisation estimates. The Medicines Patent Pool said on Monday that Daklinza would now be available to nearly two-thirds of people affected by the disease in low- and middle-income countries. The list price in the United States for Daklinza is $63,000 for a 12-week regimen, or about $750 per day at wholesale costs, according to pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts. Other drugs used to treat hepatitis C include Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi. A single Sovaldi pill costs $1,000 in the United States, according to Express Scripts. The deal with Bristol-Myers allows drugmakers anywhere in the world to develop generic versions of Daklinza. The Medicines Patent Pool had earlier signed a deal with Bristol-Myers for generic versions of its HIV treatment Reyataz.

The FDA said it approved the treatment, Empliciti, to be used in multiple myeloma patients in combination with Celgene Corp’s Revlimid and common anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone.  The National Cancer Institute estimates there will be 26,850 new cases of multiple myeloma and 11,240 related deaths in the United States in 2015.

456,BMY,New blood thinner 'antidote' to help doctors move past warfarin,"NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - A new class of blood thinners that competes with widely used warfarin should get a boost next year when an “antidote” that can reverse the medications’ effects in an emergency is expected to enter the market, according to top U.S. heart doctors and investors. Xarelto, from Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson , and Eliquis, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, were approved as safer and more convenient alternatives for preventing blood clots and strokes than warfarin. But there was one hitch: there was no way to quickly restore normal clotting for patients in need of emergency surgery or to stop a major bleeding episode, leading many doctors to hold off on prescribing the drugs. “It may be uncommon, but they’re memorable when they happen,” Dr. Charles Pollack, an emergency physician at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, said of major bleeding events. “We didn’t have a specific reversal strategy for these drugs, and I think that left people feeling a bit insecure,” added Pollack, who has done clinical work on a recently approved antidote to Boehringer Ingelheim’s rival blood clot preventer Pradaxa. That is about to change. Small drugmaker Portola Pharmaceuticals this month applied for U.S. approval of a drug called andexanet alfa that rapidly reverses the effect of Xarelto and Eliquis. It is expected to enter the market in 2016. “It will make a big difference,” said Dr. Mariell Jessup, a cardiologist at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. “I have many physicians, particularly surgeons, who hate these drugs. They’re frightened of them because they’ve had to deal with the consequences of somebody coming in with trauma,” while using the new blood thinners. The new drugs cause fewer major bleeding episodes than warfarin and do not require dietary restrictions or constant monitoring as with the decades-old medicine. But major bleeding remains the most worrisome risk of all anti-coagulant therapy as it can be fatal or cause debilitating, long-term problems. Bristol-Myers reported $466 million in global third-quarter sales of Eliquis, which won U.S. approval at the end of 2012, about 18 months after Xarelto. J&J; posted U.S. Xarelto sales of $461 million in the quarter, while Bayer reported about $509 million in international sales. There is still a lot of room to grow as warfarin, also prescribed under the brand name Coumadin, commands some 60 percent of the blood thinner market. Morningstar expects annual sales for Xarelto and Eliquis could reach $8 billion for each. The treatments are about 70 times more expensive than pennies-a-day warfarin, according to Express Scripts Holding Co , the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager. But given the superior safety and convenience, Express Scripts said in a statement that “the overall value is likely justified.” Health insurer Aetna Inc expects approval of the Portola drug to gradually increase use of Xarelto and Eliquis, said Edmund Pezalla, Aetna’s national medical director for pharmaceutical policy and strategy. Xarelto and Eliquis are approved to treat patients with a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation that significantly increases stroke risk, as well as to prevent blood clots following hip or knee replacement, and to treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs for Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit, stressed Xarelto’s safety but said availability of Portola’s drug would enhance doctor comfort levels. The Xarelto partnership is seeking additional approved uses, with trials underway in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and for reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure or peripheral artery disease. Bristol and Pfizer have a direct-to-consumer television ad campaign to increase Eliquis awareness. “We believe that a reversal agent could be an important consideration for physicians when initiating Eliquis and switching appropriate patients from warfarin to Eliquis,” Bristol and Pfizer said in a joint statement. Portola’s reversal drug “will certainly help sales. Anybody who was waiting on the sidelines will not be fence-sitting anymore,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Capital Management, which holds Pfizer shares. The drug would become Portola’s first product on the market. Cowen and Co forecast $355 million in sales by 2020 for the antidote. Portola is also developing a drug to rival Xarelto and Eliquis. Duke University’s Dr. Jerrold Levy predicted that all hospitals will stock the Portola antidote. “It increases the safety margin,” Levy said.

458,BMY,"Bristol-Myers set to lead earnings parade in 2016, beyond","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Thursday positioned itself as a potential earnings pacesetter in 2016, with a forecast of up to 19 percent growth that eclipses profit gains expected by most other large drugmakers. Bolstered by blistering sales of its Opdivo immuno-oncology drug and its Eliquis blood clot preventer, Bristol-Myers  expects earnings this year of $2.30 to $2.40 per share. It earned $2.01 per share last year. In contrast, Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) on Thursday predicted relatively flat 2016 earnings following strong gains last year, when sales of new cancer and diabetes drugs offset sharp declines in older medicines. Swiss rivals Roche Holding AG ROG.VX and Novartis AG NOVN.VX have also predicted flat 2016 earnings, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) expects growth of 3.6 percent to 6.2 percent, driven by sales of newer medicines. Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) have not yet provided 2016 earnings expectations, but Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expects them next week to forecast growth of 4.2 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Bristol-Myers, whose $17 billion in annual sales are far below its industry peers, has downsized in recent years by selling off its diabetes drugs and cutting costs. “They’ve made courageous decisions to streamline expenses, and their reduced revenue base will also fuel earnings growth,” said Guggenheim Partners analyst Tony Butler. Ashtyn Evans, an analyst with Edward Jones, said she expects Opdivo eventually to generate annual sales of more than $8 billion. Half of Bristol-Myers’ revenue will likely come from Opdivo and other cancer drugs by 2020, Evans said, allowing the company to generate average annual earnings growth in the 20 percent range for the next three to five years. “Bristol is a lot different than it was just a few years ago,” Evans said, citing its razor focus on potentially lucrative immuno-oncology drugs, while also developing cardiovascular and anti-inflammation medicines. Sales of Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers markets with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), more than doubled to $602 million in the quarter. The pill was approved in 2012 to prevent blood clots among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Growing numbers of doctors are prescribing it as a safer and more-effective alternative to longstanding oral therapy warfarin. Bristol’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings were also due to soaring sales of Opdivo, a new treatment for melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer that is also being tested against other cancers. Sales of the injectable medicine, which was approved in late 2014 and works by taking the brakes off the immune system, jumped to $475 million.    The Princeton, New Jersey-based company said on Thursday it had halted a large trial of Opdivo after a monitoring committee concluded that head and neck cancer patients taking the drug survived longer than those taking standard chemotherapy. Analysts said Opdivo could pick up $1 billion in eventual sales for head and neck cancer, if it is approved for that indication.  Earlier on Thursday, Roche spooked investors by forecasting stagnant 2016 earnings. Analysts cited concern that growth could slow for Roche’s three big cancer treatments: Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin. Novartis on Wednesday also forecast flat 2016 results, amid generic competition for its Gleevec leukemia drug and disappointing sales of new heart failure medicine, Entresto.

The pill was approved in 2012 to prevent blood clots among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Its global sales had risen slowly until the past year, when far more doctors began prescribing it as a safer and more-effective alternative to longstanding oral therapy warfarin. Bristol-Myers results also benefited from gangbuster sales of Opdivo, a new treatment for melanoma and lung cancer that is also being tested against a range of other cancers. The injectable medicine, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, generated sales of $475 million. Bristol said it lost $138 million, or 8 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit of $13 million, or 1 cent per share. Excluding special items, including those from acquisitions of drugmakers Five Prime Therapeutics and Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc, Bristol earned 38 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 28 cents. Revenue rose 1 percent to $4.29 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $4.15 billion. Sales would have risen 6 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales outside the United States.

471,BMY,Bristol raises 2016 forecast after earnings beat,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) ratcheted up its 2016 profit view after trouncing first-quarter sales and earnings forecasts on strong demand for its new Opdivo immuno-oncology drug and Eliquis blood clot preventer. The U.S. drugmaker, whose shares rose nearly 4 percent, said on Thursday that net income rose to $1.20 billion, or 71 cents per share, from $1.19 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, including litigation costs, Bristol-Myers earned 74 cents per share, well above the analysts’ average estimate of 65 cents compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 9 percent to $4.39 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts of $4.25 billion. It would have increased 11 percent if not for the strong dollar, which lowers the value of sales outside the United States. Based on the first-quarter results, Bristol-Myers said it expected full-year earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share. In January it had forecast $2.30 to $2.40.  The updated outlook would reflect earnings growth of up to 29 percent from last year. Sales of Opdivo, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, soared 40 percent to $704 million in the quarter, putting them on track for nearly $3 billion this year. Approved in late 2014 to treat melanoma, Opdivo later won approvals to treat lung and kidney cancer and is being tested against a wide array of other types of cancer. The drug competes with Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Keytruda, a similar treatment that has gotten off to a far slower start since being approved in September 2014. But sales of Yervoy, another Bristol-Myers treatment for melanoma, fell 19 percent to $263 million as doctors opted instead for Opdivo and Keytruda, which are deemed less toxic.    Sales of Eliquis, used to prevent blood clots and strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, more than doubled to $734 million. The pill, sold in partnership with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is taking flight as growing numbers of doctors prescribe it as a safer and more-convenient alternative to longtime generic treatment warfarin.  Shares of Bristol-Myers were up 3.7 percent at $72.82 in afternoon trading.

479,BMY,Pascal Soriot's big experiment: reinventing AstraZeneca,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot is a big believer in science, and the biggest experiment of his career is the reinvention of the drugmaker.  The $500 million corporate headquarters and research hub emerging amid cranes on the southern edge of the university town of Cambridge symbolizes his aim to create a science-led company with uniquely close ties to academia. For employees, these are uncomfortable times. Thousands of job have been cut globally at the company in the past three years, with more to come. Some staff are also reluctant to move to Cambridge, with its high house prices, from north-west England where the company has a strong presence dating from its time as part of the old ICI chemicals empire.  Soriot, however, relishes the chance to shake things up by setting up home near world-renowned university labs - where he says the firm is better placed to hire the “best of the best” - while shrinking its operations to focus on core areas like cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular disease.  “In the past, we’ve had too much stability,” the CEO said in an interview with Reuters that gives some of the clearest indications yet of the scale of the cultural change he intends to push through at the company.   “We had people who never moved and turnover of 1 or 2 percent. That might sound good but it’s actually not, because you don’t have new ideas flowing through the place.”  The stakes are high. Two years after spurning a $100 billion bid from Pfizer, AstraZeneca is going through the biggest “cliff” of patent expiries the drug industry has ever seen, wiping off more than half of its sales - or $17 billion - in 2011-2017. That has forced Soriot to seek new routes to profit and his overhaul of the company is now entering a pivotal phase, with make-or-break trial results and drug approvals due over the next 12 months, coinciding with the move to Cambridge.  As with any experiment, the outcome of Soriot’s reinvention is uncertain - and investors are divided.  Neil Woodford of Woodford Investment Management, the seventh largest AstraZeneca shareholder, is convinced the company will re-emerge as a successful player focused on specialty drugs like cancer treatments rather than mass-market medicines. He has added to his stake recently.  But Andy Smith, chief investment officer at fund manager Mann Bioinvest, says Soriot has yet to prove his plan will pay off. “The big question hanging over his tenure is how close he can get to showing actual value from the pipeline, rather than promised value,” he said.   No other pharmaceutical company has moved itself wholesale to an academic center. Soriot argues the move is already paying off for some 1,600 staff, nearly a quarter of its UK workforce, now in rented space around Cambridge who are liaising far more closely with academic researchers. “It is fundamentally changing the way we operate,” said the 56-year-old, who trained as a veterinarian in France. Most of the staff will move into the new building from late 2017. Soriot said he had no choice but to overhaul AstraZeneca when he took over in October 2012, due to the patent “cliff”. “The company was imploding,” he said bluntly. His answer has been to invest in internal research and bolt-on acquisitions, including more than $7 billion of deals at the end of 2015, to rebuild the company’s drug pipeline.     This includes cancer drugs that boost the immune system, which are the hottest area of drug research right now, although AstraZeneca also has high hopes for other approaches to fighting tumors. That makes oncology the area with the greatest potential to drive future sales at AstraZeneca, as the company grapples with a wave of patent expiries on older products, such as its cholesterol fighter Crestor and stomach acid pill Nexium. Investors are anxious for proof Soriot’s prescription will work, since AstraZeneca shares are languishing 28 percent below the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer and earnings are expected to fall in 2016 and 2017. AstraZeneca has also had to cope recently with some senior executive departures, including the loss on Tuesday of its North America head to Novartis.  At the height of the takeover battle, the company went public with a forecast that sales would rise by three-quarters to $45 billion by 2023 - a hostage to fortune, perhaps, but a target Soriot remains confident will be met.  “I might not be here to see if we achieve that in 2023 but people won’t have to wait until then. If we succeed, the share price will reflect the value of the company much earlier than that,” he said. “I think it is going to take another 12 months and then hopefully we can show people what they want to see.”      So far, there have been some steps forward, like success with lung cancer drug Tagrisso and with good results for a new asthma drug.   But there have also been setbacks, including the loss of a fast-to-market opportunity for AstraZeneca’s big immuno-oncology hope durvalumab.  The latter has increased the pressure to prove that a combination treatment mixing durvalumab and tremelimumab can help in lung cancer, giving AstraZeneca a foothold in a market currently dominated by Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Pascal has played his hand well but now he’s at the point where it gets harder,” said one top executive at a rival company. “He’s going down to the valley floor on earnings and we don’t know how the clinical data will play out to get the business up the other side.”     AstraZeneca has also used so-called externalization income from licensing out non-core products to underpin profits, leading to criticism over earnings quality from some analysts.   With R&D; spending equivalent to 24 percent of sales, AstraZeneca’s science budget exceeds the industry average. But Soriot aims to push selling, general and administrative expenses down to 30-32 percent from 35 percent.  The CEO says investors need patience to see through a turnaround story that, with luck, will mirror the recovery Bristol-Myers, now the star of the pharma sector. “There will be a tipping point where people see a sufficient number of projects progressing positively and then they can see the future is bright.” ",5182016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-ceo-insight/pascal-soriots-big-experiment-reinventing-astrazeneca-idUSKCN0Y90LS

496,BMY,Old pharma sees new profit cure in cancer drugs,"(Reuters) - Some of the world’s largest drug companies are taking out their checkbooks for acquisitions of smaller peers whose cancer drugs have the potential to cure not just patients, but corporate growth prospects as well. After decades in which progress meant extending life by weeks or months, new cancer treatments hold promise of adding years to patients’ lives and billions of dollars in revenue to the companies that own them. Some of the most promising, known as immunotherapy, harness the body’s own defense system to fight cancer. For many pharmaceutical companies, this wave of innovation couldn’t have come at a better time. A generation of mainstay drugs have gone off patent, raising the stakes for companies vying for a foothold in the burgeoning oncology market. In recent months, executives at many big pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in building cancer treatment portfolios through acquisitions. They range from well-established incumbents, such as Roche Holding AG and Amgen Inc, to relative outsiders, including Sanofi and Gilead, according to public statements from the companies and several sources familiar with the companies plans and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Amgen declined to comment. Roche, Sanofi and Gilead did not respond to requests to comment. Among the most logical acquisition targets are Incyte Corporation and Seattle Genetics, which have respective market capitalizations of about $16 billion and $6 billion, said Michael King, a biotechnology analyst at JMP Securities. Incyte’s blood cancer drug, Jakafi, produced more than $600 million in sales last year. Seattle Genetic’s lymphoma drug, ADCETRIS, earned revenues of nearly $450 million. Both companies declined to comment. The acquisition of promising cancer drugs is “going to be a major theme in the life sciences sector for the next several years,” said Kennen MacKay, a biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. Acquisitions of cancer drug companies accounted for about 20 percent of the $63 billion in pharmaceutical and biotech M&A; announced this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Cancer deals accounted for a smaller share - 16 percent - of a larger pharmaceutical M&A; pie during the first half of 2015. Deals involving cancer drugs are expected to rise in the second half of the year, as corporate boards of potential target companies begin to accept the lower valuations the sector has seen in recent months and become more open to deals. The Nasdaq Biotech Index, a common measure of life sciences companies’ performance, has plunged more than 30 percent from 2015 highs, as political criticism of drug prices fueled investor concerns. Global spending on cancer drugs is on the rise and may reach $178 billion by 2020, up from $107 billion in 2015, according to market research firm IMS Health. About half of that will occur in the United States. That makes oncology medication to be one of the single biggest anticipated drivers of prescription drug revenue growth over the next five years, according to data from consultancy Ernst and Young.  “I think an uptick in activity is very likely,” said Jeff Greene, global transactions leader for life sciences at EY. “We have seen some big deals already, and we are likely to see even more, large and small, in the second half of this year.”  Recent deals include AbbVie Inc’s $10 billion acquisition of lung cancer company Stemcentryx, Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ $1.5 billion takeover of leukemia drug maker Celator Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s roughly $500 million acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals. More dealmaking is on the way. Earlier this month, Medivation Inc, a U.S. prostate cancer drug company with a market capitalization of $10 billion, said it would open its books to Sanofi SA as part of a sale process that sources said also has attracted Pfizer Inc and Celgene Corp. For some, laying claim to a piece of the oncology sector’s blockbuster growth could help offset the waning fortunes of mature drugs. For example, Sanofi’s blockbuster diabetes drug, Lantus, will face heightened generic drug competition in December. Gilead faces increased pressure on its liver disease franchise, which makes up two-thirds of its revenues. Abbvie, which purchased two oncology companies in the past year, Pharmacyclics and Stemcentryx, is facing potential competition for its biggest drug, Humira, for arthritis. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel recently recommended approval of an application by Amgen to sell a similar product. Best equipped to play a leading role are major pharmaceutical companies because bringing the new generation of cancer medicines under development to market requires scale and resources. “Oncology is a go-big-or-go-home category,” said Brian Corvino, a life sciences consultant at Decision Resources Group. “The amount of investment to develop and commercialize oncology drugs is massive and only becomes efficient at a certain scale.” The benefits of scale have only grown in recent years, as insurance companies increasingly have demanded drug makers justify prices in terms of the value they add to patient’s health. A large player in oncology is better equipped to partner with health care providers to collect data on a drug’s efficacy and argue the case to major insurers, Corvino said. From an acquirer’s perspective, the most attractive targets are companies with drugs that are already generating some revenue and are treating diseases where competition is scant. “For players that are looking to build an oncology presence, you need to buy a company that already has a blockbuster out there,” MacKay said. Companies whose drugs are still in development pose greater risk. Shares of Juno Therapeutics, for example, dropped about 30 percent earlier this month when the FDA placed a hold on a clinical trial for its main leukemia drug after two people died. The hold was later reversed and the stock partly recovered. ",7192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oncology-m-a/old-pharma-sees-new-profit-cure-in-cancer-drugs-idUSKCN0ZZ0BG

505,BMY,Bristol-Myers' Opdivo fails lung cancer trial; shares plunge,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said its blockbuster Opdivo immunotherapy failed to slow progression of symptoms in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, a major setback expected to benefit Merck & Co’s rival medicine. Shares of Bristol-Myers fell almost 16 percent to $63.54 on Friday after the company announced failure of the late-stage trial. Shares of Merck gained 8.7 percent to $62.89.  “This is the worst-case scenario” for Opdivo and Bristol-Myers, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. “There appears to be no silver lining.” Opdivo had been considered the clear leader in a costly new class of medicines called checkpoint inhibitors that work by taking the brakes off the immune system. Its second-quarter sales of $840 million were more than double those of Merck’s Keytruda.  Opdivo won approval in March 2015 for treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had previously failed to benefit from chemotherapy. Six months later, Keytruda received approval for a similar patient population.  Meanwhile, both companies raced to complete large trials to see if their drugs, which each cost about $150,000 a year, would also benefit patients who had never previously been treated for the most common form of lung cancer. The trials compared the drugs against chemotherapy. “Obviously the results of this trial are disappointing,” Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio said in an interview, saying that the data suggests there is no role in the foreseeable future for Opdivo as a standalone medicine for previously untreated lung cancer. Patients in the Opdivo trial had tumors with low levels of PD-L1, a protein whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors. Those in the successful Merck trial, by contrast, were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1 and represented a smaller percentage of the lung cancer population. Caforio said the best hope now for Opdivo in front-line treatment of lung cancer is combination therapy. The company is conducting a late-stage study with more than 2,000 patients in which Opdivo will be combined with Bristol-Myers’ other approved immunotherapy, Yervoy. The data is expected by early 2018. “That study will provide the definitive answer of the role of combination immunotherapy in the front-line lung cancer setting,” he said. Data in June from a large clinical study showed Keytruda was effective in newly treated patients, not only in delaying progression of lung cancer symptoms but also in prolonging survival. The trial was stopped so that all patients could receive Keytruda. The data spurred hopes that U.S. regulators would soon expand approved use of the Merck drug. Complete data for the study has not yet been released.  Now that Bristol-Myers’ drug has failed in that effort, Merck’s medicine could have a better chance to catch up with Opdivo’s far larger sales.  Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Opdivo, Keytruda and similar drugs in development had been expected to capture peak annual combined sales of $10 billion to $15 billion from lung cancer, with Bristol-Myers winning the lion’s share. “Today’s news very much helps level the playing field and is a major boost for Merck,” Anderson said in a research note. Opdivo and Keytruda are also approved to treat advanced melanoma and are being studied against a wide range of other types of cancer.

508,BMY,"AstraZeneca hits 2014 Pfizer bid price, helped by Bristol's woes","LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shares hit a record high on Friday, breaching for the first time the 55 pounds a share level offered by Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014 during the U.S. group’s abortive $100 billion attempt to buy the drugmaker. The British firm’s stock has been on a roll recently, helped by a falling pound and speculation that Switzerland’s Novartis (NOVN.S) might be next to launch a bid. However, the shares were lifted to a high of 55.05 pounds by the misfortunes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N). The failure of Bristol’s immunotherapy drug Opdivo to slow disease progression in previously untreated patients with lung cancer as hoped was seen by investors as good news for rivals Merck & Co (MRK.N) and AstraZeneca. Analysts at Leerink, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank said the negative result with Opdivo increased the potential market opportunity for AstraZeneca’s keenly watched combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab. Crucial clinical trial results with durvalumab, both on its own and in combination with tremelimumab, are due next year. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes AstraZeneca can become a major player in cancer drugs that bolster the immune system. And its ability to carve out billions of dollars in potential sales hinges not only on the effectiveness of its own products but on the competitive profile of rivals.

517,BMY,Bristol drug flop opens big cancer opportunity: AstraZeneca CEO,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The failure of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s blockbuster Opdivo immunotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients has opened up the market for AstraZeneca, its chief executive believes. “Suddenly, this trial news opens quite some opportunities for us, in both monotherapy and combination therapy,” Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told Reuters on Saturday, in his first comments since the Opdivo trial flop in August. Soriot is in Copenhagen for the European Society for Medical Oncology congress, where he and his team will be scouring data from competitors to determine how best to fine-tune their own clinical work to maximize its chance of success. The timing has been fortuitous for the British drugmaker, which can now take advantage of the experience of its rivals. At stake is a chunk of a hugely promising new market for cancer treatments that fight tumors by boosting the immune system. Industry analysts forecast such drugs could eventually generate annual sales of $30 billion to $40 billion, with lung cancer seen as the biggest opportunity. Much of the clinical focus is on the best way to select patients likely to benefit from the new and expensive medicines, by using biomarkers to assess their tumors.  While the Opdivo trial included patients with low levels of a protein called PD-L1, a separate trial found Merck’s similar drug Keytruda worked well in a much smaller group of patients expressing at least 50 percent PD-L1. That gives AstraZeneca the opportunity to steer a path between its two rivals by refining the PD-L1 benchmarks used in its own keenly awaited clinical trial, known as MYSTIC, which is expected to report results early next year. “It gives us a chance to do what BMS was trying to do, but do it in a less risky manner, by expanding the population from the 50 percent PD-L1 cut-off to a bit broader,” Soriot said. AstraZeneca’s rival to Opdivo and Keytruda is durvalumab, which is being tested on its own and with another immunotherapy called tremelimumab. The British company is currently planning to look at how well its treatment fares among patients with a 25 percent PD-L1 expression level or more, but it has the flexibility to amend this. Roche also has a rival immunotherapy called Tecentriq, which has proved effective in previously treated lung cancer patients, and the fact that AstraZeneca looks like being fourth to market has been viewed negatively by many investors. Soriot argues this ignores the fact his company has the potential to leap ahead in combination therapy, which could well become the main choice for most lung cancer patients. “We’re coming from a place where everybody thought we were behind and we have a very good chance to play in both the monotherapy and combination segments,” Soriot said. “Even if BMS were to catch up with us in combination, there would still only be two companies with these regimens.” Currently, Bristol’s competing immunotherapy combination is not expected to produce clinical trial results until 2018. Furthermore, AstraZeneca has another card up its sleeve in the form of a so-called priority review voucher from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which Soriot said could be used, if needed, to help it seek rapid approval. “Being first is definitely important,” Soriot said.

518,BMY,Roche lung cancer drug success adds to pressure on Bristol,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Lung cancer patients on Roche’s immune system-boosting drug Tecentriq lived on average 4.2 months longer than those taking chemotherapy in a pivotal study, pressuring Bristol-Myers Squibb’s dominant position in the field. The trial involved second-line patients, who have already used chemotherapy, and it found the Roche drug worked even in people with low or no levels of a protein called PD-L1, which is often used to test suitability for immunotherapy. The study results were presented at the annual European Society of Medical Oncology congress on Sunday. Bristol’s Opdivo is currently the only immunotherapy drug approved without a PD-L1 test for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease. Merck & Co’s Keytruda requires a test.  That has favored Opdivo and fueled its sales, but the arrival of a rival with the same broad effectiveness now promises increased competition. U.S. regulators are due to decide whether to approve Tecentriq in lung cancer by Oct. 19. The Roche drug is already cleared for use in bladder cancer. Tecentriq, Opdivo and Keytruda are the first of a highly promising class of immunotherapy drugs that are revolutionizing cancer treatment and are tipped to generate huge sales. Lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, is the top commercial opportunity. Analysts believe Tecentriq sales across all cancers will reach $4 billion in 2021, according to consensus figures compiled by Thomson Reuters. In the 1,225-patient Roche study, the mean survival for patients on Tecentriq was 13.8 months, which was 27 percent better than the 9.6 months seen among those on docetaxel chemotherapy. The benefit of the new drug was greatest in patients with high levels of PD-L1 but even in people with no PD-L1 expression there was still a significant improvement. Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf said the findings suggested doctors had a problem if they planned to use a negative PD-L1 reading as a reason to exclude second-line NSCLC patients from treatment. Companies are also racing to prove that immunotherapy can help in first-line NSCLC, where it would replace chemotherapy as the initial drug given. Here, however, the idea of giving immunotherapy to all patients has proved problematic, as evidenced by the failure of a recent Bristol trial. Roche has eight late-stage Phase III lung studies under way evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other treatments in patients with early and advanced stages of lung cancer.

519,BMY,Merck drug shines in lung cancer and also works with chemo,"* Keytruda cuts risk of death 40 pct in big lung cancer study * Drug also improves outcomes when given with chemotherapy By Ben Hirschler COPENHAGEN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. In contrast to rival Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose Opdivo drug failed to help such first-line patients, Keytruda was targeted at people who express high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at the annual European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress. The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, viewed as the largest market. Results of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy. Results of Merck’s two trials were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet Oncology journal.

521,BMY,UPDATE 1-Bristol lung-cancer setback puts rival Merck drug in driver seat,"(Reuters) - New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co’s rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday.    The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol’s shares plunging 10 percent.    The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study.  Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them. Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda. The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial. Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those   concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant. “This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor’s level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines. Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy. Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. “Merck will completely ‘own’ the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really,” Anderson said. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, but analysts said they expect current off-label prescribing of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer to dry up now. In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer. Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are given every three weeks, while Opdivo is administered every two weeks, which is seen as a convenience disadvantage.   “The nearly inexplicable failure of (Opdivo) at every level of PD-L1 expression ... puts Merck in the driver’s seat in first-line lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months,” said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. Calling the Keytruda data “stunning,” Fernandez said, “We fully expect Merck to retain a significant place at the table long term.”    Bristol shares, which had already lost one quarter of their value since the initial trial data was disclosed in August, fell 10 percent $49.85, while Merck shares were up 1.7 percent at $63.84 after earlier rising more than 3 percent to a near 15-year high.

524,BMY,UPDATE 2-Roche bets on new cancer drugs to offset patent expiries,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche said on Thursday strong sales of new medicines like cancer immunotherapy drug Tecentriq would help to sustain the company’s growth as patents on older drugs start to expire. Chief Executive Severin Schwan is betting he can stay ahead of the sales erosion with new medicines that include five launched in 2016 alone. “That is an unprecedented number of launches of new medicines in a short period of time,” Schwan said on a conference call after Roche reported third-quarter sales figures. “Our product pipeline is developing very well.” The Swiss drugmaker’s three established cancer blockbusters Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, which account for annual sales of nearly 20 billion Swiss francs ($21 billion), all face biosimilar competition by the end of the decade. But so far this year, Tecentriq has won approval for bladder and lung cancer, Alecensa for lung cancer, Cotellic for skin cancer and Venclaxta for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Roche’s multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus is slated for U.S. approval before the year is over. Tecentriq has brought in 77 million Swiss francs ($78 million) since its U.S. approval in May for bladder cancer. That revenue is due to accelerate after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week gave the a green light for the drug to be used against lung cancer.  Analysts are counting on it, too, as revenue growth from broad-based cancer drug Avastin, Rituxan for blood cancer, and breast cancer therapy Herceptin begins to slow. All three missed analyst expectations in the third quarter, and Avastin in particular, which fell 3 percent in the third quarter, led by a decline in the United States.  Overall, quarterly sales at the world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs rose 3 percent to 12.48 billion francs, missing the average estimate of 12.68 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. “The momentum seems weakening in the haematology and breast cancer franchises in the U.S. and Japanese territories,” Bruno Bulic, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said. “We see the entry of Tecentriq coming timely.” He has a “buy” recommendation on Roche’s shares. They fell 0.2 percent by 0930 GMT, in line with the decline of the European health care sector index. Schwan still expected Roche’s 2016 sales to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate at constant exchange rates, with core earnings rising faster than sales. The company also confirmed its full-year outlook. He declined to comment on Novartis’s efforts to sell its $14 billion stake in Roche, saying any disposal was a matter for his cross-town rival to resolve. Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has said he may sell the stake without demanding a premium.

526,BMY,Merck wins early U.S. approval for Keytruda in untreated lung cancer,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co has won U.S. approval to market its immunotherapy Keytruda for use in previously untreated lung cancer patients two months ahead of schedule, making it the only such drug cleared for first-line treatment.  The green light from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced by the U.S. drugmaker late on Monday, confirms Merck’s leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumors by harnessing the body’s immune system. Keytruda’s latest approval is for treating first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with high-levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. The FDA had set a target date of Dec. 24 for deciding on this new use.  Expectations for Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, have been building since its success in treating selected untreated patients. Annual sales of the drug are now expected to reach $8.1 billion in 2021, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb’s drug Opdivo failed in a late-stage trial for the same indication. Bristol had tried to make Opdivo work irrespective of PD-L1 levels. In the event, it disappointed comprehensively in a major study.  Keytruda and Opdivo, along with Roche’s  rival immunotherapy Tecentriq, are already approved for lung cancer patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy. Keytruda had originally only been cleared in this second-line setting for patients with high PD-L1 levels but the FDA also expanded this on Monday to allow for treatment where PD-L1 expression is just 1 percent or more. Immunotherapy drugs are used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck, but lung cancer, the world’s biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, is the biggest potential market. Although doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, the FDA’s first-line clearance of Keytruda could greatly increase the number of patients taking the drug. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said the news should cement Merck’s position as leader in the first-line lung cancer field for at least the next 12 to 18 months, after when the battle is likely to shift to new combination therapies. Only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, making them suitable for first-line Keytruda, so around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs.

527,BMY,UPDATE 1-Merck wins early U.S. approval for Keytruda in untreated lung cancer,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co has won U.S. approval to market its immunotherapy Keytruda for use in previously untreated lung cancer patients two months ahead of schedule, making it the only such drug cleared for first-line treatment.  The green light from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced by the U.S. drugmaker late on Monday, confirms Merck’s leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumors by harnessing the body’s immune system. Keytruda’s latest approval is for treating first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with high-levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. The FDA had set a target date of Dec. 24 for deciding on this new use.  Expectations for Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, have been building since its success in treating selected untreated patients. Annual sales of the drug are now expected to reach $8.1 billion in 2021, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb’s drug Opdivo failed in a late-stage trial for the same indication. Bristol had tried to make Opdivo work irrespective of PD-L1 levels. In the event, it disappointed comprehensively in a major study.  Keytruda and Opdivo, along with Roche’s  rival immunotherapy Tecentriq, are already approved for lung cancer patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy. Keytruda had originally only been cleared in this second-line setting for patients with high PD-L1 levels but the FDA also expanded this on Monday to allow for treatment where PD-L1 expression is just 1 percent or more. Immunotherapy drugs are used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck, but lung cancer, the world’s biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, is the biggest potential market. Although doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, the FDA’s first-line clearance of Keytruda could greatly increase the number of patients taking the drug. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said the news should cement Merck’s position as leader in the first-line lung cancer field for at least the next 12 to 18 months, after when the battle is likely to shift to new combination therapies. Only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, making them suitable for first-line Keytruda, so around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs. As a result, the race is now on between Merck, Bristol, Roche and AstraZeneca to find smart ways for combining treatments, either by adding chemotherapy or using two different immunotherapies in tandem. Merck’s first-line approval was based on data from a late-stage study which showed Keytruda achieved superior progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1.

The U.S. drugmaker on Thursday predicted 2016 earnings of $2.80 to $2.90 a share, up from its previous forecast range of $2.55 to $2.65.  Bristol-Myers, whose shares rose 5 percent in premarket trading, said it expects 2017 earnings of $2.85 to $3.05 per share. Sales of Opdivo, which treats melanoma and lung cancer, tripled to $920 million in the third quarter, but trailed forecasts by $27 million.    Opdivo had been considered the leader among a new class of cancer drugs called PD-1 inhibitors until August, when researchers said it failed to slow progression of symptoms in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer.

The company said it authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, in addition to the $1.1 billion remaining under an authorization in 2012. And it predicted flat operating expenses through 2020, which analysts said should help profit margins. “We believe today’s updates should begin to address Wall Street concerns on Bristol’s near-term earnings outlook” in the wake of Opdivo’s setbacks, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note.

533,BMY,Roche advances skin cancer trials as part of combination therapy strategy,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche is pressing ahead with two skin cancer trials that combine its immunotherapy Tecentriq with other drugs after early data showed the treatments were well-tolerated and effective in a small number of patients, the company said Monday. One study combined Tecentriq with Cotellic and Zelboraf in 30 patients with untreated BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma, the other Tecentriq with Cotellic for 10 patients with BRAF-wild-type and BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma.  Both now move into phase III late-stage pivotal trials. After winning approval for Tecentriq earlier this year, first for bladder cancer and more recently for lung cancer, Roche is now trying it with other drugs in hopes that new combinations will result in potent weapons against cancer.  Of Roche’s 50 immunotherapy trials underway, 40 are with different combinations of medicines. “We are encouraged by these early results which demonstrate a high proportion of people responded to these investigational combination therapies,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer, in a statement.  Though the Roche studies are just getting off the ground, analysts said the news so far looks good. “Even when the data they are presenting was taken from a sample of only a few patients, the efficacy without the use of any chemotherapy is certainly extraordinarily high,” Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath wrote in a note to investors. Other companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, are also pursuing immunotherapy combinations. Roche shares rose 1.6 percent in early trading on Monday. They have lost almost 20 percent of their value this year, compared with the Stoxx Europe 600 Health Care index’s 16.4 percent drop.

537,BMY,Bristol-Myers' Opdivo succeeds in key stomach cancer study,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday its blockbuster immunotherapy Opdivo helped patients with advanced stomach cancer live longer in a late-stage study, becoming the first drug of its kind to show a survival benefit in these patients. Opdivo met the main study goal of overall survival in patients who failed to respond to or are intolerant of standard chemotherapy, the company said. New York-based Bristol-Myer’s shares inched up 1.1 percent to $56.90 in premarket trade. The trial was conducted by Bristol-Myers’ partner, Japan’s Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and compared the effect of Opdivo to a placebo. Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the world, and kills more than 720,000 every year, Bristol-Myers said. Opdivo, like Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda, belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that help the immune system unmask hidden cancer cells. Both drugs have secured regulatory approval for several types of cancer, but lung cancer is considered by far the biggest market for cancer drugs. Opdivo and Keytruda are both used in previously-treated lung cancer patients, but Merck’s supremacy in this class of drugs was confirmed when Keytruda last month won approval for untreated lung cancer patients, significantly expanding its addressable population. Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG’s Tecentriq is another major immunotherapy that has only recently won approvals for multiple types of cancer. As competition heats up, Bristol-Myers has orchestrated a string of deals to strengthen its pipeline. On Wednesday, it announced a collaboration to test Opdivo in combination with an experimental drug from Infinity Pharmaceuticals Inc in patients with advanced solid tumors.

543,BMY,UPDATE 1-Japan sets 50 pct price cut for Bristol Myers' Opdivo cancer drug,"(Reuters) - Japan’s health ministry has set a 50 percent cut in the price of Opdivo, a costly immune system-boosting cancer drug produced by Bristol Myers Squibb Co and marketed in the country by Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Ono Pharmaceutical said. The halving of the price on Opdivo, approved in Japan for treating advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and kidney cancer, will take effect from February 1, 2017, Ono Pharmaceutical said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. Japan’s government-run health system typically adjusts drug prices every two years, but Opdivo’s high price tag raised costs so much that officials decided to intervene with the steep price  cut, according to local media reports and confirmed by Ono. The company said the new Japanese price for a 20 mg vial of Opdivo will be 75,100 yen, and 364,925 yen for the 100 mg vial. Its current annual list price is 35 million yen ($321,787), based on the volume of drug needed to treat an average-size patient for a year. Opdivo is part of a new class of cancer drugs designed to fight cancer by unleashing the body’s own immune system to kill tumors. In the United States, Opdivo’s average list price is $13,100 per month, or $157,200 per year, according to Bristol Myers. The company said the U.S. price of Opdivo, first approved in late 2014, was increased by 1.5 percent earlier this year.

A company spokesman did not have an immediate comment on the settlement. At the time the marketing of the drug occurred, such uses were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In 2006, the drug had received a “black box” warning stating that it could increase the risk of death for dementia patients. Besides addressing the off-label promotion allegations, the settlement also resolves charges that the company violated state consumer protection laws by misrepresenting side effects such as metabolic weight gain.

550,BMY,Ono warns on profit after government halves price of cancer drug Opdivo,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Ono Pharmaceutical Co cut its annual profit outlook by a quarter on Wednesday, hit by the Japanese government’s decision to halve the price of cancer drug Opdivo that it co-developed with Bristol Myers Squibb Co. Last month, the government halved the price of Opdivo, which has been approved in Japan to treat advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and kidney cancer, on fears that a rapid uptake of the medicine would prove an intolerable burden on the national health insurance system. The cut, which will be effective from February, brought the price more into line with pricing in the United States and the Japanese government was widely seen as having initially priced it too high. Ono now expects a net profit of 41.8 billion yen ($355 million) for the year ending in March, down from its forecast of 55.8 billion yen forecast in May. It lowered its annual sales forecast for Opdivo to 105 billion yen from 126 billion yen, also factoring in the launch of Merck & Co’s rival non-small cell lung cancer treatment Keytruda. A spokesman for Ono said that Bristol Myers Squibb is entitled to 4 percent of Opdivo’s revenue in Japan with the rest going to Ono. The situation is reversed in the United States with Ono receiving just 4 percent of Opdivo’s revenue there. Japan this week said it will step up the pace and expand the scope of drug price reviews, one of the most aggressive measures it is taking to rein in ballooning healthcare costs for a rapidly ageing nation.

556,BMY,U.S. top court to hear Bristol-Myers out-of-state injury appeal,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear an appeal by pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb Co(BMY.N) in a dispute involving its blood-thinning medication Plavix that could limit where corporations can be sued, the second such case it has taken up in the past week. The justices will review a California Supreme Court decision allowing that state’s courts to hear claims over Plavix even though the plaintiffs did not live in the state and the company is not based there.  Last Friday, the justices said they would decide a similar appeal by Texas-based BNSF Railway Co of a 2015 Montana Supreme Court ruling allowing out-of-state residents to sue there over injuries that occurred anywhere in BNSF’s nationwide network.      Companies and plaintiffs are engaged in a fight over where lawsuits seeking compensation for injuries should be filed. Companies typically can be sued in a state where they are headquartered or incorporated, as well as where they have significant ties.  The California Supreme Court ruled in August 2016 that it could preside over the Plavix case because Bristol-Myers Squibb conducted a national marketing campaign and sold nearly $1 billion of the drug in the state. Bristol-Myers and pharmaceutical industry groups argue that the ruling allows plaintiffs to bring lawsuits in states with more favorable laws, rather than where the company is based or where the alleged injury occurred. Bristol-Myers is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York. The eight underlying lawsuits filed in 2012 against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp involve 84 California residents and 575 non-residents, alleging Plavix increased their risk of stroke, heart attack and internal bleeding. The BNSF case involves a pair of lawsuits brought under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, which permits injured railroad employees to sue for compensation from their companies. BNSF, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N),  argued that the Montana courts did not have jurisdiction over the cases.

563,BMY,"Bristol-Myers lung cancer delay slams shares, keeps Merck in lead","New YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) shares fell 11 percent on Friday following Thursday’s announcement that it would not seek accelerated approval of its immunotherapy drug combination in first-line lung cancer, further solidifying Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) leading position in the burgeoning immuno-oncolgy field. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and a handful of companies have been battling to become dominant in initial, or first-line, treatment, and to provide much-needed combination therapies. Merck shares rose 3.6 percent to $62.53, while Bristol fell to $49.23. Bristol-Myers earlier this month suggested it would seek a path to swift approval of an Opdivo/Yervoy combination in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) only to reverse course after reviewing available data. The company did not say whether the data was disappointing or merely insufficient to seek accelerated approval. Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala downgraded his rating on Bristol shares to “market perform” from “outperform” and lowered his price target on the stock to $65 from $85. The quickly changing lung cancer market dynamics could hurt Bristol’s earnings per share, Scala said. The news followed Merck’s surprise announcement last week that it had filed for a speedy U.S. approval of its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, and had received a May 10 regulatory decision date. The Opdivo/Yervoy news “certainly kills any potential for commercial sales in front-line lung cancer for 2017” and could leave Bristol-Myers as the third or fourth entry instead of being first or a close second, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. But it is by no means a death knell for Opdivo or the combination if the data is ultimately positive. “This is lung cancer,” Divan said. “If the combo ends up showing clearly superior efficacy in terms of overall survival, then doctors will switch to that.” Opdivo is approved for lung cancer in previously treated patients, as well as advanced melanoma, kidney and head and neck cancers and Hodgkin lymphoma. Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris lowered his estimates for Opdivo sales in 2021 to $8.5 billion from $9.7 billion. Merck will not only likely be first with a first-line lung combination, but said it will be less expensive due to the lower cost of chemotherapy versus rivals’ pairings of newer immuno-oncology drugs. Bristol, which was first to market with potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, was long perceived as the industry leader in immuno-oncology, with Merck hot on its heels and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) playing catch-up. That changed in August, when Bristol’s Opdivo failed as a monotherapy against first-line lung cancer, where Merck’s Keytruda succeeded, resetting the immuno-oncology pecking order.  Some analysts said the latest Opdivo setback was good news for AstraZeneca and Roche, allowing them to close the gap on Bristol-Myers. However, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson noted that Astra’s combination includes a CTLA4 drug similar to Bristol’s Yervoy. “This could have negative implications for AstraZeneca, who similarly has CTLA4 combination at the heart of its IO platform,” he wrote.

Shares of Bristol, which closed at $55.49 on the New York Stock Exchange, were down 6.2 percent at $52.08 after hours. The pharmaceutical company cited “a review of data available at this time” for the decision to hold off on filing for Food and Drug Administration approval of the combination of its cancer drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a research note that he still expects the Bristol immunotherapy combination to be approved in the second half of 2018 and sees “no real change to valuation or estimates as a result of this update.” But the move helps secure Merck & Co Inc’s current lead in the development of combination lung cancer treatments.  Merck last week said U.S. regulators had agreed to an accelerated review of its application to combine immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for advanced lung cancer. Merck said the FDA would decide by May 10 whether to approve its combination treatment. Keytruda and Opdivo, which both block a protein called PD-1 to boost the ability of the body’s own immune system to kill cancer cells, are already approved to treat a range of cancers, but their biggest market would be first-line lung cancer. Yervoy targets a different protein called CTLA-4. Immunotherapy is revolutionizing some areas of cancer care but giving it on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1. Merck’s Keytruda is already approved for such patients. Since just a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs for successful combination products. Jefferies’ Holford said he still expects the front line, or initial, treatment of NSCLC patients to evolve toward combinations of immunotherapy drugs without chemotherapy, where  Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca Plc have super positions.

Since just a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs for successful combination products. Jefferies’ Holford said he still expects the front line, or initial, treatment of NSCLC patients to evolve toward combinations of immunotherapy drugs without chemotherapy, where  Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca Plc have super positions.

569,BMY,Bristol-Myers cuts 2017 outlook amid Opdivo competition,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Thursday posted a fourth-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates and lowered its 2017 earnings forecast, citing tempered expectations for its key Opdivo immuno-oncology drug. For full-year 2017, the U.S. drugmaker cut its adjusted earnings per share outlook by 15 cents, to between $2.70 and $2.90. Wall Street analysts, on average, had projected $2.96 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Foreign exchange rates and the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) were the main reasons for the lowered outlook for 2017, Chief Financial Officer Charles Bancroft said on a conference call with investors. Shares of Bristol-Myers, down 15 percent so far this year, fell 5.6 percent to $46.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “For the first time in five years you might walk away thinking (Bristol-Myers) is not as confident as they were,” Guggenheim analyst Tony Butler told Reuters. “Is Bristol questioning their own strategy? That’s what the stock is telling you.” Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, short of the average analyst estimate of 67 cents a share. Revenue rose 22 percent to $5.2 billion. Bristol-Myers said it expects full-year 2017 worldwide revenue to increase by a rate in the low single digits. Fourth-quarter sales of Opdivo, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, soared to $1.3 billion from $475 million a year earlier. Approved in late 2014 to treat melanoma, Opdivo later won approvals to treat lung and kidney cancer and is being tested against a wide array of other types of cancer. New competition late last year from the launch of Roche Holding AG’s (ROG.S) immunotherapy Tecentriq cut Opdivo’s share of the U.S. second-line lung cancer market to about 40 percent. Bristol-Myers projected flat U.S. Opdivo sales this year. Competitor Merck (MRK.N) earlier this month said it had filed for speedy U.S. approval of its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy, as an initial lung cancer treatment, and received a May 10 regulatory decision date. Bristol-Myers, citing available trial data, said last week it would not seek accelerated approval of its own combination of immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and a handful of companies have been battling to dominate as an initial, or first-line, treatment, and to provide much-needed combination therapies. Bristol said it still expects full-year 2017 net earnings of $2.47 to $2.67 per share due to a recent patent settlement that includes a payment of $625 million from Merck. Fourth-quarter 2016 net income rose to $894 million, or 53 cents per share, from a year-earlier loss of $197 million, or 12 cents a share.

572,BMY,Roche cancer drug taking bite out of Bristol's Opdivo,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s cancer drug Tecentriq hit the market months behind immuno-oncology (I/O) medicines from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co but the Swiss drugmaker’s treatment is making up lost ground. On Thursday, Bristol-Myers managers said Tecentriq is grabbing market share from its I/O drug Opdivo for second-line non-small-cell lung cancer, one factor that forced them to cut their 2017 earnings forecast. “Most of our erosion in second line has been attributable to” Tecentriq, Murdo Gordon, Bristol-Myers’s chief commercial officer, told analysts. “We gave up about 10 points of market share.” Merck’s Keytruda drug is also taking patients away from Opdivo, Bristol-Myers said.  The U.S.-based company’s muted Opdivo outlook underscores why analysts predict Roche, when it announces full-year 2016 results on Feb. 1, will confirm Tecentriq sales have accelerated, particularly since its initial approval for bladder cancer in May was expanded in October to cover lung cancer. “Tecentriq continues to show strong launch trends in the fourth quarter 2016,” wrote Jeffrey Holford, a Jefferies analyst. “We have been surprised on the upside by its launch.”  Life sciences consultancy IMS estimates Tecentriq’s May-September sales for bladder cancer hit nearly $70 million, but that does not include lung cancer figures, the biggest cancer market.  Roche declined to provide sales numbers, saying only “we can confirm that we have seen a good launch of Tecentriq”.  Tecentriq, Opdivo and Keytruda work by helping the immune system recognize tumors that cloak themselves against detection. Roche and Bristol-Myers drugs are approved for use after other lung cancer treatments fail, while Keytruda has the FDA’s blessing as an initial treatment and is now seeking the go-ahead for combination therapy with chemotherapy, which Merck contends puts it in the pole position in the I/O race.

Indeed, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s problems in this setting may well turn out to be positive for AstraZeneca,” Mitchell Fraser-Jones said in a note to investors.

Earlier on Tuesday, Bristol-Myers said it added three directors to its board, a move supported by JANA Partners LLC, an activist investor building a stake in the company’s stock. Bristol shares were down nearly 2 percent for much of the day before jumping as high as $57.21 after the Wall Street Journal said Icahn has built a large stake. The report did not identify the size of the stake but said Icahn sees the company as a takeover target, citing anonymous sources.  The shares ultimately gave back most of the gains and closed up 19 cents, or 0.35 percent, at $54.78.  The addition of new board members comes as Bristol-Myers has fallen behind Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) in the key field of immuno-oncology after its Opdivo drug failed to prolong survival in previously untreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the largest cancer market. Merck’s rival drug, Keytruda, did extend survival as a so-called front-line treatment for NSCLC. Bristol’s weaker competitive position has been reflected in its shares, which are off about 28 percent since the lung cancer setback last August. Merck shares are up more than 11 percent over the same period. Bristol-Myers also disclosed that it expects to post charges of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in connection with a restructuring announced in October. In addition, it announced a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program to be funded with debt and cash. Bristol-Myers said company directors and executives met with JANA representatives to understand their views since the firm became a shareholder in late 2016. The board appointments followed those discussions, the company said. New York-based JANA owned 3.9 million shares of Bristol-Myers as of Dec. 31, a $226 million stake well below 1 percent of the $92 billion company. According to people familiar with the matter, JANA has substantially increased its stake since January, though it is still below 1 percent of the outstanding shares.  Bristol boosted its board to 14 people with the new directors. They include Theodore Samuels, who retired this year as a senior vice president and portfolio manager at the Capital Group, one of Bristol-Myers’ largest shareholders. Samuels joined the board earlier this year at drugmaker Perrigo Co (PRGO.N), which later struck a deal with activist Starboard Value LP two weeks ago to add 3 more directors. Also joining the board is Robert Bertolini, an accountant and tax expert who as chief financial officer under Chief Executive Fred Hassan helped turn around a struggling Schering-Plough prior to its merger with Merck.

591,BMY,Fitch Rates Bristol-Myers Squibb's Notes Offering 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's (Bristol, BMY) senior unsecured notes offering.  Proceeds will be used to partially fund an accelerated share repurchase program  (ASR). The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --The company maintains decent headroom under the 2.0x gross leverage level  Fitch considers appropriate for the 'A-' rating after incorporating the effect  of a recently announced $2 billion ASR. Fitch calculates pro forma gross  leverage of 1.6x.  --Increasing involvement by activist shareholders raises the likelihood that the  company will pursue transactions that have a negative effect on the balance  sheet and credit profile, like the ASR. Bristol's still decent fundamental  operating outlook and demonstrated commitment to operating with leverage below  2.0x mitigate this risk.  --Fitch anticipates that continued market uptake of promising medicines with  longer patent protection and the successful commercialization of key research  projects will help offset the declining sales of existing drugs with expired  patents. --While Bristol's new lung cancer drug Opdivo will likely grow at lower rates  than Fitch previously forecasted, the product will likely still present good  long-term prospects as the company focuses on clinical studies to expand its use  over currently approved indications. --Fitch anticipates that Bristol will successfully advance a number of early- to  mid-stage pipeline candidates into late-stage development and regulatory  submission.  --A moderating patent cliff, moderately improving margins and capital  expenditures declining to more normalized levels support positive and improving  FCF (FCF; cash from operations less dividends and capital expenditures) over the  rating horizon Leverage Expected to Remain Below 2.0x: Fitch expects that Bristol will operate  with gross debt leverage (total debt/EBITDA) below 2.0x during the forecast  horizon. Leverage has remained at or below 1.8x since the company's diabetes  divestiture in early February 2014. The Stable Outlook continues to be supported  by a demonstrated willingness and ability to conservatively deploy cash in order  to maintain a 'A-' credit profile. However, Bristol's recently announced ASR  program and shareholder activists' involvement are indicative of increased event  risk related to leveraging transactions. Patent Protected Products Growing: Bristol has a number of growth drivers for  the intermediate term that will help to mitigate the roughly 19% of sales at  risk to patent expiries through the end of 2019. The company's longer-dated  patented products continue to generate solid growth. Sprycel (chronic myeloid  leukemia), Eliquis (blood clots), Yervoy (cancer) and Opdivo (cancer) should  support long-term growth as favorable clinical outcomes and/or demographics  drive increased utilization. While Fitch expects near- and longer-term growth  for Opdivo, the drug is facing competitive headwinds, which have moderated our  growth targets. Near-Term Challenges for Opdivo: Opdivo has experienced some clinical setbacks  from a competitive perspective when compared to Keytruda (Merck & Co., Inc.) as  a first-line treatment (as a sole agent or as combination therapy) of lung  cancer. Fitch believes Bristol will continue to advance Opdivo's clinical  utility through performing clinical trials as a standalone therapy and part of  combination therapy. The company's numerous clinical trials currently underway  in various types of cancers support this assumption. Partly offsetting these setbacks, is the legal settlement that Merck reached  with Bristol regarding Keytruda's alleged infringement of Opdivo's patents.  Under the agreement, Merck will initially pay $625 million to Bristol and its  partner Ono Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. (Ono). Merck will also pay royalties on  global sales of Keytruda of 6.5% from Jan. 1, 2017 through Dec. 31, 2023, and  2.5% from Jan. 1, 2024 through Dec. 31, 2026. Additionally, the three companies  have granted certain rights to each other under their respective patent  portfolios pertaining to PD-1.  Mid/Early-Stage Pipeline: The vast majority of Bristol's late-stage clinical  developments have come from a large number of studies with Opdivo. However, the  company has a significant number of new molecular entities (NME) in mid- to  early-stage development. These programs involve new therapies to treat  cardiovascular disease, various types of cancer, neurological disorders,  fibrotic diseases and genetically defined illnesses. Current therapeutic options  for a number of these targeted diseases are suboptimal, which provide BMY an  opportunity to gain expedited pathways of regulatory approval if these therapies  demonstrate early efficacy and good safety profiles. Patent Cliff Moderates: The wave of drug patent expirations during 2015 - 2016,  is now behind Bristol. The company's next significant patent expiry occurs when  Orencia (rheumatoid arthritis/12 of total revenues), a biologic, loses patent  protection in the U.S. in 2019, Europe in 2017, and Japan in 2018. As a biologic  therapy, Fitch expects that when biosimilar competitors arrive, Orencia will  experience more gradual market share losses than a small molecule drug facing  generic competition. Expected strong performance of Opdivo, Sprycel, Empliciti  and Eliquis should provide support during 2017 to 2021.  Improving FCF: Bristol should generate steady improvements in FCF during 2017  and beyond, as new products recently launched gain traction and margins  gradually improve owing to cost control and favorable shifts in sales mix of  newer, higher margin products. Fitch forecasts $500 million to $600 million in  FCF during 2017. Estimated FCF in the latest-12-month (LTM) period ended Dec.  31, 2016 was ($912) million, compared to ($1.47) billion in the prior year's LTM  period. A temporary increase in capital expenditures (manufacturing expansion)  and working capital uses drove the negative FCF. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Bristol include: --Low single-digit revenue growth in 2017 to 2019 with new products offsetting  the decline in mature products and slowing growth rate for Opdivo; --EBITDA margin to increase to 27% to 28% as mix improves with newer product  growth and ongoing efforts to rein in costs yield savings; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of roughly $500 to $600 million during 2017; --Leverage to remain below 2.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near  term, future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to such an  action include: Fitch would consider a positive rating action if it believes gross debt leverage  will be maintained below 1.7x and FCF will remain positive through the forecast  period. Drivers of operational improvement that would support a positive  revision include strong demand for newer, patent-protected therapeutics.  Negative: Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: Ratings pressure would result if the company faces significant and durable  operational stress possibly from an increased competitive landscape regarding  its relatively new therapies, or pursues a leveraging transaction. A Negative  Rating Outlook or a one-notch downgrade could result if Fitch expects leverage  to be maintained above 2.0x.  LIQUIDITY Bristol has adequate sources of liquidity. At Dec. 31, 2016, the company had  full capacity under $3 billion in five-year revolving credit facilities  comprising $1.5 billion expiring in October 2020 and $1.5 billion expiring in  July 2021. The revolvers contain no financial covenants. Also on Dec. 31, 2016,  the company had cash and short-term investments of $6.3 billion and long-dated  securities of $2.7 billion. Roughly $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and  marketable securities resides domestically.  Upcoming significant debt maturities are the $750 million notes in 2017. Fitch  expects maturities will be refinanced with debt issuances or commercial paper  borrowings. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. as follows: --Long-Term IDR 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'; --Bank loan 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

601,BMY,Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combination extends survival in melanoma,"(Reuters) - Patients with advanced melanoma who received Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapies Opdivo and Yervoy had improved overall survival compared with those on Yervoy alone, with 64 percent on the combination therapy still alive after two years, according to data released on Monday. The combination therapy won approval to treat the deadliest form of skin cancer based on its ability to delay disease worsening, known as progression-free survival, with the condition that it ultimately helps patients live longer. Data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington for the first time demonstrated  that overall survival benefit. Prior to the introduction of these new drugs that help the immune system fight cancer, including Keytruda from Merck & Co, advanced melanoma was a short-term death sentence. The new drugs do come at a hefty price. The combination regimen used in the study costs about $145,200, Bristol said. In the 945-patient late stage trial, median overall survival for Yervoy, known chemically as ipilimumab, was 20 months. Median overall survival had not yet been reached for the combination or for Opdivo (nivolumab) alone, with a minimum follow-up of 28 months. After two years, 59 percent of those who got Opdivo alone were still alive, while 64 percent of patients in the combination group were alive.  “This level of survival rate at two years is really unprecedented,” said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of medical and oncology development. Put another way, the combination therapy reduced the risk of death 45 percent compared with Yervoy, the company said. No new safety issues turned up in the study, Bristol-Myers said. However, the rate of serious adverse side effects was 58 percent for the combination, 21 percent for Opdivo and 28 percent for Yervoy. “It is exciting to see that initial results suggest that the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination provides favorable survival outcomes compared with ipilimumab alone,” Dr. James Larkin, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement. The higher rate of severe side effects should be considered when making treatment decisions, he added. Bristol-Myers is looking to regain its standing in the burgeoning immuno-oncology field. It ceded its perceived lead to Merck last year, when Opdivo proved no better than chemotherapy as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, by far the biggest oncology market. Merck’s Keytruda won approval as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

607,BMY,"Bristol-Myers to license two drugs to Biogen, Roche","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday it would license two of its drugs to Biogen Inc and Roche Holding AG for an upfront fee of $470 million. Bristol will license its experimental neurodegenerative disorder drug, BMS-986168, to Biogen as a treatment for progressive supranuclear palsy, which is characterized by brain cell damage. Biogen said the drug also had the potential for use in Alzheimer’s disease. BMS-986089, Bristol’s rare muscle-wasting disease drug, will be licensed by Roche for use in duchenne muscular dystrophy. Bristol, which will receive an upfront payment of $300 million from Biogen and $170 million from Roche, said it expects the deals to close in the second quarter. The deals come amid activist investor pressure. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that billionaire investor Carl Icahn had taken a stake in Bristol and saw the company as a possible takeover target. Bristol also added three directors to its board in February, a move supported by JANA Partners LLC, an activist investor building a stake in the company’s stock.

Bristol will license its experimental neurodegenerative disorder drug, BMS-986168, to Biogen as a treatment for progressive supranuclear palsy, which is characterized by brain cell damage. Biogen said the drug also had the potential for use in Alzheimer’s disease. BMS-986089, Bristol’s rare muscle-wasting disease drug, will be licensed by Roche for use in duchenne muscular dystrophy. Bristol, which will receive an upfront payment of $300 million from Biogen and $170 million from Roche, said it expects the deals to close in the second quarter. The deals come amid activist investor pressure. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that billionaire investor Carl Icahn had taken a stake in Bristol and saw the company as a possible takeover target. Bristol also added three directors to its board in February, a move supported by JANA Partners LLC, an activist investor building a stake in the company’s stock.

613,BMY,"As AstraZeneca chases rivals, immuno-oncology gets complicated","LONDON (Reuters) - Three years after Pfizer’s failed bid for AstraZeneca, the British drugmaker aims to prove in the coming weeks that its cancer immunotherapy can deliver on bold sales forecasts made during that takeover battle. Central to AstraZeneca’s case is a trial called MYSTIC which is testing the drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in lung cancer. If initial results to be reported at mid-year indicate success, this could confirm the company’s place at oncology’s top table. But the market for medicines boosting the immune system’s ability to fight tumors is increasingly competitive and the science is moving fast, raising questions as to whether AstraZeneca can produce a knock-out win. Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved in lung cancer and the race is on to launch effective combinations for previously untreated disease in patients - a potentially huge market. “I think there will be multiple approvals in the first-line (untreated) space,” Naiyer Rizvi, head of thoracic oncology at Columbia University Medical Center, told Reuters. “The question is going to be how do you position all these different options.” Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs which, by helping the body’s immune cells kill cancer, offer an alternative to toxic chemotherapy. While not without side effects, I-O is a kinder option that also promises longer-lasting efficacy, although the high cost is a concern.     Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca’s approach. “There’s a critical unmet need, which is why there is so much excitement about immunotherapies and so much activity,” said Rob Iannone, AstraZeneca’s head of late-stage I-O development. “Current outcomes are still very, very poor.” As experience builds with using the new agents, rival drugmakers have been busily amending clinical trial plans to keep up with a shifting landscape, while also launching new studies to exploit a coming second generation of I-O medicines. The issue has been further complicated by doubts over how to identify patients who will benefit. The latest data suggests that the level of mutation in tumors may be a better biomarker than the current widely used benchmark, a protein called PDL-1. “PDL-1 is a bit of a blunt instrument,” said Rizvi. “In future, I think you will see a lot better science around identifying patients based on their genetics.”  AstraZeneca shares, which at around 46 pounds still trail the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer in 2014, are expected to move sharply up or down on the MYSTIC data. But the result may not be as clear-cut as some investors hope because the full data will emerge in stages. Headline news on progression-free survival (PFS), or extending the time before cancer worsens, is due in June or July, with details following later, possibly at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Madrid in September. Doctors, patients and investors may have to wait until 2018 to learn whether durvalumab and tremelimumab actually help patients live longer by extending overall survival (OS). Given the competitive landscape, the pressure is on to achieve both PFS and OS. “In the first-line setting, I think it is important to hit both,” said Rizvi, who is principal investigator for the MYSTIC trial.  Indeed, a miss on PFS could be enough to mark AstraZeneca as a likely loser in the multibillion-dollar I-O race, according to UBS analysts. AstraZeneca’s Iannone sees it rather differently, arguing that the durable response generated by I-O drugs makes long-term survival, not PFS, the gold standard test.  “It looks as if OS is a more robust endpoint,” he said. “We want to preserve PFS, even if we know that the study might ultimately have to wait for OS to appreciate the full benefit.” Importantly, AstraZeneca has built multiple options into its trial design, with potential to prove that durva/treme can help all patients or a subset with high levels of PDL-1. In addition, durvalumab is being tested on its own. Back in 2014, AstraZeneca predicted durvalumab could have peak sales of $6.5 billion, including combination therapies, making it the biggest contributor to revenue growth. Current analyst forecasts are only around half this level, according to Thomson Reuters data, making the next few weeks pivotal in building or eroding expectations. AstraZeneca has two chances to build confidence ahead of MYSTIC, with durvalumab potentially winning approval in bladder cancer - a relatively small market - and data also due from a lower-profile lung cancer trial called ARCTIC. But rivals are moving fast. Merck is expected to get a U.S. green light to sell a combination of its I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer by May 10, while Bristol-Myers and Roche also have important upcoming combination data. All of this makes success critical for AstraZeneca, which is struggling with falling sales from loss of patents on blockbusters such as cholesterol drug Crestor and is doing external deals to help fund new-drug research. Pfizer may have left the stage but some analysts and bankers believe AstraZeneca could become a target again in any future wave of pharmaceutical industry consolidation.

615,BMY,Bristol-Myers NASH drug reduces liver fat in midstage study,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said its lead experimental drug for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, significantly reduced liver fat versus placebo, according to data from a mid-stage trial presented at a medical meeting on Saturday. NASH, a progressive fatty liver disease tied to obesity and diabetes, afflicts about 5 percent of the population and is poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants. Many companies are developing drugs for the complex disease for which there are no approved treatments. The 16-week, 74-patient trial tested the subcutaneously-injected drug, BMS-986036, at two dosing regimens versus placebo in adults whose NASH was confirmed by liver biopsy. Both the 10 mg dose given daily and a 20 mg once-a-week injection met the main goal of significantly reducing liver fat. Liver fat was reduced 6.8 percent with the daily injections and 5.2 percent for the weekly dose compared with 1.3 percent for placebo. In addition, the Bristol-Myers drug reduced biomarkers for fibrosis, the scarring that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure, as well as measures of liver stiffness and enzymes indicative of liver injury, data showed. “These data suggest that BMS-986036 may be effective in patients with NASH, many of whom will experience disease progression due to the lack of available treatment options,” Dr. Arun Sanyal, the study’s primary investigator from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said in a statement. “The results of this study show that BMS-986036 had beneficial effects on three important components in the treatment of NASH: liver fat, liver injury and fibrosis,” said Sanyal, a leader in the field who presented the data at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conference in Amsterdam. The drug is a pegylated, or long acting, version of a natural human hormone called fibroblast growth factor 21, a regulator of metabolism believed to be effective because of the varied metabolic drivers of the disease.  The Bristol drug also led to improvements in cholesterol and triglycerides, researchers reported. At least one NASH drug further along in development from another company led to a rise in “bad” LDL cholesterol, which caused some concern. There were no deaths, serious side effects or discontinuation due to adverse side effects reported among patients who received the Bristol drug. The most frequently reported side effects were diarrhea, nausea and frequent bowel movements, none of which were considered severe, the company said.

617,BMY,U.S. Supreme Court may limit where companies can be sued,"WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday signaled a willingness to place limits on where corporations can be sued in a dispute involving drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, a potential setback to plaintiffs’ lawyers who try to bring suits in friendly courts. The justices heard arguments in Bristol-Myers’ appeal of a California Supreme Court ruling allowing that state’s courts to hear claims related to its blood-thinning medication Plavix even though most plaintiffs do not live in the state and the company is not based there. The justices on Monday also were set to hear a similar appeal by Texas-based BNSF Railway Co of a 2015 Montana Supreme Court ruling allowing out-of-state residents to sue there over injuries that happened anywhere in BNSF’s nationwide network. Companies and plaintiffs are engaged in a fight over where lawsuits seeking compensation for injuries should be filed. Companies typically can be sued in a state where they are headquartered or incorporated, as well as where they have significant ties. The nine-member court’s conservative majority appeared to side with the companies’ view while its liberals wondered how it would be unfair to add out-of-state claims to a case that would go ahead anyway. Conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed skepticism over California handling matters for residents of all other states. “That’s a very patronizing view of federalism,” Kennedy told the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Thomas Goldstein. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan suggested Bristol-Myers did not want to face multiple trials in California specifically because of plaintiff-friendly juries or the possibility of punitive damages. “All of the above,” the company’s lawyer Neal Katyal said, adding that it is harder to get cases thrown out of court before trial in California. The underlying lawsuits filed in 2012 against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp involved 86 California residents and 575 non-residents, alleging Plavix increased their risk of stroke, heart attack and internal bleeding. The California Supreme Court ruled in August 2016 that it could preside over the Plavix case because Bristol-Myers Squibb conducted a national marketing campaign and sold nearly $1 billion of the drug in the state. Bristol-Myers and other industry groups have argued that the ruling allows plaintiffs to bring lawsuits in states with more favorable laws and it hamstrings their ability to mount a full and fair defense. Bristol-Myers is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York.

Bristol-Myers, which is facing pressure from activist investors after losing ground to rival Merck & Co’s cancer treatment Keytruda, mostly reversed an earlier cut to its 2017 profit outlook. Its shares rose nearly 4 percent. “Sales for Opdivo were strong despite a more competitive landscape,” Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said on a conference call with analysts. “In the U.S., while we have seen some share loss in lung cancer, our share has shown signs of stabilization.”  Sales of Opdivo and Yervoy, which boost the cancer-fighting abilities of a patient’s immune system, jumped 60 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in the quarter. Sales of blood thinner Eliquis, another important Bristol-Myers drug, gained 50 percent.    “We have a favorable view of Bristol’s solid position in the immuno-oncology market,” said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans.  Opdivo sales beat expectations by 14 percent and should be “a key growth driver for the company,” Evans added. Bristol-Myers warned in January that the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Keytruda could sap Opdivo’s earnings potential this year. Merck filed for speedy U.S. approval of Keytruda as an initial lung cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy. Around the same time, Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated approval for a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer and has not fully explained why.

The U.S. drugmaker, which has faced increasing competition for blockbuster Opdivo as well as pressure from activist investors, also raised its expectations for its full-year earnings, reversing a cut to its outlook it made in the previous quarter. Opdivo sales rose 60 percent in the quarter, while Eliquis and Yervoy sales rose 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Opdivo and Yervoy are immuno-oncology drugs, which target the body’s immune system to fight cancer.

632,BMY,UPDATE 2-Novartis CEO sees no need for big takeover,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis (NOVN.S) does not need a big acquisition to kick-start growth, Chief Executive Joe Jimenez told investors on Wednesday, playing down suggestions he could use proceeds from a slew of asset sales for a significant takeover. The Swiss drugmaker is reviewing potential disposals of its struggling eyecare business Alcon, its consumer drugs joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and a stake in rival Roche (ROG.S) that could raise a combined $50 billion.  Amid speculation Novartis might use proceeds to buy AstraZeneca (AZN.L) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) to fill holes in its cancer drug portfolio, Jimenez said he remained focused on smaller purchases of up to $5 billion to bolster his pipeline. “Obviously, there’s been a lot of speculation because that would be a lot of capital,” Jimenez said at an event at Novartis’s research campus in Boston.  “We don’t need a big deal,” he said. “Our strategy in M&A; is to do bolt-on acquisitions.”  Money-losing Alcon, which makes surgical equipment for cataracts as well as contact lenses and solutions, is undergoing a strategic review, with “all options” on the table. Jimenez promised an update by year’s end on the division, which Novartis assigns a remaining book value of $21 billion. While Jimenez still expects his Sandoz generic drug division’s 2017 revenue to be “broadly in line” with last year’s numbers, he warned price pressure in the United States had intensified in the second quarter. Sandoz, whose $10.1 billion in revenue in 2016 made up a fifth of Novartis’s total, is among generics makers including India’s Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (SUN.NS) and Lupin (LUPN.NS) that have said U.S. revenue growth will be muted this year. Jimenez, who as chairman-elect of U.S. drugmaker industry lobby group PhRMA met President Donald Trump earlier this year, told investors he expected the administration to come forward with proposals on curbing U.S. drug prices “within the next three months”. Trump in January said drug companies were “getting away with murder” with high drug prices.  Still, Jimenez said on Wednesday he was optimistic the Republican president would strike an industry-friendly balance, possibly incorporating “outcome-based pricing” models that reward drugmakers whose products save the healthcare system money. “We’re watching it very closely, we’re heavily involved,” Jimenez said of PhRMA’s efforts in Washington.

644,BMY,RPT-U.S. Supreme Court ruling threatens massive talc litigation against J&J;,"(Repeats without change) By Nate Raymond June 20 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is seizing upon a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from Monday limiting where injury lawsuits can be filed to fight off claims it failed to warn women that talcum powder could cause ovarian cancer. New Jersey-based J&J; has been battling a series of lawsuits over its talc-based products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, brought by around 5,950 women and their families. The company denies any link between talc and cancer. A fifth of the plaintiffs have cases pending in state court in St. Louis, where juries in four trials have hit J&J; and a talc supplier with $307 million in verdicts. Those four cases and most of the others on the St. Louis docket involve out-of-state plaintiffs suing an out-of-state company. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in a case involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there. The ruling immediately led a St. Louis judge at J&J;’s urging to declare a mistrial in the latest talc case, in which two of the three women at issue were from out of state. It also could imperil prior verdicts and cases that have yet to go to trial. “We believe the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Bristol-Myers Squibb matter requires reversal of the talc cases that are currently under appeal in St. Louis,” J&J; said in a statement. The question of where such lawsuits can be filed has been the subject of fierce debate. The business community has argued plaintiffs should not be allowed to shop around for the most favorable court to bring lawsuits, while injured parties claim corporations are trying to deny them access to justice. Along with talc cases, large-scale litigation alleging injuries from Bayer AG’s Essure birth control device in Missouri and California and GlaxoSmithKline’s antidepressant Paxil in California and Illinois are examples of other cases where defendants could utilize the Supreme Court decision. Although he declared a mistrial on Monday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison left the door open for the plaintiffs to argue they still have jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lawyer Ted Meadows said he would argue the St. Louis court still had jurisdiction based on a Missouri-based bottler J&J; used to package its talc products, which he said would create a sufficient connection to the state. “It’s very disappointing to mistry a case because the Supreme Court changed the rules on us,” said Meadows. The lawsuit decided by the high court on Monday involved claims against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp by 86 California residents and 575 non-Californians over the blood thinner Plavix. Beyond Monday’s mistrial, the Supreme Court’s ruling could bolster a pending appeal by J&J; of a $72 million verdict in favor of the family of Alabama resident Jacqueline Fox, who died in 2015. A Missouri appeals court had said in May it would wait until the Supreme Court issued its decision to decide the appeal. J&J; has won only one of the five trials so far in Missouri. It previously sought to move talc cases out of St. Louis, but the Missouri Supreme Court in January denied its bid. The company has also cast the St. Louis court as overly plaintiff-friendly and has allowed evidence linking talc to cancer that was rejected by a New Jersey state court judge overseeing over 200 talc cases. The plaintiffs are appealing. The talc verdicts against J&J; led the business-friendly American Tort Reform Association last year to declare the St. Louis state court the nation’s top “Judicial Hellhole.” Now J&J; could try to use the Supreme Court ruling to dismiss many of the cases it faces in Missouri, according to legal experts. Corporations facing a large volume of cases in venues chosen by plaintiffs will likely cite the Supreme Court to try to dismiss those claims, said Rusty Perdew, a defense lawyer at the law firm Locke Lord. “You have a bunch of defendants who can go back and say, ‘Judge, you got that wrong and you’re going to have to dismiss claims by all those plaintiffs,’” he said.

647,BMY,UPDATE 2-Seattle Genetics slumps as cancer drug data fails to impress,"(Reuters) - Seattle Genetics Inc’s lymphoma drug met the main goal in a late stage study, but shares of the company tumbled as the data fell short of investor expectations on the treatment’s advantages over standard of care. The drug, Adcetris, co-developed with Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, met the goal of helping blood cancer patients live longer without worsening their condition. However, the difference in the progression free survival rate of patients on the combination therapy testing Adcetris and the control arm was about 5 percent - 82.1 percent for the drug versus 77.2 percent in the control arm. The relatively modest improvement of about 5 percent could generate cost concerns among insurers, SunTrust Bank analyst Yatin Suneja said. Bothell, Washington-based Seattle Genetics shares slumped as much 13.7 percent to $53.30 in afternoon trading on Monday.  Adcetris is approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, who have already received a stem cell transplant or two chemotherapies. The drug is also approved to treat anaplastic large cell lymphoma in patients who have undergone chemotherapy. However, analysts did not write off the benefits that the drug could offer over the standard treatment, which is a combination of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) drugs. “Eliminating bleomycin should be enough to ensure commercial success with a broad label,” Morgan Stanley analysts said. One of the fatal side effects of bleomycin is pulmonary toxicity. Doctors for long have been trying to get rid of bleomycin from the chemotherapy regimen to increase the long-term durable response rate and decrease toxicity, Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall told Reuters. Seattle Genetics said it would file for an expanded label in the United States as soon as possible. About 8,260 Americans were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma so far in 2017, out of which about 1,070 died, according to the American Cancer Society. Adcetris, which generated about $266 million in North America sales last year, is also being developed in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy, Opdivo, to treat relapsed Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Last week, Seattle Genetics halted a late-stage study of its leukemia drug, vadastuximab talirine, following a “higher rate” of deaths in patients on the drug compared with those on a placebo. Up to Friday’s close, the company’s shares had gained 17 percent this year.

648,BMY,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Seattle Genetics, Takeda lymphoma drug success fails to impress investors","(Fixes typo in the headline) By Divya Grover June 26 (Reuters) - Seattle Genetics Inc and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said on Monday that their drug met the main goal in a late-stage study of helping blood cancer patients live longer without their condition worsening. However, Seattle Genetics’ shares fell 11 percent as investors were unimpressed by the difference in the progression free survival rate of patients on the combination therapy testing the companies’ Adcetris drug and the control arm. The study testing the combination as an initial treatment for advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma showed 82.1 percent lower risk of cancer progression in patients, compared with 77.2 percent in the control arm. The control arm used standard-of-care chemotherapy, ABVD, which combines adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine drugs. The relatively modest improvement of about 5 percent could generate cost concerns among payers, but the benefit from removing bleomycin from the treatment regimen could be substantial, particularly for younger patients, SunTrust Bank analyst Yatin Suneja said. Doctors for long have been trying to get rid of bleomycin from the chemotherapy regimen to increase the long-term durable response rate and decrease toxicity, Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall told Reuters.

Adcetris, known chemically as brentuximab vedotin, links a tumor-targeting antibody to a cancer-killing chemotherapy drug with the goal of limiting side effects. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in white blood cells. It typically begins in the lymph nodes in one region of the body and then spreads throughout the lymph system. According to the American Cancer Society, about 8,260 Americans were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma so far in 2017, out of which about 1,070 died. The U.S. drug developer, which partnered with Takeda to co-develop and commercialize Adcetris outside the United States, said it would file for an expanded label in the United States as soon as possible. The drug, which generated about $266 million in North America sales last year, is also being developed in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy, Opdivo, to treat relapsed Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

649,BMY,Seattle Genetics halts late-stage study of leukemia drug (June 19)," (The story corrects the last paragraph in the June 19 story to say Adcetris generated $266 million in sales last year, not $71 million) By Akankshita Mukhopadhyay (Reuters) - Seattle Genetics Inc said it would halt a late-stage study of its drug to treat a type of leukemia in older patients following a “higher rate” of deaths in patients on the drug compared with those on a placebo. Shares of the U.S. drug developer fell as much as 11 percent to $57.40 in early trading on Monday, but recouped some losses to be down about 3.7 percent. The drug, vadastuximab talirine, was being evaluated in the late-stage study, Cascade, to treat a form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Seattle Genetics declined to disclose the number of deaths, but said they were not related to liver toxicity, based on available data. In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had imposed a clinical hold on several early stage studies testing vadastuximab talirine after six AML patients were identified with liver toxicity and four died. The hold was lifted in March. The discontinuation of Cascade is not related to the clinical hold from December, the company said in an email.  Seattle Genetics also said it would suspend patient enrollment and treatment in all trials involving vadastuximab talirine, including an early-stage study in patients with another form of blood cancer. The company, which is developing various cancer drugs, said it would consult the FDA regarding future plans for vadastuximab talirine. At least three analysts cut their revenue estimates for Seattle Genetics following the discontinuation of the trial. Oppenheimer analyst Leah Rush Cann slashed her estimated 2021 total revenue by 12.5 percent.  But some analysts turned their focus to the company’s Adcetris drug ahead of a late-stage study readout expected by the end of the year.  Adcetris is already approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not realized enough benefits from prior therapies. The drug, which generated about $266 million in North America sales last year, is also being developed in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy, Opdivo, to treat relapsed hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The trial, involving previously untreated HL patients, could help expand the Adcetris label.

651,BMY,"CORRECTED-Seattle Genetics, Takeda lymphoma drug succeeds late-stage trial","(Corrects last paragraph to say Adcetris generated $266 million in sales last year, not $71 million) By Divya Grover June 26 (Reuters) - Seattle Genetics Inc and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said on Monday that their drug met the main goal in a late-stage study of helping blood cancer patients live longer without their condition worsening. The study tested Adcetris in combination with a three-drug chemotherapy regimen, AVD, compared with standard of care, to treat advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1,334 patients who have had no prior treatments. Adcetris is already approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, who have already received a stem cell transplant or two chemotherapy treatments. The drug is also approved to treat patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma that have gone through one chemotherapy treatment. The study, which tested the combination as an initial treatment, showed 82.1 percent lower risk of cancer progression in the combination therapy, compared with 77.2 percent in the control arm. The standard-of-care chemotherapy, ABVD, combines adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. Doctors for long have been trying to get rid of bleomycin from the chemotherapy regimen to increase the long-term durable response rate and decrease toxicity, Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall told Reuters. Seattle Genetics, which partnered with Takeda to co-develop and commercialize Adcetris outside the United States, retains marketing rights for the drug in the United States and Canada. Adcetris, known chemically as brentuximab vedotin, links a tumor-targeting antibody to a cancer-killing chemotherapy drug with the goal of limiting side effects. It is designed to home in on an antigen, or a foreign substance, in Hodgkin’s lymphoma and in several types of T-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in white blood cells. It typically begins in the lymph nodes in one region of the body and then spreads throughout the lymph system.

652,BMY,Personalised vaccines hold cancer at bay in two early trials,"* New-style vaccines from German, U.S. teams cut relapses * Aim to add ‘neoantigen’ vaccines to immunotherapy drugs * Roche already in $310 mln deal with Germany’s BioNTech * BioNTech CEO says will look at IPO in two to four years By Ben Hirschler LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - A novel class of personalised cancer vaccines, tailored to the tumours of individual patients, kept disease in check in two early-stage clinical trials, pointing to a new way to help the immune system fight back. Although so-called immunotherapy drugs from the likes of Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche are starting to revolutionise cancer care, they still only work for a limited number of patients. By adding a personalised cancer vaccine, scientists believe it should be possible to improve substantially the effectiveness of such immune-boosting medicines. Twelve skin cancer patients, out of a total of 19 across both the trials, avoided relapses for two years after receiving different vaccines developed by German and U.S. teams, researchers reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday. The small Phase I trials now need to be followed by larger studies, but the impressive early results suggest the new shots work far better than first-generation cancer vaccines that typically targeted a single cancer characteristic. The new treatments contain between 10 and 20 different mutated proteins, or “neoantigens”, that are specific to an individual’s tumour. These proteins are not found on healthy cells and they look foreign to the immune system, prompting specialist T-cells to step up their attack on cancer cells. One vaccine was developed at the U.S.-based Dana-Farber Institute and Broad Institute and the other by privately owned German biotech firm BioNTech, which uses so-called messenger RNA to carry the code for making its therapeutic proteins. Roche, the world’s largest cancer drugmaker, is already betting on BioNTech’s technology after signing a $310 million deal last September allowing it to test the German vaccine with its immunotherapy drug Tecentriq. BioNTech’s co-founder and CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters that combination trials using Roche’s drug were due to start later this year against a number of different cancers. Rival biotech firm Neon Therapeutics, which was formed to exploit the U.S. research, initiated tests of its personalised neoantigen vaccine in combination with Bristol-Myer’s Opdivo drug last year. New drugs like Opdivo and Tecentriq that enlist the body’s immune system are improving the odds of survival, but their typical price tag of more than $150,000 a year is controversial and adding a personalised vaccine will jack costs up further. Sahin acknowledged such vaccines would be expensive at first but said costs could be brought down by economies of scale and automation. “In the mid to long term the cost will fall dramatically ... it is an individual treatment but it is a universal process,” he said. “We are at a very early stage at the moment but in the long-run this approach could change everything.” Cornelius Melief of Leiden University Medical Center, who was not involved in either study, said the research confirmed the potential of neoantigen vaccines. “Controlled, randomised Phase II clinical trials with more participants are now needed to establish the efficacy of these vaccines in patients with any type of cancer that has enough mutations to provide sufficient neoantigen targets for this type of approach,” he said. Mainz-based BioNTech is one of Europe’s largest private biotech companies, with more than 500 employees and deals with Sanofi and Eli Lilly, as well as Roche. It is majority-owned by twin brothers Andreas and Thomas Struengmann, who sold generic drugmaker Hexal to Novartis in 2005. Sahin said BioNTech would probably stay private for another two to four years before deciding on an initial public offering.

659,BMY,Bristol-Myers shares slump after failed AstraZeneca drug trial,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co shares fell 4 percent on Thursday as investors bet that a failed cancer-drug trial at AstraZeneca Plc would have negative implications for Bristol-Myers’ similar immunotherapy treatment regimen.     AstraZeneca’s Mystic study, released Thursday, looked at a combination of immune system-boosting drugs to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The trial found it was no more effective than chemotherapy in improving the amount of time patients lived without their disease getting worse. Bristol-Myers is studying a similar combination of its two top drugs in the same therapy class, Opdivo and Yervoy. Its shares were down 4 percent at $53.71 in midday trading. So far, Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda is the only immunotherapy that has been approved as an initial treatment for NSCLC, the most common form of the disease. Merck shares were up 4 percent on Thursday. Asked about the implications of AstraZeneca’s results during a conference call with analysts and investors, Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said: “It is difficult to speculate on a comparison.”  He said the trials involved different drugs, dosing schedules, enrollment sizes and other factors. Caforio said Bristol-Myers expects to see some results of its trial in the first quarter of 2018, noting an “opportunity for interim results in overall survival by the end of this year.” Also on Thursday, Bristol-Myers reported second-quarter results that largely met analyst expectations. Sales of Opdivo surged 42 percent from a year earlier to $1.2 billion, while sales of Yervoy rose 34 percent to $322 million. Analysts, on average, expected Opdivo sales of $1.1 billion and Yervoy sales of $307 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The Mystic results increase uncertainty about Bristol’s immuno-oncology franchise, particularly Opdivo plus Yervoy in the important first-line NSCLC market, and therefore, in our view, lower the probability of Bristol being acquired as some on (Wall Street) expect,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. Quarterly sales of blood thinner Eliquis, another important Bristol-Myers drug, jumped 51 percent from a year earlier. Excluding items, Bristol-Myers earned 74 cents a share, matching the average analyst estimate. Revenue for the quarter rose 6 percent to $5.1 billion. The company raised the lower end of its forecast range for 2017 adjusted earnings to $2.90 from $2.85 a share, and left the top end unchanged at $3.

661,BMY,AstraZeneca lung cancer failure sparks 16 percent share fall,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca’s combination of two injectable immunotherapy drugs failed to help patients as hoped in a closely watched advanced lung cancer trial, triggering the biggest ever daily fall in its shares on Thursday. The so-called Mystic study was the industry’s most anticipated clinical experiment this year and the news saw the shares fall 16 percent, wiping some $14 billion off AstraZeneca’s value. The study was viewed as key to proving the value of the group’s new drug pipeline and its future as an independent company, after it spurned a $118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer in 2014. Some analysts said investors would now focus on whether AstraZeneca will become a target again, although banking sources said Pfizer was unlikely to return and others, including Novartis, might be deterred by the weak growth outlook. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told reporters he did not believe the group was now more vulnerable, noting that positive data could have actually made it more desirable. Initial results from Mystic found the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab was no more effective at stopping disease progression than chemotherapy in patients with a protein called PD-L1 on 25 percent or more of their cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs are designed to help the body’s immune cells kill cancer and PD-L1 levels are used as a benchmark to determine if they are likely to work for individual patients. As a secondary endpoint, although not formally tested, durvalumab monotherapy also would not have met a pre-specified threshold of progression-free survival benefit, the company added. Durvalumab is already on the market for bladder cancer, under the brand name Imfinzi. Despite the negative initial results on disease progression,  Soriot said there was still a chance the treatment might show a benefit in improving life expectancy when more data is available in 2018. “We must be patient as the Mystic trial continues as planned to evaluate overall survival.” Uncertainty about Mystic had been heightened by speculation that Soriot might be considering a highly paid new job as head of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Soriot declined to comment directly on what he described as “rumors” on Thursday, although company insiders said he would have had to make a statement if he had firm plans to leave. “I’m not a quitter,” Soriot said. “I’m proud to be the CEO of this company and I look forward to continuing on our journey ahead and continuing to lead the incredible team ... the only thing I can tell you is I am here today.”  Immunotherapies promise to revolutionize cancer care, prompting a race to develop treatments in a market expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in annual sales.  Lung cancer is the single biggest opportunity and Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said the Mystic setback had removed around 10 to 15 percent of AstraZeneca’s mid-term earnings potential. AstraZeneca’s pain is good news for Merck & Co, the only manufacturer on the market with an immunotherapy treatment for previously untreated lung cancer and its shares rose 3 percent. But Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 5 percent, as investors worried about its experimental immunotherapy treatment that is similar to AstraZeneca’s combination.  AstraZeneca - a relative latecomer in immunotherapy - has been pinning its hopes on a combination approach for advanced lung cancer, after already showing that durvalumab alone can help in earlier-stage disease. Durvalumab, which AstraZeneca flagged in 2014 as having annual sales potential of $6.5 billion, is central to its drive into oncology - but it is not the only asset. Offsetting the Mystic hit, the company also reported that its Tagrisso lung cancer pill improved progression-free survival in another trial called Flaura, which Soriot said put it on track for eventual sales of more than $4 billion a year. AstraZeneca has also established a strategic oncology collaboration with Merck to study cancer drug combinations using its drug Lynparza, which is already approved for ovarian cancer but could have much wider uses when combined with immunotherapy. Merck will pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion under the deal, in exchange for half of future Lynparza sales, including $1 billion this year. “AstraZeneca is currently at a crossroads,” said Joe Walters, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, a top-30 shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. “In our view, the group should make every effort to capitalize on their strategic tie-up with Merck announced today and strong progress in the trials for Tagrisso.” The latest news came as AstraZeneca reported another fall in quarterly drug sales, hit by loss of patents on blockbusters like cholesterol pill Crestor. Overall first-quarter revenue fell 10 percent in dollar terms to $5.05 billion, although core earnings per share (EPS) rose 5 percent to $87 cents. Industry analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $5.0 billion and earnings of 80 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. Asked about the fall in the share price to 43 pounds from the 55 offered by Pfizer, Soriot insisted the drug pipeline was delivering and the company’s dividend was not at risk. “There’s a lot more in our pipeline than Mystic.”  ",7272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-cancer/astrazeneca-lung-cancer-failure-sparks-16-percent-share-fall-idUSKBN1AC0OP

Merck will pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion under the deal, in exchange for half of future Lynparza sales, including $1 billion this year. “AstraZeneca is currently at a crossroads,” said Joe Walters, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, a top-30 shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. “In our view, the group should make every effort to capitalize on their strategic tie-up with Merck announced today and strong progress in the trials for Tagrisso.” The latest news came as AstraZeneca reported another fall in quarterly drug sales, hit by loss of patents on blockbusters like cholesterol pill Crestor. Overall first-quarter revenue fell 10 percent in dollar terms to $5.05 billion, although core earnings per share (EPS) rose 5 percent to $87 cents. Industry analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $5.0 billion and earnings of 80 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. Asked about the fall in the share price to 43 pounds from the 55 offered by Pfizer, Soriot insisted the drug pipeline was delivering and the company’s dividend was not at risk. “There’s a lot more in our pipeline than Mystic.”  ",7272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/astrazeneca-cancer/update-7-astrazeneca-lung-cancer-failure-sparks-16-percent-share-fall-idUSL5N1KI1ZJ

The company, which is facing pressure from activist investors after losing ground to rival Merck & Co’s cancer treatment Keytruda, said sales of cancer drug Opdivo rose 42 percent from a year earlier to $1.2 billion, while sales of Yervoy rose 34 percent to $322 million. Analysts, on average, had expected Opdivo sales of $1.1 billion and Yervoy sales of $307 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Total revenue for the quarter rose 6 percent to $5.1 billion, meeting Wall Street estimates. Excluding one-time items, Bristol’s earnings of 74 cents a share matched the average analyst estimate.

676,BMY,US STOCKS-U.S. stocks set to open higher ahead of Fed minutes,"* Fed’s minutes on July policy meeting eyed * Target jumps after strong results * Futures up: Dow 50 pts, S&P; 5.25 pts, Nasdaq 14.75 pts (Adds details, comments, updates price) By Sruthi Shankar Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open higher on Wednesday, with investors awaiting the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting minutes for clues on future interest rake hikes this year. The central bank will release the details of the July policy meeting at 1400 ET (1800 GMT), which could offer insights on the debate over the policy outlook. Policymakers unanimously decided to keep interest rates unchanged in the July 25-26 meeting and said they planned to reduce the central bank’s massive holdings of bonds “relatively soon”. “Investors are looking at expectations of rates going up, but not right away, in a measured pace,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital. “I don’t believe the Fed’s going to bring any shocking news to investors.” A slide in inflation readings in recent months, which remain below the Fed’s 2 percent target rate, have made the markets skeptical about a rate hike by December. However, recent hawkish comments by New York Fed chief William Dudley advocating for another rate hike this year and strong retail sales data on Tuesday have upped the odds. Chances of a December hike rose to 49.2 percent, up from 42 percent at the start of the week, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. At 8:33 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 50 points, or 0.23 percent, with 20,760 contracts changing hands, and S&P; 500 e-minis were up 5.25 points, or 0.21 percent, with 130,516 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.75 points, or 0.25 percent, on volume of 30,606 contracts. Data showed that U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in July as the construction of single- and multi-family homes declined. The Commerce Department said housing starts declined 4.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.16 million units. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks closed little changed as declines in Home Depot and other retailers following results offset the gains from upbeat retail sales data and easing tensions between the United States and North Korea. Shares of Target rose 3.74 percent in premarket trading after the company’s profit and same-store sales beat estimates. Urban Outfitters rose 19.74 percent after the apparel retailer reported quarterly profit and sales that beat estimates, leading to multiple price target raises. Amazon edged lower after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted the retail giant was doing “great damage” to tax paying retailers. Bristol-Myers Squibb was down about 2 percent after its combination drug to treat previously untreated patients with a type of kidney cancer failed to meet one of the main goals of a late-stage trial.

683,BMY,"US STOCKS-Wall St ends flat as media stocks slump, healthcare gains","(Reuters) - Wall Street ended little changed on Thursday after a moderate late-day rally as media stocks, which slumped on negative business updates from Walt Disney and Comcast, were offset by gains in healthcare shares. Comcast (CMCSA.O) dropped 6.2 percent after the cable operator warned of subscriber losses, while Disney shares fell 4.4 percent after the company cautioned about its profit growth. The S&P; 500 media index .SPLRCME ended down 3.6 percent. Gains in healthcare stocks such as AbbVie (ABBV.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) buoyed indexes, while strength in Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) helped keep the tech-heavy Nasdaq in positive territory. Investors were tracking Hurricane Irma, which was bearing down on Florida on the heels of devastation in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey. Irma plowed past the Dominican Republic toward Haiti after devastating a string of Caribbean islands. With Irma looming, shares of insurers were weaker, with the Dow Jones U.S. Insurance index off 1.9 percent. “There’s further uncertainty because of Hurricane Irma that is supposed to be hitting Florida. You don’t know what kind of damage it is going to do,” said John Praveen, managing director at Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey.  Combined with Harvey, in the short term, Praveen said, “maybe it will have a negative impact upon U.S. GDP growth and it might hurt U.S. earnings, and that’s probably why the markets are reacting negatively.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 22.86 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,784.78, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.44 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,465.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 4.56 points, or 0.07 percent, to 6,397.87. Irma is the latest macro event to keep pressure on U.S. equities following concerns earlier this week about geopolitical tensions involving North Korea, which sparked the biggest one-day drop for the S&P; 500 in about three weeks. Adding to concerns, September historically has been the worst month for stocks, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Still, the benchmark S&P; remains near all-time highs, with market watchers pointing to strong earnings growth and solid economic data as helping to support stocks.  “For being in such a nervous world right now, the market has done exceptionally well,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Investors were also digesting comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who said the euro’s strength was  already weighing on inflation and will be a key factor for the ECB next month when it decides how to proceed with its massive stimulus program. General Electric (GE.N) shares sank 3.6 percent, dragging on the S&P; and the Dow, after a bearish analyst note. Apple (AAPL.O) shares also weighed on major indexes, falling 0.4 percent after a report that the company’s new iPhone was hit with production glitches. Financial shares .SPSY slid 1.7 percent amid a drop in U.S. Treasury yields. Healthcare .SPXHC was the best-performing sector, rising 1.1 percent. AbbVie (ABBV.N) shares surged 6.1 percent and Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 5.0 percent after the drugmakers separately reported positive developments for their respective medicines.  Eli Lilly (LLY.N) shares rose 1.3 percent after it said it would lay off about 8 percent of its employees. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

684,BMY,Bristol-Myers stops kidney cancer drug test after early success,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday the success of its combination therapy to improve overall survival in kidney cancer patients helped it end the trial well ahead of schedule, despite earlier reporting mixed results on other main goals. The company said a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, its two main drugs, showed superior overall survival rates than a standard-of-care drug in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Last month, Bristol-Myers said the combination treatment had failed to improve progression-free survival in patients, but had succeeded in reducing the size of their tumors. “We believe the overall survival benefit likely confirms the durability of the signal seen on progression-free survival, leading to a very high likelihood of approval,” Leerink Research analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a client note. The trials to monitor overall survival rates were to run through the second half of 2019, according to Cowen and Co. Bristol-Myers said the study was stopped early after the successful results in a planned interim analysis, sending its shares up 4.2 percent to a 52-week high of $62.415. Exelixis Inc, which is developing a rival kidney cancer treatment, tumbled 10 percent. But, Bristol-Myers’ trial results raised hopes for AstraZeneca Plc’s lung cancer therapy that, in July, failed to show progression-free survival. Barclays analysts said Bristol-Myers’ trial provides perhaps the most explicit evidence to date that progression-free survival may not be the best yardstick to measure the benefit of immunology-oncology drugs. That is why, Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson said, most trials now incorporate overall survival as a primary endpoint. Still, Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo failed to prolong survival in previously untreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the largest cancer market, according to test results earlier this year. The failure led to Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda getting a leg up in the key immuno-oncology field and Bristol-Myers’ becoming the target of activist investors. U.S. health regulators on Wednesday placed a partial hold on three trials testing Opdivo in combination with other medicines for multiple myeloma due to risks seen in similar studies on a rival drug. Cowen and Co analysts estimate Opdivo could generate sales of $12.36 billion in 2022, of which renal cell carcinoma would account for about $1.7 billion. Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for more than 100,000 deaths worldwide each year, Bristol-Myers estimates.

686,BMY,FDA widens holds on immunotherapy combination blood cancer trials,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators stopped five blood cancer trials testing AstraZeneca Plc’s immunotherapy Imfinzi in combination with Celgene Corp medicines from accepting new patients  and halted another study entirely, the companies said on Thursday.   The Food and Drug Administration’s decisions stem from safety concerns uncovered in similar blood cancer trials of Merck & Co Inc’s rival Keytruda medicine in combination with widely used multiple myeloma drugs that Celgene sells. The news follows Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s announcement on Wednesday that the FDA had placed similar partial clinical holds on three trials of the company’s Opdivo immunotherapy in combination with multiple myeloma treatments. The FDA placed a hold on three Merck multiple myeloma combination trials in July after safety monitors reported more deaths among patients who received Keytruda than those in the control group. Keytruda, Opdivo and Imfinzi belong to a new high-profile class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system. They have received numerous approvals for other cancers, such as lung cancer and melanoma. Several companies are testing similar drugs against a wide variety of cancers. Further clinical hold announcements are possible if they are being tested against blood cancers as the FDA works “to better understand the true cause of the safety concerns,” it said last week. The FDA said it still believed the benefits of Keytruda and rival medicines in the class outweigh risks when taken for their approved uses. Under the partial clinical holds placed on the Bristol-Myers and the AstraZeneca-Celgene studies, patients who were experiencing clinical benefits can continue treatment, but no new patients will be enrolled. Patients in the study under full clinical hold will no longer receive the treatment, the companies said. Most of the affected combination studies were for multiple myeloma. One of the trials under partial hold was testing Imfinzi, known chemically as durvalumab, in patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Celgene said it had not identified an imbalance in the risk/benefit profile in its trials, suggesting that the safety issue reported in the Keytruda studies had not cropped up in its trials with the AstraZeneca drug. Celgene shares were up 1.3 percent, while AstraZeneca, which announced positive trial results for an asthma drug, gained more than 4 percent.

690,BMY,Bristol's drug cocktail cuts kidney cancer death risk 37 percent,"MADRID (Reuters) - A combination of two Bristol-Myers Squibb immunotherapy drugs cut the risk of death by 37 percent in a key group of kidney cancer patients, data from a closely watched clinical trial showed on Sunday. The news confirms the cocktail’s utility in a hard-to-treat disease, following a rollercoaster ride. The U.S. drugmaker reported three days ago it was ending the trial well ahead of schedule due to its early success in improving overall survival, despite earlier mixed results. Now the scale of the benefit provided by the two immune system-boosting drugs has been disclosed to experts attending the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress in Madrid. In August, Bristol-Myers reported Opdivo and Yervoy failed to significantly outperform standard care in checking cancer progression, although there was a trend toward benefit. The latest result is important for doctors and investors alike, not only because it opens up a new option for treating kidney cancer but also because it helps validate the idea of combining two different kinds of immunotherapy. Opdivo works by blocking the activity of a protein called PD-1, while Yervoy tackles another called CTLA-4. AstraZeneca is combining two similar drugs in a large lung cancer trial that reported disappointing initial results in July. In the study, the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy was compared to Pfizer’s drug Sutent, a well-established treatment for renal cell carcinoma. Sutent is a so-called TKI drug that blocks signals in cancer cells. Researchers found that it cut the risk of death by 37 percent in intermediate- and poor-risk patients, which was a main pre-specified endpoint of the study. It also improved  overall survival in all patients, a secondary measure of success. Significantly, the immunotherapy combination caused fewer serious side effects than Sutent, lead researcher Bernard Escudier of the Institut Gustave Roussy in France said. He believes the efficacy and safety profile mean Opdivo plus Yervoy should become a new first-line standard of care for patients with advanced disease. Maria de Santis of Britain’s University of Warwick, who was not involved in the study, told reporters: “This data is clearly important and practice-changing and it challenges our former standard of care with TKI therapy.” Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for around 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. Bristol-Myers is a leader in the fast-growing field of cancer immunotherapy and Opdivo is expected to become one of the world’s top-selling medicines. But the drugmaker has been under pressure in the past year after falling behind Merck due to Opdivo’s failure to prolong survival in previously untreated lung cancer, the largest cancer market.

Sales of cancer immunotherapy Opdivo rose 39 percent to $1.27 billion, in line with the average estimate of $1.21 billion, while sales of blood thinner Eliquis rose 38 percent to $1.23 billion, matching analyst estimates. The company said it expects to have final data in the first half of next year from a key trial of Opdivo as a treatment for newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients. Bristol has faced pressure from investors after losing ground to rival Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Excluding one-time items, the drugmaker said it earned 75 cents a share in the third quarter, compared with the 77 cents a share average analyst estimate, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The bottom-line miss was due primarily to lower gross margin, resulting from changes in product mix and inventory,” Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. Bristol said its gross margin as a percentage of revenue fell to 70.1 percent from 73.5 percent a year earlier due to product mix and higher costs, including a $70 million write-off of inventory for hepatitis C products. Stronger sales of Eliquis hurt the company’s overall profit margin, since the blood thinner is co-marketed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). Research and development costs for the quarter rose 36 percent to $1.5 billion, while the company’s effective tax rate increased to 27.6 percent from 22.1 percent in part due to the hurricane in Puerto Rico, where Bristol operates two manufacturing plants.

723,BMY,Roche win boosts case for adding chemo to cancer immunotherapy,"* Win tilts competitive landscape in big lung cancer market * Roche, Merck & Co main backers of chemo-combo therapy * AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers betting on dual immunotherapies By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Cancer doctors struggling to work out the best way to use modern immunotherapy drugs now have further evidence of the benefits of adding them to chemotherapy, despite earlier scepticism. News that Roche’s immune system-boosting drug Tecentriq delayed lung cancer progression when given alongside chemo and its older drug Avastin validates the approach for the first time in a large Phase III clinical trial. It is a significant milestone for physicians, patients and investors, who are trying to assess the competitive landscape as drugmakers race to develop better ways to fight tumours in previously untreated lung cancer. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and first-line treatment provides access to the most patients, opening up potential annual sales forecast by some analysts at $20 billion. Roche and Merck & Co have led the way in pioneering so-called “chemo-combo” treatment, while AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers are betting primarily on mixing two immunotherapies. AstraZeneca notably failed to show a similar benefit in a high-profile clinical trial in July. Stefan Zimmermann, an oncologist at Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland, said the Roche data would help scotch concerns that chemo might hamper the new class of immuno-oncology medicines. “Many experts in the field will be relieved because there has been uncertainty ... I think this will really encourage many of us to use this combination upfront,” he told Reuters. “For now, the only positive data that we have is for chemo combination.” Merck, in fact, already has U.S. approval to add chemo to its immunotherapy drug Keytruda - but this was based on a small trial and the company withdrew a similar European application last month, knocking confidence in its strategy. Since Keytruda, Bristol’s Opdivo, Roche’s Tecentriq and AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi are all rival inhibitors of biological switches known as PD-1 or PD-L1, the market is “largely a zero-sum game”, according to Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. “Roche’s good fortune means there is less to go around for other companies,” he said. In the case of Merck, the U.S. drugmaker now faces a rival with a different and perhaps superior drug combination. Roche believes adding Avastin in addition to chemo can further help restore anti-cancer immunity. For AstraZeneca and Bristol, the bar has just been raised for two other key clinical trials sponsored by the drugmakers that are expected to report results in 2018. Roche itself will present full results on the ability of its new combination to delay the worsening of lung cancer at a European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Geneva on Dec. 7. Data on whether it also helps patients live longer is expected in the first half of next year. Overall survival is the gold standard in cancer care but proving a treatment extends the time before disease progresses is an important marker on the way. “If there is positive progression-free survival then I think it is very, very likely this will also translate into an overall survival benefit over time,” said Zimmermann.

Bristol said the charge will affect its previous forecast for net earnings per share and its tax rate, but will not have an impact on its outlook after adjusting for one-time items. In October, the company said it expected full-year 2017 net earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.46 with an effective tax rate of 25 percent to 26 percent, while adjusted earnings were forecast at $2.95 to $3.05 per share with a tax rate of 22 percent. Changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act include a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. It also exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, sets a one-time tax for U.S. business profits now held overseas, and prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad.  Bristol-Myers said it is still evaluating all the provisions of the legislation and currently estimates that the net impact on its adjusted tax rate will be roughly neutral in 2018.

739,BMY,Bristol-Myers' positive cancer data still lags Merck,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Monday provided some positive data on its immuno-oncology drugs for the most lucrative lung cancer market but it fell short of giving clarity on its ability to compete with a rival treatment from Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N)  Shares fell 2.6 percent to $61.86 in midday trading. Bristol-Myers, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, said it found a new way to identify cancer patients who are treatable by immunotherapy drugs.  It said non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumor cells had a high level tumor mutation burden (TMB) showed a highly statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival with a combination of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy versus chemotherapy. Companies had been classifying patients in terms of a tumor’s expression of a protein called PD-L1. Better diagnostic tests could improve predictions of whether cancer patients are likely to benefit from the costly treatments. Progression-free survival is a measure of how long a treatment can keep the disease from worsening. But analysts said they were waiting to see if it actually helps patients live longer, a standard that Merck’s Keytruda has demonstrated in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer. “Overall survival is what matters,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note, noting that regulators favor that standard. “The survival benefit may not be that great, and perhaps not as good as Merck’s.” The company said it plans to release overall survival data for the Opdivo and Yervoy combination toward the end of the year or early next year. Bristol-Myers was a pioneer in immunotherapy, but Merck has nearly pulled even, primarily via Keytruda’s use in lung cancer. Sales of Keytruda were just shy of the $1.36 billion that BMS pulled in with Opdivo in the quarter. The company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.33 billion compared with a year-ago profit of $894 million, due to a one-time $2.9 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax reform law. Excluding one-time items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 68 cents per share in the quarter, beating analysts’ average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of blood thinner Eliquis, which the company shares with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), rose nearly 44 percent to match Opdivo’s sales of $1.36 billion. The company forecast 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.30. Analysts had forecast $3.23 per share.

744,BMY,Roche notches fresh win amid crowd of immunotherapy cocktails,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s Tecentriq mixed with an older drug cut the risk of death in kidney cancer, marking another win for the Swiss drugmaker’s immuno-oncology (I/O) cocktail as it battles better-established medicines made by its rivals.  Tecentriq, paired with Roche’s Avastin, cut risk of renal cell carcinoma advancing or death (PFS) by 26 percent in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of a protein believed to help avoid immune detection, the Basel-based drugmaker said on Tuesday. Roche said the overall survival benefit in its IMmotion 151 trial looked encouraging, but that data was not yet mature. Success of Roche’s trial, so far, compares favourably with the mixed results in last year’s study by Bristol-Myers Squibb for its Opdivo and Yervoy combination against kidney cancer. “Today’s results are good, as IMmotion 151 met the co-primary endpoint of PFS, while Bristol’s CheckMate-214 missed,” Bank Vontobel analysts wrote in a note to investors. Roche shares fell 1.2 percent at 1350 GMT, less than the 1.8 percent drop of the Stoxx European Health Care Index. This is the second time Tecentriq with Avastin has succeeded, after a separate study in December showed the cocktail helped lung cancer patients. Still, Roche has an uphill fight to establish Tecentriq as a go-to immunotherapy amid a pack of immunotherapy combinations from rivals that have also scored recent trial wins. Bristol reported on Monday that Opdivo and Yervoy boosted life expectancy in lung cancer patients whose tumors had many mutations. Meanwhile, Merck’s Keytruda immunotherapy plus chemotherapy aced a lung cancer trial last month. So far, Tecentriq with its 487 million Swiss francs ($519.30 million) in sales in 2017 is still chasing Merck’s Keytruda with $3.8 billion and Bristol’s Opdivo with $4.9 billion. The success of three different approaches against different cancers suggests doctors will face tough decisions over which cocktail to use, since tumors of the same organs can differ wildly from patient to patient. “Physicians will have a challenge deciding which biomarker to use to and which therapeutic option to consequently prioritize,” Barclays analyst Emmanuel Papadakis said.  With its medicine fighting to gain traction, Roche says understanding which immunotherapy combination works best remains a work in progress. The Swiss drugmaker has six Tecentriq trials to read out by July. “As we approach the end of this year, we’ll have a much clearer evidence base,” Roche drugs division chief Dan O’Day said on Friday.

747,BMY,UPDATE 1-Bristol-Myers to pay $1.85 bln in cancer deal with Nektar,"(Adds share moves, analyst comment) By Bill Berkrot Feb 14 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co will pay Nektar Therapeutics $1.85 billion for a global development and profit-sharing deal on a promising Nektar cancer drug, the companies announced on Wednesday. In one of the largest single-drug collaboration deals ever, Nektar will receive $1 billion in cash upfront and Bristol-Myers will purchase about 8.28 million Nektar shares at $102.60 per share, or an equity stake of just under 5 percent of the company. Nektar shares closed at $75.66 on Tuesday. If all potential development, regulatory and sales milestones in the deal are met, it could be worth more than $3.6 billion to Nektar, while giving Bristol-Myers a new immunotherapy platform. Nektar shares were up 8 percent at $81.74, while Bristol-Myers shares rose 0.7 percent to $64.32. “We believe the deal economics are favorable to both parties,” Cowen analyst Chris Shibutani said in a research note. The partnership is built around the Nektar drug, NKTR-214, which will be tested with Bristol’s immuno-oncology (IO) drugs Opdivo and Opdivo and Yervoy in 20 cancer indications across nine different tumor types, including melanoma, kidney and lung cancers, following “very encouraging” early data from clinical trials. “We’ve been in a clinical collaboration with Nektar since 2016. This partnership was a natural next step,” Paul Biondi, head of business development for Bristol-Myers, said in a telephone interview. The combination therapies could become “potentially a new backbone in the IO space,” he added. The announcement comes as early immunotherapy leader Bristol-Myers has been viewed by investors as having fallen behind Merck & Co in the burgeoning field, especially in the most lucrative lung cancer space. NKTR-214, a CD122 agonist that utilizes the interleukin-2 (IL-2) pathway, is designed to increase the number and activation state of cancer-fighting T cells in the tumor microenvironment, while limiting IL-2 toxicity, with the hope of improving and lengthening patient responses. Nektar is also eligible to receive an additional $1.78 billion in milestone payments, of which $1.43 billion are development and regulatory milestones and the remainder are sales milestones. Following approvals, Nektar will book revenue for worldwide NKTR-214 sales and the companies will split global profits, with Nektar receiving 65 percent and Bristol-Myers 35 percent, they said. Bristol-Myers will retain 100 percent of revenues for its own medicines. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, the companies said. Both companies would be free to develop NKTR-214 with other drugs for uses not laid out in the deal.

753,BMY,FDA approves new dosing for Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Tuesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved a four-week dosing schedule for its cancer drug, Opdivo. Opdivo with a two-week dosing schedule was previously approved to treat a number of cancers such as melanoma. The drug belongs to a fast-growing class of drugs called PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors that help the immune system attack cancer by blocking a mechanism tumors use to evade detection. William Blair analyst Matt Phipps in a client note said the new approval may help the drug expand into the “maintenance and adjuvant therapy settings”. Maintenance therapy immediately follows initial treatment to keep patients cancer-free if they go into remission. The company said on Tuesday the drug was also approved for shorter 30-minute infusions, reducing previous infusion time in half. “Cutting the number of infusions in half with the four-week dosing schedule provides meaningful benefit to patients and reduces the burden at infusion centers,” said Phipps. The analyst added that Bristol-Myers is testing Opdivo in nine late-stage adjuvant trials and as maintenance therapy in small-cell lung cancer. Other PD-1 inhibitors include drugs from rivals such as Merck & Co and Roche.  The FDA decision makes Opdivo the only PD-1 inhibitor to offer every four-week dosing, according to the company.

758,BMY,Roche's Tecentriq notches third cancer cocktail trial win,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq on Tuesday racked up a third trial win in combination with other cancer drugs, a boost for the Swiss drugmaker as it seeks to muscle in on space dominated by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. A late-stage study, called IMpower131, demonstrated Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane cut risk of disease worsening or death (PFS), compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.  Roche is aiming to be the first to win regulators’ blessing for an immunotherapy combination against this form of lung cancer, which accounts for 25-30 percent of lung cancer cases. The trial will continue, as Roche awaits overall survival  data it hopes will show its combination keeps people alive longer than standard chemotherapy. Overall survival is the gold standard when assessing a drug’s effectiveness. Roche has numerous trials of Tecentriq with other drugs as the Basel-based company seeks to make up ground against Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo medicines, whose combined sales are more than 10-fold those of Tecentriq’s 487 million Swiss francs ($512.42 million) in 2017.  This latest data, from the IMpower131 trial, marks the third time since December that Roche has demonstrated a benefit for patients getting a Tecentriq cocktail, including against other forms of lung cancer and kidney cancer. “Squamous non-small cell lung cancer is difficult to treat and there have been limited new treatment options over the last few decades,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer. “We look forward to seeing more mature overall survival data.” Roche shares rose 0.3 percent at 0900 GMT. “We currently model $1.1 billion of peak sales for Tecentriq in this setting and have previously highlighted that a positive result from the trial could see 1 percent to 3 percent upside to earnings per share,” said Ian Hilliker, a Jefferies analyst. Even so, being first is no guarantee of success. Tecentriq beat others in bladder cancer but Roche’s rivals soon caught up. “One year later, all the competitors — Merck, Bristol and AstraZeneca — got the nod for bladder cancer as well and the revenue growth of Tecentriq began to suffer,” Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said.   Since immunotherapies like Tecentriq, Keytruda and Optdivo work in just a fraction of patients, all the companies are staking hopes on combinations with other drugs to boost their success.  The cocktails are proving worthwhile. Last month, Bristol-Myers said a key lung cancer combination trial met its main goal while Merck data for Keytruda in January sent its shares soaring.

763,BMY,Roche's Tecentriq cocktail adds to lung cancer survival success,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s Tecentriq immunotherapy combined with other drugs boosted lung cancer patients’ survival versus an older cocktail, the Swiss company said as it seeks an edge on Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Mixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies. The latest trial success follows Roche’s announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.  The Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail. While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.  “We are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer.  She also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers. The world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals’ cheaper copies. Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an “already robust” set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq’s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer. “We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,” Baader’s Bruno Bulic said.  “Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche’s profitability going forward.”   ",3262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-tecentriq/roches-tecentriq-cocktail-adds-to-lung-cancer-survival-success-idUSKBN1H20FP

774,BMY,"Merck, Bristol-Myers immunotherapies impress in key lung cancer trials","April 16 (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival versus chemotherapy alone in newly-diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in a highly-anticipated study that appears to cement the company’s lead in the most lucrative oncology market. While magnitude of the survival benefit in the late-stage study was not yet known, the Keytruda combination cut the risk of death by 51 percent compared with chemotherapy and significantly delayed disease worsening, according to data presented on Monday. “This study showed a clear difference in long-term outcomes,” said Dr. Leena Gandhi, the study’s primary investigator, who called the results “practice changing.” In another closely-watched study, a combination of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients whose tumors had a high number of genetic mutations. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. The results were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in Chicago. Keytruda and Opdivo have piled up approvals for advanced cancers, such as for melanoma and bladder cancer. But those drugs and rival immunotherapies from Roche and AstraZeneca are jockeying for pieces of the largest lung cancer market. Thus far, Merck is dominating the coveted newly-diagnosed setting. There are more than 200,000 new cases of NSCLC each year in the United States alone, with about half at advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis. The Keytruda plus chemotherapy regimen was approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced patients based on earlier data from a small study. But many clinicians wanted to see validation of a survival benefit in a large trial. “We were all waiting to see a definitive Phase III study that showed very clear cut results,” said Gandhi, director of thoracic medical oncology at NYU Langone in New York. In both studies, the positive results were not dependent on cancer cell’s levels of PD-L1, a marker of inflammation that has been commonly used with drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo to help predict patient responses, with higher PD-L1 levels believed to lead to greater efficacy. In the Merck-sponsored trial called Keynote-189, median overall survival was 11.3 months for chemotherapy but not yet reached for the Keytruda combination. “We don’t know how long their survival is going to be and we’re excited about that,” Gandhi said. After 12 months, 69.2 percent of patients in the Keytruda group were alive compared with 49.4 percent for chemotherapy, researchers reported. The differences would likely have been more pronounced, but many patients in the chemotherapy group were given Keytruda or a similar drug once their disease progressed. In the study called CheckMate-227, 43 percent of patients with high TMB who received Opdivo and low-dose Yervoy experienced no disease progression after one year versus 13 percent in the chemotherapy group. There was preliminary evidence of a likely survival benefit but it was too early to determine that, researchers said. The overall response rate - those with significant tumor shrinkage - was 45 percent for the immunotherapies versus 27 percent for chemotherapy. After one year, 68 percent of responders to Opdivo and Yervoy continued to benefit from the therapy. Dr. Matthew Hellman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study, said it was a validation of TMB as a biomarker and that Opdivo with Yervoy should be an important chemotherapy-sparing regimen in first-line lung cancer. “This is great that there’s new options and improved outcomes,” Hellman said of the two studies. “That’s tremendous progress for patients with lung cancer.” (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; editing by Diane Craft)",4162018,http://www.reuters.com/article/cancer-merck-co-bristol-myers/merck-bristol-myers-immunotherapies-impress-in-key-lung-cancer-trials-idUSL1N1RQ297

777,BMY,"Bristol-Myers raises 2018 forecast, some sales disappoint","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Thursday significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast even as first-quarter sales of some medicines fell short of expectations and sent shares of the U.S. drugmaker down almost 1 percent. Sales of immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, the company’s most important growth driver, surged 34 percent to $1.51 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.28 billion. “Eliquis and Opdivo were very strong,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said, but added: “There was weakness across several of its franchises,” noting sales shortfalls of cancer drugs Sprycel and older immunotherapy Yervoy. The hepatitis C franchise all but disappeared with sales of just $3 million, while Wall Street was looking for about $56 million. That stood in sharp contrast to AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) hepatitis C drugs, which blew past analysts’ forecasts on Thursday. Bristol-Myers shares were down 0.7 percent at $51.38, while AbbVie’s were up 3.5 percent at $95.09. Despite Opdivo’s strong showing, there is concern its important sales in second-line lung cancer will shrink as use of rival Keytruda from Merck & Co (MRK.N) increases as an initial treatment in the most lucrative oncology market. Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio acknowledged the changing competitive dynamics, but expressed optimism for the long term. “I continue to see BMS as a growth company and I do see Opdivo as a growth franchise,” he told analysts. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 94 cents per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 9 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company increased its 2018 earnings forecast by well over 9 cents per share as it now sees a lower than previously anticipated tax rate along with a favorable foreign exchange environment. Bristol-Myers expects 2018 earnings of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, up from its prior view of $3.15 to $3.30 and well ahead of average Wall Street estimates of $3.26 per share. It expects mid-single digit sales growth after previously forecasting low- to mid-single growth. Sales of Eliquis, the blood clot preventer Bristol shares with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), jumped 37 percent to $1.5 billion, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $1.34 billion. The company said it expects Eliquis to continue gaining market share both from new patients and converts from generic warfarin. Yervoy sales dropped 25 percent to $249 million, missing Wall Street estimates by about $32 million. It could see a rebound if use with Opdivo increases. The chemotherapy-sparing combination recently won U.S. approval to treat advanced kidney cancer. Sprycel sales fell 5 percent to $438 million. Helped by the new U.S. tax law, Bristol-Myers projected an effective 2018 tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent, below its previous estimate of about 20 percent.  Revenue rose 5 percent to $5.2 billion, but was about 1 percent below Wall Street consensus estimates. Net profit for the quarter slipped to $1.5 billion, or 91 cents per share, from $1.52 billion, or 94 cents a share, a year ago.

783,BMY,UPDATE 3-Keytruda sales power Merck to quarterly beat,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by a more than 150 percent rise in sales of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda. Shares dropped 2.8 percent to $57.22, however, on investor concerns that the company is becoming increasingly reliant on the drug, which is positioned to become the leading player in a new generation of oncology treatments.  Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the company said it does not plan to spin off its animal health business or do a large, transformational deal. “While Keytruda continues to do fantastically well, investors are still clamoring for something else besides Keytruda to focus on – thus the push by investors to spin out animal health, and the continual probing about M&A;,” Jefferies analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The surge in Keytruda sales more than offset steep declines in sales for its shingles vaccine Zostavax and hepatitis C treatment Zepatier.  Keytruda had sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter, ahead of $1.40 billion estimated by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Keytruda’s sales have nearly pulled even with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) rival drug Opdivo, which also harnesses the body’s immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells. Industry experts give Merck’s drug the edge after results from trials for both treatments last month, and Merck said on Tuesday the drug could be its largest seller ever. Revenue from the drug accounted for nearly 15 percent of Merck’s sales. Merck CEO Ken Frazier said on the company’s conference call that while the company did not expect to do transformational deals, it was looking for opportunities to enhance its drug pipeline. “We have a strong balance sheet. We have the power and the flexibility to do deals at any size and stage, and we’re going to continue to look for things that can drive long-term value and growth,” he said.  Merck raised its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to $4.16 to $4.28 per share from its previous forecast of $4.08 to $4.23 per share. Net income fell 52.5 percent to $736 million, or 27 cents per share, hurt by a $1.4-billion charge related to a collaboration with Eisai Co Ltd, the company said. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.05 per share, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1 per share. Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $10.04 billion but missed estimates of $10.11 billion.

787,BMY,UPDATE 1-Roche's Tecentriq combo wins fast FDA review in race to catch rivals,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s immunotherapy combination that includes Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy will get an accelerated review by U.S. regulators for use as an initial treatment of a common form of lung cancer, the Swiss drugmaker said on Monday. Roche expects a U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision by Sept. 5. It has already announced some results of clinical trials that showed the cocktail boosted survival benefit for patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to older treatments.  Tecentriq is approved to treat NSCLC after other therapies fail, but Roche is pushing to deploy its medicine with other drugs as early as possible to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Merck’s Keytruda is approved for initial lung cancer treatment in some patients. “We are working closely with the FDA to bring this treatment regimen to people with this type of lung cancer as soon as possible,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer. Tecentriq’s status as a late-comer in immunotherapy compared to Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo has contributed to sluggish sales.  In the first-quarter, Tecentriq revenue of 139 million Swiss francs ($138.9 million) lagged the 154 million poll estimate in a Reuters poll and was just above the 132 million of the fourth quarter, which analysts cited as a blemish on results. Still, Roche points to numerous ongoing studies in lung and other cancers that include Tecentriq, contending it still had a shot at beating rivals to market in first-line treatment of small cell and first-line squamous cell lung cancer.
