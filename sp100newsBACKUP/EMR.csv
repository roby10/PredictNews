1,EMR,Main St investors cautious even as data improves,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A few strong data points was all Wall Street needed to rally on Thursday, but on Main Street caution is still king and dividend-paying stocks are in favor.  Strong hiring by U.S. private employers in June coupled with a larger-than-expected drop in jobless claims spurred hopes that the soft patch the U.S. economy has entered might be short, rather than lead to another recession.  Better-than-expected sales gains at retailers like Macy’s Inc (M.N), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Target Corp (TGT.N) added to optimism.  But with unemployment still relatively high and debt issues swirling in Greece and Europe, there is a lot of uncertainty about investing, said Catherine Avery, president of Catherine Avery Investment Management in New Canaan, Connecticut.  “We’re going to have ups and downs, the data’s not going to move up in a straight line,” said Avery, who oversees about $20 million in assets. “Because of that, we’re advising clients who are still very, very scared and nervous about getting back into the market, that they should be looking toward high-quality, dividend-paying stocks.”  Avery recommended industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), which for 54 consecutive years has increased its dividend, along with Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and oil field services company Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N).  Money markets are returning next to nothing and the 10-year U.S. Treasury is yielding a little more than 3 percent.

Maris said his firm, which manages more than $200 million, normally favors mid-cap stocks, but small- and mid-caps have had a good run so he’s recommending large-cap value.  “The transition from bonds to stocks is going to be to stocks with a big dividend,” said Maris, noting how his clients are handling their investments.  “They know they’re in stocks, they know it’s a little bit riskier but in their mind’s eye they’re still getting their income every month from these nice dividends, which are approaching the yield on intermediate bonds,” he said.

4,EMR,Industrials could signal slower growth ahead,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers are entering an period where growth is more muted, profit margins are harder to raise and earnings beats are less common.  The easy money has been made, many analysts and shareholders of U.S. industrial stocks say.  General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Jeff Immelt, whose company reports second-quarter earnings next week, acknowledges that the industrial conglomerate is operating in volatile times.  Demand is tremendous, the company’s chief executive says. “You see it getting better, yet at the same time, there’s more discontent,” Immelt said this week at a sprawling GE factory in South Carolina. “This recovery has been so different from previous recoveries.”  Analysts say industrials are in transition from a  “V-shaped” recovery after recession, when nearly everyone increased sales and profits, to an unpredictable period when some businesses thrive, others lag and picking winners is harder.  “Industrials as a group may be among the first to see their profit margins challenged,” said Keith Goddard, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which owns GE, Johnson Controls (JCI.N) and FedEx (FDX.N), among other companies whose fortunes are tied to the business cycle.  “Margins are bumping up against all-time highs,” said Goddard, who favors healthcare stocks. “Don’t go to the industrial space looking for positive earnings surprises.”  Increasing commodity and labor costs will trim profits across corporate America, he said, hitting labor-intensive manufacturers. GE has more than 100,000 workers just in the United States.  Many investors play down the negative effects of the U.S. government debt-ceiling impasse and a cautious, debt-burdened U.S. consumer. Slow growth is not a double-dip recession, they say.  Although the U.S. recovery has stalled by some measures, other large economies are still hungry for heavy machinery, cooling equipment, tools and other industrial goods.  Companies keyed to Brazil, India and China, including 3M (MMM.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N) and Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), will again benefit from robust capital spending, much of it funded by governments.  One question earnings season may answer is whether Europe’s debt crisis will affect growth and alter profit expectations. Europe’s problems are overemphasized, said Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund, which holds shares of Caterpillar (CAT.N), Deere (DE.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N).  Industrial shares have rallied into earnings season. For a graphic, click: r.reuters.com/wes62s “I’m not too worried about earnings this quarter,” Pursche said — but a potential global economic slowdown could damp prospects for corporate profits. “I’m much more concerned about cautionary statements from CFOs and CEOs about the rest of the year. It’s going to be a much more challenging environment.”  Caterpillar could sound a cautious note because of China’s efforts to rein in its economy, he said. China’s leaders have suggested they will again raise interest rates and bank reserve requirements to bring down inflation.  U.S. industrials are among the most globally diverse multinationals, but the U.S. market still accounts for as much as half of their revenue. Recent data offers fodder for both bulls and bears.  U.S. June industrial production data disappointed on Friday, and May was revised lower.  A monthly gauge of factory activity by the Institute of Supply Management rebounded last month from a May slump, easing fears of a broad slowdown.  But construction spending — a key market for companies ranging from Eaton to Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), United Technologies and Tyco TYC.N — has fallen for six straight months to its lowest in a decade.  And a quarterly Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI survey pointed to further growth, but at a slower rate. The poll of financial executives, a leading indicator of manufacturing activity, found a fourth straight decline in sentiment.  Companies whose fiscal years ended in June, including Parker Hannifin (PH.N) and Kennametal (KMT.N), will give initial glimpses into 2012 when they introduce 12-month earnings forecasts. Both are known for starting with conservative profit targets.  Other variables to watch this quarter are how much Japan’s March earthquake hurts companies such as 3M; electrical manufacturers’ ability to offset higher steel and copper costs with pricing; and the impact of a weak U.S. dollar.  Depressed housing and a delayed recovery in non-residential construction could hurt machinery makers and rental companies, as well as makers of air conditioners and components.  Other late-cycle markets, such as power generation equipment and aerospace, are also expected to grow over the next two years after declines in 2009 and 2010, so any sign of whether their rebound has begun will be an area of focus.  Electrical equipment and multi-industry companies are near the end of a beat-and-raise phase of their cycle, said Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callahan.  “You had the big V-shaped snapback against easy comparisons,” he said. “Growth has been abnormally high. We’re entering a maturing part of the cycle.”  Managers will point to moderating growth rates this quarter, with few sounding especially bullish. Corporate crystal balls are as cloudy as anyone else’s, O’Callahan said.  ‘WHITE-KNUCKLE’ BULLS  Enough investors see the glass as half-full that earnings expectations and price-to-earnings ratios have risen this year. Industrial shares .GSPIC are up 7 percent year to date, outperforming the broader market. A few, such as Tyco and SPX SPW.N, have jumped 25 percent or more.  At 16 times this year’s estimated earnings, industrials are more richly valued than the overall S&P 500, but are only slightly above their historical average, according to Goldman Sachs.  Goldman analysts, in a July 10 note, predicted industrial companies would sound a more “constructive” tone about the second half of the year than recent economic numbers suggest. They cited expanding late-cycle markets, the weak dollar, and share buybacks and acquisitions.  Most U.S. industrials will beat Wall Street forecasts by 1 percent or 2 percent, said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co, who calls himself a “white-knuckle” bull.  “I expect bigger beats out of companies levered to energy,” he said, citing Dover (DOV.N), Ametek (AME.N) and Emerson. “Ninety-some-dollar oil makes it worth punching holes in the ground.”  Langenberg said current expectations of double-digit profit growth over the next two years are reasonable.  “We’re not back at peak earnings yet,” he said.

6,EMR,UPDATE 4-Weak U.S. housing market hits Ingersoll profit," * Q2 EPS from continuing ops $0.88 vs. expected $0.93   * Q2 revenue rises 12 pct to $3.89 billion   * Says remodeling, home building markets stagnant   * Shares down 7.3 pct   * Does not change its full-year forecast  (Adds analyst and CEO comment, updates stock activity)   By Nick Zieminski   NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday because of weakness in its residential unit that makes home air conditioners and locks, sending its shares down 7.3 percent in morning trading.   Ingersoll, which makes industrial air compressors and security technology including Schlage locks, said remodeling and home building markets remained “stagnant.”   Residential HVAC and security accounts for a smaller portion of Ingersoll revenue than its commercial offerings, but remains exposed to North American markets. The residential business was the only Ingersoll division with lower sales, orders and margins in the quarter.   “We see a continuation of a challenging backdrop in the residential market, as single family housing starts and consumer confidence remained at low levels,” Ingersoll chief executive Mike Lamach said on a conference call.   Net earnings fell to $92.3 million, or 26 cents per share, from $196.6 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.   The results included a charge related to the sale of Ingersoll’s Hussmann unit, a maker of refrigerated display cases for retailers. Profit from continuing operations was 88 cents per share, 5 cents below expectations.   Sales rose 12 percent to $3.89 billion, matching average analyst estimates.   Lamach said the company was on track to sell Hussmann by the end of the third quarter, but would not comment on the likely price the unit would fetch. In March, sources said it would likely sell for less than $1 billion. [ID:nN09281765]   The company’s industrial segment, which makes compressors, tools and utility vehicles, raised profit margins to a record level and boosted international sales by a third, helped by Asian demand.   The company’s climate unit, which includes Trane commercial air conditioners, showed stronger demand for equipment than for parts and service. Margins expanded there as well.   Global industrial and refrigerated transport markets are recovering, Asian markets are strong and demand for commercial heating and cooling systems is slowly recovering in North America, it said.   It forecast third-quarter profit from continuing operations between 85 cents and 95 cents per share. Analysts expected 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It did not change its full-year forecast.   Ingersoll shares fell $3.28 to $41.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.   United Tech, parent of Carrier, the world’s No. 1 maker of heating and cooling (HVAC) equipment, this week also noted weakness in residential demand for air conditioners.   “We’re still only about 60 percent of peak demand and we’re probably not going to get back to peak until we see housing pick back up,” United Tech’s finance chief Greg Hayes said.   Referring to Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) strong quarterly earnings results this week, Hayes joked, “If it touches the consumer, unless you put an Apple on it ... it’s not moving.”   Carrier, however, grew profit margins, said Jeff Sprague, managing partner with Vertical Research, so Ingersoll’s problems cannot be blamed solely on a cool spring or the reduction of energy tax credits.   “It raises some fairly big questions about the back half,” Sprague said, adding that Ingersoll appears to be losing market share to Carrier. “The real miss is execution on profit. There’s an operational problem here.”   Ingersoll named the chief of its Club Car business to run the residential business. Gary Michel, a 26-year company veteran, will replace Steven Hochhauser, who is leaving.   Ingersoll’s disappointing results could affect earnings expectations for Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), whose climate business makes compressors, thermostats and electronic controls and is heavily reliant on residential markets.   Forecasts for Lennox International (LII.N), which derives most of its business from North America, and for distributor Watsco (WSO.N), may also come down. Both report next week.   Parker Hannifin (PH.N) and Regal-Beloit Corp (RBC.N) also participate in the HVAC market. Emerson, Parker and Regal-Beloit are set to report results next month.

7,EMR,"Deadlock, durables, dismal earnings hit Wall Street","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street suffered its worst day in eight weeks on Wednesday, hit by weak earnings, lackluster economic data and no movement in Washington talks as the deadline for a U.S. default looms.  The debt ceiling debate has grabbed much of investors’ attention this week as the August 2 deadline approaches, but it took a back seat for much of the day as the market reacted to earnings disappointments in industrial and technology sectors.  A profit warning from Juniper Networks (JNPR.N) sent its shares down 20.9 percent to $24.66, damaging sentiment in the technology sector, which has been among the strongest this reporting period. The S&P tech index .GSPT declined 3 percent.  A late statement from White House that the government would be “running on fumes” if the debt ceiling isn’t increased by the deadline added to selling.  Besides a potential default on U.S. debt, the government could face a downgrade of its credit. The S&P 500 index .SPX has lost nearly 3 percent so far this week amid acrimonious debate about cutting spending and raising the debt limit.  “The market is beginning to show real concerns in terms of a default. I don’t think it’s going to happen ... (but) are we headed for a downgrade? That is becoming more of a possibility as each day goes by,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, in New York.  Many investors are opting to wait for the outcome of the talks before putting more money on the table.  “We haven’t been committing new capital. We’ve been holding off on making any purchases over the last few days,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago. “If you multiply us by the other 10,000 money managers, you get a sense of why the market is getting a little soft.”  Volume increased as the selling extended, a sign of weak conviction among investors. Nearly 14 stocks fell for every one that rose on the NYSE.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 198.75 points, or 1.59 percent, at 12,302.55. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 27.05 points, or 2.03 percent, at 1,304.89, and had its worst daily percentage decline since June 1. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 75.17 points, or 2.65 percent, at 2,764.79.  New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell unexpectedly in June, and a gauge of business spending plans slipped. [ID:nN1E76Q0BV] Also, the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book” report showed the pace of the recovery slowing in most districts surveyed, indicating the economy was not bouncing back as the year’s second half began.  Moderating order growth at Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) added to worries about earnings among industrial stocks. Emerson shares fell 6.7 percent to $50.43.  The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX rose 13.6 percent, gaining for a third day, and analysts said the index is pricing in the possibility of a U.S. credit downgrade.  The S&P 500 fell below it’s 50-day moving average. Analysts are eyeing the 200-day average near 1,283 as an area of support.  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have fallen for three straight days while the Dow fell for a fourth day.  The Emerson outlook came after troubling signs from Caterpillar (CAT.N), Whirlpool (WHR.N), Ingersoll-Rand (IR.N), and PepsiCo PEP.N, all of whose shares were punished by investors.  Tech stocks, on the other hand, have been a bright spot so far this earnings period.  The overall mean change in S&P 500 technology earnings estimates for the second quarter is a positive 2.2 percent, the best of the 10 S&P sectors, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.  The latest earnings disappointments are “causing people to rethink their portfolios and move some stuff around, especially on the technology side,” said Stifel Nicholas technology trader Adam Tracy in San Francisco.  After the close, shares of Akamai Technologies (AKAM.O) dropped 11.8 percent to $26 after it reported results.  Overall, some 8.69 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 7.47 billion.  On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners outweighed advancers by about 14 to 1, while Nasdaq losers beat winners by roughly 7 to 1.

11,EMR,Fears of second-half slowdown spook corporate America,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Corporate America’s hopes for a second-half pickup in the U.S. economy dimmed on Wednesday, as companies from Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) to Corning Inc (GLW.N) warned of weakening demand for everything from industrial equipment to televisions.  Their cautious words, coupled with weak earnings reports from Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and health insurer WellPoint Inc WLP.N spooked investors who are already on edge over the U.S. debt-ceiling standoff, sending the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX down more than 1 percent.  The words marked a change in tone for big companies, many of which had previously been calling for demand to pick up later in the year.  Executives warned that the long-awaited rebound in consumer spending is not materializing, as the nation’s stubbornly high unemployment leaves many families with less disposable income.  Adding to their worries, the industrial demand that so far has helped prop up a sluggish economy, is starting to fade.  “We have seen a definite weakening of general business activity in June and July,” Emerson said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The St. Louis-based maker of power equipment for corporate computer networks and factory automation gear noted that its order growth slowed in the three months ended in June: “U.S. and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft patch and it remains unclear if they will improve much in the second half of the calendar year.”  The company’s shares fell 7 percent, hitting their lowest point since September and pulled down fellow industrials including Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) .  “Emerson’s management team has their finger on the pulse of the global economy pretty well,” said Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan. “Their upfront statement is sending a message about a broader slowdown.”  Even companies that posted better-than-expected results, including Boeing Co (BA.N), did so largely on cost cutting, analysts said.  For an interactive earnings scorecard: r.reuters.com/dud72s Glassmaker Corning opened a window into consumer behavior when it lowered its demand forecast, saying that fewer consumers seemed ready to spend their money on high-end flat-panel televisions.  “There is a sense that the economies around the world are not growing as fast as people had originally hoped,” said Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws, on a day the company reported a 17.3 percent drop in quarterly profit.  “What you are seeing is the major TV brands like Sony, Samsung, LG all reducing their forecasts of what will be sold at retail,” Flaws added. “It is not by huge amounts but it is by an amount that is causing us, and the rest of the supply chain, to say there is going to be less volume in the back half of the year.”  Two of the U.S. economy’s biggest structural weaknesses, the rising cost of energy and healthcare, also played a role in Wednesday’s wave of worry.  No. 2 airline Delta said profit fell 57.6 percent, more than analysts had expected. The company blamed the drop on a run-up in fuel prices over the past year, which more than offset a rise in revenue. Its shares fell 5 percent to their lowest since November 2009.  “The challenge to the airlines right now is absorbing higher fuel costs,” said Matthew Jacob, senior airlines analyst at ITG Investment Research.  WellPoint, the No. 2 U.S. health insurer by market value, said profit fell 3 percent. Its results suffered as more sick senior citizens in northern California enrolled in its Medicare plan, raising the company’s costs after rivals pulled out of the region.  Even debt-ratings agency Moody’s Corp (MCO.N), which reported a 56 percent rise in second-quarter profit, warned things are going to get tougher, as the European sovereign debt crisis and the risk of the United States losing its top-tier AAA credit rating scare off potential bond issuers.  “We expect more challenging debt issuance conditions in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of 2011 as compared to the first half of the year,” CEO Raymond McDaniel said.

15,EMR,"Emerson warns of slowing U.S., European economies","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) warned on Wednesday that U.S. and European economies have “clearly slowed” in the past two months and said order growth moderated, sending its shares down 6.7 percent to their lowest level since September.  Consumer and discretionary spending remain weak and industrial markets are slowing, Emerson said, citing Europe’s debt crisis and the U.S. budget impasse that is threatening a potential debt default as soon as next week.  Shares of Emerson fell $3.38 to $50.67 in late morning trade. Other industrial shares were lower across the board. Rival Rockwell Automation (ROK.N) fell 3.1 percent ahead of its earnings report due Thursday.  Large European industrials were also down after the news. Shares of Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) were down 3 percent, those of Switzerland’s ABB Ltd (ABB.NS) were down 3 percent and France’s Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA) was off 4 percent.  “We have seen a definite weakening of general business activity in June and July,” Emerson management said in a regulatory filing. “U.S. and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft-patch and it remains unclear if they will improve much in the second half of the calendar year.”  Emerson reported total orders up 10 percent to 15 percent in the three months to June, down from the 15 percent pace in the three months to May. A boost from the weak U.S. dollar contributed about 7 percentage points to the growth.  Emerson’s warning was the most strongly-worded commentary on a second-half slowdown from any U.S. industrial company so far this earnings season.  Emerson’s Chief Executive Dave Farr, widely respected among industrial analysts and investors for his often blunt, no-nonsense opinions, earlier this year warned that inflation was not going away and could stay high for two or three years.  Emerson said on Wednesday its industrial-related businesses are still strong, but added:  “We expect them eventually to soften due to the generally poor economic environment (the negative budget discourse in Washington D.C. and ongoing European debt crisis) and weakening trends,” Emerson said in its monthly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Its orders showed slower growth in its industrial automation and network power segments, though orders remained high in its process management segment that serves energy and other process industries.  A weak U.S. housing market hurt Emerson’s climate technologies market, where orders were flat to down 5 percent.  Several analysts said next year’s profit forecasts for Emerson will come down.  A slowdown in the climate unit was expected, given weak demand from makers of air conditioners, said Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan, but now growth rates in the process and industrial automation businesses are also moderating. He said Emerson’s macro economic comments were the most blunt he had seen in recent weeks.  “Emerson’s management team has their finger on the pulse of the global economy pretty well,” O’Callaghan said. “Their upfront statement is sending a message about a broader slowdown.”  O’Callaghan estimates Emerson’s 2012 earnings at $3.75 per share. Some Wall Street analysts forecast earnings as high as $4 next year.  “This is a report that will put risk into consensus and especially the bullish estimates,” he said. “It sets the stage for an interesting conference call from the CEO, Dave Farr.”  Emerson shares, which typically trade at a premium to its peers, are down about 18 percent from their February 52-week high but had rebounded in recent weeks in anticipation of a strong profit report next Tuesday.  U.S. industrial shares have lagged the wider S&P 500 index this month and year-to-date, according to Standard & Poor’s. In 2010, only the consumer discretionary sector posted bigger gains than manufacturing stocks.  S&P analysts recommend the sector, saying the global economy is gradually improving and industrial stocks are increasingly exposed to robust emerging markets and benefiting from the deep cost cuts made during the 2008-2009 downturn.  Several multinational manufacturers report monthly sales or orders data, including Caterpillar (CAT.N), Illinois Tool Works (ITW.N) and tool maker Kennametal (KMT.N), offering a glimpse into future revenues and the direction of economic cycles.  Emerson’s orders bottomed as the U.S. recession ended in mid-2009. They peaked in late 2010 and have been trending lower so far this year.  St. Louis-based Emerson is scheduled to report quarterly results next Tuesday. Analysts expect it to earn 91 cents a share, up from 78 cents a year ago, and forecast a 13-percent rise in sales to $6.4 billion.  Confirmation of a U.S. industrial slowdown came in Wednesday’s durable goods report, which came in well short of economists’ forecasts.

Consumer and discretionary spending remain weak and industrial markets are slowing, Emerson said, citing Europe’s debt crisis and the U.S. budget impasse that is threatening a potential debt default as soon as next week.

17,EMR,Industrials express cautious H2 optimism,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Several U.S. industrials delivered better-than-expected quarterly profits on Thursday and raised their forecasts for the second half, balancing some of the pessimism that dragged down industrial shares in the prior session.  A brighter mood prevailed as Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Timken Co (TKR.N) and Kennametal Inc (KMT.N), among others, beat Wall Street estimates. Most U.S. manufacturing stocks were up, though off earlier highs, recovering part of Wednesday’s losses that had been sparked by worries about the U.S. debt impasse and by a blunt warning on U.S. and European economies by conglomerate Emerson Electric Co. (EMR.N)  Tyco’s quarterly profit beat forecasts amid sharply higher earnings in its security business. The company, which also makes industrial valves and fire and safety products, reported earnings from continuing operations before special items of 85 cents a share, beating estimates by 12 cents. Tyco raised its full-year forecast by roughly the same amount.  Its shares were up 1 percent at $45.17 in afternoon trading.  “Tyco is just beginning to see a pickup in growth,” said Bryan Keane, co-portfolio manager of the Alpine Accelerating Dividend Fund, which owns Tyco, as well as 3M Co (MMM.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Dover Corp (DOV.N).  “There is concern about the macro outlook, but at this point we believe we’re in a gradual recovery, both U.S. and globally,” Keane said, adding that the earnings season now winding down has been marked by “cautious optimism.”  The impasse over raising the U.S. debt ceiling before next week’s potential default is an “overhang” that will soon be resolved, he said, but it does create uncertainty about the next few months.  “Companies are expecting growth in the back half, but they do have that tinge of caution because of the debt deal in the next couple of weeks, what happens in Europe (and) whether China is slowing down,” Keane said.  Rockwell Automation Inc’s (ROK.N) profit rose 50 percent, topping expectations, and the company raised its 2011 earnings forecast. But Rockwell shares were down 1.8 percent at $75.66 on concern that the forecast reflected a lower tax rate more than improved demand.  Rockwell Chief Executive Keith Nosbusch said market growth rates were moderating, but said that was to be expected. He also acknowledged that much of the company’s industrial equipment is sold shortly after it is ordered, so Rockwell does not have long order backlogs supporting its forecasts.  “In 70 percent of our business we have very little visibility, so this could change in a week, quite frankly,” Nosbusch said in an interview. “We don’t have a backlog that tells us everything is going to be great.”  Rockwell’s CEO sounded more positive than rival Emerson Electric, which warned a day earlier that U.S. and European economies had entered a soft patch.  Emerson shares were down 1.3 percent on Thursday afternoon as analysts cut earnings and sales forecasts. Emerson reports next Tuesday.  A reminder that not all is well came from Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), the huge German conglomerate that competes with U.S. multinationals in a wide range of businesses. Siemens cautioned that global risks are increasing.  Industrial tool maker Kennametal Inc (KMT.N) posted market-beating results, helped by engineering and transportation markets, and issued a forecast of fiscal 2012 earnings with a midpoint topping Wall Street estimates.  Along with Parker Hannifin Corp (PH.N), which reports next week, Kennametal is one of the first companies to offer a glimpse into next year, since its 2012 fiscal year, now under way, extends to next June. Kennametal expects fiscal 2012 earnings of $3.50 to $3.80 a share, versus analysts’ average estimate of $3.54.  Bearings maker Timken Co (TKR.N), which competes with Sweden’s SKF AB (SKFb.ST), Germany’s Schaeffler and Japan’s NSK Ltd (6471.T), reported higher demand from oil and gas and industrial markets.  Brunswick Corp (BC.N) shares were up 7.9 percent at $22.41. The maker of recreational boats and bowling and billiards equipment said boat sales bottomed last year.  Oshkosh Corp (OSK.N), however, forecast lower sales next year, reflecting lower defense and municipal spending on its specialty trucks. Its stock was down 14 percent at $24.77.  The vast majority of large U.S. companies beat estimates this quarter because estimates had come down after the March earthquake in Japan and a rally in oil prices, said Kent Croft, co-manager of the Croft Value Fund.  “Things have definitely slowed down, but I also think that’s not a surprise to anybody,” said Croft, who called himself an optimist and predicted that current obsessions like the debt crisis will soon be in the rear-view mirror.  “There are cheap things all around,” he said.

20,EMR,"Emerson profit meets forecasts, outlook steady","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) met Wall Street forecasts with a 17 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, but said its industrial businesses were slowing and its shares fell 4 percent.  The maker of factory automation systems, power systems for data centers and wireless networks used in oil and gas production, kept its full-year profit forecast steady, defying expectations for a cut. But it said this year’s sales would come in at the lower end of expectations, citing order trends and ongoing debt problems in the United States and Europe.  Emerson Chief Executive David Farr told analysts U.S. and European governments were “dysfunctional” because they are unable to tackle excess debt and spending, and he was sharply critical of new U.S. regulations on issues like fuel efficiency standards, which he said was inhibiting investment and jobs growth.  “Washington is arranging the chairs on the Titanic, the way I look at it,” Farr said on a conference call. “I do not see the catalyst that would say the economy will be fundamentally different in the second half than we saw in the first half.”  An uncertain economic and policy environment makes it impossible to forecast 2012 demand, Farr said.  Concerns about slowing growth and its implications for 2012 earnings overshadowed a profit report that met analysts’ expectations.  Emerson earned a net $683 million, or 90 cents per share, in the third quarter that ended June 30, up from $585 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier.  Sales rose 16 percent to $6.29 billion, missing the forecast of $6.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “Considering the flood of disappointing economic news during the period, results were respectable,” said capital goods analyst Matt Collins of Edward Jones.  “It’s also encouraging that guidance didn’t come down for the full year,” he said. “After last week’s order update I think a cut was widely expected.”  Last week, St. Louis-based Emerson said order growth was slowing and warned that U.S. and European economies have entered a soft patch. U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in two years in July as new orders contracted, casting doubt on expectations the faltering recovery would quickly regain steam.  Emerson shares closed down $2 or 4.1 percent at $47.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Most other industrial shares were also down. Another large global manufacturer, Parker Hannifin Corp (PH.N) disappointed Wall Street with its quarterly earnings and its initial view of fiscal 2012, fueling worries of a broader slowdown in global manufacturing.  Sales rose in each of Emerson’s five divisions. The industrial automation business posted the biggest rise in sales and operating profit. Profit was down in the network power business, partly because of acquisition costs.  Analysts have said that although 2012 profit expectations are likely to come down, the company is still expected to benefit long-term from the building up of infrastructure in countries like Brazil, India and China.  Emerson, which generates about a third of its sales from emerging markets, said debt problems in the United States and Europe were hurting business investment. Emerging market sales rose 15 percent in the quarter, compared with just 6 percent U.S. sales growth.  An industrial-led economic recovery will continue but at a slower pace, the company forecast. It kept its 2011 forecast steady, calling for earnings of $3.20 to $3.30 per share, but said sales growth would be at the lower end of its expected range, citing the order slowdown.  Emerson’s peers include Europe’s ABB ABBN.VX, Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA).

22,EMR,UPDATE 1-Emerson CEO: No catalyst for economic growth," NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) Chief Executive David Farr sees no catalyst for economic growth in the United States and Europe, whose governments he describes as “dysfunctional,” the U.S. conglomerate’s chief executive officer told analysts.   “I do not see the catalyst that would say the economy will be fundamentally different in the second half than it was in the first half,” Farr told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call on Tuesday. “We’re looking at slower growth.”   Farr said he was telling his managers to cut spending because the company is operating in “extremely uncertain and difficult times,” but he was not demanding “draconian” cuts because the company is still growing.   “They’re not, either in the U.S. or Europe, really addressing the gut issues,” he said. “The U.S. have enormous regulations coming at us right now. The incentive to invest in the U.S. right now is negative.”   The maker of factory automation systems and uninterruptible power systems used in data centers earlier reported an in-line quarterly profit and kept its full-year profit forecast unchanged. But the company’s shares fell on concerns about profits in 2012. [ID:nN1E77102X]   Emerson employs some 140,000 people worldwide, including about 35,000 in the United States.   Farr said he had no clear picture of economic growth or demand next year. He cited an environment of waning corporate confidence amid new regulations and “dysfunctional” U.S. and European political leadership unable to tackle excess debt and spending.   Washington appears unwilling to tackle corporate tax reform, which would boost investment and create jobs, and is introducing new restrictions such as higher fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, he said.   “Washington is arranging the chairs on the Titanic the way I look at it,” Farr told analysts.

23,EMR,Analysis: Shaky economy has companies wary of spending,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Weakening demand in the United States and Europe has spooked some in corporate America, prompting big companies to throttle back their spending just as U.S. government looks for ways to cut its own outlays.  That new wave of fears is threatening to choke off a fledgling resurgence in capital investment by big companies — one of the few areas where economic activity was growing.  Chief executives and investors have been bombarded by a wave of bad economic news over the past few days, including a report that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a weaker than expected rate in the first half of the year and word on Wednesday that the rate of layoffs had picked up in July.  “We’re looking at slower growth,” said David Farr, CEO of U.S. manufacturer Emerson Electric Co, which recently warned that its order rates slowed in the past two months. “I can’t tell you right now what the second half will be, I can’t tell you what 2012’s going to be, so don’t bother to ask.”  Still, that uncertainty is not stopping the blunt-talking executive from acting. He is already looking for ways to limit the St. Louis-based company’s spending — rather than planning to boost its budget by 5 percent next year, Farr now aims to increase outlays by just 3 to 4 percent.  He is not the only one sounding a cautious tone.  Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Chrysler and Fiat SpA, said the uncertain recovery in consumer demand for cars, also cited by General Motors Co, is making automakers wary.  “People are still very reluctant to make long-term commitments to R&D and capital because of the uncertainty,” he told reporters at an industry conference on Wednesday.  Corporate spending is no better: Earlier this week SPX Corp, a maker of industrial components, surprised investors with a far weaker than expected third-quarter profit forecast, saying it was counting on a robust fourth quarter to hit its full-year target. That followed word last week from Juniper Networks Inc that the private sector and U.S. government are delaying purchases of network equipment.  The nervousness could dampen what had been a recent resurgence in corporate investment. Companies boosted their capital spending by about 21 percent in the first quarter and kept up a similar pace in the second quarter, putting them on a track for their biggest-spending year since 2006, according to a Reuters study of 3,153 U.S. companies.  That growth, however, lags the increase in money spent on stock buybacks and takeovers, which both rose more than 60 percent in the first half of 2011.  Engineering company Foster Wheeler AG also said its U.S. clients are holding off on committing to big construction projects, over worries about the economy.  “The delays are due to client concerns about the macro environment, specifically the political and economic uncertainties,” said interim CEO Umberto della Sala.  The $2.1 trillion deficit-reduction plan reached in Washington this week spared the United States from defaulting on its $14.3 trillion debt, but raised questions on what spending would be cut, which in turn weighed on shares of companies that do everything from running nursing homes to building fighter planes.  “Where is the growth going to come from?” said Michael Goodman, director of economic and public policy research at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. “It’s not going to come from the private side and it doesn’t appear like it’s going to come from the public side. That does appear like a recipe for sluggish growth at best.”  Sluggish growth is just what the United States has seen this year, with GDP up 0.4 percent in the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second.  Even companies that are spending are not necessarily making their investments in the United States.  “Our capex is increasingly shifting toward international markets and fast-growing developing economies in particular,” said David Meline, chief financial officer at 3M Co.  The company expects its total capital spending to rise this year by about 27 percent, to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, and plans to continue to raise that budget next year, in line with revenue growth.  Corporate caution will only represent a further weight on the economy, which has seen consumer spending depressed by a stubbornly high unemployment rate that has held near or above 9 percent for most of the past two years.  Companies have become increasingly unwilling to part with their cash over the past year, building up $1.9 trillion in cash and short-term instruments at the end of the first quarter, according to Federal Reserve data.  “You’ll see firms hanging on to their cash even more than they already are,” said Lee Pinkowitz, associate professor of finance in Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Companies may start rushing to issue debt, to lock in, not because they have projects but because they’re going to hold that cash.”  The new caution raises worry in some economists’ minds that the United States could slip back into recession.  “I’m not sure we’re going to head back down into recession, but I would say the probability is higher now than it was a few months back,” said Robert Murphy, a professor of economics at Boston College, who served as a White House adviser on the economy during the Clinton administration.  If the nation does slip back into recession, it could be some time before investors know, Murphy said. The United States was a full year into the last recession, which ran from December 2007 through June 2009, before the National Bureau of Economic Research officially declared its beginning.  “The good news for the president is we probably won’t know until after the election, the way these things often get called,” Murphy said.

24,EMR,UPDATE 1-Emerson industrial automation orders slow," NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported slightly slower order growth in its industrial automation business on Wednesday that it said reflected increasingly tough comparisons to year-ago orders.   Trailing three-month orders in industrial automation were up 10 percent to 15 percent through July, below the 20 percent pace in the three months to June.   Demand in some areas, such as power transmission, was slowing, but the slower growth mainly reflects strong year-ago numbers, when Emerson reported a 40 percent increase in the segment, the company said in a regulatory filing.   Total Emerson order growth was up 10 percent to 15 percent in the three months to July, matching the prior month’s pace. A weak U.S. dollar accounted for 6 percentage points of the increase.   Order growth picked up in Emerson’s network power segment and remained above 20 percent in the process management business that serves the energy sector. Orders were flat to negative in climate technologies.   “We should have solid revenue growth during the next several quarters, despite the U.S. and European economies exhibiting considerable weakness with no near-term catalysts to generate better growth,” Emerson management said in its monthly commentary.

25,EMR,UPDATE 1-Emerson industrial automation order growth slows," Sept 20 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported its second consecutive sequential deceleration in industrial orders on Tuesday, saying comparisons with year-earlier growth were getting more difficult.   Emerson’s industrial automation orders were up 5 percent to 10 percent in the three months through August, down from their pace in the three months through July, which itself marked a deceleration from the prior period.   Total company orders were up 10 percent to 15 percent, the same pace as in the previous two months, helped by currency exchange rates, the company said in a monthly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   “Strong backlog should ensure solid revenue growth over the next several quarters,” Emerson management said.   The pace of order growth improved in the company’s tools and storage segment. Orders were flat to down 5 percent in the climate technologies business and rose more than 20 percent in process management. The network power business, which makes uninterruptible power systems for data centers and other uses, showed a 5 percent to 10 percent increase in orders, according to the filing.   Emerson is among a handful of U.S. industrial companies that report monthly data to give investors a glimpse of business trends beyond quarterly earnings statements. Others include Caterpillar (CAT.N), Kennametal Inc (KMT.N), and Illinois Tool Works (ITW.N).

Total operating revenue rose 16 percent for its latest three-month period, compared with a 17 percent growth for the three months ended July 31. The increase is within the range of sales growth ITW had forecast for the third quarter, whose results it will report next month.   Its sales growth slowed in areas including industrial packaging, power systems and electronics, and in ITW’s decorative surfaces segment.   But sales accelerated in ITW’s construction products segment, a key market for many U.S. industrial names. On Wednesday, an architects’ trade group reported a sharp increase in a billings index that is considered a leading indicator  of construction activity.

27,EMR,Emerson unit head says IT executives wary of spending,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Economic troubles in the United States and Europe are making customers of Emerson Electric Co’s data center management business reluctant to make big purchases as the company prepares to launch a major new platform.  Steve Hassell, head of Avocent, part of Emerson’s network power segment, said on Monday that IT executives were reconsidering their short-term spending plans due to economic uncertainty and a deepening financial crisis in Europe.  “You have people that have needs that are just saying, ‘I want to wait and see,’” Hassell said. “There’s uncertainty out there due to a whole lot of different economic pieces and it’s making everything murky.”  Speaking to Reuters at Oracle’s annual OpenWorld conference in San Francisco, Hassell said about 10 major “early adopter” customers were using Emerson’s new Trellis platform, which manages demand and resources in data centers to improve their efficiency.  When Trellis is launched early next year, he said, customers can easily adopt portions of it gradually rather than the entire system all at once, making the transition less expensive.  “We’re going to be a substantial player in the DCIM (data center infrastructure management) market place,” Hassell said when asked about revenue targets for Trellis.  The outlook for worldwide technology spending has darkened in recent months, with warnings by major technology vendors from Dell Inc to Cisco Systems Inc. Governments are scaling back purchases to reduce deficits while corporations are tightening budgets to cope with an uncertain economic picture.  St. Louis-based Emerson in the last decade has transformed itself from an old-line maker of motors to a high-tech supplier of power and cooling systems for corporate computer centers.  Trellis is Emerson’s big bet in the small but growing data center infrastructure management market. The platform lets companies cut their energy bills and infrastructure spending, and better allocate staff at the giant server farms that manage everything from bank transactions to corporate payrolls.  The 2009 acquisition of Avocent, a maker of access and control systems, for $1.2 billion provided the technology Emerson needed to develop Trellis.

29,EMR,"UPDATE 1-Emerson order growth slows, hit by currency","Oct 24 (Reuters) - A stronger dollar helped slow order growth at Emerson Electric Co in the three months through September, the industrial conglomerate said in a monthly regulatory filing on Monday. Total order growth slowed to a range of flat to up 5 percent in the trailing three months, from a pace of up 10 percent to 15 percent in the prior two periods. The most pronounced slowdown was in Emerson’s process management segment, where orders were flat to 5 percent higher, compared with better than 20 percent growth in the three months to July and August, Emerson said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Year-over-year comparisons were also more muted because of a large order in the same period of 2010. At the start of September, one euro bought about $1.46, but the euro weakened to $1.32 at the end of the month. The dollar also strengthened against several other currencies, including the Brazilian real .

Its initial estimate of 2012 profits was in line with Wall Street forecasts, to the relief of some analysts, who had braced for a weak guidance. Emerson, whose shares closed 0.4 percent higher, also raised its dividend by 16 percent. “The dividend is a huge piece of good news,” said Catherine Avery, President and CEO of CAIM LLC, which owns Emerson shares. “These are the kind of companies you’re going to want to own in a sluggish economic growth environment, where you may not be getting a lot of appreciation in the stock price.” With a dividend of $1.60 a year, Emerson will yield 3.3 percent, above the S&P; 500’s average yield of about 2 percent. Avery likes stocks, such as Emerson, with high exposure to faster-growing emerging markets and compared Emerson to Coca-Cola Co and Intel Corp in that regard. Emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East drove the quarter’s results, she said. Net profit rose almost 2 percent to $761 million, or $1.01 per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $749 million, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations was 98 cents, 2 cents ahead of estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 12 percent to $6.55 billion, slightly below Wall Street forecasts. Revenue grew faster in Asia, Latin America and Europe than in the United States. Emerson’s results continued the industrial theme of still positive, but slowing growth, said analyst Matt Collins of Edward Jones. “Industrial facing businesses are generally doing well, but just about anything related to the consumer is struggling,” Collins said. “You might hear a collective sigh of relief on the guidance for 2012.” Emerson shares closed 19 cents higher at $48.31. Emerson’s process management segment posted a 38 percent increase in profit on an 18 percent jump in sales, as oil and gas companies continued to invest in Emerson systems that improve the efficiency of operations. Profit rose in the industrial automation segment, but earnings were down in the company’s network power and climate technologies businesses, hurt by higher costs of labor in China and raw materials. St. Louis-based Emerson, which makes industrial automation systems, uninterruptible power supplies for data centers and wireless networks for the energy industry, said on Tuesday it did not expect another U.S. recession but slow, uneven growth is likely. Management said it is more pessimistic about Europe, which has entered either recession or a period of minimal growth. “In Europe, the economy is very, very, very, very challenging,” Chief Executive David Farr said on a conference call. “We’re seeing basically a recession or basically no growth.” Despite no economic growth, Emerson’s backlog means it will grow core European sales by at least 5 percent, the company said. Still, slowing industrial production in China and weak European economies could weigh down Emerson shares, said analysts at Barclays Capital, who noted Emerson “tilts” more heavily to those economies than some of its peers. Emerson, whose peers include Switzerland’s ABB Ltd , France’s Schneider Electric SA and U.S.-based Eaton Corp , forecast 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth in the fiscal year now under way. Analysts’ estimate of 2012 earnings, at an average $3.62 a share, would mark a 10 percent increase in earnings per share.

Capital goods markets have softened from a year ago, the company said in a monthly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Orders in the industrial automation segment were flat to up 5 percent in the trailing three months, down from their more than 5 percent pace in the three months to September, in part reflecting slowing economies in Europe. About 38 percent of industrial automation’s sales are to Europe, the heaviest exposure among Emerson’s five businesses, according to a separate regulatory filing. Europe also weighed on Emerson’s climate technologies business, where orders were flat to down 5 percent, matching the pace in the prior two periods. Overall, total company orders grew 5 percent, slightly faster than the pace through September. A stronger U.S. dollar reduced order rates by 3 percentage points. The strongest order growth was in the process management division, reflecting continued demand for Emerson’s technology from the oil and gas industries. In that segment, too, order growth would have been higher once currency effects are stripped out.

33,EMR,"Emerson profit misses estimates, shares fall","(Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings as floods in Thailand disrupted supplies and weak European economies hurt demand. The industrial conglomerate also cut its full-year sales forecast but said it expects most of the pressures on its operations to be temporary. Its profit forecast was in line with analyst estimates but shares fell 2.8 percent in late trading. Chief Executive David Farr said Europe was in recession but the maker of industrial automation systems and oil and gas equipment expects to increase sales there this year, in part because its European operations sell into healthier Eastern European and Middle Eastern markets. “I feel better about Europe today than I did a couple months ago because of the actions being taken by their government and the actions being taken by the banks and financial community,” Farr said on Emerson’s conference call. “So even though we see a recession, we are still going to say that we have underlying growth in Europe in 2012.” Farr said China’s industrial economy was slowing down and said he does not expect a recovery in China’s housing and commercial construction markets this year. Net earnings fell 23 percent to $371 million, or 50 cents per share, in the first quarter ended December 31 from $480 million or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. The profit missed analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 4 percent to $5.31 billion, slightly above Wall Street estimates of $5.29 billion. Floods in Thailand disrupted supplies of electronic components, hurting revenue and profit in the process management segment that serves the energy industry. Margins in the process business were much lower than expected, Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan said. The floods also hurt Emerson’s network power segment, which makes uninterruptible power supplies. This business was also affected by U.S. telecommunications customers deferring investments. Thailand’s worst floods in half a century forced a series of industrial estates to close in October, disrupting production of electronics, one of Thailand’s key exports. Companies citing the floods this earnings season include carmakers Ford (F.N) and Honda (7267.T), electronic connector maker TE Connectivity (TEL.N), hard drive maker Western Digital Corp WDC.N, as well as insurers XL Group Plc (XL.N) and Everest Re Group Ltd (RE.N). The insurance industry estimates its losses from the flooding to be at least $15 billion, and there are fears the number could rise as high as $20 billion. “The Thailand floods, slower growth in Asia and a host of other issues derailed the quarter, but there are signs of life in the underlying numbers,” said Edward Jones industrial analyst Matt Collins. He added that the network power and climate tech businesses lagged expectations but U.S. construction activity was reviving and Emerson’s European businesses were more resilient than expected. Emerson shares have lagged the S&P; 500 index over the past year, but the stock remains one of the most richly valued among large, multinational industrial companies. Emerson stock was down 2.8 percent to $51.89. Counting Tuesday’s decline, Emerson is still up about 11 percent this year, beating a broader index of manufacturing stocks .GSPIC. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Interactive graphic: r.reuters.com/van26s. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Weak demand from both Chinese and U.S. housing markets pushed down sales of Emerson’s air conditioning components. The company said it did not expect much recovery in Chinese construction markets this year. CEO Farr said January orders were down 22 percent in the climate technology business. Two other businesses, industrial automation and tools and storage, generated higher sales. Earnings increased in the tools business, reflecting strength in nonresidential construction markets. Farr said he felt “positive” about the U.S. commercial construction outlook. Emerson said telecommunications as well as heating and cooling markets would improve and that industrial businesses were “strong,” but it trimmed its fiscal 2012 sales forecast. It expects core sales to rise by 4 percent to 6 percent, down from a December forecast of 5 percent to 7 percent. The company expects 2012 earnings of $3.45 to $3.60 per share, which brackets analysts’ average estimate of $3.51. Estimates have come down since Emerson warned in December about the effects of the Thai floods and said Europe’s economies had entered a recession.

Chief Executive David Farr said Europe was in recession but the maker of industrial automation systems and oil and gas equipment expects to increase sales there this year, in part because its European operations sell into healthier Eastern European and Middle Eastern markets. “I feel better about Europe today than I did a couple months ago because of the actions being taken by their government and the actions being taken by the banks and financial community,” Farr said on Emerson’s conference call. “So even though we see a recession, we are still going to say that we have underlying growth in Europe in 2012.” Farr said China’s industrial economy was slowing down and said he does not expect a recovery in China’s housing and commercial construction markets this year. Net earnings fell 23 percent to $371 million, or 50 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 31 from $480 million or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. The profit missed analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 4 percent to $5.31 billion, slightly above Wall Street estimates of $5.29 billion. Floods in Thailand disrupted supplies of electronic components, hurting revenue and profit in the process management segment that serves the energy industry. Margins in the process business were much lower than expected, Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan said. The floods also hurt Emerson’s network power segment, which makes uninterruptible power supplies. This business was also affected by U.S. telecommunications customers deferring investments. Thailand’s worst floods in half a century forced a series of industrial estates to close in October, disrupting production of electronics, one of Thailand’s key exports. Companies citing the floods this earnings season include carmakers Ford and Honda, electronic connector maker TE Connectivity, hard drive maker Western Digital Corp, as well as insurers XL Group Plc and Everest Re Group Ltd. The insurance industry estimates its losses from the flooding to be at least $15 billion, and there are fears the number could rise as high as $20 billion. “The Thailand floods, slower growth in Asia and a host of other issues derailed the quarter, but there are signs of life in the underlying numbers,” said Edward Jones industrial analyst Matt Collins. He added that the network power and climate tech businesses lagged expectations but U.S. construction activity was reviving and Emerson’s European businesses were more resilient than expected. Emerson shares have lagged the S&P; 500 index over the past year, but the stock remains one of the most richly valued among large, multinational industrial companies. Emerson stock was down 2.8 percent to $51.89. Counting Tuesday’s decline, Emerson is still up about 11 percent this year, beating a broader index of manufacturing stocks. Weak demand from both Chinese and U.S. housing markets pushed down sales of Emerson’s air conditioning components. The company said it did not expect much recovery in Chinese construction markets this year. CEO Farr said January orders were down 22 percent in the climate technology business. Two other businesses, industrial automation and tools and storage, generated higher sales. Earnings increased in the tools business, reflecting strength in nonresidential construction markets. Farr said he felt “positive” about the U.S. commercial construction outlook. Emerson said telecommunications as well as heating and cooling markets would improve and that industrial businesses were “strong,” but it trimmed its fiscal 2012 sales forecast. It expects core sales to rise by 4 percent to 6 percent, down from a December forecast of 5 percent to 7 percent. The company expects 2012 earnings of $3.45 to $3.60 per share, which brackets analysts’ average estimate of $3.51. Estimates have come down since Emerson warned in December about the effects of the Thai floods and said Europe’s economies had entered a recession.",2072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/emerson/update-5-emerson-profit-misses-estimates-shares-fall-idUSL2E8D6AJI20120207
35,EMR,Emerson to step up acquisitions and divestitures,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) expects to step up both acquisitions and divestitures in the next four years and will increase investments in technology and emerging markets amid recession in Europe and slower growth in the United States and China. The maker of factory automation systems and technology used in oil and gas production trimmed its long-term sales forecast to a range of $31 billion to $35 billion annually. A year ago, the bottom end of the range was $32 billion. The St. Louis-based company said it expects 2012 sales to reach $25 billion, helped by growth in its home market, including a bounceback in housing and commercial construction. It said its backlog and other metrics suggest revenue growth will be stronger in the second half than in the first half. “China is still weak but will come back ... Europe is in a recession,” Chief Executive David Farr said. “The key market for us will be the U.S.” Farr said he expects emerging markets to account for the bulk of Emerson’s growth between now and 2015, and the company will step up investments there and in technology. Emerson expects to spend $5 billion to $6 billion on acquisitions between now and 2015, he said, especially in industrial automation and process management segments. Emerson will divest $2 billion to $3 billion of assets in that period, including its Knaack storage equipment unit, Farr said. Such moves were a response to “more challenging” markets, he said, with uneven economic growth, mergers among its customers and an uncertain outlook for debt-laden developed markets. “We’re going to drive our growth,” Farr said. “We can’t sit back on our ass and wait for it to come to us.” Farr, who has led the industrial conglomerate since 2000, is known for blunt commentary on the markets where Emerson does business. Last year, he was among the first to identify a likely European recession. Emerson investors and analysts consider the company one of the best-run U.S. manufacturers. Emerson shares were down 2.9 percent at $51.28 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

The provider of industrial automation systems and uninterruptible power supplies said Europe, China and Brazil were all under pressure. “The big issue that we face here, I think, in the next six to 12 months is the global economy continues to slide,” Chief Executive David Farr said. “The U.S. economy ... is the global engine of growth right now.” The CEO also said the company’s process management segment, which makes systems used by the energy industry, lost about $300 million in sales in the first two quarters because of quality control issues. Farr apologized to investors for two disappointing Emerson quarters. Emerson gets more of its sales from China, around 10 percent, than other manufacturers, said industrials analyst Matt Collins of Edward Jones. “They’ve got more China exposure than just about anybody,” Collins said, adding that China’s economy is likely to bottom out soon and start picking up in the coming quarters. Emerson shares had run up ahead of the earnings report as investors cheered signs of a pick-up in order rates, which the company publishes monthly. Tuesday’s results threw cold water on that optimism, Collins said. Emerson’s net income slid to $545 million, or 74 cents per share, in the second quarter that ended March 31, from $556 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Fewer shares outstanding lifted earnings per share. The results were 6 cents below average analyst estimates of 80 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1 percent to $5.92 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $6 billion. Three of five divisions showed lower revenue, but Emerson’s process management segment, which serves the energy industry, had stronger sales. Stronger construction markets lifted a segment that makes tools and storage equipment. St. Louis-based Emerson, which also makes wireless networks used in oil and gas production and heating and cooling technology, said weakness persisted in Europe and China’s economy was likely to remain softer than expected. Telecommunications, technology and other markets were recovering, but not as quickly as it had forecast.

Industrial conglomerate Emerson’s interest lies in Invensys’s Foxboro unit, which makes meters and control systems, the report said citing an anonymous source, although the American group would consider a deal for the entire company. Shares in Invensys closed up 27 percent at 257 pence on Wednesday valuing the firm at just over 2 billion pounds ($3.15 billion). Invensys, which makes control systems for nuclear power stations, industry, railways and domestic appliances, has spoken to Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and General Electric (GE.N) about a sale of some or all of its business since Emerson’s approach, the report said.

48,EMR,Invensys seen in play despite bid talks ending,"LONDON (Reuters) - A slump in shares of British engineering group Invensys Plc as bid hopes faded did little to dampen the belief of some company watchers that the group was “in play” for the possible disposal of some or all of its businesses. Responding to a report that said Invensys had received an approach from Emerson Electric Co, the UK group confirmed on Thursday it had received a “highly preliminary” approach from the U.S. company but said discussions had ended. “Furthermore there are no other discussions taking place in relation to an offer for the group,” it said. It also said it had also been in “highly preliminary” talks with third parties about separate parts of the group, but these talks had also ended. Analysts at brokerage Singer Capital Markets said they saw strategic buyers for each division of Invensys, adding the company’s hefty pension liabilities should not prove an insurmountable barrier for any buyer. “A break-up is likely to generate the highest value for each division, though the group’s large pension may prove to be more of a stumbling block than if the group were to be acquired in its entirety by a large conglomerate,” Singer analysts said. Shares in Invensys, which closed up 27 percent on Wednesday after a report said it was considering the sale or all or parts of its business to Emerson, were down 16.3 percent at 215.1 pence by 1039 GMT (6.39 a.m. EDT). Morgan Stanley noted that under British takeover rules Emerson was prevented from making another approach for six months unless a third party made a bid. “This does not prevent any third party from opening talks in the meantime,” the bank said. “This may stop the shares giving up all their gains from yesterday.” The group had a market value of 2.09 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) on Wednesday after the stock spiked to a 10-month high. Invensys makes rail signaling, industrial systems for nuclear power stations and oil and gas plants, and controls for domestic appliances. It is smaller than most of its competitors, making it one of a few tradable assets in the global engineering sector. However, its pension liabilities remain a potential hurdle to a deal. Its pension fund had a net deficit of 426 million pounds at the end of March, although its total liabilities were far higher than that, analysts said. Invensys did not name any other parties which could be interested in some or all of its assets, but a report last month said Siemens, ABB and General Electric had also made informal contact. A source close to Invensys said the talks with Emerson had ended some months ago, while some of the interest from third parties was more recent. Analysts at UBS said long-suffering Invensys shareholders would probably want an offer of near 300p per share, allowing an exit at a hefty valuation of 10 times enterprise value over operating profit.

Former chief executive Ulf Henriksson speculated in November 2010 that its partner China Southern Rail could also do a deal if the price was right, although the company later issued a statement downplaying the comments.

54,EMR,Emerson orders fall as customers pull back spending,"July 25 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co said orders in the trailing three month period to June fell 3 percent, hurt by a stronger U.S. dollar and a slowing global economy. Many customers have started to pull back on investment owing to a tenuous global business environment, the company said in a statement. Rival Rockwell Automation Inc on Wednesday cut its full-year forecasts below Wall Street estimates citing slower growth in Latin America and emerging markets in Asia, as well as a strong dollar. Emerson said its process management segment reported a 5 to 10 percent growth in its trailing three-month orders, spurred by demand from oil and gas producers. Industrial Automation orders fell because of the segment’s high European exposure compared with other Emerson businesses, the company said. Total company orders in the three months to June were flat to down 5 percent from a year earlier, in line with the company’s performance in the three months to May period.

55,EMR,Emerson profit lifted by process management,"(Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, lifted by improved results in the process management business, but the industrial conglomerate trimmed its full-year earnings forecast because of slowing economies around the world. Shares of Emerson rose, however, since the forecast was above analyst estimates. The stronger dollar will be a bigger headwind in the current quarter than in the third, Chief Executive David Farr said on a conference call. Europe is likely to see falling investment next year and China’s economy will likely continue to struggle. Worries about the U.S. fiscal position — a so-called fiscal cliff could force budget cuts in the new year — are curtailing investment by corporations, Farr said. “The uncertainty of what’s going to go on relative to the U.S. fiscal policy is a big issue, it’s a huge issue. People are only going to spend what they need to spend and people are cutting back.” Emerson, a provider of wireless networks used in oil and gas production and uninterruptible power supplies, said net earnings rose 13 percent to $770 million, or $1.04 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended June 30, from $683 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. Results topped average analyst estimates by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 3 percent to $6.48 billion, which was below Wall Street estimates of $6.61 billion. Emerson’s process management segment posted a 19 percent increase in revenue, lifted by demand for energy infrastructure. Earnings jumped by one-third in that business, which makes control systems and software to run plants in process industries such as energy, food and beverage and water treatment. The profit gains reflected higher sales and recent cost cuts, and Emerson said the unit’s outlook was favorable for the next several quarters. The St. Louis-based company, which also makes industrial automation systems and heating and cooling technology, said global economies were slowing and business investment was expected to remain “tepid.” It cut its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $3.35 to $3.40 a share, compared with a May forecast of $3.35 to $3.50. Analyst estimates, which have come down in recent weeks, average $3.34 a share. “Clearly the global economy has downshifted, but the companies that prepared for it are weathering the storm pretty well,” said analyst Matt Collins of Edward Jones, which has a “buy” rating on Emerson shares. Shares were up 2.5 percent at $50.16 on Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. They are back at the same level as in early May, before Emerson’s previous earnings report disappointed investors.

61,EMR,Emerson orders decline on weakness in telecom sector,"Sept 25 (Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co warned on Tuesday that weak demand from the telecommunications sector hurt its network power equipment, driving the diversified U.S. manufacturer’s overall orders down 5 percent in the three months ended in August. The maker of wireless networks used in oil and gas production and uninterruptible power supplies warned that overall sales growth in its fourth fiscal quarter - which ends this month - would be weaker than in the third quarter. “Choppy demand patterns underscored the volatile and uncertain economic climate that continues to trend slightly downward,” the St. Louis-based company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It noted that it saw the sharpest declines in Asia, in the face of slowing economies in Australia, China and India. Emerson became the second major U.S. manufacturer to warn of decelerating demand in two days. Caterpillar Inc late on Monday lowered its 2015 profit goals, saying it expected “fairly anemic” economic growth. Bernstein Research analyst Steven Winoker noted that the decline in orders - a measure that excludes the effect of exchange-rate fluctuations - was the first such decline since January 2010. “We continue to see Emerson driving operating leverage going forward but in a decelerating demand environment,” Winoker said. Emerson shares fell 2.4 percent to $48.82 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

62,EMR,"Emerson beats on profit, plans asset sale","(Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported a sharply lower quarterly net profit on Tuesday, reflecting a goodwill charge in its network power business, and said it expects earnings to grow by at least a single-digit percentage rate in fiscal 2013. Slower telecommunications and information technology markets led to the $592 million charge. Emerson said it will pursue a sale of its $1.4 billion embedded computing and power business. The company is planning for a “challenging” business environment that includes stagnant economies in Europe and likely lower U.S. investment as a result of the “fiscal cliff” of automatic government spending cuts, Chief Executive David Farr said on a conference call with investors. “Even if they do resolve the fiscal cliff, and I have no idea how they’re going to do that, I personally believe the spending in the U.S. will be negatively impacted, both at the government level and at the consumer level,” Farr said. Farr, among the most outspoken U.S. manufacturing executives, said Tuesday’s election will result in either “great excitement” or a “great ugh,” depending on one’s political party. He added that solving the fiscal cliff is the top priority of chief executives after the vote. “We need the leaders of this country to get together and sort out how we’re going to fix the long-term fiscal structure of our government. We can’t afford what we’re doing right now.” Farr also said Japan was weakening and the outlook for China is uncertain as new leadership takes power there. While Emerson looks to dispose of a business, its acquisitions are limited to small bolt-on deals, with around $500 million budgeted, he added. Emerson shares closed up 1.9 percent at $51.46. Net earnings fell 63 percent to $282 million, or 39 cents per share, in Emerson’s fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, from $761 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the goodwill charge, adjusted profit of $1.11 a share was 6 cents ahead of the average Wall Street target, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2 percent to $6.70 billion, meeting estimates. St. Louis-based Emerson, which raised its dividend slightly, posted an 18 percent sales increase in its process management business, reflecting investment by the energy industry. Other divisions showed lower or flat sales. Sales and profit expectations have come down in recent weeks as Emerson’s orders have reflected weak telecommunications demand and softening economies in Asia. Emerson, the maker of factory automation systems, uninterruptible power supplies for data networks, and wireless technology for the energy sector, said orders have slowed because economies remain uncertain in the United States, Europe and China. It forecast that fiscal 2013 sales would be flat to up 5 percent and earnings per share should grow by the mid- to high-single digits, with up to 80 percent of the increase coming in the first half of the fiscal year. “If China’s economy can get off its back and recent momentum in the U.S. continues, Emerson should deliver another respectable year,” Edward Jones analyst Matt Collins said. In contrast with other diversified U.S. industrial companies, Emerson’s full-year forecast calls for a stronger first half of the year. That’s partly because the next two quarters’ results will benefit from easier comparisons to a year earlier, when Emerson was affected by flooding in Thailand.

68,EMR,UPDATE 3-Emerson Electric sees signs of increased industrial demand,"* First quarter profit of $0.62 per share meets Street view * Revenue growth faster than analysts had forecast * CEO says market conditions have stabilized By Scott Malone Feb 5 (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Emerson Electric Co met Wall Street profit forecasts for the first quarter and said it sees signs that demand for its industrial products may be picking up. The maker of products including industrial controls, uninterruptible power supplies and home-storage equipment said on Tuesday that sales rose 4.6 percent, more than twice what analysts had expected. Sales growth in Asia, where Emerson was still shipping goods delayed by floods in Thailand in 2011, and in the United States, offset a 2 percent decline in Europe. But St. Louis, Missouri-based Emerson’s profit margins were weaker than expected in the first fiscal quarter ended on Dec. 31. The company’s shares declined 1.4 percent to $56.70 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “Recent order trends suggest market conditions have stabilized and may be poised for improvement, particularly in the emerging markets,” chief executive officer David Farr said in a statement. The company said it expected to earn $3.53 to $3.63 a share for the year, in line with analysts’ average forecast of $3.59 per share, with sales up 2 percent to 5 percent. It had previously forecast sales to be flat to up 5 percent. “It’s encouraging that maybe this global environment is starting to loosen up a little bit, but we’re still approaching from a very circumspect outlook,” said Mike McGarr, portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management, which had trimmed its position in Emerson as it traded well above $50 in recent weeks. Emerson said net income attributable to common shareholders came to $454 million or 62 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on Dec. 31, compared with $371 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. The profit met the analysts’ average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4.6 percent to $5.55 billion from $5.31 billion a year earlier. Wall Street had looked for $5.43 billion. Profit margins were somewhat lower than analysts had expected, with the company’s industrial automation, network power and climate technologies units falling short, said Bernstein Research analyst Steven Winoker. Referring to the climate unit, which makes compressors used in air conditioners, Winoker said, “There was growth and improvement in Asia and U.S. residential air conditioning end markets, but the low-margin nature of those markets were reflected in the slight margin decrease.” Meanwhile, fellow U.S. manufacturer Eaton Corp  posted weaker-than-expected results, hurt by soft demand of its electrical and hydraulic systems used in trucks, cars and aircraft.

71,EMR,UPDATE 3-Emerson to sell embedded computing unit as charge hits profit,"By Lewis Krauskopf Aug 6 (Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co reported a 75 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Tuesday, hurt by an impairment charge for its embedded computing and power business, and said it was selling a majority stake in the unit for about $300 million. Profit and sales missed Wall Street targets. The diversified U.S. manufacturer of industrial controls, power supplies and home-storage equipment said earnings were trending toward the low end of its forecast, which it had cut in May. Emerson shares fell 1 percent in morning trading. Parker Hannifin Corp dropped more than 4 percent after the smaller industrial manufacturer reported quarterly earnings far below estimates. Emerson said it would sell 51 percent of the embedded business to private equity firm Platinum Equity and retain a noncontrolling interest. The business makes a range of power conversion products, including adapters for mobile devices and computers, and embedded computer systems used by medical, defense and other industries. “Continued weakness in the technology equipment and mobile device markets that this business serves has resulted in lower sales and earnings growth expectations,” Emerson said in a statement. The St. Louis-based company is taking a $503 million pretax goodwill impairment charge for the business, which it said was no longer a strategic fit. Emerson also plans to increase its share buybacks by $600 million to offset earnings dilution from the deal, which it expects to close in three to six months. The deal valuation was “unimpressive,” said Mike Wood, an analyst with Macquarie Research, but “it was ultimately a good thing that they found a buyer.” The business clashed with Emerson’s focus on products that support large capital projects, Wood said. “This has become a commoditized electronic product, and that’s something that Emerson cannot overcome with its good execution and cost control,” Wood said. Earlier this month, Samsung Electronics supplier Audience Inc, which makes chips that improve voice quality in mobile devices, warned it faced a loss in the current quarter. Emerson’s net income fell to $194 million, or 27 cents per share, in the third quarter ended June 30, from $770 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges for goodwill impairment and repatriating cash from the embedded computing unit, Emerson reported earnings of 97 cents per share. That was a penny below the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was off 2.2 percent to $6.34 billion, about $100 million below Wall Street’s target. U.S. sales were down 3 percent, while revenue in Europe slumped 6 percent. “Low levels of business investment continue to reflect a cautious climate, particularly in mature markets,” Chief Executive David Farr said in a statement. The company expects fiscal-year earnings, excluding items, around the lower end of its target range of $3.48 to $3.55 per share. Analysts targeted $3.49. Emerson forecast a rise of about 1 percent in fiscal-year sales, slightly below prior expectations. Emerson shares were down 62 cents at $61.72 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The St. Louis-based company will take a $503 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the business. Net income fell to $194 million, or 27 cents per share, in the third quarter ended June 30 from $770 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the impairment charge as well as one for repatriating cash from the embedded computing unit, Emerson reported earnings of 97 cents per share. That was a penny below the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 2.2 percent to $6.34 billion, about $100 million below Wall Street’s target.

75,EMR,SPX Corp to sell JV stake to Emerson Electric for $571 million,"(Reuters) - SPX Corp SPW.N, which has been under pressure from its largest shareholder to boost its stock price, said it would sell its entire stake in an electrical equipment joint venture to partner Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) for $571 million. SPX has been buying and selling businesses to focus on its flow technology division, joining other diversified U.S. industrials that have slimmed down their businesses after the economic crisis of 2008-2010. Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR.N) has spun off its security business, while Timken Co (TKR.N) is hiving off its steel division. Activist fund Relational Investors, which has a 15.5 percent stake in SPX, urged the company in February to consider strategic alternatives to boost its stock price. “I can’t say that (the sale of SPX’s stake in the joint venture) is entirely a function of Relational’s involvement but one would believe that their advise has been followed,” Wedbush Securities Inc analyst David Rose said. Relational also opposed SPX’s $4.2 billion offer for rival Gardner Denver Inc last year, saying the bid would endanger the company’s stated goal of paring down to focus on flow technology. Private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) eventually took the industrial machinery maker private. SPX has been investing in its flow technology business due to high demand for engineered pumps, valves, mixers and filtration technologies that are used to generate power and to process oil and gas. The business had sales of $2.68 billion in 2012, just over half of the company’s total revenue. SPX, which also makes equipment to produce food and beverages, transformers and cooling towers for power plants, said on Wednesday it expects the sale of its 44.5 percent stake in EGS Electric to close in the first quarter of 2014. The company said the deal value includes taxes worth about $220 million. The company expects to record an after-tax gain of about $300 million, or $6.50 per share, in its first quarter ending March 30. SPX said it would use a part of the proceeds to buy back shares and to reduce its debt. The joint venture, EGS Electric Group LLC, was set up in 1997, with Emerson responsible for operational management. EGS Electric, which makes electrical fittings, hazardous location lighting and power conditioning equipment, had revenue of more than $500 million in 2013. It operates primarily in the United States, Brazil, Canada and France. St. Louis-based Emerson said sales from EGS Electric would be consolidated in its industrial automation segment and would add to earnings in 2014. Shares in SPX, which has a market value of about $4 billion, rose as much as 2 percent in morning trading but gave back almost all those gains and ended only slightly higher on the day. The stock has risen 18 percent since Relational disclosed an 8.8 percent stake on February 25. Barclays was the financial adviser to Emerson on the transaction.

Thoma Bravo is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc  to explore a sale of Hyland, which could be worth more than $1.2 billion based on annual earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $80 million, the people said. Separately, Thoma Bravo is exploring a sale of LANDesk that also has EBITDA of around $80 million and could fetch up to 10 times that amount, the people said. The people asked not to be identified because the sale processes are confidential. Thoma Bravo declined to comment, while Hyland, LANDesk and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comment. Hyland provides enterprise content management software to corporate clients.

LANDesk makes systems to integrate control over corporate computers and mobile devices, competing with Symantec Corp , BMC Software Inc and Microsoft Corp. Thoma Bravo acquired Salt Lake City-based LANDesk from Emerson Electric Co in 2010 for an undisclosed amount. Thoma Bravo, a San Francisco-based private equity firm with more than $4 billion in assets, has seen big profits selling companies, culminating in the $1.65 billion agreement this week to sell mobile banking company Digital Insight Inc to NCR Corp , just four months after it bought it from Intuit Inc  for $1.01 billion.

Shares of the company, which had earlier said it expected reported sales to stay flat or rise by 1 percent in 2015, fell 2 percent in volatile premarket trading.

Shares of the company, which had earlier said it expected reported sales to stay flat or rise by 1 percent in 2015, fell 2 percent in volatile premarket trading. Emerson blamed a strong dollar, lower oil prices and weakness in Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa region for its weak sales forecast. The company sold its power transmission unit in December to Regal Beloit Corp for $1.44 billion, as part of its efforts to focus on its high-growth businesses. Emerson said on Tuesday that it would spend $100 million on restructuring in 2015, double the amount it had estimated earlier. The restructuring will impact about 1,000 salaried and 1,000 hourly employees, the company said. It was not clear if these employees were being relocated within the company or being offered severance packages. Emerson had about 115,100 employees as of Sept. 30. The company was not immediately available for comment. The company forecast 2015 earnings of $4.50-$4.60 per share, including a negative impact of a strong dollar, a restructuring charge of 5 cents per share and an estimated gain of 75 cents from divestiture. Analysts on average were expecting $3.92 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Emerson’s net earnings attributable to common shareholders rose to $525 million, or 75 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 31 from $462 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.3 percent to $5.59 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 72 cents per share and revenue of $5.59 billion. St. Louis, Missouri-based Emerson’s shares were trading at $57.60 before the bell. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had fallen about 8 percent in the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Global Industrials Index had risen about 4 percent.

103,EMR,Siemens approaches Emerson over network power: sources,"NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) has approached Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) to explore buying the network power business that the U.S. factory automation equipment maker is looking to shed for as much as $4 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Emerson said last June it planned to spin off the power business to concentrate on its industrial automation operations as well as its commercial and residential heating and air conditioning divisions. Emerson’s network power business provides equipment and services that stop mission-critical systems from failing, including surge prevention, uninterruptible power supplies and precision cooling.   Its main customers are operators of data centres and telecoms networks and energy providers and its main rivals are Eaton (ETN.N) and Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA). Siemens could combine the business with its power-distribution activities. Emerson, also exploring options for the rest of its non-core businesses, is talking with private equity firms, including Platinum Equity LLC, about a sale, the people said, which would be simpler and less risky than a spin-off.  Other companies have also expressed interest, according to the people. There is no certainty over which course of action Emerson will pursue and no deal is likely until later this year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Siemens, Emerson and Platinum Equity declined to comment. A price of $4 billion would imply an enterprise value of 0.9 times 2015 sales and 18 times EBIT (earnings before interest and tax), capital goods analysts at Barclays said, almost twice the EV/EBIT multiple of Emerson as a whole. The Barclays analysts said Siemens would be able to combine some of its products with Emerson’s but they also said: “We struggle to see at this stage how the company could materially improve the growth and margin profile of this business.” Barclays rates Siemens “equal weight”.  Emerson’s network power sales fell 1 percent in the quarter to end-December, reflecting what it called “mixed conditions in data centre and telecommunications infrastructure spending”. Its profit margin rose to 8 percent thanks to restructuring. That compares with a 6.6 percent operating profit margin at Siemens’ energy management unit in the quarter on flat sales. Siemens trades at 2015 EV/EBIT of 15.0, Eaton at 12.5 and Schneider Electric at 11.4.   The remaining non-core businesses that Emerson has been looking to sell include its motors and drives, power generation and remaining storage businesses. Collectively, these assets generate around $200 million in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, sources have previously told Reuters.  St. Louis, Missouri-based Emerson has seen its earnings hit  by a strong dollar and a drop in oil prices, which have curtailed spending by customers.  Rivals, such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N), have also been hit by weak oil prices.

107,EMR,Emerson launches sale of Motors and Drives unit - sources,"FRANKFURT/LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Emerson Electric is launching the sale of its Motors and Drives unit, which could be valued at up to $800 million, as the U.S. group focuses on divisions including heating and air conditioning, according to people with knowledge of the plans. JPMorgan and Centerview Partners, which are advising Emerson on the sale, are expected to send a first information memorandum on the business to prospective buyers by June. Company officials have been in Asia in the past two weeks to scout out potential suitors, two of the people added. Sector peers such as Brazil’s WEG, Japan’s Nidec , U.S.-based Regal Beloit and Chinese groups Shanghai Electric, Harbin Electric and Wolong Electric are expected to show interest. Based in St Louis Missouri, Emerson announced the sale of the division last summer as part of a wider reorganisation that includes spinning off its network power business, in which German peer Siemens has showed interest. Emerson does not provide specific figures for the Motors and Drives unit, which is part of its industrial automation division with $4 billion in fiscal 2015 sales. Emerson will keep of this division. People following the deal said the unit has about $1.5 billion in revenues and could be worth as much as $800 million based on forecast 2016 EBITDA of about $100 million and sector multiple between 5 and 8. The company said last year that it expects the divestments, equivalent to a quarter of its $20 billion in sales, to be mostly complete by September 2016. It also said it may yet decide to keep some assets including the Motors and Drives division. The division includes French industrial alternator and turbine manufacturer Leroy-Somer, acquired in 1990, as well as UK-based Control Techniques, bought in 1994, which makes drives used in the metals, cranes, mining and printing industries. “A large part of the asset is France-based, which will deter some bidders as it is always challenging to restructure French companies,” one of the people said. A takeover by a French buyout group such as Eurazeo , PAI or Wendel is a likely outcome, the person added, and other private equity groups will probably look at the asset too. Emerson, its advisors and the potential bidders either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Leroy-Somer was created in Angoulême, France, in 1919, by Marcellin Leroy. It has 29 sites worldwide, among them 16 in France, and employs 7,900 people worldwide. It also makes electric engines for the latest e-Mehari from PSA.

116,EMR,Exclusive: Emerson Electric in bid for Pentair's valves business - sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. factory automation equipment maker Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) has made an offer to acquire pump manufacturer Pentair Plc’s (PNR.N) troubled valves and controls division, according to people familiar with the matter. Such a deal would free Pentair from a unit that its chief executive Randy Hogan has called a laggard when it comes to generating cash, while allowing Emerson to expand within its core sectors as it seeks to shed its network power and motors and drives businesses. Pentair has received offers for the valves and controls business from companies other than Emerson, and there is no certainty that it will agree to any deal, the people said. The unit for sale could be valued at around $2 billion, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Emerson and Pentair declined to comment. Pentair inherited its valves and controls business as part of its $10 billion all-stock merger with Tyco International Ltd’s TYC.N flow control unit in 2012.  Its fittings are used in machinery in the chemical, power generation, oil and gas and power generation sectors. As a result, it has suffered from the commodities-driven downturn in the mining and energy industries.  Pentair has responded by slashing costs, letting more than 2,000 employees go in the last year, and hiring a new executive to lead the unit. The company has been under pressure since last year from activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP to improve its performance. Emerson announced last summer it would seek to spin off its network power division, which provides equipment and services that stop mission-critical systems from failing including surge prevention, uninterruptible power supplies and precision cooling. It has since said it is also considering a sale of that business. The remaining non-core businesses that Emerson has been looking to sell include its motors, drives and remaining storage businesses. Emerson could announce its final decision on the fate of these businesses in the coming weeks, according to the sources. Emerson Chief Executive David Farr told analysts on the company’s second-quarter earnings conference call in May that he could spend billions of dollars in cash on acquisitions in the second half of 2016. “If we could pick up a couple billion dollars worth of things, then we would be very excited about that,” Farr said.

130,EMR,Emerson Electric to buy Pentair's valves business for $3.15 billion,"(Reuters) - U.S. factory automation equipment maker Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) said on Thursday it would buy pump manufacturer Pentair Plc’s (PNR.N) valves & controls business for $3.15 billion in cash, as it expand its core businesses.  Emerson, which has been shedding non-core businesses, is focusing on growing its industrial automation business, along with process management, and commercial and residential heating and air conditioning businesses. Reuters reported in July that Emerson had made an offer to acquire Pentair’s valves and controls division, which makes fittings and controls used in machinery in the chemical, power generation, oil and gas and power generation sectors. Pentair’s valves and controls business will help Emerson capture a nearly 10 percent share of the $105 billion global process automation market, up from 7 percent currently, Emerson said.  Process automation involves precision measurement, control, and monitoring of industrial processes. Emerson’s process management business, its biggest, reported revenue of $8.52 billion in fiscal year 2015 and accounted for about 38 percent of its total revenue.  Pentair’s valves and controls business is headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, and had revenue of $1.84 billion in 2015. Pentair, which has been under pressure from activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP to improve its performance, inherited the business as part of its $10 billion all-stock merger with Tyco International Ltd’s TYC.N flow control unit in 2012.

131,EMR,UPDATE 2-Emerson Electric to buy Pentair's valves business for $3.15 bln,"(Reuters) - U.S. factory automation equipment maker Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) said on Thursday it would buy pump manufacturer Pentair Plc’s (PNR.N) valves & controls business for $3.15 billion in cash, as it expand its core businesses.  Emerson, which has been shedding non-core businesses, is focusing on growing its industrial automation business, along with process management, and commercial and residential heating and air conditioning businesses. Reuters reported in July that Emerson had made an offer to acquire Pentair’s valves and controls division, which makes fittings and controls used in machinery in the chemical, power generation, oil and gas and power generation sectors. Pentair’s valves and controls business will help Emerson capture a nearly 10 percent share of the $105 billion global process automation market, up from 7 percent currently, Emerson said.  Process automation involves precision measurement, control, and monitoring of industrial processes. Emerson’s process management business, its biggest, reported revenue of $8.52 billion in fiscal year 2015 and accounted for about 38 percent of its total revenue.  Pentair’s valves and controls business is headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, and had revenue of $1.84 billion in 2015. Pentair, which has been under pressure from activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP to improve its performance, inherited the business as part of its $10 billion all-stock merger with Tyco International Ltd’s TYC.N flow control unit in 2012. Earlier in August, Emerson agreed to sell its network power unit to investment firm Platinum Equity in a deal valued at $4 billion. The business provides equipment and services that stop mission-critical systems from failing including surge prevention, uninterruptible power supplies and precision cooling.

The company, however, posted an adjusted profit of 96 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 89 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Emerson said it expects net underlying sales for the year ending Sept. 30, 2017 to decline 1-3 percent from fiscal 2016. It expects earnings per share from continuing operations between $2.35 and $2.50.

144,EMR,UPDATE 3-Rockwell Automation expects first annual sales rise in 3 yrs,"(Reuters) - Rockwell Automation Inc forecast its first full-year rise in sales in three years as stabilizing demand in industries including oil and gas helped the company report higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Shares of the company, which makes factory automation systems, rose as much as 6 percent to $124.75 on Monday. Rockwell has been hit by weak oil prices that curtailed customer spending in the oil and gas industry, which accounted for about 12 percent of revenue in the year ended Sept. 30, 2015. Rockwell has been cutting jobs as part of a restructuring plan and estimates gross savings of more than $30 million in fiscal 2017.  The company also forecast adjusted earnings of $5.85-$6.25 per share and a 1-5 percent rise in sales for the year.  Analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $5.98 per share on revenue of $5.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Rockwell’s fiscal 2017 sales forecast seemed “aggressive” and has a “risk of negative revisions as the year progresses in a still uncertain environment,” J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note. Last week, rival Emerson Electric Co forecast a 1-3 percent drop in underlying sales for the year ending Sept. 30, 2017, citing lower industrial spending. Rockwell said it could consider acquisitions in fiscal 2017 as it looks to drive sales growth.  “We have a strong pipeline of potential acquisitions in various stages that address one or more of three focus areas around the world,” Chief Executive Blake Moret told Reuters.   Sales in Rockwell’s architecture and software business, which makes computers that help run manufacturing processes, rose 1.8 percent to $696.4 million in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. The business, Rockwell’s second biggest, contributed 44.8 percent to the company’s fiscal 2016 sales. “We saw positive year-over-year organic growth in the architecture and software segment for the first time this year,” Moret said. However, sales in the company’s larger control products business - which makes motor starters, signaling devices and relays and timers - fell 8.8 percent to $842.2 million, while contributing about 55 percent of overall revenue. Rockwell’s net income fell to $185.2 million, or $1.43 per share, from $201.3 million, or $1.50 per share, a year earlier On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.52 per share.    Total sales fell 4.3 percent to $1.54 billion. Analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of $1.48 per share and revenue of $1.51 billion. Up to Friday’s close of $117.56, Rockwell’s stock had risen about 14.6 percent this year, compared with a 6.8 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Industrials index.

151,EMR,"Emerson Electric beats profit estimates, raises forecast","(Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by strong demand in China for its air conditioning and refrigeration parts, and the company raised its full-year sales and earnings forecasts. The company’s shares rose as much as 6.1 percent to a more than two-year high of $63.50 in morning trading on Tuesday. Emerson said its commercial and residential solutions division gained from a 40 percent sales growth in China, where demand for its air conditioning and refrigeration components had risen significantly over the last two quarters. China's economy likely grew around 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter as a stimulus-fueled construction boom breathed new life into its long ailing ""smokestack"" heavy industries. (reut.rs/2ki2V65) Overall sales in the unit, which makes air conditioning compressors, sensors and thermistors for home appliances and ignition systems for furnaces, rose 6.3 percent to $1.25 billion in the first-quarter ended Dec. 31.  However, sales in the automation solutions business fell 9 percent to $1.97 billion in the quarter. The division accounted for 61.2 percent of Emerson’s quarterly revenue. The business makes valves and regulators for the oil and gas industry and has struggled as customers clamped down on spending due to a slump in oil prices. However, with a recovery in oil prices, Emerson said it saw improving order rates in the business, particularly in North America, towards the end of the first quarter. “Emerson has now ‘rounded Cape Horn’ and should now be positioned for generally positive improvement in its fundamental performance over the rest of the decade,” William Blair analyst Nick Heymann wrote in a note. Emerson said its margins in the quarter were also boosted by savings from restructuring taken during the past two years. The company’s pretax margin rose 14.4 percent in the first quarter, from 13 percent a year earlier. Emerson said it expected fiscal 2017 sales to be flat to down 2 percent, excluding the impact of a strong dollar, compared with its previous forecast of a decline of 1-3 percent. The company, which gets nearly half of its revenue from  outside the United States, lifted its forecast for earnings per share from continuing operations to $2.47-$2.62 from the $2.35-$2.50 it had previously forecast.

159,EMR,"Emerson's sales in biggest business fall 3 percent, shares drag","(Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported flat revenue, as a decline in sales in its biggest business, automation solutions, offset a rise in demand in its commercial and residential solutions business, dragging shares down as much as 5.4 percent. The company said on Tuesday sales in the automation solutions business, which makes valves and regulators for the oil and gas industry, were down 3 percent, falling across most of its markets, except China and Europe. Margins in the business fell 10 basis points to 15.5 percent, the company said. Emerson Electric’s margin performance in the second quarter ended March 31 was slightly softer than expected, with the downside largely driven by the automation business, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. However, the company raised its 2017 forecasts for both revenue and earnings, on continued strong demand from its commercial and residential solutions business. The factory automation equipment maker expects earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.55-$2.65 in 2017, up from its earlier forecast of $2.47-$2.62. Analysts on average were expecting 2017 earnings of $2.59 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also said it expects full-year net sales to be flat compared with its earlier forecast of down 1-3 percent.  The St. Louis, Missouri-based company’s quarterly profit met Wall Street estimates, helped by an increase in sales in the commercial and residential solutions business. Earnings from continuing operations rose to $384 million, or 58 cents per share in the quarter, from $375 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.  Net sales were little changed at $3.57 billion. Analysts on average were expecting second-quarter earnings of 58 cents per share, on sales of $3.50 billion.

168,EMR,"Tale of two factories: hope, anguish ahead of Trump's steel tariff call","GRANITE CITY, Ill. (Reuters) - The blast furnaces and slab casters at United States Steel Corp’s Granite City Works have been idle for 18 months, and laid-off workers here are pinning their hopes on President Donald Trump imposing broad new restrictions on imported steel. Yet just across the Mississippi River, some manufacturers worry that new tariffs and curbs Trump is weighing under a “Section 232” national security review will raise their cost and make it harder to compete with foreign rivals.  The inherent conflict between suppliers and buyers is at the heart of a debate inside the administration that lobbyists and lawmakers say could delay or weaken any protections recommended by the U.S. Commerce Department. The review’s findings, originally expected by the end of June, could be unveiled in the coming weeks. The Cold War-era law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense pits an iconic industry that has been struggling with imports for decades against those that have benefited from China flooding the world steel market with excess production. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oPeo1z) According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the libertarian Cato Institute, steel mills and steel product factories now employ about 140,000 people, compared to 6.5 million at steel-reliant manufacturers ranging from autos and appliances to machinery.    In Granite City, where about 1,200 of the U.S. Steel plant’s 1,800 workers remain laid off despite the recent restart of some  rolling mill operations, there is an air of keen anticipation. “We’re waiting on the 232 to get us back to work,” said Chris Bragg, who was laid off in November 2015 when steel imports surged and oil prices cratered, slashing demand for the mill’s main product, hot-rolled steel for oil and gas drilling pipe. The 46-year-old father of three has been working in home construction since then, making less than half of the $55,000 he earned in his last year working on U.S. Steel’s basic oxygen furnace, which melts iron and alloys into steel.  There were few dinners out, no vacations and no high school graduation presents for Bragg’s twin sons last year. TJ’s Place, a bar across the street from a plant gate,  canceled its fish fries and taco nights and could close if more workers are not called back, said bartender Diane Valerius. “If that mill shuts down, this town is dead.”  Idled steelworkers Reuters interviewed in this factory suburb see the “Section 232” probe as a key test of Trump’s commitment to campaign promises to revive U.S. manufacturing and curb imports from China and South Korea.   “I voted for Trump because the Democratic Party was going to kill the coal industry and the steel industry in one fell swoop,” said Bill Wiley, 50, a laid-off apprentice millwright. “Somebody has to stick up for us. We’re just asking for a level playing field.” Across the Mississippi in north St. Louis, factory managers at Bachman Machine Co worry new tariffs and curbs could raise steel prices, putting the 90-year-old maker of stamped steel auto parts at a disadvantage against Mexican suppliers. “Anything that is out of the norm in terms of a price change is going to be a negative factor for us. If we can’t pass that on, then that hurts us,” said Jerry Ernsky, Bachman’s head of sales and marketing.  The 100-employee company buys from steel distributors and often does not know the origin of the steel it uses to make parts for seats, airbags, door mechanisms and other components, Ernsky said. These are sold to larger auto suppliers such as Toyoda Gosei in Perryville, Missouri, and ultimately find their way to the U.S. assembly plants of Toyota, Honda, Ford and other automakers.  Kei Pang, chief executive of Ferguson, Missouri-based Nidec Motor Corp, the former Emerson Electric motors unit now owned by Japan’s Nidec Corp, warned Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a letter that import curbs on certain electrical steels “would cause serious and material harm to our companies, our employees, and our customers.” AK Steel is the only remaining U.S. manufacturer of electrical steel, a specialty product with precise magnetic properties used in transformers and motors. It has argued that it needs protection because domestic supplies are needed to safeguard the U.S. electrical grid. In similar public comments, U.S. Steel has called for  import restrictions on tubular goods for the oil and gas industry as a way of safeguarding U.S. energy independence, a critical national security goal. Foreign steelmakers now supply half the oil and gas drilling and extraction pipe used in the United States. Direct imports from China were largely cut off by successful anti-dumping cases in recent years, only to be replaced by pipe imports from South Korea, which since April have been subject to increased duties. But as U.S. energy firms boost production, foreign-made steel pipes are still flooding into U.S. ports. Based on June import permit data, The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that imports of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry are up 237 percent in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier.  Ross, the Commerce chief, has indicated he might support protection for U.S. makers of pipes and their suppliers. He told a congressional hearing in June that steel was a “genuine national security issue” and pointed out how a U.S. tubular mill made the body of the massive conventional bomb dropped on Islamic State militants in Afghanistan in April. The 79-year-old billionaire is best known for his work restructuring several bankrupt U.S. steel companies in the early 2000s, selling them to what is now Arcelor Mittal. He is formulating trade policy alongside U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer who represented U.S. Steel in anti-dumping cases. On the other side of the argument, steel users have enlisted dozens of industry trade groups to make the case against broad steel import restrictions. The American Petroleum Institute and 10 other oil and gas trade groups urged Commerce to narrowly define national security and “to consider the potential negative effects of U.S. tariffs or quotas or other measures that would raise the cost of steel inputs for the oil and natural gas industry.” It remains unclear what actions Ross will recommend, whether Trump will implement that.  U.S. Steel has not indicated how the Trump administration’s review may alter its production plans, saying in a statement that it was “interested to review the results of the 232 investigation.” Idled workers say the uncertainty is gnawing at them.  “There’s nothing that Trump’s done as of yet” for steelworkers, said Paul Morris, 55. “All we can do is sit back and wait.”    ",7132017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-steel/tale-of-two-factories-hope-anguish-ahead-of-trumps-steel-tariff-call-idUSL1N1JY0OR

The company said it now expects fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.58 to $2.62, up from its previous forecast of $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Emerson said it expects net sales to be up about 5 percent from flat. The company expects underlying sales to be up 1 percent. “As we enter the fourth quarter, we expect to see demand and economic conditions improve,” Chief Executive David Farr said in a statement. Net sales for the third quarter rose 10 percent to $4.04 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $4.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at its automation solutions business, its biggest, jumped 12.1 percent to $2.44 billion, helped in part by renewed activity in unconventional oil and gas, particularly in Western Canada. The business makes valves and regulators for the oil and gas industry and had been struggling as customers curtailed spending due to a slump in oil prices. Underlying sales in North America were up 6 percent led by energy related markets, Emerson said, adding that it anticipated bookings for larger projects in 2018. Emerson has been shedding non-core businesses and has focused on growing its automation solutions business, along with commercial and residential heating and air conditioning businesses. Earnings from continuing operations fell to $419 million, or 63 cents per share in the third quarter ended June 30, from $451 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.

180,EMR,UPDATE 4-Rockwell Automation rejects Emerson's $27 billion takeover bid,"(Reuters) - Automation equipment maker Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) said on Tuesday it had rejected an unsolicited acquisition bid from bigger rival Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) for more than $27 billion, arguing that the offer undervalued the company.  The snubbed bid illustrates how Emerson CEO David Farr, who has been at the helm for 17 years and had previously indicated he would consider only small, bolt-on acquisitions, is now seeking a transformational deal to diversify Emerson’s businesses and reduce their exposure to volatile energy prices. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, helping power plants and factories in sectors such as mining and cement operate more efficiently. Rockwell, on the other hand, is a leader in so-called discrete automation, helping assemble component parts to manufacture items such as automobiles, household appliances and computer systems. Rockwell said it had rejected a $215 per share bid from Emerson, split in half in its consideration between cash and Emerson shares.  Rockwell shares gained 7.4 percent to close at $200.82 on Tuesday. They are up 46 percent year-to-date, versus a 16 percent rise in Emerson shares. The rejection followed a previous Emerson offer in August that valued Rockwell at $200 per share, also split in cash and stock, Rockwell said.  Emerson confirmed the takeover approach, but said that no talks were currently taking place between the two companies and that it would remain a disciplined buyer. It would not comment on whether it planned a new offer for Rockwell. Emerson shares ended trading down 4.3 percent at $64.46, giving it a market capitalization of $41 billion. Analysts said the company faced an uphill battle to clinch a deal with Rockwell. “Rockwell probably does not need Emerson at all. We also agree that Rockwell has done a fantastic job on its own and see strong growth and high returns ahead. This does not mean a deal will not happen, but it feels like a long shot for Emerson,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague wrote in a research note. One of Rockwell’s attractions for Emerson is its advances in the so-called internet of things, or technology that allows different devices and systems to communicate with each other over the internet. While Emerson has been seeking to boost its software portfolio through acquisitions, it lacks the breadth of Rockwell’s offerings that help industrial businesses connect their technology operations. In its deliberations, Rockwell’s board of directors expressed doubt about the value of the synergies in a tie-up with Emerson, and was apprehensive about accepting Emerson’s stock as a currency given what it perceived as Emerson’s poor track record of integrating acquisitions, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Rockwell is now focused on its standalone strategy, added the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential. Emerson’s last offer valued Rockwell at around 20 times its projected 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, while Rockwell shares currently trade at 16 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The snubbed bid illustrates how Emerson CEO David Farr, who has been at the helm for 17 years and had previously indicated he would consider only small, bolt-on acquisitions, is now seeking a transformational deal to diversify Emerson’s businesses and reduce their exposure to volatile energy prices. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, helping power plants and factories in sectors such as mining and cement operate more efficiently. Rockwell, on the other hand, is a leader in so-called discrete automation, helping assemble component parts to manufacture items such as automobiles, household appliances and computer systems. Rockwell said it had rejected a $215 per share bid from Emerson, split in half in its consideration between cash and Emerson shares.  Rockwell shares gained 7.4 percent to close at $200.82 on Tuesday. They are up 46 percent year-to-date, versus a 16 percent rise in Emerson shares. The rejection followed a previous Emerson offer in August that valued Rockwell at $200 per share, also split in cash and stock, Rockwell said.  Emerson confirmed the takeover approach, but said that no talks were currently taking place between the two companies and that it would remain a disciplined buyer. It would not comment on whether it planned a new offer for Rockwell. Emerson shares ended trading down 4.3 percent at $64.46, giving it a market capitalization of $41 billion. Analysts said the company faced an uphill battle to clinch a deal with Rockwell. “Rockwell probably does not need Emerson at all. We also agree that Rockwell has done a fantastic job on its own and see strong growth and high returns ahead. This does not mean a deal will not happen, but it feels like a long shot for Emerson,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague wrote in a research note. One of Rockwell’s attractions for Emerson is its advances in the so-called internet of things, or technology that allows different devices and systems to communicate with each other over the internet. While Emerson has been seeking to boost its software portfolio through acquisitions, it lacks the breadth of Rockwell’s offerings that help industrial businesses connect their technology operations. In its deliberations, Rockwell’s board of directors expressed doubt about the value of the synergies in a tie-up with Emerson, and was apprehensive about accepting Emerson’s stock as a currency given what it perceived as Emerson’s poor track record of integrating acquisitions, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Rockwell is now focused on its standalone strategy, added the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential. Emerson’s last offer valued Rockwell at around 20 times its projected 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, while Rockwell shares currently trade at 16 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.

184,EMR,"Emerson outlook disappoints, shares fall","(Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) gave marginally weaker earnings guidance for 2018 than Wall Street had expected on Tuesday, sending shares in the U.S. factory automation equipment maker down as much as 2.8 percent. Emerson said adjusted net earnings per share for fiscal year ending September, 2018 were expected to be $2.85 at the mid point, compared with an average analysts’ estimate of $2.90 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  It expects full year net sales to rise by 8 percent to 10 percent, compared with the 11.8 percent increase expected by Wall Street.  The St. Louis, Missouri-based company said cooler weather and the disruption from hurricanes weighed on its commercial and residential solutions business, which makes air conditioning compressors and Wi-Fi thermostats and is its second biggest.  Sales in the unit rose 4 percent but margins fell 60 basis points to 24.7 percent in the fourth-quarter ended Sept. 30, with Emerson pointing to a change in the makeup of sales towards its lower margin products as one reason for the decline.  It said cooler weather and hurricanes had slowed down its North America compressor replacement business.  “There was a bit more pressure on Climate margins during the quarter, which is likely attributable to raw material inflation,” Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe wrote in a note. The company said it expects to recover sales lost due to the hurricanes over the next twelve months as damaged areas rebuild.  Sales in the company’s automation solutions business, its largest, improved 18 percent, helped by stabilizing demand in the oil and gas industries. Margins increased 300 basis points to 20.2 percent. The business makes products including measurement instrumentation, valves and regulators for the oil and gas sectors. The unit had been struggling as customers curtailed spending due to a slump in oil prices. Overall, September trailing three-month orders rose 11 percent, Emerson said. In October, Emerson made an unsolicited acquisition bid for smaller rival Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) for more than $27 billion, as it looked to diversify its businesses and reduce exposure to volatile energy prices.  Rockwell, however, rejected the bid arguing that the offer undervalued the company. Shares of Emerson were down 2.5 percent at $62.88 in morning trading. Up to Monday's close, Emerson's stock had risen 15.7 percent this year, compared with a 15.6 percent increase in the S&P; 500 index .SPX.

188,EMR,Rockwell defends standalone strategy in the face of Emerson bid,"(Reuters) - Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) Chief Executive Blake Moret said on Wednesday that he would stick with delivering the company’s factory automation equipment on one platform, reinforcing its rebuff of Emerson Electric Co’s (EMR.N) $27.6 billion takeover bid. Moret’s comments offer the clearest indication yet that Rockwell has been resisting Emerson’s overtures not just because of disagreements over price, but also because of a different vision of how its business should be run. “While we sometimes get caught up in looking at what pieces of the overall automation market can be used, what matters is the outcomes that you bring to a specific customer, and that specific customer is looking for a single platform,” Moret said on a call with analysts after the publication of Rockwell’s latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, helping factories in sectors such as mining and oil and gas operate more efficiently. Rockwell is a leader in so-called discrete automation, helping assemble component parts to manufacture items such as automobiles, household appliances and computer systems. At the heart of the dispute is how effectively the two companies could be integrated. Emerson’s latest $215 per share cash-and-stock bid for Rockwell is based on estimated capitalized synergies between the two companies of around $6 billion, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Rockwell caters to its discrete automation customers using a programmable logic controller platform it calls Logix. It has been seeking to expand this control platform to process automation and cater to so-called hybrid customers using a combination of process and discrete automation. Emerson uses a distributed control system platform for its process and hybrid automation customers called DeltaV. Should it acquire Rockwell, it plans to offer its Logix platform to customers alongside DeltaV. “By leveraging the key technology platforms that are strengths of Emerson and Rockwell, where this technology can mutually coexist and thrive, we would create an industry leader, better positioned in an environment where the global customer base is asking for a more integrated solution in a process world and a hybrid world,” Emerson CEO David Farr said during his company’s earnings call on Tuesday. Rockwell has argued that this approach could disrupt the business of some of its customers who want a single platform, and even cost it revenue. This is despite it previously having tried to challenge Emerson’s DeltaV by developing a similar distributed control system platform called PlantPAx, which never captured significant market share. Rockwell has been gradually making progress in increasing its footprint in process automation, thanks partly to acquisitions, including a company called MAVERICK Technologies last year. Rockwell’s process business revenue was up 9 percent year-over-year organically in the latest quarter and up almost 20 percent with the Maverick acquisition included, Moret said. Based on Emerson’s latest bid, Rockwell shareholders would own about a quarter of the combined company. Rockwell has been apprehensive about accepting Emerson’s stock as a currency because of what it perceives as Farr’s poor track record of integrating acquisitions, sources told Reuters last week. “Rockwell seems uninterested in engaging,” Vertical Research Partners LLC analysts wrote in a research note on Tuesday. “It has made arguments that a combination with Emerson will create dis-synergies, as channels are disrupted and control platforms would require migration.” Emerson has not commented on whether it would make a new offer for Rockwell. Emerson shares ended trading on Wednesday down 0.9 percent at $65.52, valuing the company at $40 billion. Rockwell shares ended trading down 3.5 percent at $193.78, valuing it at $25 billion. In its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, Rockwell forecast its fiscal 2018 adjusted profit to be $7.35 per share at the mid-point, below Wall Street estimates of $7.38 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Rockwell’s operating margins fell to 17 percent in the fourth quarter from 19.8 percent a year earlier, hurt by its control products business. Rockwell’s net income rose 10.5 percent to $204.6 million, or $1.57 per share, in the quarter ending Sept. 30. On an adjusted basis, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company earned $1.69 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.73 per share. On Tuesday, Emerson said adjusted net earnings per share for the fiscal year ending September 2018 were expected to be $2.85 at the mid point, compared with an average analysts’ estimate of $2.90 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.

The new offer follows Rockwell’s rejections of Emerson’s overtures for much of this year. Rockwell’s CEO Blake Moret said last week he wanted to stick with delivering the company’s factory automation equipment on one platform. “As it did with Emerson’s prior proposals... the board of directors of Rockwell Automation will carefully review Emerson’s proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and Rockwell Automation shareowners,” Rockwell said in a statement on Thursday. Rockwell shares were up 4.7 percent at $197.57. Emerson shares were up 0.2 percent at $59.25, giving the company a market capitalization of $38 billion. Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Rockwell said last month it had rejected a $215-per-share bid from Emerson, split in half between cash and shares. On Thursday, Emerson said its new $225-per-share bid would be split between $135 per share in cash and $90 per share in Emerson shares.  “We do think it is a compelling offer for the company, given the increase in overall bid and increased cash component,” Stifel analysts wrote in a note.  Emerson offered to name the combined company Emerson Rockwell and maintain a significant presence in Milwaukee as an “automation center of excellence” for the combined company. It also said it would expand its board from 10 to 13 directors, with three nominated from the current Rockwell board. “We remain convinced there is compelling strategic, operational, and financial merit to bringing together our two companies,” Emerson Chief Executive David Farr, who has been at the company’s helm for 17 years, said in a statement. St. Louis, Missouri-based Emerson also estimated the total capitalized value of the deal synergies to be in excess of $6 billion and said it did not anticipate any material antitrust issues. “Even after ‘capitalized’ synergies of $6 billion, the returns would be sub-par and exposed to the cyclical downside risk inherent to Rockwell’s end-markets,” Cowen and Company analysts covering Emerson wrote in a note.

200,EMR,Rockwell Automation rebuffs Emerson's latest $29 billion bid,"(Reuters) - Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) rejected Emerson Electric Co’s (EMR.N) sweetened $29 billion takeover offer on Wednesday, in  its strongest rebuttal to date of the proposed combination of two of the world’s largest factory equipment makers. Rockwell has resisted Emerson’s overtures not just because of disagreements over price, but also because it has argued that the combined company’s industrial customers would be worse off because its products would no longer be available on a single platform and in one software environment.  A combination with Emerson would “dampen, not enhance, the ability to grow in the evolving industrial automation and information market,” Rockwell Chief Executive Blake Moret wrote in a letter to Emerson CEO David Farr published on Wednesday. Investors reacted by largely dismissing the likelihood of a tie up between the companies in the short term. Rockwell shares traded down 1.3 percent to $190.57, far below Emerson’s $225 cash-and-share bid and close to the level they were trading before Emerson’s acquisition interest became public last month.  Emerson shares rose 2.5 percent to $61.87, as investor concerns that the company would proceed with an expensive deal that would overstretch its finances eased. “We believe it is unlikely there will be follow-up offer from Emerson,” Wells Fargo Securities LLC analysts wrote in a note. Rockwell is a leader in so-called discrete automation, helping assemble component parts to make automobiles, household appliances and computer systems. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, which helps power plants and factories in sectors including mining and cement operate more efficiently. Rockwell caters to its discrete automation customers using a programmable logic controller platform it calls Logix. It has been seeking to expand this control platform to process automation and cater to so-called hybrid customers using a combination of process and discrete automation. Emerson uses a distributed control system platform for its process and hybrid automation customers called DeltaV. Should it acquire Rockwell, it plans to offer its Logix platform to customers alongside DeltaV. Rockwell has argued that this approach could disrupt the business of some of its customers who want a single platform, and even cost it revenue. This is despite it previously having tried to challenge Emerson’s DeltaV by developing a similar distributed control system platform called PlantPAx, which never captured significant market share. Rockwell has been gradually making progress in increasing its footprint in process automation, thanks partly to acquisitions, including of MAVERICK Technologies last year. In his letter to Farr, Moret challenged Emerson’s assumption of $400 million of run-rate synergies in a deal. A full one-third of these synergies are assumed to be revenue synergies, which are notoriously difficult to achieve, while the cost and revenue synergies are uncertain at best, Moret wrote. Earlier this month, Emerson outlined a plan for a combined “Emerson Rockwell” that will maintain a significant presence in Milwaukee and become an “automation center of excellence.” Under Emerson’s latest proposal, Rockwell shareholders would own 40 percent of the combined company. Emerson could try to alleviate concerns about Rockwell shareholders’ exposure to the combined company by adding more cash to its offer and reducing its stock element. However, Moody’s Investors Service said last week that Emerson’s current proposal would saddle the combined company with $25 billion in debt, giving it little leeway to raise its offer much further. Moody’s has also estimated Emerson’s latest offer values Rockwell at a hefty 23 times multiple of Rockwell’s earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization reported for the last 12 months ending Sept. 30, almost double where many of its peers are trading.

205,EMR,Emerson Electric pulls Rockwell Automation bid off table,"(Reuters) - Industrial-automation systems maker Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) said on Tuesday it abandoned its bid for Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) after several rejections, and instead will pursue bolt-on acquisitions as originally planned. “Clearly, the Rockwell opportunity is dead, and we’re moving on,” Emerson’s Chief Executive David Farr said on a call with analysts, after expressing disappointment in a statement that Rockwell’s board had refused to discuss a potential merger. Emerson’s shares rose 3.1 percent to $63.82, while Rockwell’s were up 1.7 percent at $194.22 in midday trading. The move to focus on smaller, bolt-on deals is not new for Emerson. In fact, Farr, who has been at the helm for 17 years, had previously indicated that he would consider only small, bolt-on acquisitions. Farr said on Tuesday that Emerson would be interested in some assets of General Electric Co (GE.N), if GE looks to sell, and some assets that are now part of GE’s Baker Hughes (BHGE.N). He said on the call that Emerson would keep trying to strengthen its position in hybrid and discrete automation, but declined to give names of companies it was interested in buying. Farr said the company would seek bolt-on acquisitions valued at $500 million to $1.5 billion over the next couple of years. The $29 billion offer for Rockwell, which would have created an industrial automation giant, was Emerson’s bid to diversify its businesses and reduce exposure to volatile energy prices. Emerson first made an offer of $200 per share for Rockwell in August. It then raised its offer twice - to $215 per share and $225 per share, but was rejected. Rockwell argued that the offers undervalued it and that the combined company’s industrial customers would be worse off because its products would no longer be available on a single platform.       “The Rockwell Automation Board and management team are committed to the execution of our strategy, which we are confident will continue delivering extraordinary shareowner returns,” Rockwell said in a statement on Tuesday. With the Rockwell deal falling through, Emerson said it plans to speed up the rate of share repurchases over the next month and buy back up to $1 billion over the next 12 months. Emerson continues to expect more than $2.8 billion in operating cash flow for fiscal 2018.     Rockwell’s shares have risen 2.2 percent since news of the deal first became public on Oct. 31. Emerson’s shares have fallen 8.1 percent in the same time. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, helping power plants and factories in sectors such as mining and cement operate more efficiently. Rockwell, on the other hand, is a leader in so-called discrete automation, helping assemble component parts to make cars, household appliances and computer systems.

210,EMR,"Siemens sees scale, data privacy as winners in digital race","MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany’s Siemens  sees its broad industrial base and respect for customers’ data privacy as giving it the edge in a race to attract businesses to its factory software platform, rather than those of rivals. The trains-to-turbines group is betting the future of its core industrial automation business on its MindSphere platform, which competes with General Electric’s Predix and a host of others to help customers cut costs and improve productivity. The race is still wide open, and being first to gather a critical mass of software developers and system integrators is crucial to winning customers, much as Apple’s large developer community made its app store the most attractive. “One thing is clear: Size matters,” Jan Mrosik, chief executive of Siemens’ 11.5 billion-euro Digital Factory division, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. Siemens said it was targeting 1.25 million connected devices and systems by the end of its fiscal year in September, up from 1 million currently, as it expands its offering - previously focused on autos and aerospace - to cover all sectors. MindSphere gathers data from devices, analyses the information and uses it to help customers design products faster and optimize processes. To increase its attractiveness to developers, Siemens is partnering with Amazon Web Services (AWS) , the most popular cloud provider, as of next month.  So far, it has partnered with Germany’s SAP - with whom it developed the platform - and from April it will also work with Microsoft’s Azure. Mrosik said Siemens’ own experience of manufacturing in fields ranging from trains to building technology to energy equipment also gave it a solid basis of customers and expertise. Simon Jacobson, supply-chain analyst at technology research group Gartner, tended to agree. “Where Siemens has opportunity is to leverage its domain expertise across a range of sectors,” he said, although he cautioned: “This is a market that’s still rapidly unraveling.” Mrosik also highlighted Siemens’ policy of keeping customers’ data in silos that are only visible to them as a competitive advantage. “We as Siemens technically can’t look into the data of anyone,” he said. Digitally enhanced manufacturing is still in its infancy, with companies pursuing different strategies. But competition is already fierce, as evidenced by Emerson Electric’s failed $29 billion bid to buy Rockwell Automation earlier this year. Siemens is increasing research and development spending to over 5.6 billion euros this fiscal year from 5.2 billion last year, the lion’s share of which will go to Digital Factory. MindSphere has a breakeven target date of 2020. Siemens says it made 5.2 billion euros in digital revenues in the year to September. It has 23,000 in-house software developers, rivaling some of the world’s biggest pure-play software companies. “Digitalization is starting to come together for Siemens,” said Jefferies capital goods analyst Peter Reilly. General Electric is reducing investment in its Predix industrial software platform by about $400 million this coming year to $1.2 billion, and focusing solely on its own installed base of customers for the rollout. Under new Chief Executive John Flannery, GE as a whole is narrowing its focus and shedding businesses with around $20 billion in revenue.  GE aims to double Predix revenues to $1 billion in 2018.

213,EMR,Siemens partners with Amazon as it ramps up industrial software platform,"MUNICH, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Siemens is partnering with Amazon as it accelerates the rollout of its MindSphere industrial software platform, the core of its bid to dominate the market in digital factory automation. The German group’s next version of MindSphere, to be launched in January, will run on Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the most popular cloud system with industrial software developers. “Many customers appreciate it very much,” Siemens Chief Technology Officer Roland Busch told reporters and analysts at a company presentation in Munich on Friday. “You have to really scale up in order to justify your money.” So far, MindSphere has run on the SAP cloud, and from April it will also run on Microsoft’s Azure. MindSphere gathers data from devices, analyses the information and uses it to help customers optimise processes. Attracting a critical mass of developers to work on the platform is crucial to improving the quality of software applications. MindSphere is one of a number of so-called Internet-of-Things platforms being developed by industrial companies racing to help their manufacturing customers improve productivity, where growth has been slowing in developed countries. The technology was thrown into sharp focus in August by Emerson Electric’s failed $29 billion bid to buy Rockwell Automation. The area is still in its infancy, with companies pursuing different strategies, although Siemens is generally considered to be leading the pack, helped by more than $5 billion of acquisitions in the past two years and by arch-rival General Electric’s partial retreat as it narrows focus. Siemens said it was targeting 1.25 million connected devices and systems by the end of its fiscal year in September, up from 1 million currently, as it expands its offering - previously focused on autos and aerospace - to cover all sectors.
