1,NEE,FACTBOX-U.S. proposed new nuclear power reactors," July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. nuclear industry’s top cop is to weigh major changes in how it regulates the country’s 104 reactors after Japan’s Fukushima disaster, a move that will help shape the future of the power source and could lead to significant cost increases.  A task force recommended the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look at a fundamental shift in how it plans for catastrophes like the earthquake and tsunami that swamped the Fukushima plant in March, the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.  Now it is up to the five-member commission to decide which ideas to accept and how quickly to proceed in an industry where plant retrofits can run into the millions. [ID:nN1E76C0KV]  The task force praised new reactors that include passive features, saying the new designs would be in line with many of its recommendations. It urged the NRC to complete its review “without delay” of Toshiba-Shaw’s Westinghouse AP1000 reactor and GE-Hitachi’s Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR).

3,NEE,Bonneville defends wind curtailment in FERC filing,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Bonneville Power Administration urged federal regulators to dismiss a complaint filed by wind farm owners in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, saying that the agency’s policy to cut wind generation without compensation is needed to maintain grid reliability, according to a filing made late on Tuesday.  The largest snowpack since 1997 boosted Northwest river levels this spring, complicating competition between hydro and wind interests in the region where Bonneville (BPA) operates the lion’s share of the high-voltage power network.  In its response to a complaint filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last month, BPA said it adopted its “environmental redispatch” policy to balance surplus hydro power while dealing with “a myriad of statutory responsibilities.”  “This policy has effectively maintained the reliability of the transmission system and reduced harm to endangered species,” BPA said. “The commission should not take action that could remove this critical tool from the agency.”  From mid-May until early July, BPA curtailed wind generation nearly every day to increase its hydro output to protect salmon and other fish, the agency said.  In the complaint, a coalition of owners of nearly 2,000 megawatts of wind generation said BPA’s policy was an unfair use of the grid, costing generators lost income and discouraging development of renewable power resources in the region.  While BPA offered to replace wind farm output with hydropower so that wind generators still get paid by their customers, they can lose money in other ways, including lost production tax credits and renewable energy credits (RECs).  The complaint was filed by Iberdrola Renewables, an affiliate of Spain’s largest utility; PacifiCorp, a unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, the electric unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc; Horizon Wind Energy, a unit of EDP Renewables which is part of Portugal’s largest utility; NextEra Energy and privately ownedInvenergy.  Is has attracted dozens of intervenors, including supporters like the Oregon Public Utility Commission and an environmental coalition that said BPA’s policy did not benefit fish.  However, a majority of parties that want to be heard are public power utilities in the Northwest.  The American Public Power Association and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association sided with Bonneville, asking FERC to reject the complaint due to FERC’s limited legal authority over BPA.  “It’s an important regional issue and should be treated like that,” said BPA spokesman Doug Johnson. “We all are committed to reliability and to meeting our environmental requirements. We can’t abandon that, but we are willing to explore solutions and would like to get back to the work of doing that.”  Daily wind curtailments ended this month as high water conditions subsided, Johnson said. From mid-May to July 10, BPA cut 97,557 megawatt-hours of wind generation, according to the agency’s website.  Wind generators said the curtailments which occurred in the overnight hours when power demand and prices were low were made for economic reasons and violated BPA’s contracts with generators.  “We tried for over a year to come to some agreement,” said Don Furman, a senior vice president for Iberdrola Renewables. “They were not willing to refrain from curtailing us for economic reasons.”  ",7202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-utilites-bonneville-ferc/bonneville-defends-wind-curtailment-in-ferc-filing-idUSTRE76J7U620110720

5,NEE,Power companies see mixed economic picture,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Three top U.S. power companies posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but drew a mixed picture of the nation’s economic outlook and demand for electricity.  Exelon Corp (EXC.N), which operates the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear power plants, raised its full-year profit forecast based on results in the first half, when it relied on strong residential and small-business demand to offset weak electricity usage from industrial customers.  NextEra Energy (NEE.N), the largest U.S. renewable energy producer, said its earnings benefited from greater demand at its Florida Power & Light utility and stronger output from its wind farms, but warned of uncertainty ahead.  “The economic recovery in Florida appears to continue to take hold, but the progress is slow and uneven,” Chief Financial Officer Armando Pimentel Jr. told a conference call.  Still, Southern Co (SO.N), which is trying to build the first U.S. nuclear power reactor in decades, said demand had increased in its markets.  “The industrial sector continues to lead the economic recovery in the Southeast,” Chief Executive Thomas Fanning said in a release. “Our region is well-positioned for future expansion, and we are already seeing new business development in several parts of our service territory.”  The Atlanta-based company forecast third-quarter earnings of $1.02 a share and backed its full-year profit outlook of $2.48- $2.56 a share. Analysts were predicting a third-quarter profit of $1.07 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “This industrial recovery is very broad-based, with all major segments except for the housing-related segments of stone, clay, and glass and textiles experiencing year-over-year growth,” Chief Financial Officer Art Beattie said on a conference call with analysts.  Southern’s second-quarter profit increased 18 percent to $603.3 million, while revenue rose 7 percent to $4.52 billion.  Exelon’s quarterly profit rose 39 percent to $620 million. The company, which is seeking regulatory approvals to buy Constellation Energy Group CEG.N, raised its full-year forecast to between $4.05 and $4.25 per share from a prior range of $3.90 to $4.20.  Exelon forecast no growth in 2011 overall power demand from customers of its PECO utility in Pennsylvania and Commonwealth Edison customers in Illinois, largely because of moribund demand from its largest users.  NextEra’s profit jumped 39 percent to $580 million, even though extended refueling outages at its Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear power plants cut into its earnings. Its shares fell 1.09 percent.  Shares of Exelon were up 1 percent while those of Southern recouped losses to turn positive.

9,NEE,"New U.S. nuclear design, Vogtle units move forward","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Federal nuclear regulators have completed two safety reports that will allow the first new advanced nuclear power plant projects in the United States in three decades to move a step closer to reality, the agency said on Tuesday.  Westinghouse Electric said the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission will issue its final safety evaluation report for the amended AP1000 nuclear reactor design later this week after all technical issues were resolved.  The NRC action clears the way for the five-member commission to act on the final design certification needed before two U.S. utilities — Southern Co and SCANA Corp — can move forward with full-blown construction activity.  “We’re in the home stretch to receive final approval of the amended AP1000 design,” said Aris Candris, chief executive officer of Westinghouse Electric, which is majority owned by Toshiba Corp and Shaw Group.  “We’re happy that the NRC technical staff has approved the amended design and confident that the NRC commissioners will do the same so construction of AP1000 units can begin here in the U.S.,” Candris said in a statement.  Southern’s nuclear arm Tuesday also received the final safety evaluation report for its $14 billion proposed Vogtle 3 and 4 reactors in Georgia, the company said.  Three months ago, a delay in the AP1000 certification schedule seemed likely after NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko took the unusual step to issue a press release regarding unresolved technical issues between Westinghouse and the NRC staff.  Heightened concern about nuclear safety raised by Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami that destroyed reactors at the Fukushima plant also boosted nuclear opponents’ criticism of the AP1000 design and the NRC process.  The NRC, however, has ignored calls to delay decisions on new reactor designs until its Fukushima safety review process is completed.  For Southern Co, the NRC’s final safety report sets the stage for a hearing on its construction and operating license (COL) in the next few months before the commission votes to issue a license late this year or early next year.  “This is a significant step forward in the licensing process for the Vogtle project,” said Thomas Fanning, Southern’s chief executive, in a statement.  Last month, Fanning told analysts that if the COL was not finalized by year-end, Southern would seek an alternative regulatory path, known as “limited work” authority, to maintain its ambitious construction timeline to bring the first new Vogtle reactor online in 2016.  Other companies that want to build Westinghouse AP1000 reactors are Duke Energy Corp, NextEra Energy Inc, Progress Energy Inc and the Tennessee Valley Authority.  While Japan’s nuclear accident is expected to raise regulatory and operating costs for existing and new U.S. reactors, the biggest obstacle for a U.S. nuclear revival is the low cost of natural gas and the high cost of building new reactors, analysts at Standard & Poor’s said in a report.

17,NEE,GE calls for shut-down tests on reactors worldwide," * GE says problem could occur under limited conditions   * NRC says problem not an “immediate” safety issue   * Boiling-water design similar to GE reactors at Fukushima   By Jim Brumm   WILMINGTON, NC Sept 30 (Reuters) - GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy has warned operators of boiling water reactors (BWR) worldwide — including 35 in the U.S. — that the plants could fail to shut automatically during an earthquake, potentially risking the safety of the power plant.   In an event notification posted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this week, GE Hitachi told nuclear operators to conduct tests to determine what conditions would prevent the reactors from shutting safely during an earth quake.   GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is a venture between General Electric Co (GE.N) and Hitachi Limited (6501.T).   GE Hitachi spokesman Michael Tetuan said most nuclear plants could fix the problem by replacing fuel channels, if needed. A typical boiling water reactor has between 400 and 800 such channels.   The affected plants are of the same GE design as Japan’s Fukushima reactors which were crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in March.   GE said the probability of a reactor not shutting properly is very low. Because of the limited circumstances under which a unit might not shut automatically, NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said the issue “is not an immediate safety issue.”   He said GE’s notice is information the agency wants nuclear vendors to raise so that companies can respond.   Affected by the potential glitch are type 2-5 BWRs designed by General Electric and built between the late 1960s and the early 1990s.   In the U.S., 12 of those nuclear units are owned by Exelon Corp (EXC.N); five by Entergy Corp (ETR.N); and three by the Tennessee Valley Authority.   Other affected plants are owned by Constellation Energy Group CEG.N, Progress Energy PGN.N, Southern Co (SO.N), NextEra Energy (NEE.N), DTE Energy (DTE.N), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG.N), PPL Inc (PPL.N), Xcel Energy XEL.N, Energy Northwest and the Nebraska Public Power District.   GE Hitachi identified the problem in July 2010 and reported to the NRC last September, months before an earthquake-spawned tsunami crippled GE reactors in Japan.   U.S. reactors included are Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2; Fermi 2; Columbia; FitzPatrick; Pilgrim; Vermont Yankee; Grand Gulf; River Bend; Clinton; Oyster Creek; Dresden 2 and 3; LaSalle 1 and 2; Limerick 1 and 2; Peach Bottom 2 and 3; Quad Cities 1 and 2; Perry; Duane Arnold; Cooper; Monticello; Brunswick 1 and 2; Hope Creek; Hatch 1 and 2; and Browns Ferry 1, 2 and 3.   “We’ve proactively identified a very unique set of conditions in which a plant rarely operates where this is a concern,” Tetuan said. “With the guidance provided to our customers, they will be able to monitor potentially affected fuel channels and avoid a safety concern.”   Tetuan said the company also notified operators of BWRs located elsewhere.   The World Nuclear Association (WNA) website lists 53 BWRs outside the U.S., including 29 operating in Taiwan, Sweden, the Netherlands, Mexico, Japan, Italy, Germany and Finland.   The seven operating Japanese BWRs include Fukushima Daiichi 5 and 6 which were shut when the March earthquake hit.   GE Hitachi told the NRC the problem does not affect BWR/6 or ABWR - advanced boiling water reactor plants.

18,NEE,UPDATE 2-US doles out last of loan aid to solar projects," * Renewable energy loan program ends Friday  * More than $4 billion in aid doled out on last day  * Loan aid “solidifies” First Solar’s prospects-analyst  (Recasts, adds details about other projects, analyst comment)  By Ayesha Rascoe  WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday approved more than $4.7 billion in loan guarantees for major solar projects as the government closed out an incentive program embroiled in controversy over the bankruptcy of one of its biggest projects.  With the program’s statutory deadline approaching, the government finalized deals with First Solar (FSLR.O), SunPower Corp SPWRA.O, and Prologis Inc (PLD.N).  The government’s clean energy program has been at the center of a political firestorm since the high-profile collapse of Solyndra, a solar panel manufacturer that was the first company to receive backing from the program.  Still, the projects that received loan guarantees Friday differ from the Solyndra deal, which relied on the company’s ability to sell panels manufactured after its plant was completed.  Instead, both First Solar and SunPower received guarantees to build solar power plants, which need contracts to supply electricity to utilities for financing and therefore have a fixed revenue stream.  The government closed a deal to partially back $1.46 billion in loans for First Solar’s massive Desert Sunlight plant in Riverside County, California.  Once completed, the 550 megawatt plant, which could power more than 110,000 homes, will be one of the largest solar plants in the world.  First Solar also closed a deal for $646 million in backing for its 230 megawatt Antelope Valley solar plant, while SunPower received a $1.2 billion guarantee for its 250 megawatt California Valley Ranch plant.  With loan guarantees in hand, all three of the plants have already been sold.  First Solar said Exelon (EXC.N) bought the Antelope project. NextEra Energy, Inc (NEE.N) and GE (GE.N) Energy Financial Services have acquired the Desert Sunlight plant.  NRG Energy (NRG.N) has purchased the California Valley project, SunPower said Friday.  ‘BRUTAL’ PROCESS  The completion of the loan guarantees for industry stalwart First Solar will remove some uncertainty for investors in the aftermath of Solyndra’s bankruptcy.  “The difference is that First Solar’s is proven technology, Solyndra’s was not,” said Mark Bachman, an analyst at Auriga USA. “This solidifies the longer-term prospects; it would have been a huge negative if the government had not done this today,” Bachman said.  The FBI has been probing the collapse of Solyndra and Repbulicans have launched an investigation as they step up criticism of the Obama Administration’s handling of the program.  Republicans have complained that the department may be rushing to complete deals to meet the program’s deadline.  The department has strongly disputed these claims, saying any deal that is completed will be “fully vetted” following months of intense review.  Energy bankers and financiers have also said the department’s process to qualify for the loan guarantees was far more onerous and detailed than required by private banks.  “For the ones that went through the whole process, it’s been brutal,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. “The fact that there are still loan guarantees being finalized shows that Washington is not completely dysfunctional,” Molchanov said.  In addition to the SunPower and First Solar guarantees, the department finalized a partial guarantee for a $1.4 billion loan to support a project installing solar panels on industrial buildings. The project is owned by Prologis and backed by NRG Energy Inc.

21,NEE,NextEra revises dates to boost Fla. nuclear output,"* FP&L; says new capacity to save fuel costs, cut emissions * Work to add 450 MW set to be completed in 2013 HOUSTON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Florida Power & Light, a unit of NextEra Energy Inc , plans to complete work to increase the output at its 839-megawatt St. Lucie 1 nuclear reactor during an extended refueling outage set to begin next month, according to a state regulatory filing. The work is part of FP&L;’s larger effort, known as a nuclear “uprate,” to add 450 MW in capacity at four existing reactors at the Turkey Point and St. Lucie stations by 2013. FP&L;, the state’s largest electric utility, recently adjusted some of the outage dates to minimize an overlap between the planned nuclear outages and non-nuclear outages, utility officials said. Adding the 450 MW is now estimated to cost $2.48 billion, the company said, compared with FP&L;’s initial 2007 estimate of $1.5 billion for an increase of 400 MW. The increased output will supply 209,000 customers, save $4.8 billion in fuel costs over the project’s lifetime and cut carbon dioxide emissions in the state, said NextEra spokesman Michael Waldron. On Monday, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FP&L;’s request to recover about $196 million from customers next year for the uprate costs, as well as costs to develop two new reactors at Turkey Point expected to begin service in 2022-2023. “The vast majority of our request — about 90 percent — is dedicated to the uprate project,” Waldron said. In the filing, FP&L; said it plans to shut St. Lucie 1 on Nov. 26 to perform work to increase its output by 122 MW. The outage is expected to last 110 days, or until mid-to-late February. On Feb. 6, 2012, FP&L; plans to shut the 693-MW Turkey Point 3 reactor for 120 days to boost that unit’s output by 109 MW, the utility said in the filing. St. Lucie 2, also rated at 893 MW, is set to shut June 27, 2012, for 95 days for uprate work. The unit was shut for an extended period earlier this year for work that increased output by 29 MW due to a more efficient low-pressure rotor, the filing said. The extra 29 MW is helping to save $1 million per month in fuel costs, Waldron said. Next fall, the 693-MW Turkey Point 4 reactor is scheduled to shut Oct. 1 for 120 days for work to increase output by 109 MW, FP&L; told state regulators. To increase the output of reactors, operators install new pipes, valves and pumps, along with heat exchangers, new electric transformers, turbines and generators. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is currently reviewing FP&L;’s uprate applications, which were filed in 2010 and early 2011.",10262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nuclear-florida/nextera-revises-dates-to-boost-fla-nuclear-output-idUSN1E79O29H20111026

24,NEE,NextEra's Fla Port Everglades natgas plant advances,"HOUSTON, March 28 (Reuters) - State regulators have approved a plan from NextEra Energy’s Florida utility to build a 1,277-megawatt, natural gas-fired plant at its Port Everglades energy center in Broward County, replacing 50-year-old oil and gas units. The Florida Public Service Commission this week determined there is need for Florida Power & Light (FPL) to dismantle four aging gas units, totaling 1,200 MW, at the Port Everglades facility and replace units with newer combined-cycle technology that burns less fuel to produce the same amount of electricity and reduce air emissions. The new facility is expected to save FPL customers more than $400 million in fuel costs over 30 years. Once FPL obtains an air permit and other regulatory approvals, construction at Port Everglades is expected to begin in 2014 with commercial operation seen in 2016, an FPL spokesman said. The $1.2 billion Port Everglades project is FPL’s third modernization of a 1960s-era gas plant. In Brevard County, FPL is replacing and expanding its Cape Canaveral plant by constructing a 1,250-MW combined-cycle gas plant to replace an 800-MW plant at a cost of more than $1 billion. The new units are set to begin producing power in mid-2013. In 2014, the new 1,250-MW combined-cycle units at FPL’s Riviera Beach plant in Palm Beach County are expected to enter service.",3282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-porteverglades/nexteras-fla-port-everglades-natgas-plant-advances-idUSL2E8ESWMV20120328

29,NEE,TEXT-Fitch rates NextEra Energy Inc,"May 3 Fitch Ratings has assigned ‘A-‘ ratings to NextEra Energy Inc.’s (NEE)  issue of $600 million of equity units and to NextEra Energy Capital Holdings’ (Capital Holdings) $600 million series E senior unsecured debentures due June 1, 2017. The current Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for NEE and Capital Holdings are ‘A-‘, and the Rating Outlook for both is Stable. 	 	 Each Equity Unit will consist of a forward equity purchase contract and series E	 debentures of Capital Holdings. Purchase contracts will obligate the investors 	 to buy NEE common shares on or before June 1, 2015. The number of shares to be 	 bought will be determined by the applicable market value of NEE common stock 	 relative to a reference price and a threshold appreciation price. The applicable	 market value of NEE common stock will be based on  the market price of NEE’s 	 common stock over a recent reference period. NEE has the right to defer contract	 adjustment payments with respect to the equity units at any time through the 	 conversion date, but has no option to defer interest on the debentures. The 	 debentures issued in connection with the Equity Units are unconditionally 	 guaranteed by Capital Holdings’ parent, NEE. Consistent with Fitch’s hybrid 	 rating criteria, all of the units’ value will be allocated to debt in Fitch’s 	 review of the corporate capital structure, due to the senior ranking of the 	 debentures used as collateral for the transaction.	 	 NEE’s ratings are supported by sound liquidity and satisfactory cash flow from 	 two businesses: its utility subsidiary Florida Power & Light (FPL) and Capital 	 Holdings’ non-regulated energy subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources (Energy 	 Resources). NEE’s ratings reflect a shifting business mix through 2015 towards 	 regulated and highly contracted cash flows driven by significant rate base 	 growth opportunities at FPL, completion of regulated Lone Star transmission line	 in 2013, weak wholesale prices that reduces the contribution of non-contracted 	 generation assets, and rising contribution from solar and Canadian wind 	 investments that partially offset the decline in U.S. wind investments due to 	 the 2012 expiration of tax subsidies.	 	 Fitch expects NEE’s cash flows from stable utility-type sources to grow during 	 2012 to 2015. At FPL, recovering retail sales and future rate cases to 	 incorporate new rate base investments will produce revenue uplift. At Capital 	 Holdings, completion of new Texas electric transmission assets will result in 	 predictable tariff revenues. Fitch forecasts that regulated businesses will 	 contribute more than 55% of NEE’s EBITDA for the next several years. Within 	 Energy Resources, the contribution of long-term contracted generation assets 	 will increase. Fitch expects contractual sources to drive another 25 - 30% of 	 NEE’s consolidated EBITDA over the next few years.	 	 NEE’s credit metrics, as reported, show more leverage than its ‘A-‘ peers. 	 However, Fitch considers several factors that mitigate debt leverage. First, 	 sales at Energy Resources are supported by off-take contracts for a longer term 	 than most other peers (over 90% hedged over 2012 - 13). This provides NEE with 	 greater insulation to commodity price movements as compared to other hybrid 	 peers. Second, NEE’s non-utility generation is concentrated in renewable and 	 nuclear resources with favorable environmental characteristics. Finally, about 	 $5.7 billion of consolidated debt (as of Dec. 31, 2011) is made up of project 	 finance loans that have limited or no corporate recourse. 	 	 Fitch’s adjusted consolidated credit metrics for NEE incorporates off-credit 	 treatment to limited recourse debt at Energy Resources. This reflects Fitch’s 	 assumption that NEE would walk away from these projects in the event of 	 financial deterioration, including those projects where a differential 	 membership interest has been sold. Fitch accordingly excludes the debt, interest	 expense, EBITDA contribution and tax attributes from such projects and includes 	 only the distributable cash flow. 	 	 Positive rating actions on NEE and Capital Holdings appear unlikely at this 	 time. 	 	 Downward rating pressure could result from: 	 	 Deterioration in Florida Regulation: Any change in current FPSC regulatory 	 policies or adverse outcome in the pending rate case at FPL would adversely 	 affect NEE’s and FPL’s ratings. 	 	 Increase in Business Risk Profile: A change in strategy to invest in more 	 speculative assets, non-contracted renewable assets or a lower proportion of 	 cash flow under long-term contracts would increase business risk and could 	 result in lower ratings for NEE. The high level of capital expenditures at both 	 FPL and Capital Holdings creates completion risks, as well as funding risk. 	 	 Aggressive Financial Strategy: Any deterioration in credit measures that result 	 from higher use of leverage or outsized return of capital to shareholders could 	 lead to negative rating actions. 	 	 Change in Tax Laws or Regulations: Changes in tax rules that reduce NEE’s 	 ability to monetize its accumulated production tax credits, investment tax 	 credits, and accumulated tax losses carried forward would be adverse to NEE’s 	 cash flow credit measures.",5032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA653020120503
30,NEE,"FPL opens reinforced hurricane ""command center""","RIVIERA BEACH, Florida (Reuters) - Twenty years after Hurricane Andrew raked the state, Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility, dedicated a new $3.8 million storm “command center” on Friday and announced energy-grid reinforcements that officials said will boost emergency planning. FPL President Eric Silagy said the new 10,000-square-foot, concrete-hardened center, built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, is designed to be the brains of the utility’s storm-preparedness and response efforts, if another storm like Andrew sets Florida in its sights. It puts under one roof key FPL functions that have historically been carried out in disparate facilities, he said. Among them: systems for tracking power outages, restoring electricity to customers, prioritizing power restoration to critical facilities, such as hospitals, police and fire departments, dispatching response and repair crews, as well as media communications. Utility officials also detailed $44 million in FPL upgrades to power lines, infrastructure and energy-supply and backup systems that have been put in place since the last major storm - Hurricane Wilma - struck the region in October 2005. “We at FPL plan and drill for a big storm all year long and this is the culmination of that - what’s going on today,” said Silagy, noting that FPL is inaugurating the new center by conducting a mock hurricane drill this week designed to test its systems and personnel before the year’s storm season officially begins on June 1. “There is no silver bullet, there’s no quick fix, there’s no system out there that’s storm proof ... but this is part of an ongoing effort,” he said. During a press event that allowed public officials and media to tour the new facility, utility officials said this week’s storm drill - built around a fictional Category 3 “Hurricane Marina” - is allowing some 3,000 FPL employees to go through a “dry run” of the new facility. Mike Sole, FPL vice president for state governmental affairs, said the training has provided some lessons, as have previous storms that will help the utility improve its preparedness and response. Sole would not say whether the center and FPL grid upgrades, would improve FPL’s ability to restore power lost to customers in a storm more quickly and effectively than in the past, but noted “with each storm there’s a lot of lessons learned, and new technologies will allow us to better monitor activities in the field.” FPL has come in for harsh criticism in the past from some of its 4.6 million customers over the speed of post-storm repairs, as well as rate increases.

Since the last major hurricane hit Florida in 2005, FPL has taken a number of steps to improve its storm preparedness. Among them, FPL’s natural gas-powered facilities - comprising 73 percent of the utility’s sources - now use gas piped in from other states instead of through pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico which are more vulnerable to storms like Wilma, said FPL spokesman Neil Nissan. They also have 72 hours of backup fuel stored on site that would allow the plants to continue operating at full power, in the event of an interruption of gas supplies. About 21 percent of FPL’s power comes from its nuclear plants; the rest use oil and solar. FPL is a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc. In the past five years, more than two-thirds of FPL’s new power-line construction has been underground; in South Florida, underground power lines constitute 90 percent of new construction. Overall, about 40 percent of FPL lines are underground, which leaves them less vulnerable to wind damage. In the past year, FPL has created a Web-based “power tracker” system, allowing customers to monitor - in real time - power outages and restoration efforts in its service territory. Irene White, FPL senior direct of operations and support, noted FPL has at least 230,000 new customers who were not in Florida during the heavy 2005 hurricane season.

31,NEE,"CORRECTED-RPT-FPL opens reinforced hurricane ""command center""","By Nick Tate RIVIERA BEACH, Fla., May 11 (Reuters) - Twenty years after Hurricane Andrew raked the state, Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility, dedicated a new $3.8 million storm “command center” on Friday and announced  energy-grid reinforcements that officials said will boost emergency planning. FPL President Eric Silagy said the new 10,000-square-foot, concrete-hardened center, built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, is designed to be the brains of the utility’s storm-preparedness and response efforts, if another storm like Andrew sets Florida in its sights. It puts under one roof key FPL functions that have historically been carried out in disparate facilities, he said. Among them: systems for tracking power outages, restoring electricity to customers, prioritizing power restoration to critical facilities, such as hospitals, police and fire departments, dispatching response and repair crews, as well as media communications. Utility officials also detailed $44 million in FPL upgrades to power lines, infrastructure and energy-supply and backup systems that have been put in place since the last major storm - Hurricane Wilma - struck the region in October 2005. “We at FPL plan and drill for a big storm all year long and this is the culmination of that - what’s going on today,” said Silagy, noting that FPL is inaugurating the new center by conducting a mock hurricane drill this week designed to test its systems and personnel before the year’s storm season officially begins on June 1. “There is no silver bullet, there’s no quick fix, there’s no system out there that’s storm proof ... but this [command center] is part of an ongoing effort,” he said. During a press event that allowed public officials and media to tour the new facility, utility officials said this week’s storm drill - built around a fictional Category 3 “Hurricane Marina” - is allowing some 3,000 FPL employees to go through a “dry run” of the new facility. Mike Sole, FPL vice president for state governmental affairs, said the training has provided some lessons, as have previous storms that will help the utility improve its preparedness and response. Sole would not say whether the center and FPL grid upgrades, would improve FPL’s ability to restore power lost to customers in a storm more quickly and effectively than in the past, but noted “with each storm there’s a lot of lessons learned, and new technologies will allow us to better monitor activities in the field.” FPL has come in for harsh criticism in the past from some of its 4.6 million customers over the speed of post-storm repairs, as well as rate increases.

33,NEE,"BrightSource, NextEra buy California solar projects","* Insolvent Solar Millennium developed projects * Plants can generate 1,000 MW and 500 MW of power * Other development projects still to be sold June 29 (Reuters) - BrightSource Energy and NextEra Energy Inc have bought two large solar power projects in California from insolvent German renewable power company Solar Millennium AG. Solar Millennium said in a statement that the projects were sold in an auction concluded at the end of June as part of U.S. Chapter 11 insolvency proceedings. Florida power company NextEra bought the planned 1,000-megawatt (MW) Blythe project and BrightSource bought the planned 500-MKW Palen project. Both said they wanted to continue with the projects in the near future, Solar Millennium said. Officials at BrightSource and NextEra were not immediately available for comment. The auction generated $80 million dollars and the sales will not be implemented until certain closing conditions have been fulfilled, which is expected to be in July or August, Solar Millennium said. An initial sale of the projects failed when the buyer, Solarhybrid AG, another German solar power company, became insolvent. Solar Millennium said it was still looking for buyers for its proposed 500-MW Amargosa solar power project in Nevada and 250-MW Ridgecrest solar power project in California. In 2009, units of Solar Millennium and California oil company Chevron Corp proposed the Blythe project in Riverside County about 225 miles (362 km) east-southeast of Los Angeles, according to the project filing on the California Energy Commission website. Blythe will have four 250-MW concentrated solar thermal plants with a total capacity of 1,000 MW and will occupy about 5,950 acres. Also in 2009, Solar Millennium and Chevron proposed the Palen project in Riverside County about 175 miles east-southeast of Los Angeles. Palen will have two 250-MW concentrated solar thermal plants with a total capacity of 500 MW. The developers sought a right of way grant from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management of about 5,200 acres. Solar Millennium also proposed the Ridgecrest project in 2009. The project is in the northern Mojave Desert in Kern County, about 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles, according to the filing. Ridgecrest will consist of a single 250-MW solar thermal plant. The project will occupy about 1,440 acres.",6292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-brightsource-nextera-solar/brightsource-nextera-buy-california-solar-projects-idUSL2E8HT9KW20120629

37,NEE,TEXT-Fitch rates NextEra Energy Capital Holdings,"Sept 7 - Fitch Ratings has assigned ‘A-‘ ratings to NextEra Energy Capital Holdings’ (Capital Holdings) $650 million series F senior unsecured debentures due Sept. 1, 2017. The current Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Capital Holdings and for its parent, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE), is ‘A-‘,  and the Rating Outlook for both entities is Stable. NEE provides full guarantee  of Capital Holdings’ debt and hybrids.  NEE is issuing 13 million equity units with an initial stated amount of $50 per  unit. Each equity unit comprises a forward equity purchase contract issued by  NEE and a beneficial ownership interest in series F senior unsecured debentures  of Capital Holdings. The debentures issued in connection with the equity units  serve to collateralize the investor’s forward stock purchase obligation.   The series F debentures are unconditionally guaranteed by NEE. NEE has the right to defer contract adjustment payments with respect to the equity units at any  time through the conversion date, but has no option to defer interest on the  debentures. Consistent with Fitch’s hybrid rating criteria, all of the units’  value will be allocated to debt in Fitch’s review of the corporate capital  structure, due to the senior ranking of the debentures used as collateral for  the transaction.   NEE’s ratings are supported by sound liquidity and satisfactory cash flow from  two businesses: its utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL), and Capital Holdings’ non-regulated energy subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources (Energy  Resources). NEE’s ratings reflect a shifting business mix through 2015 towards  regulated and highly contracted cash flows driven by significant rate base  growth opportunities at FPL, completion of the regulated Lone Star transmission  line in 2013, weak wholesale prices that reduces the contribution of  non-contracted generation assets, and rising contribution from solar and  Canadian wind investments that partially offset the decline in U.S. wind  investments due to the 2012 expiration of tax subsidies.   Fitch expects NEE’s cash flows from stable utility-type sources to grow during  2012 to 2015. At FPL, recovering retail sales and potential future rate  increases to incorporate new rate base investments will produce revenue uplift.  At Capital Holdings, completion of new Texas electric transmission assets will  result in predictable tariff revenues. Fitch forecasts that regulated businesses will contribute more than 55% of NEE’s EBITDA for the next several years. Within Energy Resources, the contribution of long-term contracted generation assets  will increase. Fitch expects contractual sources to drive another 25%-30% of  NEE’s consolidated EBITDA over the next few years.   NEE’s credit metrics, as reported, show more leverage than its ‘A-‘ peers.  However, Fitch considers several factors that mitigate debt leverage. First,  sales at Energy Resources are supported by off-take contracts for a longer term  than most other peers (over 90% hedged over 2012-13). This provides NEE with  greater insulation to commodity price movements as compared to other hybrid  peers. Second, NEE’s non-utility generation is concentrated in renewable and  nuclear resources with favorable environmental characteristics. Finally, about  $5.7 billion of consolidated debt (as of Dec. 31, 2011) is made up of project  finance loans that have limited or no corporate recourse.   Fitch’s adjusted consolidated credit metrics for NEE incorporate off-credit  treatment to limited recourse debt at Energy Resources. This reflects Fitch’s  assumption that NEE would walk away from these projects in the event of  financial deterioration, including those projects where a differential  membership interest has been sold. Fitch accordingly excludes the debt, interest expense, EBITDA contribution and tax attributes from such projects and includes  only the distributable cash flow.   Positive rating actions on NEE and Capital Holdings appear unlikely at this  time.   Downward rating pressure could result from:   Deterioration in Florida Regulation: Any change in current FPSC regulatory  policies or adverse FPSC decision in the pending rate case at FPL would  adversely affect NEE’s and FPL’s ratings.   Increase in Business Risk Profile: A change in strategy to invest in more  speculative assets, non-contracted renewable assets or a lower proportion of  cash flow under long-term contracts would increase business risk and could  result in lower ratings for NEE. The high level of capital expenditures at both  FPL and Capital Holdings creates completion risks, as well as funding risk.   Aggressive Financial Strategy: Any deterioration in credit measures that result  from higher use of leverage or outsized return of capital to shareholders could  lead to negative rating actions.   Change in Tax Laws or Regulations: Changes in tax rules that reduce NEE’s  ability to monetize its accumulated production tax credits, investment tax  credits, and accumulated tax losses carried forward would be adverse to NEE’s  cash flow credit measures.",9072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA486420120907

40,NEE,Maine earthquake causes no damage at New Hampshire nuclear plant,"Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. power company NextEra Energy Inc  said a moderate earthquake in southwest Maine late Tuesday caused no damage at its nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, which has been shut for a planned refueling outage since about Sept. 17. The moderate earthquake struck Maine on Tuesday shortly after 7 p.m. (2300 GMT), according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It was first reported as a 4.5 magnitude quake centered near Lake Arrowhead, but the USGS revised the quake’s magnitude to 4.6 and finally down to 4.0. In a report to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NextEra, of Juno Beach, Florida, said it declared an unusual event when the earthquake was felt at the plant. An unusual event is the lowest of the NRC’s four emergency classifications. The plant exited the unusual event after several hours following walk downs that indicated no reports of damage at the station. NextEra said in the report, the unit was exiting the refueling outage. Reuters expected the unit to exit the outage sometime this week.

41,NEE,"UPDATE 2-NextEra to add more than 1,200 MW of U.S. wind power","* Wind portfolio to top 10,000 MW by end of 2012 * Energy resources unit to grow in 2013 * Florida power plant modernizations underway By Scott DiSavino Oct 24 (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc expects to complete more than 1,200 megawatts (MW) of wind power capacity in the United States in the fourth quarter, the Florida power company said on Wednesday. By the end of 2012, NextEra Chief Financial Officer Moray Dewhurst said on a third-quarter earnings conference call, the company’s wind power portfolio will top 10,000 MW. Dewhurst also earnings at the company’s Energy Resources unit would rise 10 percent to 15 percent to a range of $740 million to $780 million in 2013. In 2012, Dewhurst said, Energy Resources’ financial performance was hampered by the continued impact of reduced power from the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire and disappointing mild market conditions in Texas, where the company has a lot of wind resources. He said the energy portfolio was roughly 95 percent hedged in 2013 and 93 percent in 2014. At its Florida Power and Light (FPL) unit, the company said it was continuing the construction of both the Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach modernization projects in Florida, which were both on schedule and on budget. NextEra expects the new 1,250-MW Cape Canaveral natural gas plant to enter service in mid-2013, the company said on its website. The old Cape Canaveral was a 792-MW oil/natural gas-fired plant built in the 1960s. The company expects the new 1,250-MW Riviera Beach natural gas plant to enter service in 2014. The old Riviera Beach was a 565-MW oil/natural gas-fired plant that was also built in the 1960s. FPL’s third Florida modernization project is under development at the Port Everglades plant and should enter service in mid-2016, Dewhurst said. The new 1,277-MW Port Everglades natural gas plant would cost about $1 billion, the company said on its website. There are four large oil/natural gas-fired units at Port Everglades built in the 1960s with a combined capacity of 1,205 MW. And, Dewhurst said, FPL’s upgrade of the four reactors at the St Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear power plants in Florida should be complete by the spring, adding more than 500 MW of additional generating capacity. In the past, the company estimated the cost of the nuclear upgades at $2.95 billion to $3.15 billion. Dewhurst also said the company planned to add roughly 900 MW of solar power through 2016.",10242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-earnings/update-2-nextera-to-add-more-than-1200-mw-of-u-s-wind-power-idUSL1E8LO3K920121024

45,NEE,"Florida approves $540 mln in new nuclear costs for NextEra, Duke","* Florida law allows early recovery of nuclear costs * FPL says Turkey Point expansion still cost-effective * Crystal River concessions offset Duke’s recovery charges HOUSTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Florida regulators this week approved requests from the state’s two largest utilities to charge customers $540 million to boost nuclear generation in the state - $417 million to increase output at existing reactors and $123 million tied to new reactors that won’t come online for a decade or more. The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved separate requests by NextEra Energy’s Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility, for $397 million in extra revenue to pay for increased output, called “uprates,” at three reactors and to develop two new reactors. The PSC also voted to allow Duke Energy’s Progress Energy Florida, the state’s second-largest utility, to charge an additional $143 million t o recover its nuclear costs, including $102.7 million for Progress’ two new proposed reactors. The commission’s action may mean higher bills next year for FPL customers, while bills for Progress’ customers are likely to fall due to concessions related to Duke’s damaged Crystal River nuclear reactor, according to the commission. Florida is one of a handful of U.S. states with laws that encourage new nuclear plants by allowing utilities to recover certain costs ahead of plants coming online since nuclear licensing and construction can take many years. Florida’s 2006 law also lets utilities recover early costs to expand output at existing reactors. Costly nuclear plants, however, now face stiff competition from natural gas-fired plants which have become more economical as record gas production has cut the fuel’s price outlook and historic volatility. Lower growth in U.S. power demand and safety concerns after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan have also reduced industry expectations for new U.S. reactors. An environmental group challenging Florida’s law allowing early nuclear cost recovery criticized the commission’s actions and labeled the costs a “nuclear tax” for p o wer supply that may never be built. Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said the commission’s acceptance of P SC s taff recommendations is “an unfortunate trend of rubber-stamping that we have seen year after year in spite of major obstacles and pitfalls that have made new reactor proposals in Florida less and less feasible.” Most of the amount the PSC approved for Florida Power & Light’s (FPL) 4.6 million customers will pay for work to boost the output at the utility’s existing nuclear plants by an estimated 526 to 536 megawatts. The PSC approved an additional $246 million revenue to pay for uprates completed at three reactors: two at the St. Lucie plant on Hutchinson Island, 110 miles (177 km) north of Miami; and one unit at the Turkey Point nuclear station in Florida City, 25 miles south of Miami. Work is ongoing to add capacity at Turkey Point 4. The increase translates into an extra $2.59 in base rates per 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electric use on FPL monthly bills  next year, regulators said in a release. Overall, FPL pegged the cost of adding the 500-plus MW at between $2.95 billion and $3.15 billion, or more than $5,500 per kilowatt. The high capital costs for the nuclear uprate will be offset over the years by lower fuel costs. FPL customers will save $114 million in fuel costs in the first year and $3.8 billion over the life of the plants due to the increased output, said commissioner Eduardo Balbis. “Customers can start realizing these benefits,” said Balbis. “This is something we need to applaud.” In addition, the commission approved FPL’s request to recover $151.5 million under the 2006 nuclear cost recovery statute. That includes $131 million for the uprate work and $20.3 million for development of two new reactors at Turkey Point. That translates into $1.65 per month for each 1,000 kwh used by FPL customers, a utility spokesman said, 55 cents below the current charge. While the two nuclear related charges total $4.28 per 1,000 kwh, other pending PSC rate action may mean FPL bills rise by less than that amount in mid-2013. In filings, FPL said its plan to build Turkey Point Units 6 and 7, totaling 2,200 megawatts, will cost between $12.8 billion and $18.7 billion. Completion of the units could occur in 2022 and 2023, the company said. FPL told regulators the new Turkey Point reactors remain cost-effective compared to gas-fired generation despite falling gas prices. However, PSC staff noted that the nuclear project might not be economical if capital costs “approach” FPL’s high estimate of $5,200 per kw and gas prices remain low. At Duke’s Progress Florida unit which has 1.6 million customers, the PSC approved a nuclear recovery increase of $143 million. That includes $102.7 million for Progress’ two proposed reactors in Levy County and $40 million to expand output at the Crystal River 3 reactor in Citrus County, even though it has been shut since 2009 due to a series of cracks found in the containment building walls. Duke executives have not decided whether to repair or retire the Crystal River plant due to the extensive damage. The nuclear costs translate into a $4.79 per 1,000 kwh per month increase for Progress Florida customers, but the amount was more than offset by other regulatory action to include potential insurance proceeds covering lost output from Crystal River, deferral of some uprate costs and overall cheaper gas. The latest estimate to build the 2,200-MW Levy station is $24.1 billion, with startup dates in 2024 and 2025, according to Progress filings.",11292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nuclear-florida/florida-approves-540-mln-in-new-nuclear-costs-for-nextera-duke-idUSL1E8MT7ID20121129
46,NEE,"Seabrook, NH, reactor safe despite flawed concrete -NRC","* NRC says no immediate threat at Seabrook reactor * NextEra expects test results on concrete in 2014 * NRC to inspect plant again in early 2013 Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. nuclear regulators said on Tuesday concrete degradation at NextEra Energy Inc’s  1,247-megawatt (MW) Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire did not pose an immediate risk to the public or environment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, has told NextEra it must determine the future implications of the degradation and develop a plan to fix it, said Neil Sheehan, an NRC spokesman. NextEra identified the degradation in below grade concrete structures at Seabrook in June 2009 and confirmed the problem was from alkali silica reaction, or ASR, in August 2010. ASR is a chemical reaction that can cause expansion and cracking in concrete, potentially resulting in structural problems. The NRC said this was the first time ASR has affected a nuclear power plant. ASR has not caused structural problems at Seabrook, in part because the concrete walls are reinforced with rebar, the NRC said. In its latest report issued Monday, Sheehan said the NRC conducted three weeks of on-site inspections and four months of in-office reviews to assess the adequacy of actions taken by NextEra to address the problem. Based on these assessments, the NRC decided to close five of 11 items in a Confirmatory Action Letter (CAL) the agency issued to NextEra last May regarding regulatory commitments the company made to address the concrete degradation. Sheehan said the remaining six confirmatory action letter items will be reviewed during another inspection the agency plans to perform in early 2013. “We have said previously that no final NRC decision on the plant’s license renewal application will be made until we fully understand and approve of NextEra’s plans in response to Seabrook concrete degradation,” Sheehan said. Seabrook entered service in 1990. Even though it is one of the newest reactors in the nation, NextEra applied with the NRC to renew the plant’s original 40-year license for another 20 years in June 2010. The original license does not expire until 2030. Although the NRC has completed several non-contentious license renewals at other plants in less than two years, the NRC staff in the Seabrook case still has several reports to complete before the staff can make a recommendation to the commission on the application. NextEra has told the NRC it does not expect to get results of testing of the degradation from the concrete laboratory at the University of Texas until 2014, so the NRC could not make a decision on the license renewal until at least that time. That 2014 timeframe also fits with the NRC’s self-imposed moratorium in August on issuing new licenses until the agency reviews the environmental impact of storing spent nuclear fuel at temporary sites, like nuclear power plants, due in part to a lack of a permanent waste storage facility.

48,NEE,NextEra buys more Siemens H-Class turbines for Florida plants,"Dec 18 (Reuters) - Florida Power & Light Co contracted with German multinational Siemens AG to supply the utility with three next-generation H-Class gas turbines to modernize its Port Everglades natural gas-fired power plant in Florida. FPL, a unit of U.S. power company NextEra Energy Inc  of Florida, expects the new units at the 1,277-megawatt Port Everglades plant to enter service in 2016. Siemens said in a release on Monday that it expected FPL to generate power at the new Port Everglades plant using about one-third less fuel per megawatt hour than at the existing facility due to the efficient H-Class turbine technology. NextEra said on its website that the new Port Everglades facility would cost about $1 billion. Siemens said the new plant should produce more than $400 million in net savings for FPL customers during its 30-year operational life, over and above the cost of construction. Siemens said the Port Everglades order followed a contract in 2010 to supply six H-Class turbines for the new 1,250-MW units at FPL’s Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants in Florida. Siemens said the first of these previously ordered H-Class turbines was already started on Nov. 21 at the Cape Canaveral plant, which is expected to enter commercial service in 2013. FPL’s new Riviera Beach plant is scheduled to enter service in 2014. Siemens said the H-Class gas turbine made power plant history in May 2011 when it achieved world-record efficiency of 60.75 percent at a combined-cycle power plant in Irsching, Germany. Worldwide, Siemens said it had now sold 20 H-Class turbines. The company did not say in the release how much it costs to buy an H-Class turbine.",12182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-siemens-nextera-turbine/nextera-buys-more-siemens-h-class-turbines-for-florida-plants-idUSL1E8NI2PU20121218

51,NEE,NextEra seeks new natgas pipeline for Florida -CFO,"* First phase of pipeline could enter service in 2017 * Pipeline to run from Alabama to central Florida * FPL sees three new Florida power plants on by 2016 By Scott DiSavino Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. power company NextEra Energy Inc  is seeking proposals to build a natural gas pipeline to serve the growing demand for the fuel in Florida, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday. “As customer demand grows and fleets across the state shift to more natural gas-fired generation, Florida’s natural gas needs will increase significantly,” NextEra CFO Moray Dewhurst told analysts on a conference call following the release of fourth-quarter earnings. In December, NextEra’s Florida Power and Light (FPL) unit issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a third major gas pipeline to serve Florida. The proposed “Southeast Pipeline” will provide 400,000 million British thermal units (mmBtu) per day of gas capacity for Florida beginning in 2017, and an additional 200,000 mmBtu per day beginning in May 2020, Dewhurst said. He said the pipeline will consist of two segments and run about 700 miles in total. The first, or upstream portion, will run from western Alabama to a new hub in Central Florida that will interconnect with all major existing Florida pipelines. “This portion will access the abundant onshore natural gas resources, helping reduce reliance on off-shore resources which can be disrupted by tropical weather,” Dewhurst said. The second, or downstream segment, will run from the Central Florida hub to connect with FPL’s giant Martin County oil/gas power plant. Dewhurst said the company had not yet determined total capital expenditures for the pipeline project, noting the routes will be selected and proposed by companies submitting bids. As part of the process, Dewhurst said NextEra expects to offer a self-build option for the downstream portion and is prepared to consider investing in support of the selected upstream option to help speed things up. He said the company expects to begin evaluating proposals during the second quarter of 2013, with construction expected to be completed in 2017. NextEra has said Florida uses more gas for electricity than any U.S. state other than Texas, with about 60 percent of power generated by plants that burn natural gas. But unlike Texas, Florida has minimal gas production, no storage capabilities and only two major pipelines to deliver the fuel that powers the peninsula. The company said building a pipeline will generate thousands of jobs during construction and millions of dollars in new tax revenue for local schools and governments. In 2012, Dewhurst said FPL’s fossil fuel fleet reached a record level of efficiency, bringing the system-wide heat rate down to 7,669 British thermal units (BTU) per kilowatt hour, or roughly 24 percent better than the industry average of 10,040 BTUs per kilowatt hour. In 2012, he said the company invested more than $4 billion at FPL with more than $830 million of this associated with the modernization of three old oil and gas-fired power plants in Florida into efficient combined cycle gas plants. The Cape Canaveral project is currently on schedule and under budget, with an expected in-service date of June 2013. The Riviera Beach modernization is also on time and on budget, with an expected in-service state of June 2014, he said. FPL expects the modernized Port Everglades plant to enter service in June 2016, with demolition of the existing plant planned for the second quarter of this year, he said. On the nuclear front, he said FPL has completed three of  four planned extended power upgrades, investing roughly $3 billion to date and adding about 395 MW of clean, emissions-free energy to the fleet. The final upgrade at Turkey Point 4 is expected to come online in the spring of 2013 and add about 120 MW of capacity, he said.",1292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-naturalgas/nextera-seeks-new-natgas-pipeline-for-florida-cfo-idUSL1N0AY99F20130129
52,NEE,NextEra unit finishes upgrade of Florida Turkey Point 4 reactor,"April 19 (Reuters) - Florida Power and Light (FPL), a unit of NextEra Energy Inc, completed the upgrade of the 693-megawatt (MW) Turkey Point 4 reactor in Florida when the unit returned to service on Thursday. FPL said the return of the unit marked the end of a five-year, multibillion dollar upgrade of the Turkey Point and St Lucie nuclear plants in Florida. The company has said it expected to spend between $2.95 billion and $3.15 billion on the nuclear upgrade project. FPL said the upgrades added more than 500 MW of new capacity to the plants, which is enough to power more than 300,000 Florida homes. The upgrades of Turkey Point 3 and St Lucie 1 and 2 were completed in 2012. FPL said the upgrades, known as “extended power uprates,” surpassed the company’s initial projection of 399 MW. The company said an average of about 3,500 people worked on the project every day during 2012 alone. The company also said the upgrades were expected to reduce emissions and save customers billions on fossil fuel costs, with more than $100 million in savings in the first year of operation alone. Florida regulators approved of FPL’s plan to upgrade the units in 2007. Florida, like some other states in the U.S. Southeast, allows power companies to recover costs from nuclear upgrades during construction, which prevents certain development, construction and interest costs from compounding, FPL said. FPL said this so-called “construction work in progress” cost produces hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for its 4.6 million Florida customers over time. In 2013, FPL said its typical 1,000-kilowatt-hour residential monthly bill is about $95, of which the nuclear cost recovery clause represents $1.65 - about 5 cents a day. FPL said nearly 90 percent of 2013 nuclear funding is related to the completion of the upgrades, with the remainder paying for continued development and licensing of two new reactors that could be built at Turkey Point. In 2014, FPL said it plans to reduce its nuclear cost recovery to less than 50 cents on a typical customer’s monthly bill, or less than 2 cents a day. The company said it will file its official 2014 projections with Florida regulators in May.",4192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-turkeypoint/nextera-unit-finishes-upgrade-of-florida-turkey-point-4-reactor-idUSL2N0D61M920130419
53,NEE,NextEra to sell its oil-fired power plants in Maine,"April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. power company NextEra Energy Inc  said on Tuesday its NextEra Energy Resources unit will sell its oil-fired power plants in Maine, which have a generating capacity of 796 megawatts (MW). The company decided to sell the plants to reduce its exposure to merchant pricing and recognized a charge of roughly $41 million, NextEra said in its first quarter earnings release. The Maine plants include the company’s stake in the 822-MW Wyman plant and the 18-MW Cape Gas Turbine. Last month, NextEra sold 351 MW of hydropower assets in Maine and New Hampshire to a unit of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP. NextEra also said it signed long-term power purchase agreements during the first quarter for 225 MW of new U.S. wind projects and 40 MW of solar projects. NextEra said it sees the potential to invest $1 billion to $3 billion to add about 500 to 1,500 MW of U.S. wind assets through 2014 and about $1 billion to add up to 300 MW of solar power through 2016. Nextera Energy Resources operates about 18,800 MW of generation, including about 10,100 MW of wind and over 300 MW of solar power. At its Florida Power and Light (FPL) utility unit in Florida, NextEra said it completed the 1,200-MW Cape Canaveral natural gas-fired power plant on budget and ahead of schedule last week. The plant cost about $900 million to build. In addition, FPL said its 1,250-MW Riviera Beach gas-fired modernization project was on schedule and on budget with an expected in service date of June 2014. And the company said the demolition of its Port Everglades facility is set for July with the new 1,277-MW gas-fired plant expected to be in service by June 2016. NextEra has said the new Riviera Beach and Port Everglades plants would each cost about $1.3 billion to build. To keep up with the state’s growing demand for natural gas, FPL also said it was evaluating proposals to build a gas pipeline from the Gulf of Mexico to Florida and expected to make a decision over the summer. During the earnings conference call with analysts, NextEra Energy Resources President and CEO Armando Pimentel said the company sees transmission opportunities across the United States due in part to FERC Order 1000. Under FERC Order 1000, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) wants to open to competition the construction of new lines needed to meet regional public policy requirements like state renewable portfolio standards, among other things. “As you might imagine, the incumbent utilities have a significant interest in what happens in their home territory and would like to build the transmission themselves, but we see continued opportunities,” Pimentel said on the conference call. He did not mention any specific projects but said the company saw opportunities in California, New England, Hawaii and other U.S. states, and in Canada. The transmission opportunities were long term projects not expected to enter service until the 2017-2018 timeframe, the company said. In March, NextEra energized the 330-mile (531-kilometer), 345-kilovolt Lone Star transmission line in Texas.",4302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-maine/nextera-to-sell-its-oil-fired-power-plants-in-maine-idUSL2N0DH26U20130430

The stocks each dropped more than 50 percent in the first minute of trading, though ended just down slightly. The share drops were the latest such incidents for the market since the May 6, 2010, “flash crash,” a computer-driven trading glitch that caused a sudden afternoon tumble in the major U.S. indexes. Last week, the NYSE canceled trades in Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) after a blip in trading cut the market value of the company by 99 percent. The latest event generated criticism from NextEra and others over what it means for investors. “This is naturally a concern for all our shareholders and potential shareholders,” said Moray Dewhurst, vice chairman and chief financial officer of NextEra Energy. “This type of market behavior is not what we would expect from a well-functioning and well-regulated exchange.” The NYSE said while all transactions in those shares in the first minute of trading will stand, all trades in AEP at or below $46.03 in that period, and all trades in NextEra at or below $76.19, will be marked with an “aberrant report indicator.” An aberrant report indicator is used to indicate the market believes that the trade price does not accurately reflect the prevailing market for the security, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

61,NEE,NRC to meet on concrete flaw at New Hampshire Seabrook reactor,"Sept 27 (Reuters) - Efforts by NextEra Energy Inc to address degradation of concrete at the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire will be the subject of a public meeting conducted by staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff on Oct. 9. The NRC has said the plant continues to operate safely and the problem with concrete has not caused structural problems, in part because the concrete walls are reinforced with steel rods known as rebar. The 1,246-megawatt Seabrook reactor is about 40 miles (60  km) north of Boston. NextEra identified degradation of below-grade concrete structures at Seabrook in June 2009 and confirmed the problem was from alkali silica reaction, or ASR, in August 2010. ASR is a chemical reaction that can cause expansion and cracking in concrete, potentially resulting in structural problems. In May 2012, the NRC issued a so-called confirmatory action letter to NextEra requiring the company to undertake a variety of actions in response to the condition. In August 2013, the NRC said NextEra had met all of the commitments contained in the confirmatory action letter. The NRC said, however, it is continuing to monitor the condition of the concrete structures and a company concrete-degradation testing program being conducted at the University of Texas - Austin. NextEra will use the results of that testing program to determine the long-term resolution of the concrete issues. The NRC has said it will not make a final decision on the plant’s license renewal application until the company has a plan to deal with the concrete issues. Seabrook entered service in 1990. Even though it is one of the newest reactors in the nation, NextEra in June 2010 applied to the NRC to renew the plant’s original 40-year license for another 20 years. The original license does not expire until 2030. The NRC has completed several non-contentious license renewals at other plants in less than two years, but NRC staff in the Seabrook case still have several reports to complete before making a recommendation to the commission on the application. NextEra has told the NRC it does not expect to get the concrete degradation results from the University of Texas until 2014, so the NRC could not make a decision on the license renewal until at least that time. That 2014 time frame, however, fits well with the NRC’s self-imposed moratorium in August 2012 on issuing new licenses until the agency reviews the environmental impact of storing spent nuclear fuel at temporary sites, such as nuclear power plants, due in part to a lack of a permanent waste storage facility. That decision followed a federal court ruling in June 2012. The NRC currently expects to complete its waste confidence rulemaking in September 2014.",9272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-seabrook/nrc-to-meet-on-concrete-flaw-at-new-hampshire-seabrook-reactor-idUSL2N0HN0N520130927
62,NEE,"Florida OK's nuclear costs recovery charges for NextEra, Duke","Oct 1 (Reuters) - The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) on Tuesday approved recovery of $43.4 million for construction of planned nuclear generation and improvements to existing nuclear units for NextEra Energy Inc’s Florida Power & Light Co unit. In commission said recovery amounts include costs for investments in FPL’s planned Turkey Point Units 6 and 7 and adding about 500 megawatts of capacity to existing Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 and St. Lucie Units 1 and 2. When completed, these projects are expected to add over 2,700 MW of new nuclear generation to FPL’s system, enough to power 1.4 million homes, the PSC said. FPL proposed to build two Westinghouse Electric 1,117-MW AP1000 reactors at Turkey Point. Westinghouse Electric is a unit of Japanese multinational Toshiba Corp. FPL has not decided to build the new reactors, but has said the two units 6 and 7 would cost about $12.8 billion to $18.7 billion and could enter service around 2022 and 2023. Florida, like some other states in the U.S. Southeast, allows utilities to recover the cost to build or upgrade nuclear reactors before the projects enter service to help offset financing and other costs. The PSC said FPL residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity will see a monthly nuclear cost recovery charge of approximately 46 cents beginning in January 2014, reflecting a $1.19 decrease from the current charge. The Florida Legislature reduced FPL’s total recovery by $1.6 million due to adjustments in calculating carrying costs, the PSC said. Separately, the PSC said it approved an 89 cent increase in Duke Energy Inc’s <DUK.N > 2014 nuclear cost recovery charges, which will boost monthly charges for residential customers using 1,000 kWh to approximately $5.62 beginning in January.

The staff report is not the state’s final decision on the $1.13 billion solar photovoltaic project, but serves as its testimony in the commission’s decision-making process. The staff released its assessment in two parts. In the first, released in late September, the staff said the environmental impact of the project “would be less than significant” with the implementation of recommended mitigation measures. But in the second part, released last week, the staff said the project would have “significant cumulative environmental impacts in the areas of biological resources, cultural resources, land use, and visual resources even with the implementation of staff’s recommended mitigation measures.” Officials at NextEra were not immediately available for comment. Power traders have noted a negative staff report does not kill a project. The commission does not always follow the staff assessments and developers often make changes in response to the recommendations. In September 2010, the commission approved the 1,000-MW Blythe solar power project using solar thermal parabolic trough technology. The project is located near Blythe in eastern Riverside County about 225 miles (362 kms) east of Los Angeles. The solar thermal plant would be located on 7,043 acres of federal land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Solar Millennium, the project’s original owner, which went bankrupt in 2011, filed an amendment in June 2012 with the commission requesting to switch the technology to solar photovoltaic. In April 2013, a unit of NextEra, the new project owner, filed a revised amendment with the Commission to reduce the project’s physical size and the generation capacity. NextEra wants to build the current 485-MW project in four phases, with the first three consisting of 125 MW and the fourth generating 110 MW. In addition, to approval from the state commission, the amended project requires a revised right-of-way grant from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. If the project is approved, NextEra has told the commission construction would last 48 months with an average workforce of 341 workers during construction and 15 once the plant enters service.",10152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-blythe/california-finds-issues-with-nexteras-planned-solar-plant-idUSL1N0I511H20131015
64,NEE,California to hold meeting on NextEra Blythe solar power plant,"Nov 11 (Reuters) - California regulators will hold a public meeting on Nov. 12 with a unit of NextEra Energy Inc on environmental and other issues related to its proposed 485-megawatt Blythe solar photovoltaic power plant. The California Energy Commission said in a press release on Friday its staff will discuss air quality, biological resources, paleontological resources, and soil and water resources it has found with the $1.13 billion project. In September and October, the Commission staff issued an assessment that will serve as its testimony at an evidentiary hearing held by a committee of two Commissioners who are reviewing the project. The committee will issue a proposal that will be presented to the full commission for a final decision on the project, the Commission said. In September 2010, the Commission approved German renewable company Solar Millennium’s proposal to build a 1,000-MW solar thermal power project using mirrors and sunlight to heat a fluid and generate power. Solar Millennium wanted to build the plant on 7,043 acres of federal land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management near the town of Blythe in Riverside County about 225 miles (362 km) east of Los Angeles. Solar Millennium went bankrupt at the end of 2011 and in June 2012 filed an amendment with the Commission to change the technology to solar photovoltaic. In April 2013, the new project owner, a unit of NextEra, filed a revised amendment to reduce the project’s physical size and generation capacity. It is the revised amendment the Commission is considering. NextEra wants to build the 485-MW project on 4,070 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in four phases, with the first three each 125 MW and the fourth generating 110 MW. NextEra has said construction is expected to last 48 months and employ an average of 341 workers. Once operational, NextEra it will take about 15 workers to run the plant.",11112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nextera-blythe/california-to-hold-meeting-on-nextera-blythe-solar-power-plant-idUSL2N0IW17X20131111

66,NEE,California approves $1.13 bln NextEra Blythe solar power plant,"Jan 15 (Reuters) - California energy regulators said on Wednesday they have approved NextEra Energy Inc’s plan to use a different solar technology at its proposed $1.13 billion Blythe solar power plant, moving the 485-megawatt project a step closer to construction. By a 5-0 vote, the Energy Commission agreed to allow NextEra to switch to solar photovoltaic technology from a previously approved solar parabolic-trough system. “The project will spur California’s transition to renewable energy and help advance its aggressive climate change goals,” Commissioner Karen Douglas, the presiding member of the committee reviewing the Blythe project, said in a statement. Officials at NextEra were not immediately available for comment on the company’s planned next steps. In December, the committee reviewing Blythe found the project may have “environmental impacts that are cumulatively significant when considered along with the impacts of other projects in the region.” But the committee found the project benefits, including its contribution to meeting California’s Renewables Portfolio Standard, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating nearly 500 peak construction jobs, and boosting the economy-justify an override of those impacts. In September 2010, the Energy Commission approved the 1,000-MW Blythe solar project for a site located about eight miles (13 km) west of Blythe in eastern Riverside County on 7,043 acres (2,850 hectares) of federal public land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. Solar Millennium, which went bankrupt at the end of 2011, filed an amendment with the commission in June 2012 to switch to the project to solar photovoltaic technology. In April 2013, the project owner, NextEra, filed a revised amendment to reduce the project’s physical size and generation capacity. NextEra’s amended 485-MW project would be developed on 4,070 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in four phases, with the first three consisting of 125 MW and the fourth generating 110 MW.

67,NEE,U.S.'s NextEra files complaint over Spain's new renewable energy rules,"MADRID, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. alternative energy group NextEra has filed a complaint against Spain before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) over changes to renewable energy rules, the fourth complaint of its kind. The Spanish government has passed a series of measures over the past two years that cut and, in some cases, eliminate subsidies on renewable energy assets as part of reforms that many investors say change the original terms of their contracts. Three other foreign investors have also filed complaints against the changes with the ICSID, a member of the World Bank Group, which facilitates arbitration of legal disputes in international investment cases. The complaint by NextEra, posted on the ICSID website, was filed on May 23. Spain’s new energy laws are aimed at mending years of policy that created a gap in regulated prices and costs, leading to a 30 billion euro ($41 billion) electricity tariff deficit.

68,NEE,Fitch Rates NextEra Energy Capital Holdings' Debentures 'A-',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to NextEra  Energy Capital Holdings' (Capital Holdings) $350 million 2.40% senior unsecured  debentures due Sept. 15, 2019. The current Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for  Capital Holdings and for its parent, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE), is 'A-', and  the Rating Outlook for both entities is Stable. NEE provides full guarantee of  Capital Holdings' debt and hybrids. The debentures are absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by  NEE. The guarantee is an unsecured obligation of NEE and will rank equally and  ratably with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of NEE. The net  proceeds from this offering will be added to Capital Holdings' general funds,  which will be used to repay a portion of total outstanding commercial paper (CP)  obligations and for other general corporate purposes. As of March 5, 2014,  Capital Holdings had outstanding commercial paper obligations of $1.435 billion.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Changing Business Mix To More Regulated/Contracted: NEE's continued shift away  from merchant businesses toward regulated investments and contracted  non-regulated renewable assets is supportive of its credit profile. Driving the  favorable shift in cash flow mix are factors such as base rate increases at  NEE's regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL), a recovering  Florida economy, completion of the regulated Lone Star transmission line in  2013, the rising contribution from contracted solar and wind investments, and  proposed investment in regulated natural gas transmission. In addition, absent a  significant recovery in the commodity environment, which Fitch is not expecting,  the contribution from non-contracted generation assets and other non-regulated  businesses will remain contained, in Fitch's opinion. Fitch forecasts that  regulated businesses will contribute between 60%-65% of NEE's EBITDA for the  next several years. Within the non-regulated businesses, management's emphasis remains on long-term  contracted renewable generation, specifically solar and wind. Fitch expects the  long-term contracted business to drive up to 63% of 2016 forecasted EBITDA for  Energy Resources, which is higher than 56% contribution in 2013 and  significantly above the 49% contribution in 2009. Fitch expects contractual  sources to continue to drive another 20% of NEE's consolidated EBITDA over the  next few years.  High Capex: Aided by yet another extension in Production Tax Credits (PTCs),  NEE's renewable portfolio continues to grow under Capital Holdings' wholly owned  subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources (Energy Resources). Management expects to  develop 2,000-2,500 megawatts (MW) of new wind projects over 2013-2015, of which  1,672 MW have been committed and have long-term signed power purchase agreements  (PPAs). Management is also targeting approximately 1,100 MWs of solar projects  over 2013-2016, all of which has been contracted. Capital Holdings is also  increasing its regulated portfolio through investments in Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulated gas pipelines. Fitch has assumed all  these projects come to fruition and have included them in its financial  projections but have not included any incremental capex opportunities.  The capex at FPL over 2014-2016 is being driven by the recently completed plant  modernization at Riviera Beach and the ongoing plant modernizations at Port  Everglades and other infrastructure improvements such as storm hardening and  reliability investments. The plant modernization projects have been approved by  the Florida Public Service Commission and, once completed, will earn a return  through the generation base-rate adjustment (GBRA) mechanism. As a result of  continued investments at both Capital Holdings and FPL, capex at NEE will  continue to be elevated throughout Fitch's forecast period of 2014-2016 (average  of $6.6 billion), albeit lower than the $9.5 billion peak reached in 2012. It is  highly likely that there is further upside to these capex estimates,  particularly for Capital Holdings, since any legislative extension of tax  benefits for wind and solar will be a further impetus for NEE to expand its  renewable portfolio.  Demonstrated Equity Support: Given the pressures on credit metrics today and  elevated levels of forecasted capex, management's emphasis on strengthening the  balance sheet is warranted to maintain the current levels of ratings. In this  regard, the company's equity issuance of $1.5 billion in 2013 in the form of  $400 million of common equity issued in November 2013, $600 million of equity  forward contract to be settled by the end of 2014, and $500 million of equity  units issued in September 2013, is positive for NEE's credit.  Formation Of A Growth-Oriented Limited Partnership: NEE recently announced its  decision to form Nextera Energy Partners, LP (NEP), which will be a publically  listed, yield driven growth oriented vehicle. NEP will initially own a portfolio  of 10 wind and solar assets with a generating capacity of 990 MW. NEE has  committed to provide a right of first offer (ROFO) to NEP over a six-year period  for additional 1,549 MW of wind and solar assets. NEE intends to sell-down a  portion of its ownership in NEP to public through an IPO and will own a general  partner interest in NEP through an affiliate. At present, Fitch views the formation of NEP as neutral to NEE's credit. The  small size of NEP and contemplated pace of sell-downs does not alter the  business mix of Energy Resources or NEE in any meaningful way. Fitch expects NEE  to use a portion of the sale proceeds for holding company debt reduction.  Management in its public comments has reinforced its commitment to credit  ratings and Fitch expects NEE to meet the targeted credit metrics on a pro forma  basis. As NEP grows larger and if NEE's ownership is progressively reduced,  Fitch could take a more conservative view of evaluating the cash distributions  from NEP relative to other sources of funds to service holding company debt.  Please refer to Fitch's release ""Fitch Views NEP Formation as Neutral to  Nextera's Ratings"" dated May 28, 2014, available at www.fitchratings.com, for  additional commentary on NEP and its implication for NEE's credit profile. Treatment Of Non-recourse Debt: NEE's credit metrics, as reported, show more  leverage than a median 'A-' financial profile for a utility or parent holding  company. A large portion of Energy Resources' generation portfolio is project  financed with debt that has limited or no corporate recourse. These projects,  however, tend to be highly leveraged (with typically a low investment grade  profile), which weakens the consolidated leverage metrics for NEE. In Fitch's  view, a better way to analyze NEE's metrics is to deconsolidate a majority of  the project financed entities and only include the upstream distribution from  these entities in NEE's credit analysis. The off-credit treatment to the limited  recourse debt at Energy Resources reflects Fitch's assumption that NEE would  walk away from these projects in the event of financial deterioration, including  those projects where a differential membership interest has been sold. These  projects typically comprise wind, solar as well as fossil assets. Non-recourse  debt associated with entities such as Lone Star Transmission is not  deconsolidated.  Weak But Strengthening Credit Measures: On a fully consolidated GAAP basis,  Fitch expects NEE's funds from operations (FFO) fixed-charge coverage to be  approximately 5.00x-5.25x over the forecast period of 2014-2016. FFO adjusted  leverage and adjusted debt/EBITDAR are expected to improve to 3.7x by 2016 from  year-end 2013 levels of 4.2x and 4.7x, respectively. NEE's FFO based metrics are  robust reflecting the beneficial cash tax position of the company and aligned  with an 'A-' rated financial profile for the sector. The biggest risk to Fitch  forecasts is the extent of tax equity used by Energy Resources to build its  renewable pipeline. Lower than expected tax equity proceeds for Energy Resources  due to a limited tax equity appetite among market participants in the future  will increase the reliance on project debt, thereby, putting pressure on the  consolidated GAAP financials. Extension of PTCs is another wild card since it  would spur a higher renewable development and likely lead to higher than  anticipated debt financing.  Fitch also looked at an alternative rating scenario, which incorporates  off-credit treatment to a large portion of limited recourse debt at Energy  Resources. Fitch accordingly excludes the debt, interest expense, EBITDA  contribution and tax attributes from such projects and includes only the  distributable cash flow. Adjusting for non-recourse debt, NEE's credit metrics  look stronger. FFO fixed-charge cover remains above 6.5x over the forecast  period. FFO adjusted leverage and adjusted debt/EBITDAR are both expected to  improve to 3.2x by 2016 under this scenario.  Strong Liquidity And Capital Access: NEE's ratings also reflect the company's  strong access to the capital markets, CP market and to banks for both corporate  credit and project finance. Liquidity is robust with committed corporate credit  facilities of the NEE group of companies aggregating approximately $8.8 billion,  excluding limited recourse or non-recourse project financing arrangements. Debt  maturities are manageable.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive rating actions for NEE and Capital Holdings appear unlikely at this  time. Downward rating pressure could result from:  Inability to Reach Targeted Credit Metrics: A failure to achieve adjusted FFO  leverage between 3.75x - 4.0x by 2016 on a consolidated basis could lead to  negative rating action for NEE.  Deterioration in Florida Regulation: Any change in current regulatory policies  at Florida Public Service Commission would adversely affect NEE's and FPL's  ratings. Any weakness in the current business climate in Florida will also be a  cause for concern.  Increase In Business Risk Profile: A change in strategy to invest in more  speculative assets, non-contracted renewable assets or a lower proportion of  cash flow under long-term contracts would increase business risk and could  result in lower ratings for NEE. The high level of capital expenditures at both  FPL and Capital Holdings creates completion risks, as well as funding risk.  Aggressive Financial Strategy: Any deterioration in credit measures that result  from higher use of leverage or outsized return of capital to shareholders could  lead to negative rating actions. Fitch will continue to monitor management's  strategy with respect to NEP and an aggressive acquisition or financial  strategy, rising conflict of interest between NEE and NEP, or predominantly  shareholder focused use of sell down proceeds will have negative implications  for NEE's credit.  Change In Tax Laws or Regulations: Changes in tax rules that reduce NEE's  ability to monetize its accumulated production tax credits, investment tax  credits, and accumulated tax losses carried forward would be adverse to NEE's  cash flow credit measures.

69,NEE,UPDATE 1-Energy Future unit rejects NextEra's $2.3 bln bankruptcy plan,"(Adds details of both proposals) By Tom Hals June 24 (Reuters) - Energy Future Holdings rejected an unsolicited $2.3 billion restructuring plan by NextEra Energy Inc that would have given the alternative energy group a large stake in Energy Future’s power lines unit, according to court filings. The proposal, which was revealed in court filings late Monday, was developed by NextEra and a group of investors that hold second-lien notes issued by Energy Future’s EFIH unit, which in turn controls the Oncor power distribution business. EFIH, or Energy Future Intermediate Holding, rejected the proposal in favor of a plan already advanced by a group of investors who hold the unit’s unsecured bonds, according to filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Both proposals take the form of a loan to refinance EFIH’s high-yielding second-lien notes, which would cut interest costs. Rather than repay the loan, when EFIH emerges from bankruptcy the financing would convert into an equity stake of a little more than 60 percent of the company. Shares of NextEra, the largest U.S. generator of renewable energy, closed up 1.1 percent at $100.73, near a 52-week high, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is based in Juno Beach, Florida and a company spokeswoman said NextEra does not comment on potential transactions. Court filings reveal a flurry of last-minute changes to the two loan proposals as each group jockeyed to win over a meeting of the board of managers of EFIH on Sunday. In its final proposal, NextEra planned to contribute $1.6 billion to the package, according to court filings. Backers of the proposed NextEra loan said in court papers their proposal carried a lower interest rate, offered more money to unsecured creditors and would pay second-lien noteholders an early redemption payment, ending litigation on the issue. The company’s board opted on Sunday to stick with the loan proposed by its unsecured bondholders, in part because the NextEra loan did allow the company to pursue other deals, according to court filings. NextEra and its second-lien noteholder partners could still get their loan approved. They asked Judge Christopher Sontchi to reject the unsecured creditors loan proposal when he hears the issue on June 30. Energy Future filed one of the largest U.S. bankruptcies in April and seeks to restructure more than $40 billion in debt as it was squeezed by falling natural gas prices. Energy Future also plans to spin off the unit that owns the TXU Energy retail utility and the power generating business known as Luminant to holders of $24.4 billion in secured debt. That part of its restructuring would not be affected by NextEra’s proposal.

Hawaiian Electric shares were up 17.4 percent in extended trading at $33.10, slightly shy of the deal value of $33.50 per share, which includes the $8 per share estimated value of ASB Hawaii. NextEra, which owns Florida Power & Light Co, is one of the largest rate-regulated electric utilities in the United States. U.S. power producers have recently benefited from higher prices set by regulators, and prefer the controlled market to the volatile wholesale power market. NextEra will give 0.2413 of its shares for each Hawaiian Electric share, which equates to about $25.19 per share, based on the stock’s Wednesday close. The company will also pay a one-time cash dividend of 50 cents per share. NextEra will assume $1.7 billion of Hawaiian Electric’s debt, the companies said, valuing the deal at about $4.3 billion. The companies added there would be no “involuntary reductions” to Hawaiian Electric’s workforce for at least two years after the deal closes. American Savings Bank is one of Hawaii’s largest full-service financial institutions with over $5 billion in assets. The deal is expected to be neutral to NextEra’s profit in the first year after closing, which is expected in 12 months. NextEra Energy were unchanged in extended trading from their closing of $104.39 on Wednesday. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised Hawaiian Electric and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was legal counsel. Citigroup Global Markets Inc advised NextEra and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was legal counsel.

75,NEE,NextEra's Hawaii deal faces big concerns from solar players,"(Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc’s (NEE.N) $4.3 billion plan to buy Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc (HE.N) has made solar companies uneasy, worried that the deal would reverse the island state’s push to decentralize its power grid. In documents filed with Hawaii’s utility regulator, SunPower Corp (SPWR.O), SunEdison Inc SUNE.N and a group backed by SolarCity SCTY.O say they are worried the acquisition would be bad for their businesses, many of which have grown dramatically in the Aloha State in just a few years. The deal, announced in December, needs Public Utilities Commission approval. Hawaii, with its sunny weather and sky-high electricity rates, is one of the world’s best markets for solar power. Residents see solar as a solution to weaning the state off its reliance on pricey imported fuel oil.  The percentage of rooftop solar installations on homes in Hawaii far surpasses that of any other state, so it is widely considered the Petri dish for integrating large amounts of so-called distributed generation. “A decision on this merger could be a signal of what utility 2.0 looks like,” Robert Harris, a Hawaii-based spokesman for The Alliance for Solar Choice, said in an interview. The group represents rooftop solar companies SolarCity, SunRun, Demeter Power, Solar Universe and Verengo Solar. In the filings, the companies express concern about NextEra’s track record of favoring large centralized renewable energy plants over rooftop solar and worry that the deal will hurt competition. “It raises the question of whether NextEra plans to have all the renewable energy provided by its subsidiary NextEra Resources,” Sunpower said in its Feb. 18 filing, adding that it believed this would deny “other renewable energy companies a fair opportunity to compete in the Hawaii market.” The company said it had spent millions of dollars on building its business in Hawaii over the last 16 years. SunPower is majority owned by France’s Total (TOTF.PA). NextEra, which owns about 850 megawatts of solar and 11,500 MW of wind in the United States and Canada, said the concerns are unwarranted. The company’s regulated utility, Florida Power & Light, has just a few thousand rooftop solar systems because the state’s very low electricity prices make it more difficult for solar to compete with power from the grid. “We absolutely share Hawaiian Electric’s vision of, among other things, tripling the amount of distributed solar, and in particular, integrating more rooftop solar,” NextEra spokesman Rob Gould said.

77,NEE,UPDATE 1-NextEra Energy to buy Texas pipeline company for $2.1 bln,"(Adds details, background, shares) Aug 3 (Reuters) - Clean energy company NextEra Energy Partners said it would buy NET Midstream, a privately held company that develops natural gas pipeline assets, in a deal valued at $2.1 billion. NextEra Energy Partners said the deal would give it seven natural gas pipelines in Texas, with the capacity to carry 3 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas per day and the potential to expand by an additional 1 bcf. The company’s shares fell as much as 12 percent on Monday. NextEra Energy Partners will make an initial payment of $1.8 billion for NET Midstream, which is 50 percent owned by private equity fund ArcLight Capital Partners. The deal value also includes a $300 million future investment. NextEra Energy Partners, which also raised its annual distribution by 12 cents per unit to 94 cents, said it expected the deal to immediately add to its distribution. The company was formed by NextEra Energy Inc as a so-called “yield-co” to own renewable assets with multi-year contracts. The average contract life of the assets being acquired is 16 years, the companies said in a statement. NextEra Energy also reported a better-than-expected profit, helped by higher earnings from its rate-regulated utility and its competitive energy business.

84,NEE,SunEdison's problems cast shadow over future of solar yieldcos,"Nov 20 (Reuters) - SunEdison Inc’s decision to halt sales of solar power plants to its dividend-paying “yieldco” units has drawn attention to the company’s missteps at a time when the oil price slump has claimed renewable energy stocks as collateral damage. So-called yieldcos are publicly traded entities that house solar and wind projects sold to them by their parent companies. These units have long-term agreements to sell power, giving them stable cash flows, but they are dependent on the transfer of assets from their parents to increase dividends. Yieldcos are supposed to be safe bets for people looking to invest in the volatile solar market, which is why SunEdison’s decision has prompted a selloff in its stock and raised fresh questions about the viability of the yieldco model. Some analysts and investors think SunEdison lost the plot as it tried to grow too quickly through acquisitions it couldn’t afford, leaving it with little choice but to sell assets to third parties for higher prices rather than to its own units. So, they say, it’s unlikely rivals will follow SunEdison’s lead and halt sales to their asset-holding businesses. SunEdison, run out of Belmont, California, has lost two-thirds of its value since it said on Oct. 7 that it would halt so-called “asset drop downs”. The company’s stock hit a three-year low of $2.55 on Friday. “It’s more a reflection of SunEdison’s strategy than the yieldco structure,” said Hood River Capital portfolio manager Brian Smoluch. “I wouldn’t throw out the whole asset class.” SunEdison’s total debt of $11.67 billion is more than 10 times its market capitalization of about $900 million, according to Thomson Reuters data. Renewable energy companies such as SunPower Corp  and Transalta Corp have reassured investors that their plans to sell assets to their yieldcos remain intact. In fact, a drop in prices of yieldco stocks have opened up buying opportunities, investors say. Yieldcos of companies such as NRG Energy Inc and NextEra Energy Inc are good bets because the parents hold many assets that can be dropped down, they said. Prices for all yieldcos have fallen sharply this year, caught up in a selloff caused by weak oil prices. Up to Thursday’s close, SunEdison’s yieldcos - TerraForm Global Inc and TerraForm Power Inc - had lost about two-thirds of their value. NRG Yield Inc shares have dropped about 39 percent, while Nextera Energy Partners LP’s have fallen about 23 percent. “All yieldcos are not created equal,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, adding that the yieldco structure remained the best way to play rising demand for solar and wind energy. Yieldcos have to be seen as stable income-producing investments like REITs, many involved in the industry say. “Yieldcos should have been built as boring, fixed-income instruments,” said Ted Brandt, chief executive of investment banking firm Marathon Capital LLC. “But Wall Street couldn’t do that, they ended up ... packaging them as growth instruments,” said Brandt, whose firm advises energy and infrastructure companies. Still, for some SuneEdison’s situation has strengthened the case against the yieldco model. Critics say many yieldcos overpay for assets, and don’t like the fact that they need to continually raise money to buy projects in order to boost dividends. “We don’t really like the business models of U.S. yieldcos ... their acquisition appetite for projects is often bigger than the market opportunity,” said David Richardson, managing director at investment firm Impax Asset Management. JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, which has been looking to list a yieldco, said on Thursday that the U.S. market was not “favorable” to solar yieldcos now. The MAC Global Solar Energy Index has fallen nearly 30 percent this year. Some also draw a comparison between yieldcos and Master Limited Partnerships, set up to hold their parents’ oil and gas pipelines. MLPs were all the rage a few years ago, but have since fallen out of favor for the same reason that has hurt yieldcos - a slump in oil prices that hit dividend growth.

Energy Future has been in bankruptcy for over two years. Plans for Oncor, a utility serving Texas that is prized for its steady cash flow, have come together and then collapsed over that time, partly because of financing and regulatory issues. Fidelity would have been one of the owners of Oncor had an earlier plan panned out. Now, the mutual fund giant, seeking to protect its original investment in Energy Future, joins a crowded field of bidders for the power distribution company. NextEra Energy Inc  is thought to be the lead bidder, according to people familiar with the matter, and Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has also ramped up its interest in Oncor, the people said. Creditors have estimated Oncor’s value at $19 billion. Spokesmen for Fidelity, Energy Future and NextEra declined to comment. A request for comment from Berkshire Hathaway was not immediately returned. Energy Future began work on a new bankruptcy plan earlier this year. Like the prior plan, the new one calls for spinning off Energy Future’s power plants and retail business to senior creditors, a process scheduled to wrap up this summer. Unlike the earlier plan, the spin off can happen without waiting for a deal on Oncor. Attorneys for Energy Future had been scheduled to have a new plan for the unit of the company that holds Oncor by July 8, but asked for a suspension of that deadline. Energy Future filed for bankruptcy burdened by debt stemming from a record 2007 leveraged buyout, led by KKR & Co LP, TPG and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

The deal will give NextEra access to the largest network of power lines in Texas. The company, whose shares were up 0.5 percent in morning trading, has been trying to buy Oncor for more than a year.  The company said on Friday it would buy Energy Future’s 80 percent indirect stake in Oncor through a newly formed subsidiary. Energy Future would spin off its power plants and retail electricity business under a reorganization plan. NextEra said the agreement to buy Energy Future would be filed in a Delaware court as part of the restructuring of the Texas company, allowing it to emerge from bankruptcy. NextEra will use $9.5 billion mainly to repay creditors of Oncor’s holding company.  The breakdown between cash and NextEra common stock to be provided to creditor classes will be closely scrutinized, said Angelo Thalassinos, a senior legal analyst at Reorg Research.  Energy Future, the largest power company in Texas, filed for Chapter 11 in April 2014 after it failed to meet its debt obligations as electricity prices weakened. The bankruptcy is one of the largest ever in the United States.

99,NEE,Energy Future wins court approval to exit bankruptcy,"(Reuters) - Energy Future Holdings Corp [EFHC.UL] [TXEFHE.UL], Texas’ biggest power company, won U.S. court approval on Friday for a plan that will allow the bulk of its operations to exit Chapter 11 after two years of battling creditors. “I am going to overrule all of the remaining objections, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi said in court in Wilmington, Delaware. “I am prepared to confirm.”  Dallas-based Energy Future filed for bankruptcy in April 2014 when weak electricity prices left it unable to service $42 billion in debt, mostly related to the company’s creation through a 2007 leveraged buyout. It was the largest U.S. bankruptcy since that of General Motors Co (GM.N) in 2009. The reorganized company will own TXU Energy, the state’s largest retail electric utility, and Luminant, Texas’ largest power plant operator and largest coal miner. The spinoff of the two divisions into the new company avoids a tax liability that had worried creditors. The potential for a “massive” tax liability was the “elephant in the room,” Sontchi said on Friday, adding he believed the plan “was the best possible deal” to push the company out of bankruptcy. “A tax-free separation was a critical component to maximizing the value of the estate,” Energy Future spokesman Allan Koenig said in an email. Energy Future’s 80 percent stake in power distribution business Oncor, which owns the largest network of power lines in Texas, remains in Chapter 11 and will face its own confirmation hearing in December. A previous plan by Energy Future to exit bankruptcy won approval from Sontchi last year but fell apart when regulators opposed the sale of Oncor to a group of creditors and investors led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas. Energy Future agreed in July to sell Oncor to Florida’s NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N) in a deal valued at $18.4 billion but is still accepting other bids for the business. Before it becomes effective the latest reorganization needs regulatory approval from the Railroad Commission of Texas, which the company said it expects in September. The plan won broad support from creditors but was opposed by some noteholders who said it would not fairly compensate creditors for tax benefits and back-office operations that would be transferred to the new company. The new owners, the company’s first lien lenders, have yet to select a name for the reorganized company.

122,NEE,Energy Future bankruptcy exit hearings set for February,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Texas power company Energy Future Holdings Corp will start hearings in February to confirm its Chapter 11 bankruptcy exit plan and its proposed sale of its power lines business to NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N) for $18.6 billion, a judge said on Thursday. Those hearings had been scheduled to begin on Thursday, but were postponed after the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the company owed holders of its first-lien and second-lien notes about $800 million more than anticipated. The company’s plan is based on a sale of its main asset, its stake in the Texas-based Oncor power distribution business, to NextEra Energy of Juno Beach, Florida. Energy Future filed a modified plan of reorganization on Thursday that essentially shifted the cost of last month’s appeals court ruling to holders of junior unsecured notes, by reducing their payout by roughly $800 million.  Those junior creditors argued to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi in Wilmington, Delaware that NextEra should be on the hook for making the unanticipated payment to the first-lien and second-lien noteholders. If the Florida power company did not want to pay, then it should drop its merger plan, their lawyer argued. The unsecured noteholders also asked the judge for a six-week “time out” in the case. “We should be entitled to a short window to explore a potentially better alternative,” said Abid Qureshi, a lawyer for Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld who represents the unsecured noteholders. He said the investors holding the unsecured so-called PIK notes wanted to see if they could find a buyer for Oncor to replace NextEra. Sontchi rejected their proposed schedule, saying it was important to move the two-and-a-half year case along or risk losing the NextEra deal. “A six-week time out is not reasonable,” he said. “There is a bird in hand here with NextEra.” Energy Future filed for bankruptcy in 2014 to cut its $42 billion in debt. The company has already spun off its power generation business, known as Luminant, and its TXU retail utility to senior lenders who were owed $24 billion.  Energy Future was created from the record $45 billion leveraged buyout of TXU Corp in 2007, a deal led by KKR & Co and TPG Capital.

(Reuters) - Energy Future Holdings Corp [EFHC.UL][TXEFHE.UL], which owns the largest power network in Texas, received court approval on Friday to confirm its plan to exit bankruptcy and be acquired by NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N) in a deal valued at around $18 billion. Approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas is required for the purchase of Energy Future’s power distribution business, known as Oncor. A decision is expected in the coming months.

Energy Future said on Tuesday it had resolved the last main disputes to its plan of reorganization, when its noteholders reached an agreement to modify what they were owed. Friday’s order confirming the plan by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi ended one of the country’s largest and most expensive bankruptcy cases. The company was created from the record $45 billion leveraged buyout of TXU Corp in 2007, a deal led by KKR & Co (KKR.N) and TPG Capital [TPG.UL]. Energy Future was undermined by a steep decline in natural gas prices that in turn led to depressed power prices and rendered the company’s debt unsustainable. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2014 to cut its $42 billion in debt.

131,NEE,Texas regulators nix $18 billion deal for bankrupt power company,"NEW YORK/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Texas regulators on Thursday agreed to scuttle NextEra Energy Inc’s (NEE.N) $18 billion purchase of Energy Future Holdings Corp [EFHC.UL] [TXEFHE.UL], finding that the deal was not in the public interest. The three-member Public Utility Commission of Texas found that the deal, a key component of Energy Future’s plan to exit an approximately three-year bankruptcy, placed too much risk on ratepayers, its members said in a public meeting Thursday.  Energy Future is the majority owner of Oncor, the state’s largest power network. The commission said it was concerned about the debt of the combined company, the independence of Oncor’s board and payments to the parent company at the expense of Oncor. NextEra and Energy Future Holdings declined to comment.  This is the second plan to sell Oncor that has met regulatory resistance. A separate plan to sell Oncor to a group of creditors and investors led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas collapsed in 2016 after it hit obstacles from the commission. The path forward for Energy Future may now involve converting some of its debt to equity, or recapitalizing by selling stock, and emerging as a standalone entity, people familiar with the matter said Thursday. That path calls for drafting a new plan of reorganization for the company. Bankruptcy court approved Energy Future’s reorganization plan that included the planned sale to NextEra in February, after the company reached agreements with some creditors modifying what they were owed. The Texas commission plans to meet and formally vote on the NextEra deal at an April meeting.  “In each case I believe that (NextEra’s) deal killers are also mine,” wrote Commissioner Kenneth Anderson in a memorandum dated March 30, adding that he thought it would waste time to potentially accept the deal with conditions NextEra could not accept.

138,NEE,NextEra asks Texas to reconsider bankrupt power company deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Florida utility company NextEra Energy Inc asked Texas regulators on Monday to reconsider a decision that threatens to kill its roughly $18 billion bid to acquire bankrupt Energy Future Holding Corp, the majority owner of Oncor, Texas’ largest power network. The request, announced in a public filing, keeps the deal, a key part of Energy Future’s plan to exit its three-year-long bankruptcy, alive for now. The three-member Public Utility Commission of Texas has until June 7 to respond to NextEra’s request, said Terry Hadley, a spokesman for the regulators. Hadley said regulators were reviewing NextEra’s request. NextEra said in its motion for rehearing that the regulators went beyond the scope of their powers when they decided earlier this year that its proposal for Energy Future was not in the public interest and was too risky for ratepayers. NextEra argues the deal would actually help the financial health of Oncor because it could lead to an upgrade of its credit rating and eliminate legacy debt. NextEra declined to elaborate beyond the filing. Energy Future declined to comment. One factor in the efforts to complete the acquisition is a $275 million breakup fee if the deal fails due to certain reasons. This is the second proposal to sell Oncor that has met resistance from regulators. A separate plan to sell the power network to a group of creditors and investors led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas collapsed in 2016 after hitting obstacles from the commission. The commission had said of NextEra’s proposal that it was concerned about the debt of the combined company, the independence of Oncor’s board and payments to the parent company at the expense of Oncor.",5092017,http://www.reuters.com/article/nextera-energyfuture-appeal/nextera-asks-texas-to-reconsider-bankrupt-power-company-deal-idUSL1N1IB01D
139,NEE,Elliott sues Energy Future for chance to offer bankruptcy alternatives,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp filed a lawsuit against Energy Future Holdings Corp on Thursday, claiming that the bankrupt power company has prevented it from pursuing better options for it as its $18.7 billion deal with NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N) falters.  Energy Future’s plan to exit its three-year-long bankruptcy hinges on selling its majority stake in Oncor, Texas’ largest power distribution network, but that deal is in limbo since state regulators scuttled it over concerns it would not benefit  ratepayers.  Elliott, Energy Future’s largest creditor, wants to lay the groundwork for a plan of reorganization for Energy Future that involves converting its significant debt holdings in the company to equity, eventually putting Oncor under the hedge fund’s control, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Other options include finding another buyer for Oncor. “The precarious state of the NextEra transaction means that creditors and (Energy Future) must immediately consider and pursue other restructuring alternatives,” Elliott said in the lawsuit. Energy Future, Elliott and NextEra all declined to comment. NextEra’s bid for Oncor is the latest in a string of nixed deals to get Energy Future out of its lengthy bankruptcy.   Energy Future has stymied Elliott from seeking other plans for the company because it says that the fund must abide by the terms of an earlier agreement with bondholders, according to the lawsuit.  Energy Future is waiting to see if the Public Utility Commission of Texas chooses to re-hear NextEra’s application to acquire Oncor.  Elliott is a new player in the Energy Future case, having amassed since October enough of the company’s debt to give it a significant say in the bankruptcy process, according to the complaint. Its total holdings tally $2.9 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. To try to salvage its deal, NextEra held a meeting with the company’s debtholders in April asking for financial concessions so that it could meet demands made by the Texas regulators, including rate relief for ratepayers, but no agreement was reached, according to the lawsuit.

The hedge fund believes its acquisition offer would result in a higher payout to debtholders. New York-based Elliott’s proposal to acquire Energy Future Holdings Corp calls for a complex conversion of its debt to equity and for an outside equity partner to help finance the deal. Reuters first reported on Elliott exploring a bid for Oncor on Friday. The offer from the hedge fund, which says it has more than $32 billion under management, would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. But even without a competing bid, Buffett’s deal faces a difficult road securing the approval of a bankruptcy court judge without Elliott supporting it.  “We are extremely concerned that introducing a transaction with Berkshire at the current time will significantly undercut and potentially limit Elliott’s ability to provide a portion of the financing necessary to achieve the higher and otherwise superior transaction Elliott has proposed,” the hedge fund said in a letter to the board of Energy Future dated July 5 and released on Monday. Berkshire’s offer would help Energy Future exit its costly bankruptcy, which has stretched for over three years as other deals for its crown jewel Oncor fell apart. Energy Future’s power generation and retail electricity business were separated from Oncor and emerged from bankruptcy last year. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also disclosed on Monday that it would keep in place a corporate “ringfencing” structure that would prevent debt from being added to Dallas-based Oncor, or too much cash being paid out as dividends.  Regulators in the utility’s home state of Texas have demanded such a structure. That was the reason Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc’s (NEE.N) $18.7 billion deal for the utility collapsed earlier this year. Berkshire Hathaway already has reached an agreement on a consensual approval process with regulators, according to a statement from an adviser to Energy Future filed in bankruptcy court. Oncor did not immediately comment on Elliott’s letter, while Berkshire was not immediately available for comment. Elliott declined to comment. Elliott’s disclosures came after Energy Future filed its new bankruptcy plan of reorganization on Friday. It proposed repaying the unsecured debt that Elliott holds at 18 cents on the dollar.  Should Elliott succeed in its offer for Energy Future its unsecured debt would have a recovery of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. Elliott holds $2.9 billion of Energy Future’s secured and unsecured debt, enough to try to block the reorganization plan with Berkshire, the people said.  Elliott built up most of its position in Energy Future’s debt after Texas regulators rejected NextEra’s offer earlier this year, causing bond prices to crash, the sources said. The hedge fund would break even on its debt investment if the Berkshire bid prevails because gains in some parts of its debt holdings, which would be paid out in full, would offset losses in the unsecured bonds it holds, where it would take a deep haircut, the people said. Elliott, known for its aggressive tactics including a 12-year battle over sovereign debt in Argentina, also may pursue litigation to block the deal, the sources said.  Elliott said in the letter it would support a deal with Berkshire or a third party if those bids exceeded the value proposed by the hedge fund. “We fear that the Berkshire transaction does not provide such value,” the hedge fund said in the letter. Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines.
