3,COP,US Cash Products-Chicago gasoline falls on unit restart," * Chicago gasoline down as Ohio refinery restarts unit  * Harbor gasoline slips on low demand for growing supply  (Updates with end-day Gulf prices)  HOUSTON, July 7 (Reuters) - Cash gasoline differentials in Chicago fell 7.00 cents a gallon on Thursday on news that a key unit restarted at an Ohio refinery, traders said.  Differentials jumped after Husky Energy Inc (HSE.TO) said it had restarted a crude distillation unit shut last week for a furnace repair at its 155,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Lima, Ohio, refinery. [ID:nWEN5130]  Ultra-low sulfur diesel in Chicago slipped 0.75 cent per gallon on the news. Husky said the refinery is operating at 80 percent capacity. [ID:nWNAB9345]  In the New York Harbor, gasoline differentials to the New York Mercantile Exchange’s August RBOB futures contract slid on Thursday as growing supply met tepid demand, traders said.  The prompt F2 RBOB differential shed a penny per gallon versus the screen, extending recent losses to more than 5.00 cents in a week as Canadian and Caribbean imports arrived, following last week’s crest at 14.00 cents over for prompt material.  Traders said another factor in the decrease was likely the ongoing restart of PBF Energy’s 182,000 Delaware City, Delaware, refinery. [ID:nN1E7660C5]  On the Gulf Coast, cash gasoline markets were steady on Thursday, though ultra-low sulfur diesel differentials showed a gain of half a penny per gallon and other distillates showed slight moves in thin trade, traders said.  The U.S. Energy and Information Administration said in its weekly inventory data release on Thursday that U.S. gasoline stocks fell 634,000 barrels, driven largely by a 935,000-barrel drop in Midwest stocks. [EIA/S]  Gulf Coast gasoline stocks gained 475,000 barrels, while East Coast stocks rose by a modest 68,000 barrels, the EIA said.  U.S. distillate stocks slipped 191,000 barrels despite a 1.98 million-barrel increase in East Coast inventories, the EIA said. Midwest distillate stocks fell by 773,000 barrels, and Gulf Coast stocks fell by 221,000 barrels.  U.S. refinery utilization rose 0.3 percentage points to 88.4 percent last week as gains in the East Coast and Gulf Coast regions slightly offset a significant decrease in the Midwest, the EIA data showed.  Midwest utilization slipped 8 percentage points to 87.9 percent, reflecting in part unit shutdowns for work or repairs at CVR Energy Inc’s (CVI.N)115,700 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas, and Husky’s Lima, Ohio plant.  Problems at ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) joint-venture 362,000 bpd refinery in Wood River, Illinois, also contributed to the dip, traders said.  Gulf Coast utilization climbed 4.1 percentage points to 92.8 percent last week as BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) restarted a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit, an ultracracker and a reformer at its 437,080 bpd refinery in Texas City, Texas.  East Coast utilization gained 3.2 percentage points to 75.8 percent, reflecting the restart of a reformer and hydrotreater at Sunoco Inc’s (SUN.N) 335,000 bpd refinery in Philadelphia.

6,COP,WRAPUP 2-Petrovietnam eyes oil assets in disputed South China Sea," * Company says deal would show Vietnam’s commitment to area   * Assets owned by ConocoPhillips, worth $1.5 bln-Petrovietnam   * Philippine foreign secretary meets Chinese counterpart   * Competing national claims in South China Sea   (Adds comment from Philippine foreign minister)	   By Ho Binh Minh	   HANOI, July 8 (Reuters) - Petrovietnam and its partners may buy $1.5 billion worth of Vietnamese oil and gas interests in the the South China Sea from ConocoPhillips to help protect Hanoi’s territorial claims, the chief executive of the state oil group said.	   Vietnam and the Philippines have protested against aggressive action by China in the dispute over the resource-rich area, which covers the world’s busiest sea lanes and also provides rich fishing.	   China has made the largest claim over the area, and Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines also claim territorial sovereignty.	   Petrovietnam’s chief executive Phung Dinh Thuc said ConocoPhillips may sell the oil assets because it was scaling back its presence, possibly as part of a restructuring. 	   He also said there was an opinion that this oil field’s development was at “a complicated stage” and production was no longer increasing. He did not say when a deal might be done.	   Thuc was quoted in a statement published by PV Oil, Petrovietnam’s marketing arm.	   The South China Sea dispute was discussed on Friday in talks in Beijing between Philippine foreign minister Albert del Rosario and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi.	   “Both ministers exchanged views on the maritime disputes and agreed not to let the maritime disputes affect the broader picture of friendship and cooperation between the two countries,” said del Rosario, who was reading from a joint press statement from both countries to reporters in Beijing. 	   “The two sides reaffirmed their commitments to respect and abide by the declaration on the conduct of parties in the South China Sea signed by China and the ASEAN member countries in 2002,” he said. 	   In a meeting with del Rosario, China’s Vice President Xi Jinping, who is likely to take over from President Hu Jintao in late 2012, said talks between Yang and del Rosario were “productive,” state news agency Xinhua reported.	   A political adviser to Philippine President Benigno Aquino said in Manila that the country had to carefully manage relations with both China and the United States in the territorial dispute.	   “We should know how to balance our interests between the two superpowers,” Ronald Llamas said at a forum, adding Manila should negotiate through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).	   “Smaller states must work together as a bloc and avoid taking any side. ASEAN should be a fulcrum to balance the interests of the U.S. and China. The problem can be avoided by not being partisan.”	   Tensions over sovereignty of the region have escalated this year. The Philippines and Vietnam have accused China of cutting the seismic cables of ships exploring for oil and gas, threatening to ram vessels and firing shots at fishermen.	   Last month the Philippine military reported an unidentified fighter jet harassed Filipino fishermen in the Spratlys, the second incident involving unidentified fighters since May.	   The Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, warned late last month of growing risks that incidents at sea involving China could lead to war, potentially drawing in the United States and other powers. 	   China wants one-to-one negotiations with each of the claimants rather than dealing with them within ASEAN and rejects any suggestion of U.S. involvement in the process.	   Beijing says it has historical sovereignty over the region, which it says supersedes claims of other countries under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).	   Officials at ConocoPhillips in Vietnam could not be reached for comment on Petrovietnam’s comments. Thuc spoke with domestic media on Tuesday, but his comments were not released until Friday.	   ConocoPhillips owns a 23.3 percent stake in a complex of five oil fields in block 15-1 in the area. It owns 36 percent of the Rang Dong oil field in block 15-2 in the Cuu Long basin and 16.3 percent in the Nam Con Son gas pipeline project, the PV Oil statement said, valuing ConocoPhillips’ total interests at $1.5 billion.	   In Block 15-1 its partners include Petrovietnam with a 50 percent interest, state-run Korea National Oil Corp with 14.2 percent, Korea’s SK Corp with 9 percent and Monaco’s Geopetrol with 3.5 percent.	   The firm’s partners in block 15-2 are Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co with 46.5 percent and Petrovietnam with 17.5 percent.	   In the Nam Con Son gas pipeline project BP has 32.7 percent and Petrovietnam owns 17.5 percent.	   Late last year, Petrovietnam said it had considered buying BP’s stakes in offshore oil projects, but later waived the option, paving the way for BP to sell them to its Russian joint venture, TNK-BP, for $1.8 billion.

10,COP,UPDATE 3-US oil reserve bids were double amount offered," * U.S. sold all 30.6 mln barrels of oil initially awarded  * Government hopes to deliver 7 mln barrels this month  * Valero, Vitol, Shell, Conoco get largest contracts  * Parnon Energy, PetroChina among those losing out  (Releads with companies bid for 62 million barrels of U.S. oil, ships available to transport oil)  By Tom Doggett and Ayesha Rascoe  WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. government received bids for more than double the amount of oil it was selling from its emergency reserves last month, and the first 7 million barrels are set to hit the market before August.  The latest details from the biggest-ever sale from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve showed for the first time just how great demand was, but also highlighted those who lost out, including one company targeted by regulators in a landmark manipulation case and China's top state-run oil firm.  The Energy Department confirmed it sold a total of 30.6 million barrels of SPR crude oil to 15 firms for an average $107.20 a barrel, details that were little altered from information released almost two weeks ago. But it added that it had offers for almost 62 million barrels of U.S. oil.  The DOE hopes to begin delivering 7 million barrels this month and the rest in August, a source told Reuters, providing the first indication of how much crude might soon begin showing up in commercial stocks or refinery runs. [ID:nWNA3343]  The White House last month ordered the oil sale as part of a coordinated release with the International Energy Agency of 60 million barrels of crude from the stockpiles of industrialized nations.  The distribution of oil is intended to offset the disruption in crude exports and the increase in world oil prices caused by unrest in Libya.  The IEA said the amount of emergency oil to be released by its other members would be slightly less than the 30 million barrels expected. [ID:nL6E7IB0C2]  It is unclear if the huge interest in the U.S. oil will prompt the Obama administration to have another oil sale.  ""The U.S. SPR release of 30.6 million barrels fulfilled the U.S. share under the IEA's collective action. The IEA and its members are evaluating the impact of that collective action and will determine next steps,"" a government source said. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  FACTBOX-Bidders on U.S. oil reserves      [ID:nN1E76A17U]  LINK-Energy Department's list of all offers:   r.reuters.com/hac62s  FACTBOX-IEA release statistics            [ID:nL6E7I80VV]  COLUMN-US oil release justified: Kemp     [ID:nLDE75Q0TS]  GRAPHIC-U.S. reserves         r.reuters.com/cah48r  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  PARNON, PETROCHINA OUT OF LUCK  DOE data released on Monday also showed offers that were rejected. Parnon Energy, which was recently charged by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with oil market manipulation, tried to buy 550,000 barrels for $102.83 each.  The CFTC said Parnon and London-based Arcadia, which didn't bid on the reserve oil, were part of a scheme that allegedly earned $50 million in illegal U.S. oil trading in 2008. [ID:nN25148525]  PetroChina International (0857.HK) (601857.SS) bid $103.89 a barrel for 500,000 barrels and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) bid $96.18 for 1.65 million barrels and $99.49 for 250,000 barrels. PetroChina is the largest oil and natural gas producer in China.  The losing bids from PetroChina and Parnon were close to the lowest winning bid, which came from Barclays Bank (BARC.L) at $104.98 for 200,000 barrels.  Some companies had a mix of successful and unsuccessful offers, but 10 were rejected outright, including commodities giant Glencore (GLEN.L), which bid $99.78 for 2 million barrels.  U.S. SALES PART OF IEA RELEASE  In the United States, the largest amounts of oil will go to Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), Vitol Inc, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Plains Marketing, Hess Corp (HES.N) and Marathon (MRO.N). The department said it will begin putting some of the U.S. reserve oil in the market this month, earlier than expected.  ""The Department is currently coordinating with the successful contract awardees, the Maritime Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate and streamline deliveries, including those for companies that have requested early delivery of the crude oil in July 2011,"" it said.  The department previously said deliveries of emergency oil would begin in August and be completed by the end of that month.  The delivery schedule is not final as companies still need to line up the vessels to transport the crude and get waivers from the federal Jones Act law to allow foreign-based ships to move the oil between U.S. ports, a government official said.  The Maritime Administration, which compiled a list of U.S. vessels able to transport reserve oil, said there are several ships available for leasing during the second half of this month that can hold from 171,000 to 330,000 barrels of crude.

11,COP,FACTBOX-Bidders on U.S. oil reserves," July 11 (Reuters) - Fifteen energy trading companies received contracts for crude oil from U.S. emergency stockpiles, the Department of Energy said on Monday.  The contract recipients matched a list of companies with ""apparently successful"" bids that was released by the department on July 1.  The United States is releasing 30 million barrels from its stockpiles, representing half of a coordinated international push to boost global supplies and combat rising oil prices.

12,COP,UPDATE 2-Bangladesh exports hit record on apparel sales," * Exports targets for 2011-12 at $26 bln, up 15 pct   * Exports up 41 pct in 2010-11, $4.4 bln above targets   * Slowdown in key western markets could hurt exports   (Add targets)	   DHAKA, July 12 (Reuters) - Strong apparel sales to China helped boost Bangladesh’s exports to a record $22.92 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30 but the garment industry is expecting a slowdown in the current quarter.	   Clothes exports climbed 43 percent to more than $17.9 billion, Export Promotion Bureau data showed on Tuesday.	   Bangladesh’s low labour costs have helped it join the global supply chain for low-end textiles and clothing. 	   Officials have said the record exports reflected the decision by some retail chains such as European-focused Esprit Holdings to shift production to Bangladesh from China, where labour costs are rising.	   This helped boost exports as the garments were then exported back to China. 	   Bangladesh’s total exports surged 41.5 percent during July-June, exceeding the target of $18.5 billion. The June total, $2.38 billion, was the highest ever monthly export figure.	   Mohammad Shafiul Islam, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, attributed the strong numbers in 2010-11 to the orders from China, January’s relaxation in import rules by the European Union and the global economic recovery.	   The Export Promotion Bureau  unveiled on Tuesday  its export target for the current fiscal year, which began on July 1, at $26.3 billion, up 15 percent from 2010-11, a slower pace of growth than the 41.5 percent last year. 	   “We have fixed the target considering signs of global economic slowdown in the key western world,” Jalal Ahmed, head of the Export Promotion Bureau. 	   “We anticipated a slowdown in exports growth after a massive growth in previous fiscal year  ,  “  Ahmed said. 	   The projected 2011-12 export target for garments is 20.29 billion. 	   Shafiul also said the outlook is not so buoyant, adding that July-September will be slower than a year ago as orders from buyers in Western economies are declining.	   Also affecting the outlook for Bangladesh’s exports at present are a power and gas crisis, high interest rates and a volatile political situation after a peaceful atmosphere.	   A series of anti-government strikes in recent weeks over issues ranging from constitution amendment to exploration pact with U.S. energy giant ConocoPhillips had crippled much of the country’s economic activities, which exporters said could cost millions of dollars in losses.	   Garments sector, which employs 3.5 million workers, is one of the main foreign exchange earners for Bangladesh’s more than $100 billion economy, along with remittances, which has recently seen a slower growth pace mainly due to turmoils in the key Middle eastern and north African countries.	   Remittances from more than 7 million Bangladeshi working abroad and robust garments sector also played key roles in lifting nearly 14 million people out of poverty over the five years to 2010.	   Bangladesh grapples with high inflation and swelling trade deficits, driven by costly fuel and oil imports, that analysts said to jeopardise the economic growth.

16,COP,ConocoPhillips to split in two; shares rise,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) will spin off its refining arm in a bid to improve investment returns for shareholders, abandoning the bigger-is-better strategy that drove oil giants into mergers.  As an integrated oil major with exploration and production, as well as refining and marketing, ConocoPhillips ranked sixth globally and was often overshadowed by larger rivals such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron (CVX.N).  By splitting the $107 billion Conoco into two, each unit becomes the No.1 pure play in their segments, a move the company hopes will attract new investors and boost market valuations.  Shares of Conoco initially jumped 7.5 percent on the news, but those gains faded and the stock closed up only 1.6 percent at $75.61 per share.  Some analysts welcomed the move and said it would unlock value in the exploration and production unit, which accounted for 80 percent of profit last year. But others said nothing fundamentally had changed in the business.  “I’m not a fan of these financial engineering maneuvers,” The Benchmark Co analyst Mark Gilman said. “I don’t see any incremental value associated with two separate companies.”  Conoco is the latest and biggest integrated oil company to break up, following Marathon Oil Co’s split, which was finalized on July 1. Other energy companies, such as Williams Cos (WMB.N) and El Paso Corp EP.N have sought split off operations to narrow their focus.  Conoco is the smallest of the oil majors that include Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP Plc (BP.L) and Total SA (TOTF.PA). Exxon and Chevron had strongly defended their integrated strategies in the past.  By splitting up, Conoco’s refining arm will become the top independent refiner in the U.S. above Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N). Similarly, its exploration and production business will become the biggest independent player in that market above Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N).  “We believe more value is created in the formation of two very clear, stand-alone companies,” said Chief Executive Jim Mulva, who will retire upon the completion of the split.  Conoco did not name new heads of the separate businesses.  The decision to split comes as confidence rises that global oil prices will remain strong for years as rising demand from China, India and other emerging markets soak up supplies.  Mulva “built this company in a different commodity price environment and different outlook,” said Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss Inc analyst and portfolio manager R. Lewis Ropp, “and now we have an opportunity to separate back and really get peer group multiples that are much higher than the integrated multiples investors are assigning to the company.”  The split should unlock value in the exploration and production business, which is very undervalued, said Ropp, who is a long-time owner of ConocoPhillips shares.  Raymond James analyst Stacey Hudson estimates Conoco’s two companies would have a combined value of $80 to $85 a share, or $113 billion to $120 billion.  The refining business would probably be worth about a quarter of that, Hudson said, although ConocoPhillips’ decision about where to place its pipelines and storage operation and chemical business could have an effect on the final value.  ConocoPhillips will be the first of the so-called super majors to shift away from a strategy that led the industry to consolidate into a handful of players with global reach in the oil and gas production and oil products businesses.  The announcement marks an abrupt change in the company’s views on a spin-off of its refining business. In March, Mulva was asked at an analysts’ meeting if he would consider a split as Marathon did.  He said in March: “I think for them, they’ve decided it seems to make sense and work for them. Whether that’s something that we should do, I don’t think so.”  Mulva told analysts on Thursday that the company began taking a hard look at options that included a spinoff for its refining business last fall.  In the past two years, ConocoPhillips embarked on a massive portfolio shift to sell up to $17 billion in assets and reduce its debt, while buying back shares and raising its dividend.  The plan to return cash to shareholders will continue at both companies. The exploration company will contemplate share repurchases in 2012, when the split is expected to be complete, while both companies will pay a dividend, Mulva said.  Strategies at both companies will remain the same, the executive told analysts.  ConocoPhillips’ exploration business will continue to shed mature oil and gas properties while looking to increase production and reserves that deliver good returns. The company’s refining arm will sell, shut or make joint ventures of refineries that are unable to process cheaper grades of crude oil, Mulva said.  Conoco’s oil and gas production fell more than 5 percent last year to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, but that business provided more than 80 percent of the company’s 2010 net profit.  ConocoPhillips said the transaction does not need a shareholder vote. The spinoff is subject to market conditions, regulatory approvals and the receipt of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ruling that approves its planned tax-free status.  The company has not decided what to do with its 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co LLC, a joint venture with Chevron Corp (CVX.N).

18,COP,Biggest US oil firms see refining as core strength," * Exxon, Chevron committed to downstream for technology   * No line of buyers to snap up refineries   * Breakdown of fully integrated model happening slowly   By Braden Reddall   SAN FRANCISCO, July 14 (Reuters) - The very biggest U.S. oil companies seem perfectly happy holding on to their refining arms given that expertise in processing oil and gas after extraction looks likely to be more in demand in the future.   Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) have thrown their weight behind their refining arms despite repeated questions about their value in the modern oil business.   The refining arm spin-off announced by ConocoPhillips (COP.N) on Thursday, coming just weeks after a similar move by Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N), inevitably led to speculation about who would move next. [ID:nL3E7IE1Z0]   Alan Gelder, head of downstream consulting at Wood Mackenzie, said Marathon’s success only made Conoco’s decision easier, since Conoco was already slimming its refining arm.   Yet “one size doesn’t fit all,” with oil companies taking a wide variety of strategic approaches. Anyway, he added, selling refineries has proven hard enough without a rush for the exits by every U.S. integrated oil company.   “We’re not aware of a line (of buyers) anywhere,” Gelder said, noting Murphy Oil Corp (MUR.N) announced plans to sell its refining business a year ago. [ID:nN22119712]   This follows years of a slow unraveling of the fully integrated model in oil, which goes back to John D. Rockefeller’s attempt to remove volatility from the business at Standard Oil — the predecessor of both Exxon and Chevron.   Unlike in early days of the oil business in the 19th century, there is little chance of an oil glut now, and far more risk of being stuck with too much refining capacity.   At first glance, the two businesses seem to be a perfect fit. But while rising prices for oil lead to swelling profits for oil producers, they can be a disaster for refiners: Pricey oil often pushes refiners’ profit margins into the red, as they find it harder to pass on price increases to retailers in a crowded market.   The emergence of dedicated and acquisitive refiners such as Valero (VLO.N) and PBF Energy underlines the specialization trend. Plus, pipelines and storage are run increasingly by third parties — such as Oiltanking Partners, which had a strong debut for its shares on Thursday. [ID:nN1E76D0A1]   Yet with much of the oil now being extracted getting harder to refine, Chevron Chief Executive John Watson told reporters in London in April that he could not think of a time in his 30 years at the company when being integrated made more sense.   “We believe it is central to our value proposition and executing our long-term growth strategy,” Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Thursday.   As for Exxon, the world’s largest private-sector oil company, it also values the technological expertise of the downstream, and notes its chemicals and refining business reported a 20 percent return in the last cycle.   “There’s no fire sales at Exxon Mobil,” Michael Dolan, a senior vice president, told analysts recently when asked about integration. “There’s just good, solid capital discipline.”   Canadian producers are also seen as likely to keep hold of their downstream arms given the unique challenges they face in producing the heavy oil north of the U.S. border. [ID:nN1E76D1T2]   Other major oil companies, however, have decided that the more consistent returns offered from exploration and production, with oil prices in the range of $100 per barrel, make that a preferable business in which to invest.   “If the upstream is going to be consistently good, then it probably doesn’t make sense to necessarily have refining assets,” said Dave Geddes, a refinery consultant who teaches refining economics at the Colorado School of Mines.   BP Plc (BP.L), having exited 10 refineries in a decade, is selling refineries in California and Texas. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has sold some in Europe due to overcapacity, and said in April it was closing one in Australia.

25,COP,COLUMN-Conoco gives up the supermajor dream-Campbell," — Robert Campbell is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own. —   By Robert Campbell   NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has hit on a neat trick for dealing with its unwanted oil refineries at a time when plenty of plants are on the block and there are few buyers: it has decided to give them away.   Conoco (COP.N) announced on Thursday it would spin off its downstream arm to shareholders by mid-2012, arguing that owning refineries was no longer an advantage in gaining access to new opportunities to explore for, and produce oil and gas.   Stock markets applauded the move, which comes less than four months after the company’s strategy meeting when it said its downstream focus was solely on shedding less profitable refineries.   Clearly the outperformance of the shares of smaller rival Marathon Oil (MRO.N) following its own decision to lop off its refining arm focused Conoco managers’ thoughts. (See Chart 1)   As recently as March, Conoco had talked of reducing its worldwide refining capacity of 2.4 million bpd by 500,000 bpd.   A slide on page 82 of its strategy presentation (see link) implied that seven of its 16 refineries were candidates for divestment or closure.   So is this a trend? Is it the unwinding of the supermajor movement from the late 1990s that saw the biggest oil companies race to bulk up, arguing they needed massive scale to tackle costly projects like deepwater and oil sands?   Is it also an admission that the Golden Age of refining, which saw even the least efficient U.S. refineries become hugely valuable as fuel demand soared before collapsing in 2008, is at an end?   It’s hard to say, but there seems to be more at play here than just responding to equity investors’ demand for more “pure play” companies. Refining may be struggling but in some places, like the U.S. Midwest, it is again enormously profitable.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Chart 1: r.reuters.com/cup62s  Conoco's strategy: r.reuters.com/vep62s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   MAJORS’ CAST-OFFS   Unlike Marathon, which had an enviable collection of refineries concentrated in the U.S. Midwest, where cheap crude and costly products produce bumper profits, most of Conoco’s assets are scattered outside that region and are under pressure.   First of all, a large number are the oil majors’ cast-offs, cannily purchased in the 1990s by Tom O’Malley, who gained fame and fortune for his contrarian bets on refining, buying up unwanted plants for a fraction of their cost as the majors sought to bolster profitability.   O’Malley sold the plants to Phillips at a huge profit in 2001 as the (short-lived) Golden Age of refining began.   With neither scale nor niche advantages, they’re not exactly premium assets, unless you can buy them for very little.   For instance, ConocoPhillips has a big refining presence on the U.S. East Coast, where margins are battered by high costs, heavy competition and a reliance on costly, imported light, sweet crude.   It also has a jumble of European assets, some acquired as part of the company’s earlier effort to buy its way into the supermajor ranks, including a small refinery in Ireland and another at Wilhelmshaven in Germany that has all but been permanently shut down.   Elsewhere, California’s low-carbon fuel standard looks set to heap pressure on Conoco’s two refineries there by curbing crude oil choices and cutting further into petroleum demand.   Oil demand in the rest of the United States is already forecast to drop lower, so while plants in the Midwest, which is structurally short of refined products, will be relatively shielded, less efficient refineries on the Gulf Coast will be fighting for their lives.   At the same time at least four refineries are up for sale in the United States along with a slew of plants in Europe so it is not exactly a sellers’ market, as evidenced by the reemergence of Mr O’Malley with his third refinery buyout vehicle, PBF Energy.   So is this the end of the supermajor era or is it just Conoco, which arguably never quite got to supermajor status, throwing in the towel after a decade of costly empire-building?   Certainly all the supermajors, even ExxonMobil, are selectively cutting refining.   Shell, Chevron and Total have all closed or sold refineries in Europe recently and BP is exiting much of its U.S. portfolio after cutting back sharply in Europe.   But they all seem to see some value in retaining at least their best performing refineries.   For Conoco, a company that has relied heavily on acquisitions in its upstream business, it may be that the drag of its refineries on its share price was perhaps getting too heavy to sustain its model of buying up smaller players.   Rather than accept discounted prices and delay as it negotiated the sale of individual plants the company has opted for a swift amputation of its downstream arm.

26,COP,Shell seeks sale of Canadian Mackenzie gas assets,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) has put its stake in the C$16.2 billion ($16.8 billion) Mackenzie gas project up for sale, the first crack in the partnership set up to develop vast reserves in Canada’s Arctic and build a pipeline to take the gas south.  Shell is seeking bidders for its 950 billion cubic foot Niglintgak natural gas field in the Mackenzie River Delta, as well as its 11.4 percent stake in the planned pipeline.  The move adds yet more uncertainty to a project that many observers believe suffers from shaky economics. Now several years behind its initial schedule, the Mackenzie project is under pressure because of high construction costs and questionable returns due to weak gas markets as the industry develops cheaper shale gas reserves across North America.  Still, Shell said the planned sale was part of its routine portfolio management and that it continues to have faith in the viability of the pipeline.  “Shell still believes the project is important for Canada,” said Stephen Doolan, a spokesman for the company.  Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO), the lead partner in the five-member consortium that has backed the project for more than a decade, still plans to go ahead with the line, its chief executive said on Friday.  “We’re still committed to try to make this project go forward,” Bruce March told Reuters. “We’re just pleased that (Shell) is getting started with the marketing effort.”  He declined to say if Shell had first offered its stake to project’s remaining partners.  Shell said it would market the interest to a wide group of potential buyers, but any purchaser would need deep pockets. Developing the Niglintgak field, the smallest of the three fields the pipeline would serve, would cost C$800 million according to regulatory filings.  A buyer would also need to pay Shell’s share of the C$7.05 billion pipeline.  Though the construction of the line was approved by regulators earlier this year, the project has been stalled as the backers seek a deal with the federal government that would see Ottawa pay for roads, airstrips and other permanent infrastructure in the sparsely populated Northwest Territories, in order to reduce the project’s financial risk.  Although he did not comment on the progress of the fiscal negotiations for the Mackenzie project, Joe Oliver, Canada’s natural resources minister, said he believed the project is still viable, despite Shell’s exit.  “My understanding is that their investment is relatively small for the size of the company that they are. It was explained to me by their president that it wasn’t a strategic investment so I don’t draw any broader conclusions from that,” Oliver told reports following a speech in Calgary.  The planned pipeline is only a small part of Shell’s Canadian operations. The company also has the country’s third-largest oil sands project and is expanding its western natural gas production, as well as examining the feasibility of building a liquefied natural-gas facility on the West Coast.  The sale “might be a signal that they don’t want to have to manage too many projects,” said Michael Dunn, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital.  The planned pipeline would carry up to 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily nearly 1,200 km (750 miles) south from the Mackenzie Delta on the Beaufort Sea to Alberta’s pipeline network. The current start-up estimate is 2018.  Other partners in the pipeline project, include ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline LP.

28,COP,Analysis: Many U.S. energy companies seen ripe for picking,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy exploration companies like Range Resources (RRC.N), Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N) and Cabot Oil and Gas Inc (COG.N) have something that bigger oil companies desperately want: extensive acreage in U.S. shale basins.  Those companies and a long list of others are considered by Wall Street analysts to be takeover targets as a perfect storm for deal-making brews.  Sustained low natural gas prices have left some of the smaller companies vulnerable after they spent heavily to amass large areas to drill, while big companies are awash in cash. Crude prices around $100 per barrel have also piqued interest in companies that own acres in oil-rich basins like the Eagle Ford and Permian in Texas.  “The large U.S. players all the way to the international companies have more cash than they know what to do with and a longer time horizon to develop the assets,” said Neal Dingmann, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.  Mining giant BHP Billiton Plc’s (BHP.AX) planned takeover of Petrohawk Energy Corp (HK.N) for an eye-popping $12 billion pushed shares of potential targets sharply higher on Friday and is prompting a rush of speculation about who might be next.  “I think the key idea out there is you are looking for players that have a lead position in a basin,” said Andrew Coleman, an analyst with Raymond James. “Who I think looks most interesting are Cabot and Whiting.”  Cabot has acreage in the Permian Basin in Texas as well as positions in the Haynesville Shale, which straddles the Texas-Louisiana border. Whiting has acreage in the Permian and the oil-rich Bakken Shale in North Dakota.  Range Resources has substantial acreage in the Marcellus Shale in the U.S. Northeast. That basin is prized for its proximity to large natural gas consuming markets.  Companies that might bulk up on U.S. shale, bankers and analysts say, include ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and foreign companies looking to take advantage of a weak dollar.  “Bigger companies are looking to add value,” said one investment banker not authorized to speak on the record. “Shales are clearly part of their overall strategy and you’ve got to look at who the owners are of higher quality shale. It doesn’t need to be a corporate transaction. Corporate transactions are tough to do, and there are lots of ways to capture shales.”  Shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) flew 7 percent higher on Friday after news of the Petrohawk deal. But a number of analysts played down the possibility of a takeover.  Chesapeake has acreage in nearly every major U.S. shale basin, including 450,000 acres in the red-hot Eagle Ford Shale. But the company’s structure is complex and it has already formed a number of joint ventures for its shale assets.  “People are saying Chesapeake and EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) are targets, but those companies are awfully large,” said John White, an analyst at Triple Double Advisors, an energy investment management firm in Houston. “And Chesapeake is such a beast in terms of its structure, they have so many JVs, it would be quite a structural challenge.”  ",7152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-shale-deals/analysis-many-u-s-energy-companies-seen-ripe-for-picking-idUSTRE76E50S20110715

It is challenging.”	   Asked whether SABIC was interested in any assets being divest as a result of the split-up of ConocoPhillips and the divestment of its refining arm, announced three days ago, Mady declined to say whether it was a possibility.	   “We always look at everything, and match it with company strategy,” he said. “We always evaluate these opportunities, we are always on the lookout for very important acquisitions and for organic growth.”	   Bolstered by robust growth in China, India and the Middle East, results for the latest quarter came in well above analysts’ forecasts, beating the average for 7.1 billion riyals and the highest estimate of 7.7 billion.	   “India is a huge market, the (Indian) government is thinking of attracting new investments and SABIC is looking at investments in India — if there are any good investments in petrochemicals there, products from refineries,” Mady said. 	   “If there are refineries attached to petrochemical plants we will be looking at that.”	   SABIC has an advantage over rivals in terms of profitability because it pays a government-subsidised 75 cents per million BTU (British Thermal Unit) for gas feedstock, a fraction of the cost on international markets.	   In terms of projects, Mady said a decision would be made this year on SABIC affiliate Saudi Arabian Fertilizers Co.’s (Safco) proposed 1 million tonne urea factory in Jubail.

33,COP,Partners could buy Shell Mackenzie stake: analysts,"   * Shell’s Mackenzie project stake could be tough sell   * Imperial, Exxon seen as logical buyers   * Could be foreign interest in Shell assets   CALGARY, Alberta, July 18 (Reuters) - Buyers could be scarce for Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s (RDSa.L) stake in the planned C$16.2 billion ($16.9 billion) Mackenzie gas project in Canada’s Arctic, but the pipeline’s other backers may be the most logical buyers, analysts said on Monday.   Shell put its 11.4 percent stake in the long-delayed natural gas pipeline up for sale last week, along with the Arctic gas fields the line would tap, including the 950 billion cubic foot Niglintgak field.   The pipeline, running from the Mackenzie River Delta on the Beaufort Sea to southern markets, was first proposed in the 1970s but received regulatory approval less than a year ago.   Shell said the planned sale was part of its routine portfolio management activities and that it continues to have faith in the viability of the pipeline, as do others in the project’s five-member consortium.    “We’re optimistic that someone is going to come in because Shell’s assets in the Mackenzie Delta are proven assets ... and we have our (regulatory) certificate,” said Orland Hansen, a spokesman for the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline LP, which has a one-third stake in the project.   The sale adds yet more uncertainty to a project many observers believe may be unprofitable to build and could make make finding a buyer for a line that wouldn’t deliver gas until 2018 a challenge.   “The Mackenzie Valley (pipeline) doesn’t really matter any more to most people,” said Andrew Potter, an analyst at CIBC World Markets. “It’s just so far out.”   Now several years behind its initial schedule, the Mackenzie project is under economic pressure because of high construction costs and uncertain returns due over-supplied gas markets as the industry develops cheaper shale gas reserves across North America that are closer to markets and existing infrastructure.   “Shell walking away clearly indicates they see better natural gas opportunities elsewhere globally,” said Chris Feltin, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Markets. “It would probably make the most sense for one of the other operators to consolidate (the stake) if they do have a much longer-term horizon for that stranded gas.”   Along with the Aboriginal Pipeline partners, the other owners in the project include Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO), with a 34.4 percent stake, ConocoPhillips (COP.N), with 15.7 percent, and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), with 5.2 percent. Exxon also has a majority stake in Imperial Oil.   ConocoPhillips, which is in the midst of planning to split into two companies, is seen as an unlikely bidder for Shell’s stake.   But analysts say it would make the most sense for Imperial, the operator of the Mackenzie project, or Exxon, to acquire the Shell stake.   “Exxon or Imperial would be top of the list,” Potter said. “You wonder if they would move to consolidate the interest and keep the project moving along.”   Bruce March, Imperial’s chief executive, said on Friday the company remained committed to the project despite Shell’s planned sale.   Foreign buyers looking for natural gas reserves may also be one the list of potential bidders. A number of Asian companies have moved to acquire Canadian gas assets recently, a list that includes national oil companies (NOCs) such as Malaysia’s Petronas  [PETR.UL] and Korea Gas Corp (036460.KS).   “I wouldn’t be surprised to see some NOCs step in and take a long-dated call option to try to secure some natural gas potential,” said Macquarie’s Feltin.   Asian companies have mostly shown an interest in the massive shale gas reserves of northeastern British Columbia, which could eventually be exported through a planned gas liquefaction facility on the Pacific Coast, though Korea Gas recently acquired a stake in an undeveloped gas field in the Arctic owned by MGM Energy Corp MGX.TO.   Shell expects to find a buyer by the end of August.   The line would carry up to 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily nearly 1,200 km (750 miles) to Alberta’s pipeline network from the Mackenzie Delta.

36,COP,Trans Alaska Pipeline restarts after planned weekend shutdown," July 17 (Reuters) - The Trans Alaska Pipeline System restarted Sunday afternoon at the end of a scheduled maintenance shutdown, the system’s operator said.	   The 800-mile line was shut down Saturday morning to allow several major projects, many at pump stations, to be completed in a coordinated fashion. The system restarted at about 3:30 p.m. Alaska time, said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., operator of the 800-mile line.	   Pipeline operations were able to resume sooner than expected because the maintenance projects were completed more quickly than the 36 hours that had been scheduled, Alyeska said.	   It will likely take at least another 24 hours for oil flow to increase to normal summer levels, said Michelle Egan, spokeswoman for Alyeska.	   Average throughput in June was 571,286 barrels per day, according to Alyeska’s website. Summer production at the North Slope is usually lower than winter production because of reservoir dynamics.	   The maintenance shutdown went as planned, Egan said.	   “Everything went great and we got all of the projects finished,” she said.	   Projects that were completed included replacement of large valves at Pump Station 4, located 145 miles south of Prudhoe Bay, replacement of piping at the Pump Station 11 site, about 685 miles, south of Prudhoe Bay, modifications at other pump stations and major maintenance work at the Valdez marine terminal.	  Alyeska usually stages one or two scheduled maintenance shutdowns each summer, allowing North Slope oil producers to conduct major maintenance projects at the same time.	   This was Alyeska’s only scheduled maintenance shutdown for this summer, Egan said.  	  Alyeska is a consortium owned by companies with interests on the North Slope. Major owners are BP , ConocoPhillips  and Exxon Mobil .

37,COP,Australia to help key resources state bring in workers," CANBERRA, July 19 (Reuters) - Australia will adjust immigration laws to help businesses in resource powerhouse Western Australia state plug a skills gap threatening to crimp exports, by bringing more workers from overseas, the government said on Tuesday.	   Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said he would widen a regional migration scheme designed to make recruitment of semi-skilled foreign workers faster and less restrictive to include the West Australian capital Perth.	   “The simple fact is that there will not be enough Australian workers to get the job done,” Bowen said.	   A record A$380 billion in mining investment, four times Australia’s average for the past 30 years, was expected to lead to a shortage of 36,000 trades-people by 2015, Bowen said.	   Western Australia as a whole expects a shortage of 150,000 skilled workers by 2017 as infrastructure and resource investments across the state gather pace.	    Mining giants Rio Tinto  , BHP Billiton   and Fortescue are all well entrenched expanding their iron ore operations amid a once-in-a-century mining boom driven by demand from Asia.	   And firms like Woodside , ConocoPhillips , Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) BG Group , Chevron , Santos and Origin are pouring cash into country’s natural gas and coal seam gas sector.	   Bowen said the immigration changes would make it easier for employers to get semi-skilled workers from overseas and help them transition to permanent residency in Australia.	   The government said in its May budget that it would try to ease a shortage of skilled workers that threatened to fuel inflation, lifting skilled migration by 10,000 to 125,850 in a move that resource companies said did not go far enough.

38,COP,US W. Coast Products-L.A. gasoline falls on inventory data," HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Wholesale gasoline differentials in Los Angeles seesawed on Wednesday, reversing an early gain after U.S. government inventory data showed builds in refined products stocks in the region, traders said.  Unleaded ethanol-blend July-delivery CARBOB in L.A. was seen done early at 17.50 and 18.50 cents under the August RBOB contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange RBQ1, up more than 2 cents per gallon from Tuesday’s levels.  Differentials retreated about 4 cents per gallon after weekly inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed gasoline and distillate stock builds in the region last week as well as higher refinery utilization.  July CARBOB traded at 20, 21 and 22 cents under August NYMEX RBOB, traders said.  The EIA said West Coast gasoline stocks climbed 685,000 barrels, which drove a 757,000-barrel jump in U.S. gasoline inventories. West Coast distillate stocks gained 457,000 barrels last week, the EIA said. [EIA/S]  Refinery utilization rose 2.1 percentage points to 88.8 percent in the region last week, reflecting equipment start-ups on completion of planned work at ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) 120,200-barrels-per-day refinery in Rodeo, California. [ID:nWNAB9630]  August-delivery L.A. CARBOB was seen done 9, 10.5, 10.75, 11 and 13 cents under, traders said.

August CARB diesel differentials in Los Angeles tightened about 0.75 cent to 2.5 cents/4.25 cents over the August NYMEX heating oil contract.  Los Angeles jet fuel for July delivery was steady at 6 cents/7 cents over August NYMEX heating oil.  In the Portland, Oregon market, gasoline was seen done at 10 cents under August NYMEX RBOB, flat with Tuesday’s levels.  Portland diesel differentials were pegged at 4 cents/3 cents under August NYMEX heating oil, down a penny per gallon.

39,COP,UPDATE 1-Russia's LUKOIL joins Sierra Leone project," * Acquires 49 pct stake in offshore block from Oranto	   * LUKOIL’s second West African project after Ghana	   * First exploration well must be drilled before 2013	   (adds background on African oil, details on project)	   MOSCOW, July 20 (Reuters) - Russia’s second largest oil producer, LUKOIL said on Wednesday it bought a 49 percent stake in an offshore block in Sierra Leone, as the company moves to build its portfolio of African oil assets.	   LUKOIL, which replaced only 84 percent of its 2010 production with new reserves, is pinning its hopes on overseas ventures, including offshore exploration and production in another West African country, Ghana, and a major oil project in Iraq.	   With global on-land oil supplies becoming more scarce, other global majors are also scrambling for contracts to explore the waters off the coast of West Africa for oil.	   Chevron said earlier this month that it plans to drill its first deepwater well off the coast of Liberia in the fourth quarter this year. 	   LUKOIL has already drilled several wells in the Gulf of Guinea as part of a joint venture with Vanco and Ghana’s National Petroleum Corporation. It hopes to find reserves of 150-250 million barrels of oil. 	   LUKOIL bought the majority stake in the offshore Sierra Leone block with an area of 4,022 square kilometres from Nigeria’s firm Oranto Petroleum.	   “The framework of agreement provides for the drilling of one exploration well before 2013,” the company said in a statement.

41,COP,World Bank to hear Koch arbitration against Venezuela," * Chavez nationalized Koch fertilizer plant in 2010	   * Multiple Venezuela arbitration cases outstanding	   By Diego Ore	   CARACAS, July 19 (Reuters) - The World Bank will hear an arbitration case requested by U.S. company Koch Industries after Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez nationalized a fertilizer plant it owned with the OPEC nation’s state oil firm.	   On Tuesday, The World Bank’s investment dispute body ICSID said on its website it will form a tribunal to hear the complaint by two subsidiaries of Koch, one of the world’s largest privately owned companies.	   In recent years, Chavez has put large parts of the economy into state hands, including much of the OPEC nation’s vast oil industry.	   The two brothers who own Koch industries are vocal free-market advocates and powerhouses in U.S. conservative politics. Their subsidiaries had for years worked with Venezuela’s government-owned PDVSA at the fertilizer factory.	   Italy’s Eni also owned a share of the Fertinitro plant that was nationalized in October. It is one of the world’s largest nitrogen-based fertilizer factories.	   ICSID announced the new arbitration on its website (icsid.worldbank.org/).  It did not give a figure for compensation being sought by Koch.	   The company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for information on Tuesday evening.	   Currently, Venezuela faces more than a dozen international disputes with foreign companies, many stemming from Chavez’s nationalization drive. Two cases brought by Exxon Mobil  and ConocoPhillips could cost Venezuela several billion dollars.

42,COP,CORRECTED - Conoco seeks to boost Calif. refinery throughput," (Corrects to say two refinery sections far apart and connected via pipeline, not adjacent)   * Company wants permit to increase throughput   * Overall capacity of 120,000 bpd would remain the same   * Project unrelated to refining spinoff plan-spokesman   By Kristen Hays   HOUSTON, July 21 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is seeking California state permits to run more crude oil at its 120,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Rodeo, California, a spokesman said.   Spokesman Rich Johnson said the project would not involve new construction or expansion. It would involve expanding throughput by 10 percent at the Arroyo Grande section of the refinery, about 200 miles from Rodeo in Santa Maria, California.   The sections are connected via pipeline and considered a single complex, Johnson said. The Santa Maria section provides semi-refined products to the Rodeo complex for upgrading into finished petroleum products.   “It’s really a matter of having the necessary permits that would allow us to run more crude at Santa Maria that the existing equipment is already capable of processing, but is limited by current permits,” Johnson said.   He said the throughput increase would provide more flexibility in running the refinery, which would still run the same California-based crude. Its overall capacity of 120,000 bpd would remain unchanged.   Johnson said the current permit allows the Santa Maria section to process 44,500 bpd annually, and the proposed increase would boost that to 49,950 bpd.   ConocoPhillips started seeking permits to boost that throughput in 2008. Johnson said the project was unrelated to ConocoPhilips’ announcement last week that it will spin off its refining arm into a separate company next year.   Local pollution and planning regulators aim to draft an environmental impact report by mid-August, which will be subject to public review and comment, Johnson said.

46,COP,"Shell, ConocoPhillips get draft Alaska air permits"," By Yereth Rosen  ANCHORAGE, Alaska, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. federal regulators said on Friday they issued draft air-quality permits to Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), a key step for the oil companies’ drilling plans in Arctic waters of Alaska.  The permits cover Shell’s plans to drill two wells annually in 2012 and 2013 on leases in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska’s northern coast, and ConocoPhillips’ plans to drill a yet-to-be-determined number of wells in 2012 the Chukchi Sea, off Alaska’s northwest coast.  The draft permits are subject to a 45-day public comment period before being made final. Any final permits are also subject to potential administrative appeals.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on July 1 issued a separate draft air-quality permit to Shell for a drill rig the company intends to use starting next year in the Chukchi. That permit is a revised version of one that was struck down on Dec. 30 by EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board. The appeals panel determined the old permit was inadequate and failed to incorporate updated limits for air pollution.  Securing the draft air-quality permits for planned operations in both the Beaufort and Chukchi is an important milestone for Shell, a company spokesman said.  “The issuance of a second draft air permit for our 2012 exploration program is another in a series of recent, positive developments and adds to our optimism that we will be drilling our offshore leases in Alaska by this time next year,” Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said in an email.  Shell had hoped to drill at least one well in the Beaufort this year, but dropped that plan after the EPA Appeals Board rejected the permit that had been issued last year by EPA’s Seattle-based regional office.  Shell now has new detailed exploration plans for both the Chukchi and Beaufort that are being reviewed by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). Shell plans to drill up to 10 wells total in the open-water seasons of 2012 and 2013.  The company spent $2.1 billion acquiring leases in the Chukchi in 2008 and about $84 million acquiring leases in the Beaufort in 2005 and 2007. In both areas, Shell plans to explore prospects where oil was discovered in the past.  ConocoPhillips, which also acquired exploration tracts in the Chukchi in the record $2.66 billion 2008 lease sale, has not yet submitted an exploration plan to the BOEMRE, company spokeswoman Natalie Lowman said.  “So the number of wells and exactly which rig we will use is undetermined right now,” she said.

The installation, in which the company wants to replace existing coker drums at the 58,000 barrel-per-day refinery, is not expected to increase production or change the crude slate at the refinery, spokesman Rich Johnson said in an email.   Johnson said the transportation company, Emmert, is mobilizing personnel and preparing to resume travel starting Monday. The loads are expected to reach their destination around Aug. 5.   The load weighing up to 323 tons (293 tonnes) and stretching 225 feet (68.58 meters), is moving from the port of Lewiston, Idaho, to the state’s border with Montana.   On Nov. 2, last year, the Idaho Supreme Court lifted a lower court order that prevented Conoco from moving the megaloads along a rural highway across the state.   Residents along Highway 12 sought to block the contractor for Conoco from moving the coking unit drums citing a blockage of the only roadway they could use to reach hospitals or for police and fire departments to reach their homes.   Spokesman Johnson said Conoco had no legal or regulatory issues pending with regard to the shipments.   “We have been delayed since the end of May due to flooding in the region,” Johnson said.   The drums were planned to move in four shipments.   Last week, Conoco said it will spin off its refining arm in a bid to improve investment returns for shareholders  in hopes each arm would be worth more as a separate company.

48,COP,"Analysis: Australia shale gas heats up, but output still far off","PERTH (Reuters) - Australia’s fledgling shale gas sector is picking up steam, but significant production is still at least a decade away, even if the industry clears hurdles such as high costs, a growing shortage of labor and environmental concerns.  Global shale gas exploration and production has taken off in recent years, particularly in the United States, where rising production has cut the need for the world’s largest economy to import gas, instead turning the country into a gas exporter.  But shale gas faces a bumpier ride in Australia, where drilling costs are triple those of the United States, labor costs about 50 percent higher, and the continent’s vast distances and infrastructure deficiencies will slow progress.  A recent flurry of activity in shale gas has awakened speculation the new energy source could lead Australia’s next wave of energy growth, after the nation’s A$70 billion coal seam gas industry.  “There’s very high potential. The amount of shale that’s available is more than even coal bed methane. But I don’t see significant shale production this decade,” said Tony Regan, an analyst with Tri-Zen International in Singapore.  “We’ll have pilot plants and people will declare first production, but it will be relatively small quantities. It’s going to be small production within the next five to ten years, but could become substantial after 2020.”  Australia has 396 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, the U.S. Energy Information Agency says, equivalent to about 46 percent of U.S. reserves.  ConocoPhillips this month became the first U.S. major to step into the Australian industry and Australian energy explorer and producer Beach Energy tapped its first shale gas well with results that were better than expected.  Australian oil and gas explorer New Standard Energy has made a preliminary agreement to farm some of its shale gas acreage in Western Australia’s Canning Basin to ConocoPhillips for A$109.5($118.703) million.  Also in July, Beach Energy’s first shale gas well in central Australia’s Cooper Basin produced 2 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d), five to ten times the company’s expectations.  Top global miner BHP Billiton, also known as “the Big Australian,” placed its bet on shale gas when it announced mid-month it would buy U.S. Petrohawk Energy Corp for $12.1 billion in cash, representing a 65 percent premium.  Although the company said it was not looking to acquire Australian shale gas assets, some speculated the mining giant might bring shale gas expertise to future investments.  “This sector is going to take off at some point and I think we are right at the early stages. I liken it to the early days of what happened on the east coast with coalbed methane,” Sam Willis, managing director of New Standard Energy, said.  Proponents say Australian shale gas could take a course similar to that of the U.S. industry.  “We’re sort of where America was 10 years ago,” said Chris Jamieson, investor relations manager at Beach Energy, adding that he saw Beach having some small commercial operations by 2014 to 2015.  Others say the U.S. shale gas industry was 20 years in the making and emerged when U.S. gas prices exceeded $6 per million British thermal units; natural gas prices in the U.S. have since fallen to about $4 per mmBtu as shale gas brought a supply glut.  High costs that have plagued more conventional gas development as well as Australia’s other mining and resource projects will also pose a challenge for shale gas.  Australian shale gas drilling costs are about three times those of the United States partly because of tight labor supply, and although industry growth will bring costs down, they are only likely to drop to one and a half to two times those in the United States, Citigroup analysts said in a recent note.  “Australia is already suffering skilled labor shortages due to the boom in the coal seam methane, LNG and mining industries. We understand labor costs in the Australian petroleum industry are currently 40 to 50 percent higher than in the U.S., which has a flow on effect to both cost of services and supplies,” Citigroup analysts, led by Mark Greenwood said in a recent note.  And environmental concerns have been stirred by “hydro-fracking, a drilling technique that shoots water and chemicals into shale rock at high pressure to produce the gas, particularly over how the technique could affect water quality, prompting a ban by Australia’s New South Wales state.  The vastness of the distances and lack of infrastructure also pose challenges— natural resources are often thousands of kilometers from the nearest town, with nothing in between.  “It’s not like you can get a rig from the next county. A lot of people just don’t realize the logistics,” Peter Strachan, an analyst with Stock Analysis in Perth.  Australia’s shale gas reserves are scattered across the huge continent, with the most advanced operations in the center-east Cooper Basin. The Canning Basin lies in the Great Sandy Desert in the northwest, with the Perth Basin on the west coast.  Shale gas projects, which will produce cleaner-burning natural gas, could get a boost if Australia’s A$23 per tonne proposed carbon tax moves forward.  The tax could increase Australia’s demand for gas as it weans itself off coal.  “If we get this carbon tax, surely there’s going to be upward pressure on east coast gas prices,” Adrian Wood, an analyst with Macquarie in Sydney, said.  Australia’s east coast, home to its major population centers, is relatively accessible from the Cooper Basin, where Beach Energy is exploring for shale gas.  “You are closing down a lot of these more dirty power stations in South Australia and Victoria and you can supplement that with gas-powered stations fired potentially with shale gas from the Cooper,” Wood said.

49,COP,BP investors turn up heat on CEO Dudley,"LONDON, Jul (Reuters) - BP boss Bob Dudley is under pressure to clear up confused strategy and revive the oil giant’s share price when it reports second-quarter earnings next week that will lag well behind its peers.  A year after BP staunched the massive leak at its Gulf of Mexico well, investors say Dudley still has not set the company on the road to recovery and big plans for emerging markets growth have fallen flat.  On Tuesday BP unveils its second-quarter earnings, which will reflect a drop in production after it sold some oil fields to pay for the cost of the U.S. spill.  While a 50 percent jump in crude prices is predicted to boost BP profits 21 percent to $6.0 billion, the improvement is likely to look anemic compared to BP’s rivals. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are both forecast to report a 50 percent jump in second-quarter net income.  Earlier this year Dudley — who replaced Tony Hayward as chief executive nine months ago — announced an emerging markets growth strategy. It involved a flurry of deals constructed around a centerpiece $16-billion share-swap and multi-billion dollar Arctic exploration deal with Kremlin-controlled Rosneft.  That deal fell apart in the face of opposition from BP’s partners in another Russian venture, TNK-BP. Meanwhile analysts have concluded that the other deals in India, China and Indonesia are mostly not material and offer only tight margins. The deal-making has since dried up.  “Investors feel that the company has slightly lost its way,” Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management.  “You need to have some clear guidance on where the company is going in the future, and how they are going to advance their strategy,” he added.  Compounding the confusion, BP has made much of the strategic importance of the North Sea to its future growth at a time when investors have been pressing oil firms to shift the focus away from its declining reserves toward more prospective oil basins.  BP decided earlier this month to invest 3 billion pounds in the extension of a North Sea field.  In addition to receiving detail on Dudley’s broader vision for BP, investors will also want some reassurance that the Russian spat, which flared up again this week, will not prove a major risk to BP’s TNK-BP stake or require major payments to settle.  Analysts had predicted a rapid share price recovery after BP’s leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well was capped in September last year, bringing to an end the daily vilification of the company by the U.S. media.  BP has since received a $1 billion contribution toward the cost of the spill from well partner Mitsui, and equipment provider Weatherford agreed to pay $75 million. The Mitsui settlement means BP is unlikely to face a charge of gross negligence — which could cut the potential cost of the spill bill by tens of billions of dollars.  Nonetheless, the London-based company’s shares have gained little in the past nine months. BP’s market capitalization still stands at a 50 percent discount to the value of its assets, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate.  This kind of scenario would normally expose a company to takeover but in BP’s case this seems unlikely. The only companies large enough to do it are state-owned Asian energy giants such as CNPC — whose bid would probably be blocked by Washington because of BP’s US assets — and rivals Exxon, Chevron and Shell.  However these last three would be reluctant to buy a company with so many legal uncertainties hanging over it, and analysts say only some of BP’s assets would be of interest.  BREAK-UP?  Some analysts, bankers and investors are beginning to ask whether the best way for BP to address its valuation discount is to break itself up.  “The risks to the ownership structure are greater now than they were 12 months ago. Twelve months ago the board could say, ‘we’ve got to deal with Macondo’. Now they have no excuse,” a banker who has advised the company said.  ConocoPhillips’s decision to spin off its oil refining and fuel retail unit last week boosted its shares and some observers have suggested that BP should do the same.  However, following the sale of individual refineries and service station chains over the past decade and other planned refinery sales, only a small fraction of BP’s capital is tied up in ‘downstream’ operations.  Analysts are increasingly arguing in favor of something more dramatic — the spin off of BP’s U.S. assets into a new company, the sale of its Russian unit TNK-BP, and the creation of a new company focused on BP’s assets in places such as Angola, Brazil and Asia.  “Bob Dudley should go the whole hog and hive off the US (‘Amoco’) and N Sea (‘Britoil’) businesses to renew BP - no longer ‘Beyond Petroleum’ but as ‘BRIC-ish Petroleum’ - a higher growth global player,” analysts at Investec argued in a research note last month.  Such a big move is not expected while tens of billions of dollars worth of lawsuits remain outstanding. However, some legal experts predict the biggest cases and potential fines will be settled before the U.S. presidential election next year, paving the way for such a breakup.

50,COP,UPDATE 2-Murphy Oil announces sale of smallest refinery," (Updates with detail, background; adds byline)   By Kristen Hays   HOUSTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Murphy Oil Corp (MUR.N) announced on Monday it sold the smallest of its three refineries for $214 million plus inventory, bringing the company a step closer to shedding refining to focus solely on exploration and production.   The company said Indianapolis, Indiana-based Calumet Specialty Products Partners L.P. (CLMT.O), a U.S. refiner of specialty products such as petroleum waxes and solvents, would buy Murphy’s 34,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) oil refinery in Superior, Wisconsin.   The inventory was valued at $260 million as of June 30, the company said. El Dorado, Arkansas-based Murphy said the deal was expected to close late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter this year.   Murphy’s shares were unchanged in post-market trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $69.52 per share.   A year ago, Murphy announced it would sell its three refineries and exit that business. The other plants, a 125,000 bpd refinery in Meraux, Louisiana, and a 130,000 bpd refinery in Milford Haven, Wales, remain for sale.   While Murphy is seeking to sell all of its refineries, two of its larger integrated peers chose to spin off refining and marketing arms into separate companies.   Marathon Oil Corp’s (MRO.N) refining, transportation and marketing arm split off into Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) on June 30. Earlier this month, ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the smallest of the so-called super-majors, said it would spin off its refining arm next year, creating the largest U.S. independent refining and exploration and production companies.   The Wisconsin refinery benefits from cheap crude priced off of depressed West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude futures benchmark. A glut of crude at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point of the New York Mercantile Exchange contract has kept the WTI at a double-digit discount to London’s Brent crude for months, giving Midwest refiners access to cheaper crudes than peers in other regions.   “Meraux is five times bigger, but will probably sell for only double Superior, but the inventory value could be much higher,” said Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.   He expects the Meraux plant to sell sometime in the third quarter this year and the Wales plant in the first quarter next year. The total net after tax proceeds for all three plants could top $1 billion, he added.

53,COP,Cenovus CEO sees new oil sands partner by year-end,"   * “World class” holdings include Telephone Lake   * Not limiting potential deal structures   * ConocoPhillips split seen having little impact   By Jeffrey Jones   CALGARY, Alberta, July 26 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) expects to announce a joint venture by the end of the year to develop Alberta oil sands holdings that are not currently part of a 10-year growth plan, its chief executive said on Tuesday.   Cenovus has hired RBC Capital Markets and Barclays Capital to assist in its search for a partner to take a stake in a portion of the company’s early-stage Borealis holdings. That would include a wholly-owned prospect called Telephone Lake.   “This, I would characterize, will be a world-class opportunity that we’re taking to market here in terms of the size and the scale of it, but I don’t want to get into specifics at this point,” Chief Executive Brian Ferguson told analysts.   Cenovus is seeking to revise its application with regulators for Telephone Lake to 90,000 barrels a day from 35,000.   A joint venture would be in addition to the company’s alliances with ConocoPhillips (COP.N). The two currently operate the producing Foster Creek and Christina Lake, Alberta, steam-driven oil sands projects and plan to develop a new 130,000 bpd project called Narrows Lake.   They also have 50-50 stakes in refineries in Wood River, Illinois, and Borger, Texas.   Expansion of the oil sands projects is key to a plan by Cenovus to lift its production to half a million barrels a day in a decade, up from an expected 150,000 by year-end 2011.   The Borealis holdings do not currently figure in that plan.   In an interview, Ferguson said the company is looking for joint venture partners that bring something other than cash to the table, including proposals that would help Cenovus become less exposed to the vagaries of the price spread between light and heavy oil.   “We would be looking, first and foremost, with someone who is strategically aligned with us and we’re quite open-minded about he nature of a transaction,” he said. “We’ll consider any of a joint venture, farm-out, divestiture or other former of partnering. We really don’t want to, in any way, limit the public competitive process that we are pursuing.”   During the conference call, Ferguson said ConocoPhillips’ recent decision to split its refining operations from its exploration and production arm would have minimal impact on its partnerships.

54,COP,UPDATE 4-PDVSA debt to suppliers leapt to $10.9 bln in 2010,"     * Venezuelan company says debt rose 55 percent  * Sees 140,000 bpd Orinoco production this year  * Average production was 2.97 mln bpd in 2010  * Plans investments of $142 bln between 2011-2015  (Updates throughout with more Ramirez quotes, edits)  By Marianna Parraga and Daniel Wallis  CARACAS, July 26 (Reuters) - The debt owed to suppliers by Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA jumped 55 percent to $10.9 billion at the end of 2010 from the previous year, the company said in its results on Tuesday.  OPEC said last week that Venezuela had overtaken Saudi Arabia in 2010 as the country with the planet’s largest crude reserves. But PDVSA has piled on debt in recent years.  More debt to suppliers could make it harder for it to boost stagnant production, because partners may demand funds up front or raise prices in anticipation of delays getting paid.  The company, financial motor and cash cow of President Hugo Chavez’s socialist revolution, said its results showed it had weathered the global financial crisis well.  “The results of the operational, financial, environmental and social management of PDVSA for 2010 show the strength and growth seen by the company, despite the crisis currently being suffered by global capitalism,” it said in its report.  Speaking at the company’s headquarters, Energy Minister and PDVSA President Rafael Ramirez said the debt situation with its suppliers had “improved” since December, but gave no details.  He said Venezuela plans to produce 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of this year from new fields in its enormous Orinoco extra heavy crude belt.  The South American OPEC nation is pinning its hopes for reviving its oil sector on several ambitious projects to develop the region, seen as one of the world’s largest untapped hydrocarbon reserves.  Almost all those projects are joint ventures with foreign companies, including Chevron (CVX.N), Repsol (REP.MC), Eni (ENI.MI) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM). Ramirez said a $4 billion loan from China to help develop the Orinoco would be signed soon.  PDVSA said it invested $13.3 billion last year and planned to spend a further $142 billion between 2011 and 2015.  The company said its average crude production was 2.97 million barrels per day (bpd) last year, compared with 3.01 million bpd the previous year, and that its average cost of production had fallen to $5.5 per barrel from $6.3 per barrel.  The Chavez government has routinely given higher figures for Venezuela’s oil output than those provided by international bodies, including OPEC, and estimates from industry experts.  “FOURTH-BIGGEST OIL COMPANY”  The results confirmed previously-announced figures of a $3.2 billion net profit from $94 billion revenue for PDVSA in 2010. Total debt at the end of the year stood at $25 billion.  PDVSA said exports of crude and oil derivatives fell to 2.41 million bpd in 2010 from 2.68 million bpd a year earlier.  “The 2010 operating results consolidated PDVSA as the fourth largest oil company in the world for the second year running. This reflects PDVSA’s capacity in terms of reserves, production, refining and marketing,” it said in the report.  It said exports to China fell to 179,000 bpd from 370,000 bpd in 2009. This was unexpected because the government has repeatedly said exports to China were about 500,000 bpd, partly in exchange for multibillion dollar oil-for-loans deals with Beijing, and that it aimed to increase that to 1 million bpd.  The company said it held back $1.46 billion last year for the potential cost of arbitrations, including those related to the nationalization in 2007 of huge projects run by U.S. majors Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N).  “We have always said we would recognize a reasonable value for the assets,” Ramirez said on Tuesday.  He told Reuters in March the government expected to pay less than $2.5 billion in total to Exxon and ConocoPhillips and that it was ready for rulings this year. [ID:nN31268640]  The Venezuelan government has often raised taxes and royalties for the sector, while requiring that PDVSA operate and have majority ownership of all oil projects.  Chavez, who underwent cancer surgery in Cuba last month, has reveled in OPEC’s confirmation that Venezuela leap-frogged Saudi Arabia last year to become the world’s no. 1 holder of oil reserves with 296.5 billion barrels. [ID:nL6E7IJ0QZ]  That was up from 211.2 billion barrels in 2009. The new deposits were booked in the Orinoco belt. The projects there are slated eventually to add 2.1 million bpd of new production and bring in some $80 billion in investment.

55,COP,BP fails to convince investors on strategy,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s pledge of strong long-term growth failed to reassure investors concerned about the company’s post-oil spill strategy and second-quarter results well shy of forecasts.  A year after BP, Europe’s second-largest oil company by market capitalization, staunched the massive leak at its Gulf of Mexico well, some investors say Dudley has still not set the company on the road to recovery.  He sought to address that concern on Tuesday, saying deals to secure new reserves this year would help drive performance in 2012, 2013 and beyond. But some analysts were unimpressed.  “Other companies have clearly re-defined their strategies over the last 12 to 24 months .. ExxonMobil continues to build its shale gas business in the U.S. and Shell is focused on mega gas projects. But what is BP doing?” Dougie Youngson, oil analyst at Arbuthnot, said in an email to clients.  The oil major’s shares were down 2.5 percent at 1452 GMT (10:52 a.m. EDT), one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index was down 0.6 percent.  Investors are frustrated at the share price which has failed to recover materially in the past nine months, despite some progress in oil spill lawsuits and indications the final cost to the company will be less than many had feared. The dividend is also currently only half the pre-spill level.  On top of that, a failed $16 billion share swap and Arctic exploration deal with Russia’s Rosneft has left investors questioning whether the company has a credible plan to access new resources.  BP said oil and gas production fell by 11 percent in the quarter to 3.43 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with sales of fields to pay for the spill accounting for a third of the drop.  Dudley acknowledged investor anxiety.  “We feel a great sense of urgency around where our share price is .. Shareholders, I think, also are impatient,” he told a press conference.  But he reiterated that BP’s priority this year was to consolidate its financial and operational position, namely by settling legal and judicial claims related to the spill.  “It is important for us to continue to reduce the uncertainties the company faces, particularly in the U.S., before we would be in a position to increase the dividend,” he added.  Some analysts, bankers and investors are beginning to ask whether the best way for BP to address its valuation discount is to break itself up.  U.S. rivals ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil have followed strategies of spinning off their oil refining and fuel retail units.  Dudley said he would not rule anything in or out but played down the chances of an upstream-downstream breakup. Refining boss Iain Conn defended BP’s integrated business model to reporters: “This type of company has an offer to the world.”  Nonetheless, the company is selling half its U.S. refining capacity and said it was making progress on the sale of its Texas City and Carson, California plants.  Some bankers and analysts have also suggested BP sell off its Russian and U.S. assets to focus on high-growth international oil and gas production.  BP’s underlying second-quarter results fell short of analysts’ forecasts and benefited less than rivals from a 50 percent rise in crude prices from a year ago.  Replacement cost net income was $5.31 billion, compared with a loss of $16.97 billion in the same period last year that included a charge for tackling the spill.  Excluding one-offs, the replacement cost net income was up 13 percent to $5.61 billion, below an average forecast of $6.02 billion from a Reuters poll of 12 analysts.  Smaller rival BG Group announced a 27 percent rise in underlying earnings on Tuesday while larger rivals Exxon and Shell are both expected to post a 50 percent rise in underlying net income.  “For the Bulls on BP there is little in today’s results to get excited about,” analysts at Bernstein said in a research note.  The London-based company said maintenance work in the North Sea and Angola and continued outages in the Gulf of Mexico had weighed on results in the quarter and would continue to impact performance in the second half of the year.  The company again increased its estimate for the cost of dealing with the spill, adding around $500 million to the bill, although contributions of $1.1. billion from partners allowed the total charge taken by BP to be reduced.

A year after BP, Europe’s second-largest oil company by market capitalisation, staunched the massive leak at its Gulf of Mexico well, some investors say Dudley has still not set the company on the road to recovery. 	   He sought to address that concern on Tuesday, saying deals to secure new reserves this year would help drive performance in 2012, 2013 and beyond. But some analysts were unimpressed.	   “Other companies have clearly re-defined their strategies over the last 12 to 24 months .. ExxonMobil continues to build its shale gas business in the U.S. and Shell (RDSa.L) is focused on mega gas projects. But what is BP doing?” Dougie Youngson, oil analyst at Arbuthnot, said in an email to clients.	   The oil major’s shares were down 2.5 percent at 1452 GMT, one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index  was down 0.  6  percent. 	   Investors are frustrated at the share price which has failed to recover materially in the past nine months, despite some progress in oil spill lawsuits and indications the final cost to the company will be less than many had feared. The dividend is also currently only half the pre-spill level.	    On top of that, a failed $16 billion share swap and Arctic exploration deal with Russia’s Rosneft has left investors questioning whether the company has a credible plan to access new resources.   	    BP said oil and gas production fell by 11 percent in the quarter to 3.43 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with sales of fields to pay for the spill accounting for a third of the drop.	   Dudley acknowledged investor anxiety.	  “We feel a great sense of urgency around where our share price is .. Shareholders, I think, also are impatient,” he told a press conference.	   But he reiterated that BP’s priority this year was to consolidate its financial and operational position, namely by settling legal and judicial claims related to the spill.	   “It is important for us to continue to reduce the uncertainties the company faces, particularly in the U.S., before we would be in a position to increase the dividend,” he added. 	   Some analysts, bankers and investors are beginning to ask whether the best way for BP to address its valuation discount is to break itself up.	   U.S. rivals ConocoPhillips , Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil have followed strategies of spinning off their oil refining and fuel retail units.     	   Dudley said he w  ould  not rul  e    anything  in or out  but played down the chances of an upstream-downstream breakup. Refining boss Iain Conn defended BP’s integrated business model to reporters: “This type of company has an offer to the world.”	   Nonetheless, the company is selling half its U.S. refining capacity and said it was making progress on the sale of its Texas City and Carson, California plants.	   Some bankers and analysts have also suggested BP sell off its Russian and U.S. assets to focus on high-growth international oil and gas production. 	   BP’s underlying second-quarter results fell short of analysts’ forecasts and benefited less than rivals from a 50 percent rise in crude prices from a year ago.	   Replacement cost net income was $5.31 billion, compared with a loss of $16.97 billion in the same period last year that included a charge for tackling the spill.	   Excluding one-offs, the replacement cost net income was up 13 percent to $5.61 billion, below an average forecast of $6.02 billion from a Reuters poll of 12 analysts.	    Smaller rival BG Group announced a 27 percent rise in underlying earnings on Tuesday while larger rivals Exxon and Shell are both expected to post a 50 percent rise in underlying net income.

The London-based company said maintenance work in the North Sea and Angola and continued outages in the Gulf of Mexico had weighed on results in the quarter and would continue to impact performance in the second half of the year.	    The company again increased its estimate for the cost of dealing with the spill, adding around $500 million to the bill, although contributions of $1.1. billion from partners allowed the total charge taken by BP to be reduced.

57,COP,Cenovus sees Q4 startup for Illinois refinery unit,"   * Work was 98 pct complete at end of June   * Project to add 65,000 bpd of coking capacity  (In U.S. dollars)   CALGARY, Alberta, July 26 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) said on Tuesday that a $3.8 billion project at an Illinois refinery to boost capacity to process heavier Canadian crude oil should be completed in the fourth quarter.   Cenovus said work on a new coker unit at the Wood River refinery was 98 percent complete at the end of June. Cenovus operates the 306,000 barrel a day refinery in a joint venture with ConocoPhillips (COP.N).   Cokers are massive drums that allow refineries to process heavier slates of oil. Cenovus and ConocoPhillips also produce extra-heavy bitumen in Alberta as part of their strategic alliance.   The new equipment will boost coking capacity at the refinery by 65,000 barrels a day to 83,000 barrels a day, the company said.

However, oil production fell 5 percent to 121,762 barrels per day, partly hurt by rough weather conditions in the country and wildfires in Alberta.

Foster Creek and Christina Lake combined oil sands production exceeded 58,000 barrels per day net to Cenovus in the second quarter, slightly less than the same period a year earlier, due to planned turnarounds.

62,COP,UPDATE 2-FACTBOX-Energy firms prepare for Gulf of Mexico storm," July 27 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Don formed in the southern Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday near the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula and could reach the Texas Gulf Coast by the weekend, the National Hurricane Center said. [ID:nL3E7IR2EB]  Oil companies began preparations to protect oil and gas platforms, offshore personnel and refineries that could be threatened. Computer models predicted the system could hit somewhere between northeast Mexico and the central Texas Gulf Coast.  The Gulf of Mexico is home to thousands of oil and gas production platforms, producing about 29 percent of U.S. oil output and more than 13 percent of domestically produced natural gas. More than 40 percent of U.S. refining capacity sits on the Gulf Coast from Texas to Mississippi.

63,COP,Conoco quarterly profit lower but tops forecasts,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N), which has plans to spin off its refining business, reported a lower quarterly profit that topped Wall Street expectations as higher crude oil prices helped its exploration and production business.  Demand for fuel in developing countries including China and India and a recovering global economy have contributed to a rise in crude prices. Benchmark WTI oil averaged about $102 a barrel in the second quarter, up 32 percent from a year ago and natural gas prices rose 6 percent.  “Most of the beat was in exploration and production and midstream,” Fadel Gheit, oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, said on Wednesday. “Industry fundamentals have improved. Oil prices are higher and refining margins are higher than they were last year.  The oil company’s shares were up 0.1 percent at $73.76 on Wednesday morning when most other energy stocks were lower.  Earlier this month, ConocoPhillips announced plans to split off its refining business as a stand-alone publicly traded company in an effort to improve investment returns for shareholders.  That plan comes on the heels of another. In 2010, ConocoPhillips said it would sell mature assets and use the proceeds to buy back its shares, a strategy dubbed “shrink-to-grow” by some analysts.  But investors have so far not been convinced by ConocoPhillips’ plan to shed its refining business. Since the plan was announced on July 14, the company’s shares have fallen nearly 3 percent.  Brian Youngberg, analyst at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said the second-quarter results set the company on a good path toward separation, expected early next year.  “Production was down but better than I had expected and midstream doubled earnings,” Youngberg said. “I really don’t see anywhere they came up short. It helps position the company as it moves toward 2012.”  Jeff Sheets, ConocoPhillips’ chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company has received “generally positive comments” on its intention to shed the refining business from its institutional investors.  The third-largest U.S. oil company reported a second-quarter profit of $3.4 billion, or $2.41 per share, compared with $4.2 billion or $2.77 per share a year earlier.  Analysts on average expected ConocoPhillips to report a profit of $2.19 per share, according to estimates gathered by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, said its exploration and production earnings were $2.5 billion, higher than the $2.4 billion that analysts at Barclays Capital had expected, but lower than a year ago.  Output in the quarter was 1.64 million barrels oil equivalent (boe) per day, down from 1.73 million barrels oil equivalent per day in the same period a year ago. Loss of production from Libya and asset sales contributed to the decline.  For the full year, the oil company expects oil and gas production of 1.625 million boe per day to 1.65 million boe per day, analysts were told on a conference.  The company’s gas gathering and storage — or midstream — business more than doubled, earning $130 million. Its refining and marketing unit had a profit of $766 million, compared with a year-ago loss of $279 million..  The rise of ConocoPhillips shares on Wednesday morning contrasted with the fall in the CBOE index of oil companies .OIX, which was down nearly 2 percent.

68,COP,"Shell, BP say high oil price erodes demand"," * Shell says OPEC capacity worry to fuel oil price   * BP, Shell see lower products sales   * Refining use rates to stay low throughout 2011    By Dmitry Zhdannikov	   LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - High crude prices have dented global oil demand in the second quarter, oil majors said this week, in a trend likely to be repeated in the second half of the year if prices stay high.	   Oil majors BP , Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ConocoPhillips all said they witnessed signs of demand rationing in the second quarter, which saw Brent oil prices LCOc1 spiking to $127 per barrel, close to their all-time high of $147.	   Many analysts and fund managers say demand erosion will ultimately help bring oil prices down if producing nations cannot pump more to help support fragile world economic growth.	   But Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) chief executive told Reuters concerns over geopolitical tension in the Middle East and falling output capacity will be supporting prices for the foreseeable future.	   “It (oil prices) is reflecting obviously today expectations that demand will still go up and supply will be in a catch up mode,” Peter Voser told Reuters Insider Television.  	   “It also reflects that OPEC spare capacity is now below 2 million barrels (per day), according to the latest numbers, and there are some geopolitical tensions in it,” he said.  	    	   Shell said oil products sales volumes decreased by 8 percent compared with the same period a year ago while, excluding the impact of divestment, sales volumes were 4 percent lower than in the second quarter of 2010.	   On Tuesday, BP’s head of refining and fuel marketing Iain Conn said the firm’s marketing volumes were down about 2 percent in the second quarter year-on-year.	   “This is a reaction to high prices. This is something we are going to continue to see in Europe and the U.S.. East of the Rockies retail volumes are down about 6 percent year on year... Everywhere else were are seeing diminishment of demand,” he said.	   European oil consumption is set to fall to its lowest since 1995 this year as high prices cut sharply into fuel use in debt-laden peripheral eurozone nations. 	   Efficiency gains have reduced European oil demand over the past five years. Crude price changes do not normally have as much impact on retail demand as in the United States because tax in Europe makes up a much larger share of total fuel costs.	   Some funds, including Investec, say the risks of demand destruction in the United States are underestimated as gasoline prices hover around a critical level of a tenth of personal disposable income, after which demand destruction begins.    U.S. No.3 oil firm ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday its U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 percent and the international rate was 96 percent.	   “We expect global refining capacity utilizations to be in the low 90s in the second half of 2011,” said Conoco’s chief financial officer Jeff Sheets.	   Latest European data from Euroilstocks showed total refinery production in 16 European countries was down 8 percent in June, year-on-year, and refining utilisation capacity hovered at around 80 percent compared with 87 percent last year  	   In China, which has been the engine of global oil demand growth in the past year, implied oil demand rose 1.1 percent in June from a year earlier, the slowest growth in more than two years as Beijing’s monetary tightening cut into oil use.  	   Developed consuming nations released emergency stocks last month in a bid to cap oil prices and protect economic growth although prices quickly returned to where they were prior to the released.	   Voser said he did not support the release as the world needed sustained new supply from places such as Iraq or the Arctic.	   “I don’t believe in these measures. These are very short-term measures and do not bring any medium and long-term benefits.” 	 	  (Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, additional reporting by Tom Bergin, editing by Richard Mably)	  ",7282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-demand/shell-bp-say-high-oil-price-erodes-demand-idUSL6E7IS1JI20110728
69,COP,PRESS DIGEST - Wall Street Journal - July 28," July 28 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * Groupon Inc. has attracted scrutiny from regulators over a newfangled accounting metric it is using to market itself to investors ahead of its initial public offering, said a person familiar with the situation.	   * In the last decade, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Jim Mulva achieved a feat with few equals in modern U.S. corporate history: creating a new oil major, almost from scratch. Now, as he prepares to retire next year, Mulva is presiding over the disintegration of his signature achievement-selling assets and splitting Conoco into two publicly traded companies, a move disclosed earlier this month and projected to be completed in the first half of 2012.	   * Juniper Networks Inc offered some new clues that the U.S. economy is stalling, warning of slowing sales growth that sent its stock plunging 21 percent in trading Wednesday. As a key player in the Internet networking business, Juniper and larger rival Cisco Systems Inc are regarded as bellwethers of how companies and governments invest in new technology and workers.	   * The debt stalemate in Washington is creating stress in a little-known but vital corner of the bond market, increasing the risk that banks, hedge funds and other investors will have to pay billions of dollars in additional costs if the U.S. defaults or is downgraded.	   * Miller, an oil-industry veteran from Pennsylvania, is one of a small band of pioneers seeking to replicate North America’s shale-gas boom in Europe. His company, Cuadrilla Resources, has imported a technology used to great effect in the U.S. to try to turn Blackpool, a seaside resort on the west coast of England, into a new Klondike for gas.	   * U.S. fuel economy standards would double by 2025 under a deal the White House announced Wednesday with auto makers and environmentalists. If upheld, the plan would lead to the biggest gains in fuel economy since government began setting mileage regulations in the 1970s and could lead to substantial changes to the cars and trucks most Americans drive.	   * The federal regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Wednesday sued UBS AG , accusing the Swiss investment bank of costing the two mortgage giants at least $900 million by selling them shaky mortgage-backed securities during the housing market boom.	   * More small companies-already struggling with weak sales and tight lending-are being forced to rely on business credit cards to provide working capital. Many of these cards are subject to unannounced rate changes, unrestricted penalties and other terms that were banned from consumer cards in the wake of the financial crisis.

70,COP,UPDATE 2-Australia's Origin makes final investment decision on APLNG," * First phase of APLNG to cost $14 bln   * Entire two train project will cost $20 bln   * First train to start up in 2015, second train in 2016   * Origin in advanced talks with buyers for train two LNG   (Adds analyst comments, details)	   By Rebekah Kebede	   PERTH, July 28 (Reuters) - Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips approved the $14 billion first phase of their Australia Pacific LNG export project on Thursday, joining a crowded field of LNG developers struggling to keep costs for labour and materials in check.	   The joint venture is focusing on the first train, which is expected to start in 2015, as Australia Pacific LNG secures customers for the second LNG train, which will come online in 2016, the company said.  	   Australia Pacific LNG will likely face stiff competition for resources and labour one of three major LNG projects underway in Australia’s eastern Queensland state, where energy companies have plans to sink tens of billions into coal seam gas to LNG projects.    	   “It’s not surprising that they wanted to get into the development queue ... Australian resources are very stretched right now,” Noelle Leonard, a consultant with FACTS Global Energy in Perth.	   Australia’s resources sector has been booming as demand for LNG as well as other commodities such as iron ore and coal has increased competition for supplies and escalated project development costs, especially labour. 	   Origin said it is in advanced discussions with potential customers and the full two-train LNG development will have a capacity of 9 million tonnes per year and will cost $20 billion.	   Still, some said a decision on just a single train of a two-train project might not be received well by the company’s shareholders.     	   Origin shares on the Australian stock exchange had dipped just over one percent late Thursday morning and ConocoPhillips shares were down about 0.6 percent.    	   Origin and ConocoPhillips both hold a 42.5 percent stake in the project, while China’s Sinopec has a 15 percent stake as well as an agreement to purchase 4.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG for 20 years, which underpinned the first train of the project.        	   Australia Pacific’s second phase will be another 4.5 million tonne per annum LNG train and Origin said it was in advanced discussions with customers for the LNG from the second train. 	   Analysts said a sales and final investment decision on the second phase are not far off. 	   “The capex sum committed at this stage clearly includes some provision for a second train and points to a strong degree of confidence that Origin and ConocoPhillips are close to announcing further sales agreement(s). We see this as a positive indicator for a two-train project,” Craig McMahon, a Wood Mackenzie analyst based in Perth, said in an email. 	   Origin’s managing director Grant King said the second train will likely be underwritten by a number of customers with an offtake of one to two million tonnes per year rather than a large customer such as Sinopec, which bought most of the LNG expected from train one. 	   “We believe the prospects of the LNG market have improved relative to, say, six months ago, certainly relative to 12 or 18 months ago,” King said.    	   Although he acknowledged the increased LNG demand has been in part due to the Japanese nuclear crisis which created demand for LNG when several reactors were knocked offline, King said demand has also emerged from other regions in Asia.    	   “We’ve seen in the last six months the emergence of southeast Asian nations as well,” King said.	   “It’s no secret that you’ve seen the emergence of Thailand, Malaysia through the GLNG project and even Indonesia to emerge as buyers in that 2015 to 2016 window.”	   Thailand opened the first LNG receiving terminal earlier this year and several Southeast Asian nations are expected to follow suit in the next several years.

No one was injured in the fire that occurred at about 4 p.m. local time (2100 GMT) on Thursday, a Conoco spokesman said in an email.   The refinery continues to operate without impact, he added.   Conoco said the refinery emergency response team was mobilized to contain the fire and isolate the line.   “The fire is fully controlled but continues to burn as the hydrocarbon in the line is burned off,” spokesman Bill Stephens said.   Conoco has begun efforts to prepare the transfer line for maintenance.   Earlier in the day, Conoco reported a release of butane caused by a pipeline leak at the refinery, in a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

73,COP,Oil still leaking at ConocoPhillip's oilfield in China," BEIJING, July 29 (Reuters) - Oil continues to leak at two oilfield platforms of ConocoPhillips in China’s northern Bohai Bay, two weeks after the Chinese government ordered the Houston company to halt production, the official Xinhua news agency said on Friday.	   Remote satellite sensing and a survey by patrol boats has  identified several oil belts in an area of 4.6 square kilometres to the east of the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s largest offshore oilfield, Xinhua quoted Lin Fangzhong, an official of State Oceanic Administration (SOA) North China Sea Branch, as saying.	   The oilfield’s platform C is leaking at around 2.52 liters per day despite ConocoPhillips’ cleaning efforts, it said.	   SOA has asked ConocoPhillips China, operator of the oilfield, to contain the oil spill, clean up polluted areas and conduct a thorough investigation to eliminate further risks of oil spills before Aug. 31, it said.	   Pollutants from the oil spill have been found spreading to beaches in northern Hebei province and northeastern Liaoning province, which have been blamed for losses in local tourism revenue and the aquatic farming industry, it added.	   In mid-July, SOA ordered ConocoPhillips to halt production at platforms B and C of the Penglai 19-3 oilfield due to slow progress in cleaning up oil leaks. 	   ConocoPhillips has estimated around 1,500 barrels (240 cubic meters) of oil and oil-based drilling fluids have been released into the sea and the order to shut down the platforms will result in a temporary reduction of about 17,000 barrels of oil per day.	   The oil leaks, which started on June 4 and June 17, has polluted 840 square kilometres of water, SOA has said.

79,COP,UPDATE 3-North Sea oil cargoes further delayed," * Fifth UK Forties oil cargo delayed by 3 days   * Norwegian Ekofisk crude loadings further delayed in Aug   * BP sees pipeline maintenance ending on schedule   (Adds details of delays to Ekofisk supplies)	   By Alex Lawler	   LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Supplies of North Sea crude oil have been delayed by oilfield problems, trading sources said on Thursday, further deferring shipments in a region that sets the global Brent benchmark.  	   Another cargo of Forties crude has been delayed in August, the sources said, reflecting the impact of production glitches at Nexen’s Buzzard field. Forties supplies have been disrupted since May due to the Buzzard problems.	   And shipments of Norway’s Ekofisk crude will be further delayed in August due to reduced production after a fire at BP PLC’s Valhall offshore platform on July 13, a revised loading programme showed on Thursday.	   The delays to shipments have tightened supply in the North Sea, home of the dated Brent benchmark used to price up to 70 percent of the world’s crude cargoes, and supported Brent futures relative to U.S. crude. CL-LCO1=R	   In an indication of rising supplies, BP said on Thursday it planned to restart the Forties oil pipeline on Friday afternoon, on schedule, after a five-day maintenance shutdown.	   But some oil traders were suspending judgement on whether any more Forties cargoes would be delayed until the pipeline and associated oilfields, including Buzzard, had restarted.	   “Let’s see how it goes,” a North Sea trader said. “The trouble is, nothing ever goes to plan when you start something up again.”	   BP said earlier on Thursday it planned to restart the  pipeline on Friday afternoon after the removal of a World War Two mine found nearby and maintenance work.	 	   In the latest Forties deferral, Nexen’s F0815 shipment scheduled to load on Aug. 27-29 has been deferred by three days, two trade sources said. 	   This is the fifth August-loading shipment to be delayed, according to a Reuters tally. 	   Four North Sea crudes — Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk — make up the North Sea BFOE crude benchmark and Forties, usually the cheapest of the four, mostly sets the price of dated Brent.	   Buzzard, with normal output of 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), normally contributes about a third of the Forties volume.	   Supply in August of Forties was already expected to be unusually low. The original loading schedule listed just 16 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, amounting to 310,000 bpd.	   Revisions to the schedule usually take time to filter out as there is no requirement for them to be disclosed.	   The revised Ekofisk loading schedule issued by operator ConocoPhillips and obtained by Reuters showed Ekofisk cargoes loading between Aug. 17 and Aug. 26 would be loading as much as five days later than earlier planned.	   On Wednesday, oil traders said three August-loading Ekofisk cargoes would be dropped.	   BP said last week the Valhall platform suffered little damage in the fire, but output was unlikely to resume before mid-August. The field was producing about 42,000 bpd at the time of the fire.

April-June Natural gas prices NGc1 rose about 3 percent from year-ago levels to average $4.38 per million British thermal units. U.S. crude oil prices CLc1 soared 32 percent to average $103.49 a barrel during the period.	   Plains Exploration & Production , which reported a near three-fold jump in quarterly profit, raised its capital spending outlook by a fourth to $1.5 billion — excluding deepwater spending. 	   “Due primarily to our accelerated drilling activity in the Eagle Ford and a higher than originally planned rig count in the Haynesville, the board of directors approved an increase in 2011 capital spending,” Plains Exploration said in a statement.	   Denver-based Cimarex Energy Co said its full-year exploration and development capital investment is expected to be in the range of $1.5-$1.6 billion, higher than its earlier view of $1.3-$1.5 billion. 	   Smaller peer PetroQuest Energy Inc also slightly raised its full-year expenditure view to $120-$130 million.  	   All of these companies are looking to accelerate drilling activity in areas rich in oil or gas liquids, such as the Permian and Eagle Ford shale fields in Texas.	   “We are now seeing the results of having large acreage positions in liquids-rich operating areas where we have leveraged our technical expertise,” said Swift Energy Co  Chief Executive Terry Swift. 	   Beside spending on existing assets, some companies are also looking at adding acreage through small acquisitions.	   “We (have) pursued future growth through two bolt-on acquisitions that offer existing oil production and reserves with sizable upside potential, located in the Uinta and DJ Basins,” said Fred Barrett, the CEO of Bill Barrett Corp  .

84,COP,"Dealtalk: Spin-offs lay groundwork for more deals, fees","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate splits divide companies, but they multiply bankers fees.  Kraft’s plan to split into two publicly traded companies, announced on Thursday, is the latest in what is shaping up to be the year of the spin-off.  The result will be new, smaller companies, many of which will need to do more deals to stay relevant, driving more business for bankers and lawyers who advise on these deals.  Spin-offs have become popular this year as a weak economy has made it hard for companies to increase revenue and earnings. To maximize value for shareholders, companies are looking to get rid of the units facing greater challenges, hoping the market will value the remaining company higher.  Moreover, investors such as Carl Icahn, Pershing Square’s William Ackman and Trian’s Nelson Peltz are nudging companies to do so to increase shareholder profits.  Investors have rewarded companies that have announced splits in 2011. An analysis of 10 high-profile spin-offs this year shows shares on average rose nearly 5.5 percent in their first day of trading and tended to go even higher in the month afterward. (r.reuters.com/ver92s)  “This is the natural swing of the pendulum,” said a head of mergers and acquisition of a U.S. bank, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “You’ve got years of consolidation and mergers, then you have cost-cutting and downsizing the pieces to be streamlined, then you spin them off and create new companies. Then the process starts again.”  An analysis of recent breakups shows that nearly every bank on Wall Street is getting a piece of the action, as spinoffs have spanned a range of industries, from energy and defense to technology, and big names such ITT (ITT.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N), and Expedia (EXPE.O).  Private-label food maker Ralcorp Holdings Inc RAH.N, which said in July it would split itself into two companies to fend off an unwanted, unsolicited takeover bid from ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N), eventually could be taken over in pieces.  Ralcorp’s branded Post Foods cereals business could be sold to a company like Kellogg Co (K.N) at a premium, one source familiar with that situation said.  And since ConAgra was believed to be mostly interested in Ralcorp’s private label business, it could buy what remains, the source said.  The spinoffs themselves tend to generate smaller fees for investment banks than acquisitions and depend on the complexities around the transaction, according to Lam Nguyen, vice president at Freeman Consulting, a financial consulting firm that estimates investment banking fees.  Still, the fees can be substantial. Freeman estimated that Philip Morris’ spin-off of Kraft in 2007 generated around $130 million of fees for that company’s banks.  Based on that, Nguyen suggested the fees for the current Kraft split would likely be in the $50 million to $100 million range.  Spin-offs also often create complex tax issues, which lead to windfalls for law firms that advise on them, he said.  That, of course, is followed by other lucrative opportunities down the line — underwriting capital market offerings, advising on M&A deals and raising financing for deals.  Kraft’s shares rose as much as 8.5 percent in premarket trading after the spinoff plan was announced, but closed down 1.5 percent amid a large stock market selloff.  Kraft, which counts Peltz and Ackman among its shareholders, is breaking up a year and a half after its purchase of UK chocolate maker Cadbury.  Kraft was advised by Robert Pruzan and Tony Kim at Centerview Partners; Roger Altman, William Hiltz and Paul Billyard at Evercore Partners (EVR.N), and Peter Gross, Andre Kelleners, Eric Dobkin, and Joe Todd at Goldman Sachs. (GS.N)  The Kraft spin-off allows the company to get rid of assets without worrying about a prohibitively high tax bill, said Frank Maher, managing director and head of KeyBanc Capital Markets’ Food & Beverage investment banking team.  “There’s probably not too many people that would have a strategic interest that would pay a strategic price that would compensate them for what would be a very high tax leakage on a sale,” Maher said.  Kraft is likely to be followed by more companies spinning off assets.  “You’re going to see many more companies starting to get broken up because in a lot of cases, the individual parts are worth more than the sum of the whole, and so there is a logic in many cases to doing that,” billionaire investor Wilbur Ross told Reuters.

86,COP,"Global LNG-Asian LNG Sept demand filled, buyers look to winter"," PERTH, Aug 5(Reuters) - Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot prices for September remained just under $15 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) during the week, with most buying for the month done, and buyers looking to fill cargoes for October and beyond.     	   “The demand has been filled... September buying seems to be done now,” one market source said.  	   Strong demand is likely to continue with top buyer Japan still depending heavily on LNG to replace the nuclear power it lost due to the March earthquake. 	   “Over the next couple of weeks, it’ll probably tighten up to around the $16 level,” the source said. 	   Top buyers Japan and South Korea as well as smaller players in the LNG market usually begin stocking up for the winter as the summer draws to a close and prices are typically at their peak between October and February.  	   “Traditionally prices spike during the winter period because you have Kogas and Japan adding to their stock... demand depends on how well stocked up they are,” another market source said.  	   In a sign of increasing southeast Asian demand, the gas trading arm of Petrovietnam, PV Gas, said on Friday it was in talks with Qatargas over a contract to import LNG. PV Gas is expected to begin importing LNG around 2013. 	 	   Stronger demand and higher prices in Asia appeared to be drawing cargoes eastward. 	   Spot prices in Spain were said to be trading narrowly above the UK’s NBP front-month gas contract, putting it at significant discount to Asia even after adding shipping costs. 	   A tanker loading at Belgium’s Zeebrugge terminal on August 9 will deliver to Asia, sources said. 	   Global energy trader Gunvor has sold the volumes to a Pacific buyer and Russia’s Gazprom also looks set to divert Atlantic production east. 	   The overwhelming proportion of Europe’s LNG continues to be shipped from Qatar, as most traders focus instead on the world’s premium market in Asia. 	   Qatar tends to send gas to Britain irrespective of prices in Asia because it bankrolled Europe’s biggest import terminal South Hook, in southwest Wales. That’s keeping a lid on British spot prices.

91,COP,Conoco says Kenai LNG plant to operate into October," NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) on Tuesday said it would continue to produce liquefied natural gas at its Kenai LNG export plant in Alaska and operate into October, but long-term plans to mothball the plant remain unchanged.   Plans to shut the 40-year-old plant came after it failed to sign new supply contracts with its long-standing Japanese buyers, Conoco said previously.   Conoco and partner Marathon Oil (MRO.N) had been granted a export license extension last year, from 2011 to 2013. But with ample supply elsewhere in the Pacific, Kenai’s customers saw no need to extend contracts.

Gulf Coast conventional M2 gasoline differentials also climbed 2.00 cents per gallon over September NYMEX RBOB futures on more Midwest buying early on Wednesday, traders in the region said.  “Midcon seems to be sucking up barrels off the Gulf,” a Gulf trader said of the jump.  However, M2 differentials later retreated half a penny per gallon, ending the day up 1.50 cents.  The Midwest drove an unexpected 1.58 million-barrel drop in U.S. gasoline inventories last week with a drop in gasoline stocks of 1.34 million barrels in the region, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

Prompt CBOB differentials gained half a cent per gallon and premium grades also rose as buyers sought to line up supplies before the seasonal shift in Reid vapor pressure, traders said.  However, later on Wednesday trading activity dramatically thinned as traders retreated to watch futures and equities activity from the sidelines.  Regarding gasoline stocks in other regions, the EIA data also showed that Gulf Coast inventories slipped by 639,000 barrels, while those in the East Coast rose by a slight 4,000 barrels.

96,COP,"UPDATE 2-Hestya Energy to buy, restart German refinery"," * Plant was idle for nearly 2 years   * Follows string of refinery sales in Europe   * Europe’s refining margins better in August   (Adds detail, factbox, graphic)	   By Michael Hogan and Emma Farge	   HAMBURG/LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Private Dutch company Hestya Energy BV said on Wednesday it plans to buy the German Wilhelmshaven oil refinery from U.S. group ConocoPhillips and then restart it, adding to signs that investor interest in the crippled European refining sector is not dead.	   The north German plant has been mothballed for most of the past two years due to an extended bout of poor margins and damage caused by a fire in May 2010.	   ConocoPhillips has been trying to either sell the 260,000 barrels-a-day refinery or turn it into an oil distribution terminal as part of its strategy of cutting downstream operations as weak fuel demand has pummelled European profit margins.  	   No price for the deal was given. A Hestya Energy spokesman said it was planned to resume refinery operations “as soon as possible” at the site but gave no date.	   The transaction is expected to close later this year.	   The planned sale of the refinery and its terminal follows several prominent transactions in the industry this summer including oil major Chevron Corp’s sale of its UK Pembroke plant to U.S. refiner Valero and Shell’s (RDSa.L) sale of UK Stanlow complex to India’s Essar.	   Funding for the transaction is being provided by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings — of which former BP chief executive Lord Browne is a partner — and private investment company Atlas Invest. Private investor Klesch agreed to buy Shell’s German Heide refinery in similar move last year.    	   Analysts and oil traders met the news of the sale and imminent restart with surprise as the plant had been seen as a likely candidate for permanent closure given its limited complexity. 	   “I’ve just fallen off my chair. It’s against a background of weak demand and overcapacity and it doesn’t appear to make sense to restart it. It’s a rather good thing for Conoco,” said Roy Jordan, research associate at FACTS Global Energy (FGE).	   As a simple plant, Wilhelmshaven has a relatively high yield of fuel oil — a product which is generally made in Europe at a loss. Conoco cancelled a plan to upgrade the plant in July last year in a move which would have increased the output of higher value products such as the motor fuel diesel.	   “It’s hard to see how they could make Wilhelmshaven sufficiently profitable when a healthy oil major with huge refining experience worldwide could not,” said Robert Beaman, oil and gas analyst at Business Monitor International.	   Still, better refining margins this summer may have increased the plant’s appeal and the gasoil crack spread traded on the IntercontinentalExchange has recently rebounded to around $15 a barrel on weakness in the underlying Brent contract. LGO-LCO1=R	   Oil traders said that the German plant typically processes light, sweet crude sourced from the North Sea and exports its fuels mostly to other parts of Europe and the United States.

101,COP,US Cash Products-Chicago gasoline up on refinery outages," * Chicago gasoline extends week’s gains on outages  * Harbor gasoline cools week’s rally  (Updates with end-day prices)  HOUSTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Chicago gasoline differentials rose 2.50 cents per gallon on Friday on increased buying ahead of the weekend, traders said.  With Friday’s rally, Chicago differentials gained 10.25 cents a gallon this week as outages at regional refineries operated by BP Plc (BP.N) (BP.L) and Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) boosted buying, traders said.  Chicago gasoline differentials rose a penny per gallon on Friday on increased buying interest ahead of the weekend, traders said.  With Friday’s rally, Chicago differentials gained 8.75 cents a gallon this week as outages at regional refineries operated by BP Plc (BP.N) BP.L. and Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) fueled buying, traders said.  A gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit remained down for work at BP’s 405,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Valero’s 180,000 bpd refinery in Memphis, Tennessee, remained shut after a crude unit’s heater exploded and burned a week ago.  On Friday, an FCCU at BP’s joint venture 131,400 bpd refinery in Toledo, Ohio, was back in operation after a malfunction earlier this week, according to regulators. [ID:nWEN7228] BP operates the refinery, which it co-owns with Husky Energy (HSE.TO)  The outages helped push Group Three gasoline differentials up a penny per gallon on Friday as well, though the ongoing restart of ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) 198,400 bpd refinery in Ponca City, Oklahoma, tempered the gain, traders said.  In the New York Harbor, trade cooled on Friday even with tight supply in the region, slightly extending Thursday’s 4.00 cents-per-gallon rally with an increase of a quarter cent per gallon, traders said.  “The market is pretty dead. There isn’t a whole lot of products out there,” a Harbor trader said. “It appears everyone is waiting for Monday.”  The Harbor rally stemmed from talk of an outage at Irving Oil’s 300,000 bpd New Brunswick refinery, Canada’s largest, which is a major supplier of fuels in the U.S. Northeast.  On Friday, an Irving spokeswoman said the plant had a brief upset on Thursday, but had resumed normal operations.

102,COP,Conocophillips ups estimate of China oil spill,"BEIJING (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips China, a subsidiary of the Houston-based oil company ConocoPhillips, said on Friday that as much as 2,500 barrels of oil and mud leaked from an oilfield in China’s northern Bohai Bay.  A recent survey at the C platform of Penglai 19-3 oil field identified more oil-based drilling mud on the sea floor than originally estimated, the company said on its website (www.conocophillips.com.cn), adding that it expected to complete a cleanup by the end of this month.  Last month, ConocoPhillips estimated around 1,500 barrels (240 cubic meters) of oil and oil-based drilling fluids had been released into the sea and that an order to shut down the platforms would result in a temporary output reduction of about 17,000 barrels of oil per day.  “We have already cleaned up approximately 70 percent of the mineral oil-based mud on the seabed and will have the additional volume cleaned up by the end of August,” said Georg Storaker, President of ConocoPhillips China.

104,COP,U.S. Cash Products-Chicago gasoline down on cycle change," * Chicago gasoline slips on cycle shift  * Group Three gasoline up on continued refinery outage  HOUSTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chicago gasoline differentials fell 3.00 cents a gallon on Monday as the market shifted to the third cycle of the month, traders said.  The drop pared the fuel’s rally of 10.25 cents per gallon last week on regional refinery outages, and coincided with the complete restart of ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) 198,400-barrels-per-day refinery in Ponca City, Oklahoma.  However, Group Three gasoline differentials climbed 1.50 cents a gallon on lower stocks in the region and the continued shutdown of Valero Energy Corp’s (VLO.N) 180,000-bpd Memphis, Tennessee refinery, traders said. The refinery shut after a heater that is part of one of two crude units exploded.  Valero on Monday had no estimate of when the plant would restart. [ID:nWNAB9686]  Gulf Coast conventional M2 gasoline differentials gained about 2.00 cents per gallon several days after the fire as Midwest buying of Gulf products increased, but had pared those gains by Friday.  “Its market area includes locations that are also supplied out of the Gulf, like Little Rock (Arkansas) and Nashville (Tennessee),” a Gulf trader said.  Gulf gasoline differentials slipped half a penny per gallon under the September RBOB contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the fuel’s latest five-day lifting cycle scheduled to move on the Colonial Pipeline.  The Colonial transports refined products from the Gulf Coast to the U.S. Northeast. Gulf jet fuel differentials gained 0.75 cent per gallon, also on pipeline scheduling.

105,COP,Nigeria's NNPC to reduce its stake in Brass LNG," ABUJA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state-oil company NNPC said on Monday it will reduce its stake in the long-delayed Brass Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project to 30 percent, from its current 49 percent, to secure much-needed investment.   The state-owned company has offered 4 percent of its stake to LNG Japan, which is jointly owned by trading firms Sumitomo (8053.T) and Sojitz (2768.T) and 3 percent to Itochu (8001.T) . A further 2 percent was offered to a joint venture between Nigeria’s Sahara Energy and U.S.-based Sempra Energy (SRE.N).   NNPC said it has secured a $2 billion loan from a Japanese consortium, led by Japan Bank for International Co-operation, to help fund its share of the project.   “Everyone is looking to invest and we have invited others to join. It is a time everyone is looking to alternatives and the Japanese have been very interested in this project,” an NNPC spokesman said.   He said stakeholders will make a final investment decision on the project in the first quarter of next year.   Brass LNG, whose shareholders also include multinational energy firms Eni (ENI.MI), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Total (TOTF.PA), opened construction bids last month for onshore and offshore works and for a sub-sea pipeline.   The project has suffered from years of delays of a lack of investment and the country’s focus on crude oil production.   President Goodluck Jonathan, sworn in for his first full term in May, pledged during his campaign to unlock the potential of the world’s seventh-largest gas reserves.

108,COP,UPDATE 2-TransCanada has attracted no Alaska gas shippers," * No signed commitments, one year after open season   * Still in talks with possible shippers, partners   * TransCanada and Exxon expect to spend $700 million  (Adds comments from hearing, background)   ANCHORAGE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) has no firm commitments to ship gas on its proposed $40 billion pipeline from Alaska’s North Slope, despite 12 months of negotiations and the demise of a rival project, an executive with the company said on Tuesday.   The company is still in talks with potential shippers for its long-delayed Alaska pipeline, and they include all of the major North Slope producers, TransCanada vice-president Tony Palmer told a state legislative committee on Tuesday.   “If customers are out there today who want to make a late bid and sign contracts with us, we’re open to reviewing that,” Palmer said.   He reiterated the company’s offer of equity stakes in the development to other firms.   Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is currently TransCanada’s partner in the Alaska pipeline project, which under the main plan would ship 4.5 billion cubic feet a day of gas to the Alberta border from the North Slope. A second option would move supplies to Valdez, Alaska, where they would be liquefied and shipped on tankers.   A 90-day “open season” — essentially an invitation for commitments to ship gas on the pipeline — ended July 30, 2010.   The company has said the results were inconclusive, and it was in talks with potential shippers to try to come to terms as the economics of Arctic gas were pressured by weak prices and the development of shale gas projects closer to major U.S. markets.   Palmer said the project is on schedule in its technical development and its reparation for permitting, which anticipates Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certification in 2014.   “But our commercial timeline is behind schedule, absolutely, primarily because of factors out of our control,” he told the committee.   He said one sticking point for garnering shipping commitments has been a legal dispute between Exxon Mobil and the state over developing the Point Thomson field on the North Slope, gas from which feeds the pipeline.   Alaska Natural Resource Commissioner Dan Sullivan told lawmakers Monday that the state and Exxon Mobil and Alaska had reached a tentative settlement over the company’s development of Point Thomson. [ID:nN1E77F055]   “That’s highly positive for our project because we need Point Thomson gas to make this project viable,” Palmer said.   In May, BP Plc (BP.L) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the two other major oil producers on the North Slope, dropped their rival $35 billion Denali pipeline plan, blaming the weak gas markets and competition from shale supplies.   BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil hold the leases to most of the known North Slope natural gas reserves, totaling about 35 trillion cubic feet.   TransCanada has had the backing of the state under legislation aimed at kick-starting the project that was developed under former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.   The state legislation entitles TransCanada and Exxon to as much as $500 million in state subsidies.   So far, Palmer said, the companies have spent $288 million, of which $94 million has been reimbursed by the state. Even if the result is a project lacking commitments from shippers, TransCanada and Exxon expect to spend $700 million, of which $500 million would come from the state, he said.

110,COP,China says it has not yet set damages for oil spill,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s maritime authority said on Tuesday it had not determined the compensation it would seek for ecological damage caused by a spill at the Bohai Bay oilfield, while it plans to sue the parties responsible for those damages according to state media.  The State Oceanic Administration (SOA), on its website, denied a report by the Economic Information Daily, citing unidentified sources, that the government was considering demanding more than 100 million yuan ($15.6 million) from CNOOC Ltd and ConocoPhillips, which own the oilfield.  “Related work on compensation for ecological damage from the Bohai oil spill is ongoing,” the SOA said on its website (www.soa.gov.cn).  “Final compensation has not been fixed,” it said, adding that the newspaper report was “untrue.”  The North China Sea branch of the SOA will represent the government in suing responsible parties for ecological damages by the oil spill, Xinhua reported.  The oil leak at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, which started in June, have polluted 840 square kilometers of water, the SOA has said.  ConocoPhillips China said on Friday that as many as 2,500 barrels of oil and mud had leaked from the oilfield in the Bohai Bay, off the coast of northern China.  The subsidiary of the Houston-based company, which operates the oilfield, said it could not comment on speculation about future actions the SOA may take but was making efforts to finish the clean-up by the end of this month.  “ConocoPhillips is making significant progress cleaning up the mineral-oil based mud on the sea floor, which we expect to have complete by the end of August,” the company said in a email to Reuters.  By Tuesday, ConocoPhillips China had recovered 337 cubic meters (2,119 barrels) of oil-based mud from around the Penglai 19-3 C platform, the company said on its website (www.conocophillips.com.cn).  Small oil droplets were seen bubbling from the sea floor near Platform C on Sunday, and this area is being continuously monitored to determine the source of the droplets, it said.  Near the B Platform, the containment device that has been placed on the seabed over the current location of the seep is containing any hydrocarbons that are released from the seep, it added.  ConocoPhillips has a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s offshore oil specialist CNOOC Ltd has the remainder.  Last month, the SOA said ConocoPhillips could be fined up to 200,000 yuan ($30,946) for the accident, according to law. But that figure did not include any compensation for ecological and economic damage.  The administration has accused ConocoPhillips of being too slow to clean up the spill and has demanded an apology. It has also asked the company to contain the oil spill, clean up polluted areas and conduct a thorough investigation before August 31 to eliminate further risks of oil spills.

113,COP,UPDATE 2-Washington refineries report upsets," * Gasoline prices spiked in West Coast markets Wednesday  * Tesoro, Conoco, Shell refineries file notices  (Updates with Conoco comment, paragraph 6; Shell comment, paragraph 8)  HOUSTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Three Washington state refineries have reported malfunctions on units involved in gasoline production since Sunday, notices filed with state pollution regulators show.  Tesoro Corp TSO.N and Shell Oil Co’s (RDSa.L) Anacortes, Washington refineries along with ConocoPhillips’(COP.N) Fernday, Washington, refinery reported malfunctions to the Northwest Clean Air Agency.  Gasoline prices spiked up 9 cents in the Los Angeles wholesale market on Wednesday for August-delivery gasoline while September contracts climbed 11 cents. Traders were scrambling to find refinery problems, which usually account for such price swings.  Tesoro’s said a carbon monoxide boiler on the 120,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery’s catalytic cracking unit was shut down due to a leak on Sunday and was preparing to start a temporary boiler to maintain production during the upset.  Conoco reported a an alkylation unit malfunction on the Monday at its 100,000 bpd refinery.  A Conoco spokeswoman declined to discuss refinery operations.  Shell said a sulfur recovery unit tripped out of production on Monday night at its 145,000 bpd Anacortes refinery. The unit was out of production on Tuesday.  A Shell spokeswoman declined to discuss refinery operations.

114,COP,Melting Arctic sea ice drives walruses onto land,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fast-melting Arctic sea ice appears to be pushing walruses to haul themselves out onto land, and many are moving around the area where oil leases have been sold, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.  Walruses are accomplished divers and frequently plunge hundreds of feet (meters) to the bottom of the continental shelf to feed. But they use sea ice as platforms to give birth, nurse their young and elude predators, and when sea ice is scarce or non-existent, as it has been this summer, they come up on land.  Last September, the loss of sea ice caused an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 walruses to venture onto land, and as sea ice melts reached a record last month, U.S. government scientists are working with Alaskan villagers to put radio transmitters on some of the hauled-out walruses to track their movements around the Chukchi Sea.  “The ice is very widely dispersed and there is little of it left over the continental shelf,” researcher Chad Jay of the U.S. Geological Survey said in a statement on Wednesday. “Based on our tracking data, the walruses appear to be spreading out and spending quite a bit of time looking for sea ice.”  The loss of sea ice puts Pacific walruses at risk, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but other, higher-priority species will get attention first. In February, the wildlife service listed Pacific walruses as candidates for protection, though not protection itself.  Walruses are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which means these animals cannot be harvested, imported, exported or be part of interstate commerce.  Polar bears, which also use sea ice in the Chukchi Sea as platforms for hunting, have been designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act because of declining sea ice in the Arctic.  Compared to last year’s massive haul-out, there are few walruses on land, and there is no solid count, Jay said.  “There is a lot less ice than there used to be on the continental shelf this time of year,” he said. “So we might be headed into a new normal.”  Transmissions from the radio-tagged walruses offer a good picture of where these creatures are in the Chukchi Sea in a U.S. Geological Survey graphic updated approximately weekly.  Available online here , the graphic shows where the walruses were when they were first tagged (shown as red Xs) and how they moved around the water (shown as yellow dots).

115,COP,Melting Arctic sea ice drives walruses onto land," * Many walruses spotted in Arctic oil lease sale area   * Loss of sea ice makes them move onto land   By Deborah Zabarenko, Environment Correspondent   WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Fast-melting Arctic sea ice appears to be pushing walruses to haul themselves out onto land, and many are moving around the area where oil leases have been sold, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.   Walruses are accomplished divers and frequently plunge hundreds of feet (meters) to the bottom of the continental shelf to feed. But they use sea ice as platforms to give birth, nurse their young and elude predators, and when sea ice is scarce or non-existent, as it has been this summer, they come up on land.   Last September, the loss of sea ice caused an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 walruses to venture onto land, and as sea ice melts reached a record last month, U.S. government scientists are working with Alaskan villagers to put radio transmitters on some of the hauled-out walruses to track their movements around the Chukchi Sea.   “The ice is very widely dispersed and there is little of it left over the continental shelf,” researcher Chad Jay of the U.S. Geological Survey said in a statement on Wednesday. “Based on our tracking data, the walruses appear to be spreading out and spending quite a bit of time looking for sea ice.”   The loss of sea ice puts Pacific walruses at risk, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but other, higher-priority species will get attention first. In February, the wildlife service listed Pacific walruses as candidates for protection, though not protection itself.   Walruses are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which means these animals cannot be harvested, imported, exported or be part of interstate commerce.   Polar bears, which also use sea ice in the Chukchi Sea as platforms for hunting, have been designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act because of declining sea ice in the Arctic.   Compared to last year’s massive haul-out, there are few walruses on land, and there is no solid count, Jay said.   “There is a lot less ice than there used to be on the continental shelf this time of year,” he said. “So we might be headed into a new normal.”   Transmissions from the radio-tagged walruses offer a good picture of where these creatures are in the Chukchi Sea in a U.S. Geological Survey graphic updated approximately weekly.   Available online here , the graphic shows where the walruses were when they were first tagged (shown as red Xs) and how they moved around the water (shown as yellow dots).

116,COP,US Cash Products-Group Three gasoline extends gains," * Group Three gasoline up on supply concerns  * Harbor jet fuel pares gains as more supply arrives  HOUSTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Group Three gasoline differentials in the Midwest rose on Wednesday on supply concerns, traders said. Gasoline in the Midwest Group Three market climbed 1.50 cents per gallon, extending Tuesday’s gain of the same amount and bringing differentials to their highest level in two months.  The gain also came as the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s weekly inventory data released on Wednesday showed a substantial 1 million-barrel drop in the region’s gasoline stocks last week. [EIA/S]  The EIA said U.S. gasoline stocks fell by a higher-than-expected 3.5 million barrels. Stocks in all five PADDs fell, though the Midwest decrease was the largest among markets east of the Rockies.  In the New York Harbor, differentials in products markets eased slightly on Wednesday as Korea National Oil Corp’s 115,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Come By Chance, Newfoundland, was resuming production after a lengthy turnaround. [ID:nN1E77B10Q]  The EIA said East Coast gasoline stocks fell by 394,000 barrels last week.  Traders said few deals were done on Wednesday, but talks indicated that the market was weakening by about a half cent per gallon across the board.  Harbor jet fuel differentials fell by that amount, paring a 2.50 cent-per-gallon gain earlier this week, as more supply became available, traders said.  On the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, conventional M2 gasoline differentials gained half a penny per gallon after the EIA data showed a slight drop of 190,000 barrels in the region’s gasoline stocks. Gulf distillate markets were largely steady.  The EIA also said U.S. distillate stocks climbed 2.45 million barrels to 153.9 million barrels, driven by sizable increases in stocks in the East Coast and Gulf Coast regions, which rose by 1.39 million barrels and 1.36 million barrels, respectively.  Midwest distillate stocks slipped by 127,000 barrels, and traders expect diesel demand to increase as the region nears the autumn crop harvest season.  U.S. refinery utilization slipped 0.9 percentage points to 89.1 percent last week, the EIA said.  Utilization in the Gulf Coast region, where the coastline is home to 40 percent of the nation’s refining capacity, was largely steady, having risen 0.1 percentage point to 90.2 percent.  But Midwest utilization fell by 3.1 percentage points to 90.8 percent on refinery outages in the region, which included problems at ConocoPhillips’ 198,400 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and BP Plc’s (BP.L) (BP.N) joint-venture 131,400 bpd refinery in Toledo, Ohio.  East Coast refinery utilization fell by 2.6 percentage points to 80.4 percent, reflecting in part an upset at Hess Corp’s (HES.N) 70,000 bpd refinery in Port Reading, New Jersey.

118,COP,Energy-hungry Bangladesh strikes new gas reserve," DHAKA, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Bangladesh has struck a gas reserve at a newly discovered field at a time when the country is facing acute gas shortages, a senior energy official said on Wednesday.	   A gas structure at Sundalpur in southern Noakhali district has been discovered by the state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company (Bapex). 	   “Today we started a well test to determine its exact reserve,” said Bapex Managing Director Mortuza Ahmad Faruque.	   “The reserve could be small but we are expecting 10-12 million cubic feet of gas may be extracted per day and it would be commercially viable,” he told Reuters.	   The gas has been found 1,400 metres under ground and the pressure is good, he added.	   Bangladesh, with about 13 trillion cubic feet of probable and recoverable gas reserves, has been facing an acute supply crisis, with production totalling around 2,000 million cubic feet per day against demand of more than 2,500 mmcfd.  	   The widening gap prompted the government to stop giving new gas connections to industrial and manufacturing firms as well as households since 2010, curbing economic growth.	   The government, under growing public furry over utility shortages, hopes to add about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to the national grid by the end of 2012, with a deal signed with U.S. energy giant ConocoPhilips to explore gas and oil in the Bay of Bengal.

119,COP,China pushes ConocoPhillips to contain oil spill by end of Aug,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s marine authorities expressed growing frustration at the failure of a unit of ConocoPhillips to contain a two-month oil spill that has spread across the northeast coast and again urged it to halt the leak by the end of August.  Officials of the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) met ConocoPhillips officials again on Tuesday and urged the company to seal off oil leaks in northern China’s Bohai Bay and clean up polluted areas before an August 31 deadline, the agency said on its website (www.soa.gov.cn).  “To date, ConocoPhillips has not yet sealed off sources of the oil spill at Penglai 19-3 oilfield,” the administration said.  “The company has come to no clear conclusion about why a new oil spill source has been found at platform B, why more oily mud has been found near platform C, or even whether similar situations could occur in the future,” the administration said.  The measures taken by ConocoPhillips have so far been limited to lowering pressure on the seabed and installing an oil containment device, which are temporary and remedial. They have not eliminated oil spill risks effectively, it added.  The administration said it would “strengthen oversight” if ConocoPhillips fails to contain the oil spill in time, but it did not provide any further details about what action it would take.  The spill has already spread to the Bohai Bay coast, posing a direct threat to the region’s environment, and SOA also urged ConocoPhillips to keep the public informed about potential risks as soon as possible.  The oil leak at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, which started in June, have polluted 840 square kilometers of water, the SOA has said.  ConocoPhillips has a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s offshore oil specialist CNOOC Ltd has the remainder.  SOA said on Tuesday it had not decided how much compensation it would seek for the ecological damage caused by the oil spill, but it plans to sue the parties responsible.

125,COP,Wall Street sinks for fourth straight week,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended a fourth week of losses on a down note on Friday as most buyers left the market before the weekend on growing fears of another U.S. recession and destabilization in Europe’s financial system.  Investors already reeling from big losses in growth stocks were thumped by a dismal outlook from Hewlett-Packard, which dropped nearly 20 percent, its worst day since the stock-market crash of 1987.  It was the latest discouraging event in a month full of bad surprises ranging from the U.S. credit rating downgrade to a sharp slowdown in world growth. The S&P has lost 13.1 percent so far this month — on track for its worst month since October 2008.  “What I’m seeing right now is a basically a crisis of confidence, more so than an economic crisis or financial crisis necessarily at this stage,” said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland, which manages about $14.8 billion.  Hewlett-Packard’s shares tumbled 19.9 percent to a six-year closing low at $23.60 and were the biggest drag on the Dow, a day after the company said it may spin off its PC business, the biggest in the world, and lowered its outlook.  The losses follow a day of sharp declines. At the session lows on Thursday, the Dow was down more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq each shed more than 5 percent at the day’s worst.  Worries that the United States and the global economy may be headed for another recession have unnerved investors in recent weeks. Thursday marked the sixth time in the past two weeks that the S&P 500 has moved 4 percent or more.

IBM shares fell 3.8 percent to $157.54, while Intel dropped 2.9 percent to $19.19, and Microsoft lost 2.5 percent to $24.05.  “I think it’s more of a drift than any real selling here,” said Frank Gretz, market analyst and technician for Shields & Co in New York. “It’s more common to see a drift down with people more fearful about the weekend ...

131,COP,UPDATE 1-China's demand for W. African crude jumps -trade," * China to import average 918,00 bpd of W.African crude   * Unipec the largest buyer of W.African crude   * Nigerian spot premiums return to the level before SPR release   (Adds details)	   By Ikuko Kurahone	   LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - China’s buying of West African crude oil is set to rise about 15 percent in September from August, trade sources said on Friday, but overall Asian imports from West Africa will fall due to slower Indian demand.	    Meanwhile, U.S. companies have resumed buying light sweet crude after having suspended spot purchases following the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the sources said.	   Chinese imports of oil from producers such as Angola and Nigeria are estimated to average 918,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September, the largest volume since March. The August imports are expected to total 797,000 bpd.	   Unipec, the oil trading arm of Sinopec Corp , appeared as the biggest corporate buyer of West African crude, buying at least 633,000 bpd for September loading, mostly Angolan crude. More than a quarter of Angolan crude was sold to Unipec.	   ConocoPhillips followed Unipec as the second-largest corporate buyer. It bought about 10 cargoes, or about 320,000 bpd, in September, mostly Nigerian sweet crude. 	   ConocoPhillips scooped up the cargoes towards the end of the trading month of September, while it bought nearly no West African crude for August loading as it procured sweet crude from the SPR as a part of the emergency oil stock release coordinated by the International Energy Agency in late-June.	   “The September market turned to be strong,” a physical oil trader said.	   “Conoco’s move definitely supported the market and Angolan cargoes were sold very quickly to Chinese buyers.”	   The increase in U.S. demand pushed up spot differential on Nigerian light, sweet benchmark Bonny Light and Qua Iboe to about dated BFOE plus $2.90/$3.00 a barrel, recovering to the May level before the announcement of the SPR release. BFO-BON BFO-QUA	   The differentials on Nigerian light sweet crude had fallen to dated plus $1.60/$1.70 in July because of the release, which was meant to fill in the loss of oil exports from war-torn Libya. 	   The Chinese and U.S. demand offset the fall in Indian demand for West African crude. The volume will halve to about 253,000 bpd in September from 523,000 bpd in August, lowering total Asian imports.	   Total Asian imports of West African crude will average 1.39 million bpd in September, compared with 1.59 million bpd in August.

133,COP,Global LNG-Asian LNG prices rise above $15/mmBtu on demand," PERTH/LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot prices for September rose above $15 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) during the week, with strong Asian demand keeping prices high.        	   “Asian markets were holding just north of the $15 level for cargoes as the demand for LNG continues to ramp up,” ICAP analysts said in a note.   	   Top LNG importers Japan and South Korea both reported higher imports for July. 	   Japan’s LNG imports rose 14.3 percent in July compared with the same period a year earlier as the nation continues to depend on the fuel to replace nuclear power lost due to the March earthquake, while South Korea’s imports increased 9 percent year-on-year.    	   Spot prices in Asia have now risen over 50 percent since Japan’s earthquake in March boosted demand for LNG. LNG-AS	   The spread between Asian spot prices around $15.10 and British prices was about $5.40 per mmBtu this week, wide enough to coax cargoes to Asia from the Atlantic. Recent Nigerian cargoes have been sent east to higher-paying Pacific markets. 	   Shipments to Asia from the Middle East and the Atlantic Basin increased by 1.357 million and 1.146 million metric tons respectively in July, while Asia-Pacific shipments of LNG to Asian buyers fell, Waterborne LNG analysts said in a note. 	   Qatar, Nigeria, Trinidad, Yemen, and Abu Dhabi had the largest year-over-year increases shipments to Asia. 	   And the trend looks set to continue, despite extremely high shipping costs of just under $100,000 a day.  	   “Spreads to Asia from the Atlantic remain at all time highs with winter 11 spreads now looking close to $7.50,” ICAP analysts said.   	   Supply from the Atlantic Basin was also seen in South Korea’s long term supply agreements with Shell and Total signed this week. Under the deals, totaling $84 billion, cargoes will be sourced from Australia, and from company portfolios across the Atlantic Basin. [ID: nL3E7JH056]	   The boom in Asian supply may leave European import terminals short as Asia sucks up Atlantic Basin supply, analysts said this week. 	   In the Atlantic, U.S. gas prices hit five month lows on Thursday and ample supply continued to deter spot LNG shipments to terminals there. 	   Flows from U.S. terminals hit 0.63 billion cubic feet per day on average last week, according to Tudor Pickering Holt analysts. The flows are near contractual minimums, as traders ship gas elsewhere.

134,COP,ConocoPhillips vows to finish oil spill cleanup by end-Aug,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A subsidiary of Houston-based ConocoPhillips said on Friday that more than 85 percent of oil-based mud from its oil spill in China’s Bohai Bay had been recovered and vowed to finish the cleanup by the end of this month.  The oil leak at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, which started in June, has polluted 840 square kilometers of water, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has said.  ConocoPhilips owns a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s offshore oil specialist CNOOC Ltd has a 51 percent stake.  The marine authority had expressed growing frustration at the failure of ConocoPhillips China to contain the two-month oil spill that has spread across the northeast coast and repeatedly urged it to halt the leak by the end of August.  ConocoPhillips China said in a statement it believes the leak at platform B of Penglai 19-3 oilfield had naturally sealed. The company is also carrying out plans to ensure the fault is sealed off by pumping cement into various spots along the fault, the company said on its website (www.conocophillips.com.cn).  The company said it has not found evidence of harm to marine life but added it continues to work with the government and international experts to confirm whether there has been any affect on marine life or fisheries.  The official Xinhua news agency said on Thursday that fishermen in north China’s Hebei Province were preparing to sue ConocoPhillips because they believed recent oil spills in Bohai Bay were to blame for the deaths of large numbers of scallops.  Economic losses of the fishermen are believed to be between 150 million yuan and 170 million yuan ($23.5 million-$26.6 million) as more than half of the scallops the fishermen raised have died, Xinhua said.  The State Oceanic Administration said this week it had not determined the compensation it would seek for ecological damage caused by the oil spill, adding it plans to sue the parties responsible.  ConocoPhillips is preparing to deliver to the China’s marine authority a report reviewing the steps taken to address these incidents and to review forward plans. It will also keep the public apprised of its progress, it said.  The company said on Thursday that with the approval from SOA, it had resumed operations at some wells in China’s Bohai Bay that were ordered to shut down after an oil spill.

135,COP,ConcoPhillips begins Bangladesh gas search in October," DHAKA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - U.S oil company ConocoPhillips  has begun preliminary work to carry out exploration in Bangladesh’s offshore gas field in October this year, a senior energy official said on Saturday.	   Bangladesh approved on May 23 a plan by the firm to explore for oil and gas in two deep sea blocks in the coming winter.	   “We are happy that the international oil firm is to begin its work on time as we are deeply short of natural gas,” Mohammad Hussain Monsur, chairman of the state-run Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation or Petrobangla, told Reuters.	   He said the U.S firm had already started an environment impact assessment survey.	   Bangladesh faces acute gas shortages, with production at around 2,000 million cubic feet (mmcft) per day against demand of more than 2,500 mmcft a day.	   It has proven gas reserves of 7.3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and probable reserves of 5.5 tcf.	   ConocoPhillips signed a production sharing contract (PSC) with Petrobangla on June 16 this year, under which the U.S. firm  has a total of nine years to carry out exploration work.	   It has provided a $52 million guarantee for an initial exploration period of five year, $58 million for a first extension of two years and $50 million for a second 2-year extension period.	   It will not be able to undertake any exploration work in  disputed areas in the blocks until Bangladesh resolves its maritime boundary spats with neighbours, India and Myanmar.	   According to the PSC, ConocoPhillips will not be able to export gas from the two deep water blocks by pipeline, but in liquefied natural gas (LNG) form, and only if Petrobangla and any third-party domestic user refuses to buy it.	   The share of profit for Petrobangla under the PSC is a minimum of 55 percent running up to a maximum of 80 percent for natural gas and a minimum of 60 percent with a maximum up to 85 percent for oil or condensate.

Investors already reeling from big losses in growth stocks were thumped by a dismal outlook from Hewlett-Packard, which dropped nearly 20 percent, its worst day since the stock-market crash of 1987.  It was the latest discouraging event in a month full of bad surprises ranging from the U.S. credit rating downgrade to a sharp slowdown in world growth. The S&P has lost 13.1 percent so far this month — on track for its worst month since October 2008.  “What I’m seeing right now is a basically a crisis of confidence, more so than an economic crisis or financial crisis necessarily at this stage,” said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland, which manages about $14.8 billion.

139,COP,"ENI leads Libya oil race; Russia, China may lose out","MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italian oil company Eni led the charge back into Libya on Monday as rebels hailed the end of Muammar Gaddafi’s rule and as traders watched for the return of Libyan crude to the market.  Gaddafi’s fall will reopen the doors to Africa’s largest oil reserves and give new players such as Qatar’s national oil company and trading house Vitol the chance to compete for lucrative contracts, but rebels warned Russian and Chinese firms may be frozen out for failing to support the rebellion.  “We don’t have a problem with Western countries like the Italians, French and UK companies. But we may have some political issues with Russia, China and Brazil,” Abdeljalil Mayouf, information manager at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO, told Reuters.  The comment signals a potential setback for those countries which opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi or pressed for more talks and would leave European and U.S. companies to capture billions of dollars worth of oil exploration and construction contracts in the OPEC member nation.  Shares in Eni (ENI.MI), top producer in pre-war Libya, gained as much as 7 percent, as its chairman Giuseppe Recchi said Libyan oil and gas flows could restart before winter.  Italy’s Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said staff from Eni had arrived to look into a restart of oil facilities in the country’s east.  “The facilities had been made by Italians, by (oilfield services group) Saipem (SPMI.MI), and therefore it is clear that Eni will play a No. 1 role in the future,” Frattini told state television RAI.  Shares in Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) also rose by 3-5 percent and U.S. oil and oil services firms with operations in Libya followed the trend.  Brent oil futures fell sharply early on Monday as traders anticipated the resumption of Libyan exports, but prices crept back up later in the day as the outlook for a speedy return was reassessed.  “It will probably take weeks before we see exports again and it (Libya) also needs to feed the refineries. But nonetheless we need to add Libya back to OPEC spare capacity now,” said analyst Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix.  Before the war, Libya produced about 2 percent of global oil output or 1.6 million barrels per day and has reserves to sustain that level of production for 80 years.  Libya’s former top oil official Shokri Ghanem, who defected from the government of Gaddafi in May, told Reuters some Libyan oil output would restart in a few months but it would take up to 18 months to return to pre-war levels.  A Reuters poll forecast it would take up to a year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd and up to two years to get back to pre-war levels.  About 75 Chinese companies operated in Libya before the war, involving about 36,000 staff and 50 projects, according to Chinese media.  Russian companies, including oil firms Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM) and Tatneft TATN3.MM, also had projects worth billions of dollars in Libya. Brazilian firms such as Petrobras (PETR3.SA) and construction company Odebrecht were also in business there.  “We have lost Libya completely,” Aram Shegunts, director general of the Russia-Libya Business Council, told Reuters.  “Our companies will lose everything there because NATO will prevent them from doing their business in Libya.”  Apart from Italian officials, other European politicians and oil companies were more reserved in comments on Libya.  “At the moment we are not holding any bilateral talks with the (National) Transitional Council,” OMV said.  Wintershall said restarting production could be done within several weeks: “This of course depends on the state of the export infrastructure as well as a stable security situation in the country,” it said.  Analysts and industry observers have said Eni and Total could emerge as the big winners in post-war Libya due to their countries’ heavy support for the rebels.  Big support from Qatar as well as oil trader Vitol, neither producers in Libya before the war, may also guarantee a chunk of reserves and influence goes to new players.  “Qatar will be a big player.

142,COP,UPDATE 2-ENI leads Libya oil race as Gaddafi nears end," MILAN, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Libya’s leading foreign oil producer, Eni of Italy led the charge back into Libya on Monday as rebels swept into the Libyan capital Tripoli hailing the end of Muammar Gaddafi’s rule.      	   Gaddafi’s fall will reopen the doors to Africa’s largest oil reserves with new players such as Qatar’s national oil company and trading house Vitol set to compete with established European and U.S. companies.	   Shares in European companies Italy’s Eni , Austria’s OMV and France’s Total rose by 3-5 percent despite a $2 fall in the price of oil LCOc1 on hopes the firms would be able to quickly re-establish output from Libya.	   Italy’s Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said staff from Eni had arrived to look into a restart of oil facilities in the east of the country even as fighting between government troops and the rebels continued in Tripoli in the west. 	   “The facilities had been made by Italians, by (oil field services group) Saipem , and therefore it is clear that Eni will play a No. 1 role in the future,” Frattini told state TV RAI.	    OPEC member Libya was producing about 2 percent of global oil output or 1.6 million barrels per day before the war and has reserves to sustain that levels of production for 80 years.	   OMV said it was not in any talks yet.	   “We are observing the current situation and further developments very closely. At the moment we are not holding any bilateral talks with the (National) Transitional Council,” an OMV spokesman said.  	   Other major player in pre-war Libya France’s Total  and Germany’s Wintershall declined comment.	   Analysts and industry observers have said Eni and Total could emerge as the big winners in post-war Libya due to their countries’ heavy support for the rebels.	   Big support from Qatar as well as oil trader Vitol, neither producers in Libya before the war, may also guarantee a chunk of reserves and influence goes to new players.	   “Qatar will be a big player, Vitol might be an important one. Shell (RDSa.L) is also looking to boost its role,” said a Western risk consultant with knowledge of negotiations.	   Most global oil majors have taken a much more cautious approach to events in Libya with BP , not yet a producer in Libya, saying it was planning to return to explore but giving no timeframe.	   “We fully intend to return to Libya to fulfil our contract when conditions allow,” said a spokesman for BP, which did not have production in Libya before the war.	   U.S. companies such as Marathon , ConocoPhillips  , Hess , Occidental have pulled out of Libya at the start of the year and have had little direct involvement in the events there since then.	   “They are just sitting and waiting and trying to figure out who will run the place,” said the risk consultant who is advising some U.S. firms on Libya.

150,COP,"ENI leads Libya oil race; Russia, China may lose out","MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italian oil company Eni led the charge back into Libya on Monday as rebels hailed the end of Muammar Gaddafi’s rule and as traders watched for the return of Libyan crude to the market.  Gaddafi’s fall will reopen the doors to Africa’s largest oil reserves and give new players such as Qatar’s national oil company and trading house Vitol the chance to compete for lucrative contracts, but rebels warned Russian and Chinese firms may be frozen out for failing to support the rebellion.  “We don’t have a problem with Western countries like the Italians, French and UK companies. But we may have some political issues with Russia, China and Brazil,” Abdeljalil Mayouf, information manager at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO, told Reuters.  The comment signals a potential setback for those countries which opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi or pressed for more talks and would leave European and U.S. companies to capture billions of dollars worth of oil exploration and construction contracts in the OPEC member nation.  Shares in Eni, top producer in pre-war Libya, gained as much as 7 percent, as its chairman Giuseppe Recchi said Libyan oil and gas flows could restart before winter.  Italy’s Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said staff from Eni had arrived to look into a restart of oil facilities in the country’s east.  “The facilities had been made by Italians, by (oilfield services group) Saipem, and therefore it is clear that Eni will play a No. 1 role in the future,” Frattini told state television RAI.  Shares in Austria’s OMV and France’s Total also rose by 3-5 percent and U.S. oil and oil services firms with operations in Libya followed the trend.  Brent oil futures fell sharply early on Monday as traders anticipated the resumption of Libyan exports, but prices crept back up later in the day as the outlook for a speedy return was reassessed.  “It will probably take weeks before we see exports again and it (Libya) also needs to feed the refineries. But nonetheless we need to add Libya back to OPEC spare capacity now,” said analyst Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix.  Before the war, Libya produced about 2 percent of global oil output or 1.6 million barrels per day and has reserves to sustain that level of production for 80 years.  Libya’s former top oil official Shokri Ghanem, who defected from the government of Gaddafi in May, told Reuters some Libyan oil output would restart in a few months but it would take up to 18 months to return to pre-war levels.  A Reuters poll forecast it would take up to a year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd and up to two years to get back to pre-war levels.  About 75 Chinese companies operated in Libya before the war, involving about 36,000 staff and 50 projects, according to Chinese media.  Russian companies, including oil firms Gazprom Neft and Tatneft, also had projects worth billions of dollars in Libya. Brazilian firms such as Petrobras and construction company Odebrecht were also in business there.  “We have lost Libya completely,” Aram Shegunts, director general of the Russia-Libya Business Council, told Reuters.  “Our companies will lose everything there because NATO will prevent them from doing their business in Libya.”  Apart from Italian officials, other European politicians and oil companies were more reserved in comments on Libya.  “At the moment we are not holding any bilateral talks with the (National) Transitional Council,” OMV said.  Wintershall said restarting production could be done within several weeks: “This of course depends on the state of the export infrastructure as well as a stable security situation in the country,” it said.  Analysts and industry observers have said Eni and Total could emerge as the big winners in post-war Libya due to their countries’ heavy support for the rebels.  Big support from Qatar as well as oil trader Vitol, neither producers in Libya before the war, may also guarantee a chunk of reserves and influence goes to new players.  “Qatar will be a big player. Vitol might be an important one. Shell is also looking to boost its role,” said a Western risk consultant with knowledge of negotiations. Shell and Vitol declined to comment.  Most global oil majors have taken a much more cautious approach to events in Libya. BP, which did not have production in Libya before the war, said it was planning to return to explore but gave no timeframe.  U.S. companies such as Marathon, ConocoPhillips, Hess, Occidental pulled out of Libya at the start of the year and have had little direct involvement in the events there since then.  “We have no intention of returning to Libya at the moment, as we don’t know what’s going on,” ConocoPhillips spokesman John McLemore told Reuters. “We are not in contact with the rebels or the Gaddafi people.”  Marathon Oil said it has had preliminary discussions with the National Transitional Council on restarting output at the Waha field, where it has a production sharing agreement with Conoco and Hess Corp.

156,COP,US Cash Products-Midwest gasoline markets pare gains," * Midwest gasoline slips as NYMEX RBOB spread narrows  * Harbor markets shrug off Philly refinery fire  HOUSTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Midwest gasoline differentials slipped Wednesday, paring recent gains, as the September RBOB gasoline futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost some of its premium against the October contract, traders said.  Group Three gasoline differentials fell a penny a gallon and Chicago gasoline slid a half cent on Wednesday, according to trade sources.  “The spread has firmed up,” said a Midwest trader noting the mid-morning rally of the October RBOB gasoline contract after a fire early on Wednesday at Sunoco Inc’s (SUN.N) 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Philadelphia narrowed its spread with the September contract. The latter is set to expire next week.  Chicago gasoline differentials jumped 5.00 cents per gallon on Tuesday on talk that Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) increased buying as a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit at its 212,000 barrels-per-day refinery in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, remained offline following a fire last week.  Marathon did not specify on Wednesday when the unit is likely to come back online. [ID:nN1E77N0UU]  New York Harbor gasoline and distillate markets were mostly quiet on Wednesday despite the Philadelphia refinery fire and Hurricane Irene’s path toward the East Coast, where the storm is expected to make landfall this weekend. [ID:nN1E77N00M]  Sunoco said on Wednesday that a crude unit at the refinery was running at reduced rates. [ID:nWEN7522]  On the Gulf Coast, conventional M2 gasoline differentials slipped half a penny per gallon as the fuel’s latest five-day lifting cycle scheduled to move on the Colonial Pipeline, which transports refined products to the U.S. Northeast.  The slip also came after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Gulf Coast gasoline stocks gained 1.9 million barrels last week, driving an overall U.S. gain of 1.35 million barrels to 211.4 million barrels. [EIA/S]  Midwest gasoline stocks fell by 322,000 barrels, and East Coast inventories fell by 18,000 barrels, the EIA said.  The Gulf Coast also drove last week’s 1.7 million-barrel increase in U.S. distillate stocks to 155.69 million barrels, the EIA data showed, with a gain of 2.15 million barrels in the region. East Coast distillate stocks rose by 439,000 barrels, and Midwest distillates fell by 401,000 barrels, the EIA said.  Gulf jet fuel differentials slipped by 0.75 cent per gallon after the data was released on Wednesday. Gulf ultra-low sulfur diesel differentials also showed a slight dip of 0.25 cent per gallon, but that likely reflected Colonial pipeline scheduling as well, traders said.  U.S. refinery utilization rose by 1.2 percentage points to 90.3 percent last week at the tail-end of the summer driving season, the EIA said.  Of markets east of the Rockies, the Gulf Coast saw the largest hike in utilization, rising 2.8 percentage points to 93 percent. The hike in part reflected the restart of a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit at BP Plc’s (BP.L) (BP.N) 406,570 (bpd) refinery in Texas City, Texas, as well as the return of an alkylation unit at ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) 247,000 bpd refinery in Sweeny, Texas.  East Coast refinery utilization gained 1.4 percentage points to 81.8 percent. Midwest utilization slipped 0.2 percentage points to 90.6 percent, reflecting the FCCU shutdown at Marathon’s Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery  For more refinery news, please go to [REF/OUT]  U.S. GULF COAST <0#P-USG>  Scheduling Cycle 48 conventional M2 gasoline was seen done at 6.25 and 6.50 cents under September RBOB futures, down half a penny.

158,COP,ConocoPhillips says evaluating China spill impact,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A subsidiary of ConocoPhillips said it has started evaluating the impact of its oil spill in China’s northern Bohai Bay on the marine environment, but has not yet received any claims for the incident.  State media have said fishermen in northern China’s Hebei Province were preparing to sue ConocoPhillips for wiping out large numbers of scallops in Bohai Bay.  Economic losses incurred by the fishing industry were estimated at between 150 million and 170 million yuan ($23.5 million-$26.6 million), according to the reports.  “We have not received any notification of any claims from this incident,” Georg Storaker, president of ConocoPhillips China, said at a news conference on Wednesday.  The company has said it had halted original leaks at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, which started in June.  The State Oceanic Administration has said 840 square kilometers of water had been polluted by the leaks.  On Monday, media reports said the company was still dealing with several small oil leaks on the seabed 15 meters north of the oilfield’s Platform C.  Asked if the company was considering establishing a fund for environmental protection activities, as BP did after last year’s massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Storaker said: “First of all, there is no comparison between the two incidents. We have not received any claims today, but we will consider any such claims if they come out.”  ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd has a 51 percent stake.  A third party was conducting an investigation and evaluation of the oil spill’s environmental impact, company officials said.  “After these unfortunate incidents, we have started to evaluate the impact on the marine environment. Work is ongoing right now and our vessels are taking samples,’ said Xu Xianhong, head of health, safety and environmental protection at ConocoPhillips China.  Xu declined to identify the third party and gave no timetable for when the evaluation would be finished.  ConocoPhillips China again said it was on track to meet requirements of China’s marine authorities to finish the cleanup and seal off oil spill sources by the end of the month.  “We are on target to reach that goal. At the moment we have 95 percent of the oil-based mud already cleaned up and have sealed off the sources of original releases from June 4 and June 17,” said ConocoPhillips spokesman Rich Johnson.  CNOOC Ltd said on Wednesday that it had revised its production target to 331 million-341 million barrels of oil equivalent for 2011, down from 355 million-365 million, partly because of the oil spill.  “The company has already started performing inspections of major facilities, equipment and production operations of all our oilfields, and reinforcing our risk management measures, to avoid similar incidents happening in the future,” CNOOC said in a press release.  CNOOC would continue to urge and assist ConocoPhillips China to complete the cleanup work in a timely manner and to minimize the impact on the marine environment, it added.  ConocoPhillips has said the shutdown of two platforms at Penglai 19-3 would result in a temporary reduction of about 17,000 barrels of oil per day.

161,COP,Factbox: U.S. East Coast energy sites brace for Irene,"(Reuters) - Oil terminals, refineries, pipelines and nuclear power plants from the Bahamas to Rhode Island braced for Hurricane Irene on Thursday.  The major Category 3 storm with winds of 115 mph roared through the Bahamas on a path expected to take it up the U.S. East Coast by the weekend.  Unlike a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, an East Coast storm does not threaten significant U.S. crude oil and natural gas production.  The Department of Energy calls the refining region PADD 1. It is the second smallest of the five U.S. refining regions, with most of its fuel being supplied by pipeline from the Gulf Coast or tanker ship from Europe. But there are six refineries and numerous storage and shipping terminals on or near the coast.  There also are six nuclear plants on or very near the East Coast, and operators were preparing them for a possible visit by Irene in the next few days.  * PBF Energy said it was preparing for storm conditions at its 182,200 barrel-per-day (bpd) Delaware City, Delaware, refinery, and its 160,000 bpd Paulsboro, New Jersey, refinery.  * ConocoPhillips said it was monitoring the storm as a precaution for its 238,000 bpd Bayway refinery at Linden, New Jersey, and its 190,000 bpd refinery at Trainer, Pa.  * Sunoco Inc said its Marcus Hook, Pa, refinery, 194,000 bpd, and its Philadelphia refinery, 355,000 bpd, were “monitoring the storm closely and have begun taking steps.”  * Progress Energy said it was preparing its Brunswick nuclear power plant on the coast at Southport, North Carolina. Two reactors, 900-plus megawatts (mw) each.  * Public Service Enterprise Group said it would shut down Salem and Hope Creek plants in New Jersey near Wilmington, Delaware, before hurricane winds arrive. Salem is a two-reactor, 2,300-mw facility. Hope Creek is a single-reactor, 1,061-mw plant.  * Entergy said its two-unit, 2,069-mw plant at Indian Point, 24 miles north of New York City, and its 688-mw plant at Plymouth, Mass, near Boston, were securing equipment, fueling backup generators and reviewing procedures.  * The U.S. Coast Guard said decisions whether to limit or stop New York Harbor traffic depending on the storm’s path, no restrictions yet.  * Buckeye Partners said its 21.6-million-barrel storage facility in the Bahamas escaped damage as Irene passed, but monitoring conditions before restarting operations.  * Statoil also planned shutdown of its 6.75 million-barrel storage facility at South Riding Point on Grand Bahama Island.  * Sunoco Inc said it was “monitoring the storm closely” and “taking steps under our hurricane preparedness plan” to ready terminals at Newark, NJ, and areas under threat from Irene.  * Kinder Morgan said it was readying its major petroleum terminals at Carteret, N.J., 7.2 million barrels; Perth Amboy, N.J., 3.5 million barrels and Staten Isl, N.Y., 2,959,700.  * Magellan Midstream Partners said its terminals at New Haven, Conn., 4 million barrels, and Wilmington, Del., 2.8 million barrels, continued to operate as they prepared for the storm.  Enterprise Products said its Providence, Rhode Island, propane ship terminal was monitoring the storm and making preparations for a possible visit by Irene.  * El Paso Corp said its Tennessee Gas Pipeline unit notified customers it anticipated limited flexibility to manage imbalances if Irene impacts areas it serves on the East Coast.  * Kinder Morgan said it was “fueling vehicles, generators, pumps and securing equipment” around all facilities, including Plantation products pipeline.  * Colonial Pipeline, a major petroleum products pipeline supplying the East from the Gulf Coast refining complex, said it was monitoring the storm.  * NiSource said it was preparing its Columbia gas transmission system for Irene and will take appropriate actions as a result of the storm threat.  * GDF Suez said its Everett, Massachusetts, liquefied natural gas import terminal has backup power and no ship arrivals scheduled during period Irene is a threat.  * Kinder Morgan said its Pier IX coal exporting terminal at Newport News, Va, will close for 24 hours on Saturday. Annual capacity 14 million short tons.  * Norfolk Southern said its Lamberts Point coal terminal at Norfolk, Va., was loading a final ship before shutting down on Friday to await passage of the storm.  * NS said it was preparing its rail service along the East Coast to weather the storm and will hold shipments away from seaports pending Irene’s passage.

164,COP,China to sue ConocoPhillips over oil spill -Xinhua," BEIJING, Aug 25 (Reuters) - China’s maritime authority is preparing to sue U.S. firm ConocoPhillips over an oil spill in China’s northern Bohai Bay, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.	   Citing a spokesperson from the State Oceanic Administration, Xinhua said late on Wednesday that China was ready to file a lawsuit seeking compensation for the spill once it appoints a team of lawyers, perhaps before the end of August.	   The maritime authority, which would file the lawsuit on behalf of the government, was quoted as saying that the oil spill at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, had polluted some 840 square kilometres of water and damaged the country’s marine environment. 	   It intends to select a team of eight law firms to file the suit, from a group of 49 companies that have expressed interest in representing China in the case.	   Earlier this week, a unit of ConocoPhillips said it had started evaluating the environmental impact of its oil spill, but said it had not received any claims for the incident.	   The company has said it halted original leaks which started in June. ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s top offshore oil and gas producer, CNOOC Ltd , has a 51 percent stake.	   Fishermen in the country’s northern Hebei province were preparing to sue the U.S. firms for allegedly wiping out large numbers of scallops in the ocean, Chinese media reported earlier.	   The reports estimated that the spill had inflicted between 150 million yuan ($23.5 million) and 170 million yuan of losses on the fishing sector.

165,COP,"Irene losses already up to $1.1 billion, more to come","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused as much as $1.1 billion in insured losses in the Caribbean, catastrophe modeling company AIR Worldwide said on Friday, with more expected to come as the storm heads for the U.S. Northeast.  Yet in a sign of the confusion sure to plague insurers in days to come, rival catastrophe modelers Eqecat said late on Friday losses in the region were likely no more than $600 million.  While no one knows yet precisely where Irene will strike or how strong it will be at the time, it seemed certain as of Friday that Philadelphia, the New Jersey shore, New York City, Long Island and broad swaths of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts were all going to be hit.  The insured losses for the Caribbean will range from $500 million to $1.1 billion, mostly from the Bahamas, said AIR, one of the three companies the insurance industry relies on to model the impact of both natural and man-made disasters.  AIR had warned Irene was likely to do more damage to the islands than 1999’s Floyd, the last hurricane to strike them in such a direct way.  But Eqecat said its own models suggested losses of $300 million to $600 million. That the two would differ in their estimate is not unusual. However, it also serves as a reminder of how difficult it can be to assess storm damage in the days and even weeks after the fact.  The next question is what Irene will do to the U.S. East Coast, with some estimates putting more than $4 trillion of insured coastal property in its path. The losses, by some accounts, could be enormous.  An analysis by New York Times statistics blog FiveThirtyEight found a Category 2 hurricane making landfall within even 100 miles of New York City would cause at least $2.15 billion in economic losses in the city alone.  If landfall was within 50 miles, the losses would approach $10 billion in the city.  If Irene is sufficiently large, the insured losses it causes could lead to an industrywide firming of, or rise in, prices after years of declines caused by heavy competition and excess capacity.  As of late Friday afternoon, all signs were that Irene was weakening, contrary to earlier expectations. AIR said it now looked as if Irene would be a Category 2 storm when it hit the Carolinas and a borderline Category 1 on landfall Sunday afternoon in Long Island.  However, the slower wind speeds are deceiving, one of the company’s top scientists said, since the storm is also moving north faster than had been expected.  “Even though the forecast may come down 5-10 miles (an hour) from what they had yesterday, if the storm is moving faster than it was yesterday that can actually compensate, especially on the right side of the storm,” said Peter Dailey, AIR’s director of atmospheric science.  The storm could also prove problematic for investors in catastrophe bonds, which insurance companies use to transfer risk to capital markets.  The percentage of so-called cat bonds with exposure to U.S. hurricane risk stands at 67 percent — with $506 million exposure to hurricanes just in North Carolina, according to broker Guy Carpenter’s GC Securities.  Bonds such as Shore Re Ltd, which covers hurricane damage in Massachusetts, and Johnston Re Ltd, with such exposure to North Carolina, could be particularly at risk. Standard & Poor’s said on Friday it would hold off on any rating action until Irene passes, but it could put some bonds on a “negative watch” after the storm if the damages appear severe enough.

167,COP,"Irene to deal blackouts, oil disruptions to U.S. East","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy companies on Friday activated emergency plans as the densely populated U.S. East Coast braced for blackouts from Hurricane Irene that could affect millions.  Oil refineries in the U.S. Northeast scaled back operations and pipeline operators warned of potential delays for fuel distribution. The Coast Guard said it had no plans yet to shut the New York Harbor, but energy traders said delays could affect the delivery hub for millions of barrels a day in crude and oil products, by pipeline, barge and ship.  Storm-caused blackouts could be a huge menace, energy experts, meteorologists and U.S. officials warned.  “The range of possibilities from this storm is enormous,” said energy analyst Tim Evans at Citi Futures in New York.  “We could see anything from blackouts putting the entire Northeast in the dark, to only very localized problems.”  At 2 p.m. (1800 GMT), Irene’s center was 300 miles south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, churning northward. It weakened early Friday to a Category 2 hurricane from a 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, but was expected to retain hurricane force and scour the length of the mid-Atlantic coast on Sunday.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency said power outages could last days, with flash flooding in coastal areas and strong winds expected to reach far inland.  Irene may leave 5 million to 7 million people without electricity, a Deutsche Bank meteorologist wrote in a report, adding high tides due to a new moon on August 28 could exacerbate storm surges.  Although the East Coast does not have major offshore oil and gas production like the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast, its huge power and pipeline networks, nuclear plants and refineries mean the energy stakes are high as Irene bears in on North Carolina.  The storm threatens to tear up to the Northeast starting Saturday.  Hurricane Katrina in 2005 knocked out Gulf Coast refining for weeks, months for some plants, while the last major hurricane to batter the East Coast, Gloria in 1985, left millions without power but caused little lasting damage to energy infrastructure.  As a category 2 storm, Irene already packs winds between 96 and 110 miles per hour and storm surges of 6 to 8 feet.  East Coast utilities were lining up thousands of workers from as far away as Texas to descend on storm-ravaged areas through the power industry’s mutual aid program. Crews would clear fallen trees and debris and restore power as quickly as possible after Irene passes.  “If the storm tracks anywhere close to the worst-case scenario, it will be a very major mobilization,” said Jim Owen of trade group Edison Electric Institute.  East Coast oil refineries, which process up to 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, planned to brave Irene without total shutdowns. But some were scaling back, the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association (NPRA) said.  Sunoco’s Marcus Hook refinery in coastal Pennsylvania has cut rates by 25 percent to 140,000 bpd, a source familiar said.  Irene’s severity had nuclear power plant operators near the coast securing equipment and battening down the hatches.  Dominion Resources Inc, which shut its Virginia-based North Anna nuclear plant on Tuesday following an earthquake, said the plant would remain closed through the storm.  Hurricane winds may cause Dominion to idle other reactors along the seaboard over the weekend, the company said, even though they are built to withstand winds of up to 360 miles per hour.  Any closure of the New York Harbor could create backlogs of ships waiting to deliver crude or fuels, but would not be likely to cause a prolonged supply crunch.  Oil terminals in the East Coast region had around nine days of crude supply on hand last week.  The consumption region, known as PADD 1 in the refining industry, depends largely on imports of fuel, and its depots currently hold enough gasoline to cover 23 days of regional demand, 46 days for heating oil, according to the NPRA.  The largest U.S. refined products pipeline, 2.37 million bpd Colonial line, continued to operate normally on Friday but said it expected deliveries to be partially affected by Irene.  Colonial ships fuels including gasoline and diesel to terminals in Irene’s projected path, including Virginia, Maryland, and New York Harbor, where the line ends.  “This is not Katrina,” said Jim Beck of the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  “PADD 1 has plenty (of crude) to ride out any kind of supply disruptions. We are well-covered with (oil) products for this time of year.”  Several oil terminals were due to close temporarily. Pipeline and terminal operator Magellan Midstream partners was shutting oil terminals in North Carolina and Virginia on Friday. Enterprise and Kinder Morgan planned to close some coastal terminals.  Prices of front-month gasoline futures in New York Harbor retreated 1.1 percent on Friday. They had gained more than 3 percent Thursday on concerns over supply disruptions.  In the Bahamas, which was pounded by Irene on Thursday, Buckeye Partners said its massive 21.6 million barrel Borco oil shipping terminal was restarting on Friday.

168,COP,UPDATE 2-Some US East Coast refiners cut rates-NPRA head," * NPRA head says cutbacks help with shutdowns if needed   * Refiners have yet to confirm rate cuts  (Adds rate cut at Sunoco refinery, other details)   HOUSTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Some U.S. East Coast refineries were cutting production rates on Friday in preparation for having to shut units or entire plants as Hurricane Irene headed for the region, the president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association President Charles Drevna told Reuters.   Those include Sunoco Inc’s (SUN.N) 178,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, a source familiar with refinery operations said on Friday. The source said ratess were cut by about 25 percent. [ID:nN1E77P1BK]   Drevna had no details and did not identify which plants were cutting rates, but he said pullbacks are part of the shutdown process if shutdowns are deemed necessary.   Irene, a Category 2 storm with winds of up to 105 miles per hour (165 kph) was expected to make landfall on the North Carolina coast on Saturday, then extend to New York on Sunday, and then to New England.   Major East Coast refiners are in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.   “Refiners are taking precautions right now” and would likely decide later Friday whether to move ahead with shutting units or entire plants, Drevna said.   “If you’re going to shut it down, you’ve got to start making preparations and those need to be done in an orderly fashion,” he said.   Drevna added that the PADD I region is well supplied with refined products, with 23 days of gasoline and 46 days of diesel and heating oil in stocks.   He said power outages could be the post-Irene focus, which could leave refiners unable to operate even if unscathed by the storm. U.S. Gulf Coast refiners faced that issue after Hurricane Ike pummeled the Texas coast in 2008.   Individual refiners that could be in Irene’s wide swath said on Friday that operations were routine while they were monitoring or undergoing storm preparations. None confirmed whether those preparations included cutting rates.   “We have not announced any changes,” PBF Energy President Michael Gayda said. PBF runs a 182,200 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Delaware City, Delaware, and a 160,000 bpd plant in Paulsboro, New Jersey.   Hess, which runs a 70,000 bpd plant in Port Reading, New Jersey, also said it had no updates to its plan to continue operating through the storm while preparing for high winds and storm water ahead of time.   Other plants that could be affected include ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) 238,000 bpd Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, its 185,000 bpd plant in Trainer, Pennsylvania, and Sunoco’s (SUN.N) 335,000 bpd plant in Philadelphia.

The U.S. Coast Guard said it had no immediate plan to shut the New York Harbor, a delivery hub for millions of barrels a day in oil products. The harbor handles shipments from ocean-going ships, barges and pipelines.   But the 2.37 million barrel per day Colonial Pipeline system, which delivers oil products to New York Harbor as well as other East Coast locations like Virginia and Maryland, said it expects operations to be partially affected as some coastal oil terminals shut down to gird against Irene.   Pipeline and terminal operator Magellan Midstream partners (MMP.N) was shutting petroleum terminals in North Carolina and Virginia on Friday.   Steve Baker, a spokesman for Colonial Pipeline, which ends in New York Harbor, said the company was preparing its facilities. “We don’t expect impact until Saturday.” he said.   As Irene bore down on North Carolina on Friday, tens of thousands of people evacuated and East Coast cities including New York braced for a possible weekend battering from the Category 2 storm, with winds between 96 and 110 miles per hour (154-177 kph) and storm surges of 6 to 8 feet (1.8-2.4 meters).   U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Friday warned East Coast inhabitants to expect extensive power outages.   A Deutsche Bank report compiled by an in-house meteorologist said Irene posed a risk of leaving 5 to 7 million people without power along the Eastern Seaboard. It warned storm surges could be exacerbated by unusually high tides due to a new moon on Aug. 28, raising the risk of flooding. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     FACTBOX-East Coast energy infrastructure: [ID:nN1E77O0I1]   Reuters Hurricane Tracker     r.reuters.com/san78n   National Hurricane Center         www.nhc.noaa.gov ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   East Coast oil refineries said they were preparing for Irene, but were operating normally as of Friday.   The region, also known as PADD I, holds refining capacity of around 1.62 million bpd.   ConocoPhillips (COP.N) was continuing to run its East Coast refineries as it prepared for bad weather, said spokeswoman Janet Grothe. The oil major operates the 238,000 bpd Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and a 185,000 bpd plant in Trainer, Pennsylvania.   Another refiner, Hess (HES.N) said it was preparing its 70,000 bpd New Jersey plant and associated oil terminals for high winds and storm water, but planned to operate them through the storm.   PBF, with a 160,000 bpd refinery in Philadelphia and a 182,000 bpd plant in Paulsboro, New Jersey, said it has no immediate plans to reduce or alter its crude processing due to Irene. Another major refiner, Sunoco (SUN.N) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   Prices of front-month gasoline futures RBU1 for delivery in New York Harbor retreated by 0.9 percent in Friday trading, after gaining more than 3 percent on Thursday on fears that Irene would disrupt supply.   In the Bahamas, which was pounded by Irene on Thursday, Buckeye Partners (BPL.N) said its 21.6 million barrel Borco oil terminal, which is a major transatlantic shipping point, suffered no visible damage but remained closed following the storm.

172,COP,Q+A-Regulating Australia's coal seam gas sector," PERTH, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Opposition to Australia’s coal seam gas industry, which is due to sink around $70 billion into projects in the eastern state of Queensland over the next few years, appears to be growing with calls for new legislation to regulate the industry.	   A recent poll released by Australia’s Greens party, which is strongly opposed to the industry, showed that 70 percent of respondents want coal seam gas mining banned in urban areas, while 68 percent want a moratorium on coal seam gas in Australia until the effects on the environment are more fully known. 	   Here are some questions and answers about the industry:	   WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS AROUND COAL SEAM GAS AND “FRACCING”? 	   Coal seam gas production involves pumping large amounts of water out of the ground to release gas trapped in coal seams. Opponents say the process could cause the water table in key farming areas to drop. 	   A gas drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which involves blasting large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into shale rock or coal seams to free trapped gas, has also been the subject of criticism. The process, also known as “fraccing”, is used primarily for shale gas production, as well as some coal seam gas production. 	   Opponents say fraccing could pollute groundwater, that the expansion onto prime agricultural land will hit farmers, and the extensive dredging required to build the projects could harm sites including Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.	   Industry groups deny that fraccing affects water quality and say the industry can co-exist with farmers. 	 	   Under Australian law, landowners have surface land rights, but the government owns mineral rights.  	   Coal seam gas companies have said they prefer to make voluntary agreements with landowners rather than force their way onto farmland to gain access to resources and companies typically negotiate land access agreements with landowners. 	   The terms of these agreements are typically confidential, but Queensland AgForce, a group which represents agricultural interests, said anecdotal evidence suggests compensation varies widely, ranging from A$500 ($522.77) to A$5,000 a year per well.	   WHAT ARE THE RESTRICTIONS ON GAS DRILLING AND PRODUCTION? 	   Both Queensland and New South Wales have banned the chemical combination known as BTEX, which has been used for fraccing in the United States. These states have also ruled out using evaporation ponds to dispose of the extremely saline water produced by coal seam gas production.	   Other restrictions vary from state to state. 	   In Queensland, State Premier Anna Bligh recently banned mining and coal seam gas exploration within 2 km of urban areas with populations over 1,000. Farmers have pushed to get the ban extended to farmland, but experts say Bligh is unlikely to do so, given the huge amount of investment and jobs involved.	   New South Wales, where the coal seam gas industry is still relatively new, has extended an existing moratorium on fraccing through the end of this year. 	 	   ARE THERE PROJECT-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS? 	   Yes. Individual projects must get state and federal environmental approvals, which are often contingent on meeting environmental conditions. 	   Coal seam gas projects approved so far have been subject to meeting conditions that focus on protecting underground aquifers and disposing of the salty water that the projects produce.  	   Analysts have said the conditions attached to coal seam gas projects, although numerous, were not extremely onerous or likely to present significant obstacles to development. 	   However, some experts have said that the unknown costs associated with disposing of brackish water and salt could be unexpectedly high. 	   WILL THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSE ANY NEW LAWS ON GAS DRILLING? 	   The Australian Greens party is currently leading the charge to impose more stringent regulations and this week introduced legislation that would allow farmers to refuse to have coal seam gas drilling on their land. 	   Opposition leader Tony Abbott, who heads a conservative coalition of pro-business and pro-farming parties, made statements earlier this month indicating that farmers should have a right to deny coal seam gas companies access to their land, but later tempered those comments, saying he will not back the Greens’ legislation. 	   The minority Labor government strongly opposes changes to land access.	 	   Analysts say the recent tightening of regulations in Queensland is unlikely to affect projects significantly, but have flagged the growing opposition to the coal seam gas sector as a factor that could impact the industry down the road. 	   “While the immediate impact of the new rules on the sector will be modest, and will not set back progress on the three major CSG projects already underway in Queensland, it does highlight the broader risks the coal seam gas sector, in particular, could face as an increasing number of projects move forward and if land and water management issues lead to a stronger backlash from local populations,” Eurasia Group wrote in a note.  	   There are currently three coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects including Santos’ Gladstone LNG, BG Group’s Queensland Curtis Island LNG, and Origin  and ConocoPhillips’ Australia Pacific LNG, all expected to come online around 2015.  	   Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and PetroChina also plan a project, but have not yet moved forward with a final approval.  	   In a recent note on coal seam gas producer Santos, Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood indicated that further regulatory changes cannot be ruled out. 	   “It appears that state politicians (particularly in New South Wales) are increasingly siding with the farmers rather than the miners. While the Federal government remains resolute, Santos may yet find that the fiscal, environmental or regulatory goal posts could be retrospectively moved,” Wood wrote.

173,COP,REFILE-China says ConocoPhillips to pay for Bohai oil spill," (Refiles to fix typo in 8th para)	   * China says Bohai oil spill its most serious marine ecological incident   * Has polluted 5,500 sq km of water   * More leaking points found near platform C   * To take strict measures if ConocoPhillips can’t finish tasks by end-Aug    BEIJING, Aug 26 (Reuters) - An oil spill by a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips has polluted 5,500 square kilometres of water in China’s northern Bohai Bay, China’s marine authorities and state media said on Friday, adding the company will have to pay for the spill.	   The oil leak at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, which started in June, is “the most serious marine ecological incident in China,” the official Xinhua news agency cited Liu Cigui, director of the State Oceanic Administration (SOA), as saying.	   “Seeking compensation for damage of the oil spill is a long-term, huge and complicated task,” Liu told Xinhua. “Any company that damages China’s marine environment will pay a price.”	   SOA said earlier this week that it was preparing to sue ConocoPhillips over the oil spill and was ready to file a lawsuit seeking compensation once it appoints a team of lawyers, hopefully before the end of this month. 	   As of Tuesday, 5,500 sq km of water had been polluted, of which 870 sq km were seriously polluted, the SOA said on its website (www.soa.gov.cn).   	   Six more leaking points have been found near platform C of Penglai 19-3, bringing the total number of leaking points near the platform to 16, said the North Sea branch of SOA. ConocoPhillips earlier had said the two original leaks had been sealed.	   The administration has repeatedly urged ConocoPhillips China to seal off spill sources and clean up oil-based mud by the end of this month, and the company has said it was on track to do so.	   If ConocoPhillips cannot fulfil these tasks in time, the administration will “take strict measures”, the SOA said, without providing details.	   ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd has a 51 percent stake. 	   Oil-polluted particles found in coastlines and beaches in nearby Liaoning and Hebei provinces were partly or all from Penglai 19-3 oilfield, the SOA said.	   Fishermen in Hebei province were preparing to sue the U.S. firms for allegedly wiping out large numbers of scallops in the ocean, Chinese media reported earlier.  	   The reports estimated that the spill had inflicted between 150 million yuan ($23.5 million) and 170 million yuan of losses on the fishing sector.  	   ConocoPhillips China said this week it had started evaluating the environmental impact of its oil spill, but said it had not received any claims for the incident. 	   Penglai 19-3 oilfield has seven production platforms, with total production of 8.4 million tonnes a year (168,000 bpd), about 20 percent of total crude oil production in Bohai Bay, the SOA said.

174,COP,"Irene losses already up to $1.1 billion, more to come","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene caused as much as $1.1 billion in insured losses in the Caribbean, catastrophe modeling company AIR Worldwide said on Friday, with more expected to come as the storm heads for the U.S. Northeast.  Yet in a sign of the confusion sure to plague insurers in days to come, rival catastrophe modelers Eqecat said late on Friday losses in the region were likely no more than $600 million.  While no one knows yet precisely where Irene will strike or how strong it will be at the time, it seemed certain as of Friday that Philadelphia, the New Jersey shore, New York City, Long Island and broad swaths of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts were all going to be hit.  The insured losses for the Caribbean will range from $500 million to $1.1 billion, mostly from the Bahamas, said AIR, one of the three companies the insurance industry relies on to model the impact of both natural and man-made disasters.  AIR had warned Irene was likely to do more damage to the islands than 1999’s Floyd, the last hurricane to strike them in such a direct way.  But Eqecat said its own models suggested losses of $300 million to $600 million. That the two would differ in their estimate is not unusual. However, it also serves as a reminder of how difficult it can be to assess storm damage in the days and even weeks after the fact.  The next question is what Irene will do to the U.S. East Coast, with some estimates putting more than $4 trillion of insured coastal property in its path. The losses, by some accounts, could be enormous.  An analysis by New York Times statistics blog FiveThirtyEight found a Category 2 hurricane making landfall within even 100 miles of New York City would cause at least $2.15 billion in economic losses in the city alone.  If landfall was within 50 miles, the losses would approach $10 billion in the city.  If Irene is sufficiently large, the insured losses it causes could lead to an industrywide firming of, or rise in, prices after years of declines caused by heavy competition and excess capacity.  As of late Friday afternoon, all signs were that Irene was weakening, contrary to earlier expectations. AIR said it now looked as if Irene would be a Category 2 storm when it hit the Carolinas and a borderline Category 1 on landfall Sunday afternoon in Long Island.  However, the slower wind speeds are deceiving, one of the company’s top scientists said, since the storm is also moving north faster than had been expected.  “Even though the forecast may come down 5-10 miles (an hour) from what they had yesterday, if the storm is moving faster than it was yesterday that can actually compensate, especially on the right side of the storm,” said Peter Dailey, AIR’s director of atmospheric science.  The storm could also prove problematic for investors in catastrophe bonds, which insurance companies use to transfer risk to capital markets.  The percentage of so-called cat bonds with exposure to U.S. hurricane risk stands at 67 percent — with $506 million exposure to hurricanes just in North Carolina, according to broker Guy Carpenter’s GC Securities.  Bonds such as Shore Re Ltd, which covers hurricane damage in Massachusetts, and Johnston Re Ltd, with such exposure to North Carolina, could be particularly at risk. Standard & Poor’s said on Friday it would hold off on any rating action until Irene passes, but it could put some bonds on a “negative watch” after the storm if the damages appear severe enough.

178,COP,"U.S. refiners, reactors eye restart as Irene passes","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil refineries and nuclear power plants along the U.S. East Coast eyed restarts on Sunday as Hurricane Irene left many with only minimal damage, while 3.6 million households and businesses remained without power.  The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm with 60-miles-per-hour winds as it made landfall in New York, sparing the largest U.S. city the widespread power outages forecast by many.  Still, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) warned it could take several days to restore power to areas experiencing blackouts on the East Coast.  New Jersey utility Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G) said 330,000 customers could be without power for five to seven days. FEMA said the duration of outages on the East Coast would depend on whether systems were damaged by the storm or taken offline protectively.  New York City utility Consolidated Edison said on Sunday it had made no final decision on whether to cut power to lower Manhattan due to storm surges, but flooding in the area appeared less severe than feared.  Several East Coast oil refineries throttled back operations and ConocoPhillips shut its Bayway plant in New Jersey.  Conoco said Bayway remained shut on Sunday morning though its Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery continued to operate. No damage was reported at any plant on the East Coast as of 11:51 a.m.  PBF Energy said its New Jersey and Delaware refineries sustained no damage from the storm and were operating normally as of Sunday morning.  Two nuclear power plants were forced to shut during the storm, but Progress Energy said the units at its Brunswick plant in North Carolina should be back to full power within 36 hours.  A unit at Constellation Energy’s Calvert Cliff plant in Maryland remained offline after an aluminum siding flew off a building and hit a transformer, forcing a precautionary shutdown on Saturday night. The firm said the reactor was safe and a second unit was running at full power.  As a precaution against winds, Exelon Corp took its Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey offline on Saturday. The plant normally supplies electricity to as many as 600,000 homes.  The oil hub of New York Harbor is expected to resume normal operations on Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard said, after imposing severe traffic restrictions as the storm bared down. Traffic restrictions will remain in place on Sunday.  Irene tracked north toward New England after landing only a glancing blow on New York City.  Just over 110,000 homes and businesses in the city’s five boroughs and neighboring Westchester County were without power at 11:51 a.m. EDT, Con Edison said, less than 4 percent of the total the company powers in the region.  Con Edison estimated most would have power restored by 10:00 a.m. EDT on Monday.  The largest blackouts took place in Virginia, where almost 40 percent of households and businesses were without power, Dominion Resources said.  Dominion said its damage assessment would be completed by noon on Monday.  “We ask for your patience while we complete this important restoration step because it allows us to identify the extent of damage, prioritize restoration so we can restore power to the greatest number of customers in the shortest amount of time, and accurately predict when we will complete restoration,” the company said on its website.

The category 1 storm made landfall in New Jersey before dawn with 75 mile-per-hour/120 kph winds, dumping heavy rain and provoking storm surges. The hurricane was 40 miles southwest of New York City at 8:00 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), the National Hurricane Center said.   Mid-Atlantic coast states reported more power losses even as blackouts in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut jumped. In New York City and nearby Westchester County, some 80,000 customers lost electricity.   Consolidated Edison (ED.N), which powers nearly 3 million homes and businesses — or more than 8 million residents — in the city warned that flooding could prompt much wider power cuts in downtown Manhattan.   Two East Coast nuclear power plants shut to ensure safety. Aluminum siding flew off a building in Maryland and slammed into a transformer at CENG’s Calvert Cliff reactor early Sunday, forcing it to shut and declare an “unusual event,” the lowest level of nuclear emergency. CENG said the reactor was safe and secure.   As a precaution against winds, Exelon Corp (EXC.N) took its Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey offline on Saturday. The plant normally supplies electricity to as many as 600,000 homes. [ID:nWEN7647]   Several East Coast oil refineries throttled back operations and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) shut its Bayway plant in New Jersey.   With gale-force winds and rough seas threatening shipping, the oil hubs of New York Harbor and the Port of Philadelphia declared alert level ""Zulu,"" an emergency designation that severely restricts vessel traffic, the U.S. Coast Guard said.

That could raise the odds of blackouts in New York City.   Con-Ed said it was evaluating whether to turn off power later on Sunday in low-lying areas of Manhattan including the Financial District. Hundreds of thousands of residents in the area have already evacuated to higher ground.   “We’re now at a critical moment of the storm with debris starting to fly due to the high winds,” said Con-Ed spokeswoman Joy Faber. “Our crews in the field are reporting more hazardous conditions.”   Shutting off power in downtown Manhattan before flooding from a storm surge could lessen the time required to restart services.   Irene earlier cut power to large swaths of Virginia and North Carolina as it came ashore, prompting Brunswick nuclear power plant in Southport, North Carolina to reduce power generation.

184,COP,Irene cuts power to 1.8 million,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene knocked out power to 1.8 million homes and businesses, disrupted oil refineries and forced nuclear plants to reduce power as it barreled toward New York City.  As the Southeast made small progress toward restoring power as Irene spun northward, blackouts in Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey jumped.  Only 19,000 customers faced outages in New York City, but Consolidated Edison warned that downtown Manhattan, including Wall Street, could face further blackouts as low lying areas flooded.  Local forecasters said the path of Irene was shifting westward, raising the prospect of 10-foot storm surges.  Several East Coast refineries were forced to cut back on runs, while ConocoPhillips shut its Bayway plant in New Jersey. Other refiners in Pennsylvania and New Jersey throttled back on throughput or prepared for the full impact of the storm.  The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Port of Philadelphia, an oil hub, and restricted some vessel traffic at the larger hub of New York Harbor, which stayed open.  Power generator Exelon idled the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in Ocean County, New Jersey, as a precaution. The plant supplies up to 600,000 homes.  The shutdown is expected to be short and other power supply may be available in the region, a company spokesman said.  “It’s really as a precaution, a conservative action because we do expect hurricane force winds,” said Exelon spokesman Marshall Murphy on Saturday.  Irene earlier cut power to large swaths of Virginia and North Carolina as it came ashore, prompting Brunswick nuclear power plant in Southport, North Carolina to reduce power generation.

By Selam Gebrekidan and David Sheppard   NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - New York City braced for widespread blackouts as Hurricane Irene churned up the East Coast on Saturday, leaving more than 1 million homes and businesses without power in U.S. coastal states further south.   Power generator Exelon idled the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant as a precaution as winds gained force. The plant in Ocean County, New Jersey supplies up to 600,000 homes.   The shutdown is expected to be short and other power supply may be available in the region, a company spokesman said.   “It’s really as a precaution, a conservative action because we do expect hurricane force winds,” said Exelon spokesman Marshall Murphy.   East Coast oil refineries reduced operations or shut, while pipelines and fuel terminals also scaled back.   ConocoPhillips (COP.N) shutdown the Bayway oil refinery in New Jersey. The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Port of Philadelphia, an oil hub, and restricted some vessel traffic at the larger hub of New York Harbor, which stayed open.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Factbox: Irene-related power outages         [ID:nN1E77Q05B]   Factbox: Energy cos, refiners brace for Irene[ID:nN1E77Q047]   Factbox: US nuclear plants in Irene's path   [ID:nN1E77P179]   Hurricane Irene hits East Coast              [ID:nSTORM]   Reuters Hurricane Tracker:      r.reuters.com/san78n   National Hurricane Center:          www.nhc.noaa.gov   Weather Underground:   www.wunderground.com/tropical   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Utility firms warned of more power outages ahead, with Consolidated Edison (ED.N) considering pre-emptive blackouts on Sunday in flood-prone downtown Manhattan, including on Wall Street. U.S. stock exchanges were expecting to operate normally on Monday. [ID:nN1E77Q0CP]   Irene cut power to large swaths of Virginia and North Carolina and forced the Brunswick nuclear power plant in Southport, North Carolina to reduce power generation.   Brunswick sustained no damage, but electricity from its two nuclear reactors was cut by 25 to 35 percent, to ensure they can keep running through the storm, said operator Progress Energy PGN.N.   Progress said 228,000 customers were without power in North Carolina as of 7:33 p.m. EDT (2333 GMT). Dominion Resources (D.N) said around 822,000 of its customers lost power in North Carolina and Virginia. Outages also hit areas in Maryland and Delaware.   In New York City, which was bracing for Irene’s impact late on Saturday into Sunday, intermittent rains began in the afternoon but the power grid suffered few disruptions so far.   That could change as storm surges cause flooding.   “Make sure you know where your flashlights are,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned New Yorkers at a storm briefing on Saturday.   Utility Consolidated Edison (ED.N) said it wouldn’t shut down the city’s power pre-emptively, but could cut power early on Sunday in low-lying parts of Manhattan, including to 6,000 homes or businesses south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The area includes New York’s Financial District.   Irene howled ashore in North Carolina on Saturday, weakening to a Category 1 hurricane, and was expected to hit the mid-Atlantic states on Saturday night and New England on Sunday. [ID:nN1E77Q00G]   At least one oil refinery shut and others scaled back in the Northeast, home to 1.2 million barrel per day of capacity.   ConocoPhillips said late Saturday it had shut the 238,000 barrel per day Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey to gird against Irene. Sources said the oil major also cut rates at its 185,000 Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery.    On Friday, rates were cut by 25 percent at Sunoco’s (SUN.N) Marcus Hook plant in Pennsylvania, sources said. The firm declined comment on operations Saturday.   The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Port of Philadelphia, a major oil hub which typically handles 1 million barrels a day. At 4:00 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) it said gale force winds were expected at the port within 12 hours. [ID:nN1E77Q0CE]   The New York Harbor, a delivery hub for crude oil and fuels by pipeline, barge and ship, remained open on Saturday with traffic restrictions, including a ban on anchoring of vessels.   The largest U.S. refined oil product pipeline, the 2.37 million barrel a day Colonial that runs from the Gulf Coast to New York, continued operating after warning earlier of potential disruptions to customers along its path. Several coastal oil terminals were forced to shut.   Shipping disruptions may delay oil deliveries to the East Coast, or PADD 1, but the region’s plentiful oil inventories lessen the risk of major supply shortages.   Trade group National Petrochemical and Refiners Association said on Friday the region’s oil terminals held 23 days of gasoline supply and 46 days supply of diesel and heating oil. [ID:nN1E77P1BG]   Around nine days of crude supply were held in the region’s terminals, according to Energy Department data from last week.

186,COP,"Energy operations resume after Irene, 5 million lose power","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy firms along the Eastern Seaboard scrambled on Monday to resume operations after Hurricane Irene left millions of customers without power.  Refineries and other energy facilities escaped serious damage, while utilities, whose power lines were battered by the storm over the weekend, faced the most daunting workload, with over 5 million homes and businesses from North Carolina to Maine still cut off on Monday.  Restoring power could take days, and up to weeks in the hardest-hit zones, due to flooding and strewn debris.  “Irene was weaker than some expected, but it will probably take a week to restore power to some areas,” said energy analyst Peter Beutel of Cameron Hanover in Connecticut.  “The storm shouldn’t have a permanent impact on energy infrastructure.”  One of the hardest hit refiner was Sunoco, which shut a crude unit at its Philadelphia refinery after a pump was flooded, sources said. The company was boosting output at another Pennsylvania plant, Marcus Hook.  ConocoPhillips’ 238,000 barrel per day (bpd) Bayway oil refinery in Linden, New Jersey also shut down on Saturday but was due to restart on Monday, a source familiar with the plant said.  Other East Coast refineries that throttled back for Irene were resuming normal operations, and wholesale gasoline prices fell by 1 percent on Monday at the New York Harbor, after the oil hub reopened to vessel traffic following the storm.  One nuclear power reactor at Constellation Energy’s Calvert Cliffs facility in Maryland remained shut after being struck by wind-blown debris on Sunday, but the company said the plant was safe. Other plants that reduced operations were preparing to restore normal rates, while Exelon Corp’s Oyster Creek New Jersey plant, which supplies up to 600,000 homes, remained offline.  POWER GRIDS HARDEST-HIT  As of 3:00 p.m. Monday (1900 GMT), power was restored to one in every six households and business affected by outages from Irene, the Department of Energy said.  That left 5.1 million customers without power in 14 U.S. states, down from the 6.7 million affected in all by the storm, the department said in a report.  New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Virginia — where the outages were greatest in number — all had more than 600,000 customers without power on Monday afternoon.  In Rhode Island around two-thirds of all customers had no power, or more than 280,000, the DOE said.  In New York State, 889,000 customers were still without power late Monday.  Consolidated Edison, which powers New York City and nearby Westchester County, said around 70,000 remained affected in those areas. It expected to restore city customers by late Tuesday and others by Thursday.  Utilities warned that work could be slow-going.  “There are still areas we can’t get to because of flooding and debris,” said Jersey Central spokesman Ron Morano, who estimated that restoring service would take several days. Around a third of the firm’s 1.1 million customers in central and northern New Jersey were affected on Monday.  Oil hubs at the New York Harbor and the Port of Philadelphia were both scheduled to resume normal activities on Monday, after Irene’s approach forced them to restrict vessel traffic..  The 2.37 million bpd Colonial pipeline system, which ships refined oil products from the Gulf Coast to New York, said on Monday it was nearly ready to resume normal operations. The storm cut power to some oil terminals supplied by the pipeline.  Kinder Morgan’s 600,000 bpd Plantation pipeline from North Carolina to Washington D.C. resumed operations after a brief shutdown during the storm.

190,COP,US Cash Products-Harbor gasoline up post-Irene," * Harbor any-August gasoline up in thin, post-Irene trade  * Gulf gasoline retreats after storm  HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Any-August F2 RBOB differentials in the New York Harbor surged 6.00 cents per gallon on Monday with at least one deal done as the region recovered from Hurricane Irene.  The storm hit New Jersey and New York on Sunday, having prompted energy infrastructure such as refineries, oil storage and terminals to shut down or cut back on operations.  The U.S. Coast Guard said the harbor resumed normal operations on Monday, while refineries and oil storage and terminal facilities did the same. [ID:nN1E77S0UO]  ConocoPhillips (COP.N) planned to restart its 238,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey on Monday, a source familiar with refinery operations said. [ID:nN1E77S0WS]  Other regional refineries that cut rates without shutting down said they were ramping back up or had resumed planned levels except for Sunoco Inc’s (SUN.N) 335,000-bpd Philadelphia plant, where a crude unit was down due to flooding, a source familiar with refinery operations said. [ID:nN1E77S0P3]  Prior to the deal on any-August F2 RBOB, brokers and end-users scrambled for information.  “I think people are still trying to figure out what to do,” a veteran harbor trader said. “There are a lot of conflicting stories, some guys coming back, some not ... it’s hard to know what’s right.”  And despite the strong end-August trade, other gasoline markets in the region talked within established ranges, albeit thinly.  Harbor distillate trade also was thin, with jet fuel weaker by a quarter cent per gallon after Irene forced cancellations of more than 12,000 flights in the Northeast.  New York-area airports reopened on Monday as airlines gradually restored more flights throughout the region. [ID:nN1E77R0FZ]  On the Gulf Coast, conventional M2 gasoline differentials pared last week’s gains, falling 1.25 cents per gallon as Irene’s effects on the U.S. Northeast energy infrastructure were not as serious as expected.  Gulf gasoline differentials gained 2.25 cents per gallon last week in the run-up to the storm’s landfall, as traders anticipated increased needs to ship refined products to the region from the Gulf.  “Irene has come and gone, and didn’t leave such huge footprints after all,” a Gulf trader said.  In the Midwest, Group Three gasoline fell a little more than 2.00 cents a gallon as the expiry of the September RBOB gasoline futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange drew close.

Up until that trade was done, activity in the New York market had been described by more than one participant as “indecisive,” as people tried to assess their needs as August nears its end.

195,COP,"Oil jumps 2 pct as market eyes storms, economy","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude rose for a sixth straight session to a four-week high on Tuesday, boosted by concerns about gasoline supplies, optimism about fresh economic stimulus and the threat of fresh storms.  Gasoline futures led the complex higher, rallying 3 percent, boosted in part by concerns about the slow return of some refinery operations following Hurricane Irene.  “The market is getting a little perturbed that refiners are not coming back quickly,” said Stephen Schork, editor of The Schork Report in Villanova, Pennsylvania.  Further support for prices came after Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said he favored strong central bank accommodation for a substantial period of time, as the U.S. economy looks to be moving “sideways.”  Traders have been closely watching for any signs of more stimulus for the economy, which would spur investors into oil.  Crude got an additional boost following the release of notes from the August 9 policy meeting showed the Fed considered a range of actions, including the unprecedented step of tying interest rate policy outlook to a specific unemployment level.  “The Fed minutes revealed they were inclined to do QE3 (quantitative easing) and this could be bullish for oil and commodities going forward,” said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist, at MF Global in Chicago.  Brent crude traded up $2.14 to settle at a four-week high of $114.02 a barrel, breaking over the 50-day moving average. U.S. crude, settled up $1.63 at a three-week high of $88.90 a barrel.  Trading volumes were 9 percent below the 30-day average for Brent and 10 percent below for U.S. crude.  U.S. RBOB gasoline futures rose 3 percent and heating oil 2 percent. Lift for RBOB came ahead of Wednesday’s September contract expiration, the last contract of the year that covers summer-grade gasoline, Schork said.  Oil rebounded after being pressured by data showing U.S. consumer confidence in August fell to the lowest in more than two years.  The CME Group (CME.O) declared force majeure on Tuesday on the few remaining deliveries of its New York Mercantile Exchange August 2011 heating oil futures contract due to damage at a New York Harbor delivery facility caused by Irene.  Traders awaited the restart of Sunoco Inc’s (SUN.N) Gerard Point section of its 335,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Philadelphia refinery, shut due to a flooded crude charge pump.  ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has begun the restart of its 238,000- bpd Linden, New Jersey refinery according to environmental filings with the state.  Nearly three million customers on the East Coast remained without power due to Hurricane Irene.  The market was also cautious ahead of the strengthening Tropical Storm Katia in the Atlantic, expected to become a hurricane late Wednesday or early on Thursday.  Early models showed it missing the Hovensa refinery in St. Croix and passing north of Puerto Rico on Sunday morning.  Traders also reacted to a tropical wave over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, which was given a 10 percent chance of developing over the next 48 hours and could move into the western Gulf of Mexico, home to a large concentration of oil and natural gas facilities.  Traders also eyed reports of Israeli naval movements in the Red Sea. An Israeli military official said two additional warships had been stationed in the Red Sea but added that this was no more than routine.  He played down reports that they were connected to an Egyptian sweep of the Sinai peninsula for militants that has been reported in the Israeli media, although he declined to say what, if any, operational duties the ships were performing.  Prices reacted little in post-settlement trading to industry group the American Petroleum Institute data showing U.S. crude stocks rose 5.1 million barrels last week, though the report also showed stocks at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell slightly.  Distillate stockpiles rose 276,000 barrels, but gasoline inventories fell 3.1 million barrels.  Ahead of the API report, a Reuters analyst survey yielded a forecast for crude stocks to be up 400,000 barrels, with distillates expected to be up 600,000 barrels and gasoline stocks seen down 1.1 million barrels. <EIA/S>  The Energy Information Administration’s weekly inventory report will follow at 10:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday.

ConocoPhillips (COP.N) began the restart process of its 238,000 barrels=per-day Linden, New Jersey, refinery early this week, which was likely to take some pressure off the market, which saw differentials to the futures soar on Monday due to panic-buying. [ID:nWEN7727]  Traders said the market for gasoline was better offered than bid for any-August material, with offers for F2 RBOB heard at 10.00 cents over the screen and notional buying interest seen closer to 9.00 cents over.  The market had surged in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene as traders sorted through their logistics and tried to determine where they stood for the balance of August and early September timings.  Harbor distillates continued to converge with the NYMEX heating oil futures contract, with any-August heating oil talked a quarter cent stronger at either side of 0.50 cent under and jet fuel pegged at 10.00/11.00 cents over.  On the Gulf Coast, cash conventional gasoline and most distillate differentials slipped on Monday as their latest five-day lifting cycles scheduled to move on the Colonial Pipeline.  The Colonial, which transports refined products from the Gulf to the U.S. Northeast, was fully serving customers in the New York Harbor and Linden, New Jersey, after Hurricane Irene brought flooding and power outages to the region over the weekend.  Gulf Coast conventional M2 gasoline differentials fell a quarter cent per gallon, while differentials for ultra-low sulfur diesel and jet fuel each fell half a penny per gallon.  Space is limited on the Colonial’s main gasoline line to the U.S. Northeast because of allocations this month, but no such restrictions have been imposed on the main distillate line since mid-July.  In the Midwest, Group Three gasoline lost more ground on Tuesday, falling another 2.00 cents as the September RBOB gasoline futures contract rallied a day before its expiry.  Group Three gasoline is trading against the September RBOB contract, which had a 14.00-cent premium over the October contract at midday Tuesday as traders watched another hurricane approach the U.S. Eastern seaboard.

205,COP,Oil firms start U.S. Gulf evacuations due to weather,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Plc on Wednesday became the first major oil producer to say it was evacuating some workers from Gulf of Mexico oil and gas platforms because of a tropical disturbance that could become a named storm this week.  Later on Wednesday, Anadarko Petroleum Corp joined BP saying it has evacuated non-essential workers from three platforms in the Gulf.  Royal Dutch Shell also was preparing to evacuate some workers and expected to decide whether to move forward with that during the day, spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh said.  Shell was monitoring the system over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and the eastern Gulf. The National Hurricane Center said the weather formation had a 30 percent chance of becoming a cyclone in the next two days.  Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips and Apache Corp also said they were monitoring the system.  BP, the biggest oil producer in the Gulf with eight company-operated oil and gas platforms, said it was evacuating from five platforms more than 500 “nonessential” workers, or those not directly involved in production, such as cooks.  The platforms involved are Thunder Horse, the world’s largest with capacity to produce up to 250,000 barrels of oil per day, and Na Kika, Mad Dog, Holstein and Atlantis.  “Essential personnel remain on board to continue safe operations and prepare the platforms for potential shut-in and full evacuation in the event it becomes necessary,” the company said in a statement.  Anadarko said the workers were taken from the Gunnison, Nansen and Boomvang platforms.  “We will continue to monitor the path of the weather and are prepared to evacuate all personnel and shut in production if necessary,” Anadarko said in a statement.  Shell is the second-largest producer in the Gulf, operating six oil and gas platforms.  Mexico’s state oil monopoly Pemex said it was monitoring the weather but not yet taking any emergency or precautionary steps.  The U.S. National Hurricane Center gives the disturbance, which would be called Lee if it becomes a tropical storm, a 30 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, but said it could develop further when it reaches the western Gulf.  U.S.-regulated areas of the Gulf of Mexico roughly account for 30 percent of U.S. oil production and 12 percent of natural gas output, according to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.  About 30 percent of U.S. natural gas processing plant capacity and 40 percent of the nation’s refining capacity also line the Gulf Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Shell was monitoring the system over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and the eastern Gulf. The National Hurricane Center said the weather formation had a 30 percent chance of becoming a cyclone in the next two days.  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N) also said they were monitoring the system.  BP, the biggest oil producer in the Gulf with eight company-operated oil and gas platforms, said it was evacuating from five platforms more than 500 “nonessential” workers, or those not directly involved in production, such as cooks.  The platforms involved are Thunder Horse, the world’s largest with capacity to produce up to 250,000 barrels of oil per day, and Na Kika, Mad Dog, Holstein and Atlantis.  “Essential personnel remain on board to continue safe operations and prepare the platforms for potential shut-in and full evacuation in the event it becomes necessary,” the company said in a statement.  Anadarko said the workers were taken from the Gunnison, Nansen and Boomvang platforms.  “We will continue to monitor the path of the weather and are prepared to evacuate all personnel and shut in production if necessary,” Anadarko said in a statement.  Shell is the second-largest producer in the Gulf, operating six oil and gas platforms.  Mexico’s state oil monopoly Pemex said it was monitoring the weather but not yet taking any emergency or precautionary steps.  The U.S. National Hurricane Center gives the disturbance, which would be called Lee if it becomes a tropical storm, a 30 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, but said it could develop further when it reaches the western Gulf.  U.S.-regulated areas of the Gulf of Mexico roughly account for 30 percent of U.S. oil production and 12 percent of natural gas output, according to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.  About 30 percent of U.S. natural gas processing plant capacity and 40 percent of the nation’s refining capacity also line the Gulf Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Forecasters have said the 2011 hurricane season will spawn six to eight hurricanes, up to six of which half could become major.

207,COP,Chevron won't spin off refining: CEO,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is not interested in spinning off its refineries into a separate company as Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) has done and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) plans to do, CEO John Watson told reporters in Houston on Wednesday.  “You should not look for Chevron to participate in anything like what ConocoPhillips or Marathon has done,” Watson said after giving a speech to business leaders.  On June 30, Marathon’s refining, transportation and retail businesses split off from the parent to became Marathon Petroleum Corp, (MPC.N) a move the company first considered in 2008 until the financial crisis put it on hold.  ConocoPhillips announced in mid-July that it would spin off its refining arm as well, creating the largest separate pure-play refining and exploration and production companies. ConocoPhillips is the smallest of the oil majors that include Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).  Watson said ever-increasing development of liquefied natural gas, high-sulfur heavy crudes and natural gas liquids requires refining expertise and plants that can process them.  “It helps to be able to run those in your own refinery,” he said. “There’s never been a time when I have felt it was more important to be an integrated company.”  Chevron operates seven refineries, most of which are in North America, and holds interests in seven more in the Asia-Pacific region, company spokesman Sean Comey said.

212,COP,ConocoPhillips says China oil leaks sealed before deadline," BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - A ConocoPhillips  subsidiary, an oil spill by which polluted 5,500 square kilometres of water in China’s northern Bohai Bay, said it had already sealed off the leaks ahead of an Aug. 31 deadline.	   ConocoPhillips China said it had submitted a report to China’s marine authority showing it has met requirements imposed at the end of last month to completely seal off oil spill sources and eliminate the risk of further leaks.	   The oil leak at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, which started in June is “the most serious marine ecological incident in China”, according to the State Oceanic Administration (SOA).	   The report submitted to the SOA includes details of the methods used by ConocoPhillips to seal the leaks and includes third-party confirmation, the company said on its website (www.conocophillips.com.cn).	   This report also includes the results of the company’s internal investigation of the causes of the accident. 	   The company estimated that 115 cubic meters (700 barrels) of crude oil and 400 cubic meters (2,500 barrels) of mineral oil-based drilling mud have been leaked, it added.	   Although there is no evidence that the oil slick itself made it to shore or soiled any local beaches, ConocoPhillips China crews continue to monitor the situation, collecting samples for testing, it added.	   The North China Sea branch of SOA has finished its investigation into the ecological damage caused by the oil spill and is compiling an evaluation report, providing evidence for victims of the oil spill and for the government seeking compensation, state television said.	   Fishermen in Hebei province were preparing to sue the U.S. firm for allegedly wiping out large numbers of scallops in the ocean, Chinese media have reported.   	   SOA said last week that ConocoPhillips will have to pay for the spill, adding that it would be ready to file suit against ConocoPhillips once it appoints a team of lawyers. It also said that the company would face “strict measures” if it failed to seal off the leaks on time. 	   ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd has a 51 percent stake.	   Penglai 19-3 oilfield produces a total of 8.4 million tonnes a year (168,000 bpd), about 20 percent of total crude oil production in Bohai Bay.

CDS spreads in Europe saw the biggest surge, widening 8.2% followed by North 	 America at 6.7%. Not surprisingly, European sovereign CDS sold off another 7% on 	 average. ‘Contagion concerns seem to be parlaying into widening spreads for 	 normally resilient sovereigns such as Sweden and Norway,’ said Author and 	 Director Diana Allmendinger. 	   Elsewhere, CDS on oil & gas companies in North America saw substantial widening 	 last week (9% on average). ‘Ongoing market concern over weak economic conditions 	 are likely contributing to the sector’s recent underperformance, with notable 	 declines from ConocoPhillips , Mobil Corporation and The Williams Companies ,’ 	 said Allmendinger.	   Fitch Solutions’ Risk and Performance Monitor is a report that gauges CDS market 	 sentiment and spread movement among major companies and sovereigns throughout 	 the world on a weekly basis.

216,COP,Oil firms weigh sabotage and boobytrap risks in Libya,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Benghazi’s hotel lobbies are filled with bustling reporters and diplomats — but there is no sign of the blackberry-wielding oil executives that big oil cities attract.  Posh restaurants are few and far between and trash is piling up on the streets of the city, Libya’s de-facto oil capital while violence and shortages still plague Tripoli.  So far they have mostly stayed away and have not instructed site workers to return, settling instead for very fleeting visits on private jets to meet and greet Libya’s new leaders.  But a careful study of the hotel lobbies also reveals private security workers hired as scouts for oil companies which are dithering over whether to return to the oil-rich North African state.  They are from private companies hired by oil firms to make a safety assessment in a city where battlewagons mounted with anti-aircraft guns still roam the streets and the sound of machinegun fire is regularly heard in the night.  Beyond Benghazi, one of the main concerns for international firms is damage to the oil terminals during the back-and-forth fighting along the Mediterranean coast over the last six months.  The front line has now moved beyond the major export terminals of Brega, Ras Lanuf and Es-Sider toward Gaddafi’s hometown of Sirte, possibly within the range of a scud missile.  But perhaps even more worrying for international firms with is the risk of further sabotage attacks on facilities deep in the desert.  The Sirte Basin, which contains around 80 percent of Libya’s proven reserves, in particular is seen as vulnerable since the fields are in remote parts of the Sahara desert where some areas are still not firmly under control of rebel forces.  Oil companies have good reason to worry. Production in eastern parts of the country ground to a halt after pro-Gaddafi forces attacked oil installations in the desert.  Benghazi-based oil firm the Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) said 14 people were killed in two separate attacks on its infrastructure in the Sarir and Mesla fields.  “We are facing a different threat of military gangs from Gaddafi. We have to expect anything,” said Mustafa el-Huni, an oil official within the government of the interim National Transitional Council (NTC).  “Nobody can guarantee that a missile won’t hit Brega.”  Even if rebel forces are successful in taking territory around Sirte, the risk of further damage to facilities and risk to staff will remain important considerations for oil majors like ConocoPhillips and Total with high standards of health and safety.  One of the biggest challenges is clearing the landmines laid by Gaddafi forces in the first few months of the war when they were driven back west toward Tripoli from the oil town of Brega in the east.  This conflict is not Libya’s first experience with mines and the desert is still littered with those placed by Gaddafi troops to protect the country against possible invasion from United States’, Chadian and Egyptian forces.  The Sirte Basin also still holds unexploded bombs from World War II, but oil companies were able to operate there with the help of security forces and the former Libyan army.  But the present conflict has brought new risks.  Russ Bedford, head of operations for Swedish company Countermine Operations working with the NOC on mine clearance said fresh minefields have been laid on the beaches around the Ras Lanuf oil export terminal and the Libya’s largest refinery.  “They were put on the beach to prevent sea landings. We have been informed that it has been mined again,” he said.  Boobytraps are another threat.  “The risk is that the facilities are booby-trapped. We know that they have that capability. They found mines with switches on them in one of the oil concessions.”  While AGOCO and oil officials in the Libyan government say they can start initial production without foreign workers, the process of ramping up output is likely to depend on how quickly they return.  The speed of ramp-up will also partly determine the pace at which the cash-strapped National Transitional Council can be weaned off western financial aid.  Before the war, Libya pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day, most of which was exported. At current oil prices near $114, Libyan oil exports are worth around $148 million a day.  The National Oil Corporation’s newly appointed chairman Nouri Berouin told Reuters this week that it would take up to 15 months to reach pre-war output levels, citing mines as a key problem.  “Once our fields are secure, we need to make sure we clear the mines. Building up output will require logistical support and we might need our foreign partners,” he said.  But Africa’s biggest oil reserves will be a strong lure.  The NTC said it has a force of 3,000 protecting the oil fields and will aim to add another 2,000. AGOCO said it has a “small army” in place in its eastern fields. Still, oil firms are not likely to give the green light to send in foreign workers until it is satisfied that this is enough.  Industry sources told Reuters that oil companies have offered the Libyan NOC assistance by providing their own security but there is so far little sign of these being accepted, with many politicians wary of possible political implications of a foreign security presence.  “Many companies are offering security but we have to study the strategic ideas of these companies,” said el-Huni.  “We don’t want foreign soldiers to be here.”  ",9012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-oil/oil-firms-weigh-sabotage-and-boobytrap-risks-in-libya-idUSTRE78033O20110901

224,COP,UPDATE 1-UK within-day gas firms on North Sea outages," * ConocoPhillips says work underway to rectify Theddlethorpe issue   * Deutsche Bank expects to serious LNG export impact from Qatari maintenance   * Sizewell B nuclear reactors ramp down to start refuelling outage   (Updates throughout)	   LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - British gas for immediate delivery shrugged off lower offshore gas supply, while contracts further out eased in line with a bearish energy complex and forecasts that the impact on cargoes of Qatari LNG maintenance would be minimal.	   Friday gas fell after initial gains in early trading following news that gas exports from the ConocoPhillips  Theddlethorpe terminal were cut due to problems offshore and a reduction in flows from the Teesside PX terminal.	   “Due to an operational issue offshore, production export was ceased through the Theddlethorpe gas terminal yesterday afternoon,” a ConocoPhillips spokeswoman said.	   “Work is currently underway to rectify the matter,” she added.	   Theddlethorpe flows dropped to zero from about 12 million cubic metres/day (mcm/day) at about 1200 GMT on Thursday, while Teesside PX stopped flowing at about midnight, indicating that two separate issues are preventing exports.	   The loss of 17 million cubic metres/day (mcm/day) of gas from the combined outages tightened the UK gas system and initially supported within-day prices but contracts later eased as the gas system remained well balanced.	   UK NBP within-day gas fell 0.45 pence per therm to 56.55 pence on Friday afternoon, while Monday gas was down 0.85 pence at 56.65 pence. 	   “The UK CS is not performing well today, we have two unplanned outages at Theddlethorpe and Teesside,” one trader from a UK utility said.	   Front-month gas also extended losses in afternoon trading, after estimates that Qatar’s LNG maintenance would not substantially affect its exports.	   Qatargas said last Sunday it will stop three of the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas producing plants at different times during a rolling maintenance programme planned for this autumn. 	   “We believe that the actual impact to UK LNG imports will be significantly less than the nameplate capacity of trains offline for maintenance,” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a report published late on Friday.	   The bank estimates around 28 million cubic metres of capacity could be lost per day during maintenance this autumn.	   “The primary risk at this point is for unplanned extensions to the maintenance period, which would begin to have a more serious effect especially as winter heating demand increases into November.”	   Reduced LNG import concerns eased the October contract which fell 1.80 pence to 64.80 pence. Noevember was down 1.90 pence at 72.50 pence.	   Oil futures fell following disappointing U.S. job growth data, which raised further concerns about energy demand in the world’s largest oil consumer nation. 	   UK winter 2011/12 gas followed the bearish direction and shed 1.30 pence day on day to 73.50 pence, down 5.5 percent from its all-time high reached earlier this week.	   In Britain’s over-the-counter power market, day-ahead baseload traded lower, despite the outage of EDF Energy’s Sizewell B nuclear plant.	   Instead, the power market tracked losses in the gas market as gas plants covered around 43 percent of UK power production on Friday.	   Baseload Monday power traded at 49.50 pounds per megawatt-hour (MWh), down 60 pence day on day.	   EDF Energy’s two Sizewell B nuclear reactors were ramping down production on Friday to start a refuelling outage.

225,COP,UPDATE 1-China orders ConocoPhillips to halt output at Bohai Bay oilfield," (Adds background, detail)	   BEIJING, Sept 2 (Reuters) - China’s State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has ordered a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips  to halt all operations at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield in northern China’s Bohai Bay, saying the company has failed to seal a leak that has lasted more than two months.	   The administration said in a statement posted on its website (www.soa.gov.cn) that ConocoPhillips had been ordered to stop injection, drilling and production of oil and gas at the country’s largest offshore oilfield.	   “If the current situation continues, there could be risks of more damage to the seabed and of new oil spills,” it said, adding that oil continues to drift across the surface of the water, and oil mud on the seabed has not yet been cleaned up.	   The statement said that a team of inspectors “unanimously agreed” that ConocoPhillips had not fulfilled the requirements imposed on it at the end of July.	   “Because ConocoPhillips has not fulfilled its responsibility as a reasonable and prudent operator, the oil spill at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield is designated as an accident caused by negligence,” the statement said.	   ConocoPhillips has been requested to draw up a new environmental impact assessment report for the oilfield, and will only be allowed to resume operations once the report has been approved by government.	   The SOA again stressed that it would represent China in efforts to seek compensation from ConocoPhillips for the ecological damage caused by the spill.	   The U.S. company said on Wednesday that it had complied with all the requirements imposed by the administration by sealing off all the leaks before an Aug. 31 deadline. 	   The oil leak, which started in June, has polluted 5,500 square kilometres of water and has been described by the SOA as “the most serious marine ecological incident in China”.       	   The Penglai 19-3 oilfield has seven production platforms, with total output of 8.4 million tonnes per year (168,000 bpd), about 20 percent of total crude oil production in Bohai Bay.	   ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd has a 51 percent stake.

228,COP,WRAPUP 7-New Orleans braces for Tropical Storm Lee," * Storm will bring sustained rainfall to Louisiana coast   * Lee shuts 60.3 pct of U.S. offshore oil production  (Recasts, updates Lee position, adds details)   By Kathy Finn   NEW ORLEANS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - New Orleans, devastated by Hurricane Katrina six years ago, faced a new threat on Saturday from Tropical Storm Lee, which was set to challenge the city’s flood defenses with an onslaught of heavy rain.   The storm was expected to bring up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain to southeast Louisiana over the next few days, including to low-lying New Orleans, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.   Lee’s tidal surge could spur coastal flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama before drenching a large swath of the Southeast and Appalachian regions next week.   The slow-moving storm has bedeviled forecasters. Lee resumed its slow march northward toward the marshy Louisiana coast at 4 miles (6 kph), after stalling for several hours on Saturday afternoon.   The center of Lee was 60 miles (95 km) west-southwest of Morgan City, with maximum winds of 60 mph (95 kph), the hurricane center said. Lee’s winds were expected to stay below the 74-mph (119-kph) threshold of hurricane strength as the storm crawls ashore on Saturday evening.   New Orleans’ extensive levee system has pumped away about 8 inches (20 cm) of rain so far, with isolated reports of flooding in roads and homes. The system can process about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rainfall per hour, but the storm’s slow-moving nature remained a worry, officials said.   “We are not out of the woods,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu told a news briefing, noting that hurricane-force gusts had been logged at City Hall. “This storm is moving painfully slow.”   The prospect of flooding in low-lying New Orleans evoked memories of Hurricane Katrina, which flooded 80 percent of the city, killed 1,500 people and caused more than $80 billion in damage in 2005. Half the city lies below sea level and is protected by a system of levees and flood gates.   The storm dampened business at Mandina’s, a popular restaurant on Canal Street that was rebuilt after being nearly destroyed by Katrina’s floodwaters.   “Ever since Katrina it seems like the weather people are a little over-excited about the bad weather,” restaurant manager Martial Voitier said. “We had a terrible dinner last night, and lunch is not looking any better.”   No injuries or deaths were reported in Louisiana, but rough waters off Galveston Island in Texas led to the drowning death of a 34-year-old man, an island official said.   The storm could also bring heavy rains and flooding to Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle as it creeps eastward over the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend.   Low-lying parishes around New Orleans saw rising waters, which covered some roadways in Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes, but no homes or businesses were threatened. Some residents in Jefferson Parish were ordered to evacuate.   Periodic breaks in the rainfall allowed the city’s giant pumps to catch up with the water flow and clear standing water, said Jefferson Parish President John Young.   “Everything looks good,” Young told local television. “The pumps are keeping up with the water. We are getting some street flooding.”   About 35,000 houses were without electrical power due to the storm, according to utility Entergy Corp (ETR.N).   Over 60 percent of U.S. offshore oil production, all based in the Gulf of Mexico, and nearly 55 percent of offshore gas production were shut as of Friday, according to the U.S. government. Most of that output should quickly return once the storm passes. [ID:nWEN7917]   Major offshore producers like Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) shut down platforms and evacuated staff earlier this week. (For oil and gas outage FACTBOX click on [ID:nN1E7810TM])   Shell and Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) started to return workers to offshore platforms in the western Gulf of Mexico on Saturday. [ID:nWEN7915]   Low-lying refineries in Louisiana that collectively account for 12 percent of U.S. refining capacity were watching the storm closely, but reported no disruptions.   ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) 247,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Alliance, Louisiana, 25 miles (40 km) south of New Orleans, was operating normally as Lee moved overhead, the company said.   In the open Atlantic, Hurricane Katia weakened to a tropical storm on Saturday and was forecast to wobble back and forth between hurricane and tropical storm strength far from land, the hurricane center said.

229,COP,New Orleans holding up under Tropical Storm Lee,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lee moved slowly across southern Louisiana on Sunday as New Orleans’ flood defenses appeared to pass one of their biggest tests since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005.  The National Hurricane Center said Lee’s center was about 110 miles west-northwest of New Orleans, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph at around 5 p.m. EDT, and tropical storm-force winds extending 275 miles. The storm was moving at 5 mph.  Winds were expected to weaken gradually in the next couple of days and up to 20 inches of rain was expected to fall on southeast Louisiana, the Miami-based center said.  The storm has temporarily shut over 60 percent of offshore oil production.  In New Orleans, the storm recalled Hurricane Katrina, which flooded 80 percent of the city, killed 1,500 people and caused more than $80 billion in damage to the tourist destination. Lee has dropped up to 13 inches of rain on New Orleans since it developed late last week.  Half the city lies below sea level and is protected by a system of levees and flood gates.  Some street flooding was reported, but the city’s massive pumping system kept ahead of the volume and diverted the waters into Lake Pontchartrain.  Low-lying parishes around New Orleans did not fare as well, as Lee’s winds drove a tidal surge over levees and onto roads.  “For a while we got some false hope that we might be out of the woods, but we realized overnight we would get more rain,” Lafourche Parish spokesman Brennan Matherne said. “We’re getting call after call about street flooding.”  New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned residents to stay alert for flash floods and high winds expected before Lee moves to the northeast on Monday.  “Let’s not be lulled to sleep by the breaks that we’ve had,” Landrieu said.  New Orleans’ levees saw less stress because Lee’s winds were too weak to drive a massive storm surge into the city, as was the case during Katrina.  “The levees at this point are really not being tested because the surge is not coming into the system,” said Colonel Edward Fleming of the Army Corps of Engineers. “This is mainly a wind and a rain event.”  New Orleans’ festive spirit endured despite the rain. A parade for the Southern Decadence festival, a gay and lesbian event expected to draw 100,000 people, was to continue as planned, city police said.  There were isolated reports of flooding in roads and homes. No injuries or deaths were reported in Louisiana.  Wet conditions associated with the storm appeared to be a factor in an early morning car wreck in Mobile, Alabama, that killed one man and left several injured.  Lee’s tidal surge could spur more coastal flooding in Louisiana, as well as in Mississippi and Alabama, before drenching a large swath of the Southeast and Appalachian regions in the coming days.  Storm winds have already been pushing Gulf waters inland, slamming barriers in low-lying areas such as Lafourche Parish and prompting mandatory evacuations in the coastal communities of Lafitte, Crown Point and Barataria.  In Mississippi, local governments were taking precautions as forecasters predicted tides could be 2 feet to 4 feet above normal.  Less than 1,000 houses were without electrical power due to the storm late on Saturday, down from about 38,000 earlier, according to utility Entergy Corp .  More than 60 percent of U.S. offshore oil production, all based in the Gulf of Mexico, and over 44 percent of offshore gas production were shut as of Saturday, according to the U.S. government. Most of that output should quickly return once the storm passes.  Major offshore producers like Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp and BP Plc shut down platforms and evacuated staff late last week.

234,COP,WRAPUP 9-New Orleans braces for Tropical Storm Lee," * Storm brings sustained rainfall to Louisiana coast   * Lee shuts 60.3 pct of U.S. offshore oil production   (Updates with storm position, power outages)   By Kathy Finn   NEW ORLEANS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - New Orleans, devastated by Hurricane Katrina six years ago, faced a new threat on Saturday from Tropical Storm Lee, which was set to challenge the city’s flood defenses with an onslaught of heavy rain.   The storm was expected to bring up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain to southeast Louisiana over the next few days, including to low-lying New Orleans, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.   Lee’s tidal surge could spur coastal flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama before drenching a large swath of the Southeast and Appalachian regions next week.   The slow-moving storm has bedeviled forecasters. Lee’s winds weakened on Saturday night as it meandered northward toward the marshy Louisiana coast at 2 miles per hour (3 kph), after stalling for several hours in the afternoon.   Late on Saturday, the center of Lee was just off the Louisiana coast 85 miles (137 km) west-southwest of Morgan City, with maximum winds of 50 mph (80 kph), the hurricane center said. Lee’s winds were expected to stay well below the 74-mph (119-kph) threshold of hurricane strength as the storm prepared to crawl ashore, possibly overnight, and into Sunday.   New Orleans’ extensive levee system has pumped away about 8 inches (20 cm) of rain so far, with isolated reports of flooding in roads and homes. The system can process about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rainfall per hour, but the storm’s slow-moving nature remained a worry, officials said.   “We are not out of the woods,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu told a news briefing, noting that hurricane-force gusts had been logged at City Hall. “This storm is moving painfully slow.”   New Orleans is under a flash flood watch through Monday night due to heavy rain potential, the National Weather Service said on Saturday. Potential damage from wind gusts up to 50 mph will also be a concern for New Orleans on Sunday as Lee’s center moves inland, it said.   The prospect of flooding in low-lying New Orleans evoked memories of Hurricane Katrina, which flooded 80 percent of the city, killed 1,500 people and caused more than $80 billion in damage in 2005. Half the city lies below sea level and is protected by a system of levees and flood gates.   Slivers of sunshine in the afternoon brought some tourists out and drew grumbles from some local businesses that advance reports on Lee may have been overdone.   But Landrieu said stormy conditions could continue for the next 36 hours, warning, “Don’t go to sleep on this storm.”   No injuries or deaths were reported in Louisiana, but rough waters off Galveston Island in Texas led to the drowning death of a 34-year-old man, an island official said.   The storm could also bring heavy rains and flooding to Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle as it creeps eastward over the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend.   Low-lying parishes around New Orleans saw rising waters, which covered some roadways in Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes, but no homes or businesses were threatened. Some residents in Jefferson Parish were ordered to evacuate.   Periodic breaks in the rainfall allowed the city’s giant pumps to catch up with the water flow and clear standing water, said Jefferson Parish President John Young.   “Everything looks good,” Young told local television. “The pumps are keeping up with the water. We are getting some street flooding.”   About 8,000 houses were without electrical power due to the storm, down from about 35,000 earlier on Saturday, according to utility Entergy Corp.   Over 60 percent of U.S. offshore oil production, all based in the Gulf of Mexico, and nearly 55 percent of offshore gas production were shut as of Friday, according to the U.S. government. Most of that output should quickly return once the storm passes.

China’s State Oceanic Administration (SOA) ordered the PL19-3 oilfield in the northern Bohai Bay, co-owned and operated by ConocoPhillips , to suspend all operations because the American firm had failed to seal a leak that had lasted for more than two months, CNOOC said.	   SOA intends to sue ConocoPhillips and state media criticised the firm sharply, calling it negligent.  	   CNOOC, China’s biggest offshore state oil company, said it would lose 62,000 barrels per day of output because of the suspension at China’s biggest offshore oil field. 	   It had already been losing 22,000 bpd since the regulator ordered a halt to operations at two PL19-3 platforms on July 13 because of the leaks.	   The oilfield was producing 150,000 bpd before the oil leak, Standard Chartered Bank said in a research note on Monday. CNOOC owns a 51 percent stake and ConocoPhillips 49 percent. 	   Investors thought the leak had been sealed so did not expect the government to order a full suspension of output, analysts said. Last Wednesday, ConocoPhillips had said it had sealed off all the leaks before an Aug. 31 deadline. 	   “It was a negative surprise to the market,” said Lee Wee Keat, an analyst from DBS Group Research.	   CNOOC shares fell to a four-week low of HK$13.54, down 11 percent on the day, the biggest single-day percentage fall in three years.	   CNOOC shares closed at HK$13.84, down 8.9 percent, while the broader Hang Seng Index fell 2.95 percent. 	   Analysts expect the loss of output to reduce CNOOC’s total output and earnings by about 2 percent this year.	   Beijing has been vocal about cracking down on industrial polluters, focusing on private-sector companies. In this case, the SOA threatened to sue ConocoPhillips, but not its state-owned partner CNOOC.	   ConocoPhillips drew harsh criticism from the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party, for its handling of the spill.	   “Time after time, delays, negligence, cover-ups and cheating, ConocoPhillips China’s oilfield operation was finally stopped by China’s maritime authority,” said an article in the newspaper, which was also picked up by the official Xinhua news agency.	   “There is a sharp contrast between the company’s sensitivity regarding its image and its inadvertence towards China’s oceanic environment,” Xinhua quoted the article as saying.	   A spokesman for ConocoPhillips was not immediately available for comment. 	   Monday’s plunge in CNOOC shares was also fuelled by fears of a U.S. recession that is weighing heavily on global stock and oil markets,  analysts said.	   “Earnings impact is only several percentage points, but given a fragile market sentiment, any negative news would trigger panic selling,” said Mona Chung, a fund manager at Daiwa Asset Management.	   The PL 19-3 oilfield has about 647 million barrels of proven and probable reserves, a note by Deutsche Bank said.	   In 2010, CNOOC produced 906,000 boe (barrels of oil equivalent) per day.	   Suspension of PL 19-3 would cut CNOOC’s production by 4.4 percent, based on 2010 output figures and assuming a 12-month closure, Deutsche Bank said.	   CNOOC had already said last month it was lowering its annual output target to 331-341 million boe from 355-365 million because of the oil spill and delays with an acquisition.	   “We do not foresee an adjustment to CNOOC’s current 2011 production guidance of 331 to 341 mm boe,” Deutsche Bank analyst David Hurt said in the note.	   “We think that selling on the news is probably not the right move,” Hurt said, adding the bank maintained a “buy” rating on CNOOC with a price target of HK$20.9.	   JPMorgan, which maintained an “underweight” rating on CNOOC, said on Monday it estimates a 2 percent impact on CNOOC’s domestic crude production for 2011 with impact on full-year earnings closer to 4 to 5 percent.	   “It is still not clear how costs and penalties will affect the two parties involved,” JPMorgan analyst Brynjar Eirik Bustnes said in a note to clients.

239,COP,UPDATE 1-China CNOOC plans Oct Huizhou refinery turnaround," * Refinery turnaround planned as Penglai oilfield ordered to shut   * CNOOC has contingency plan in place for plant’s crude supply   (Adds details)	   BEIJING, Sept 5 (Reuters) - China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), parent of CNOOC Ltd , will shut down its 240,000 barrel-per-day Huizhou refinery in south China for up to 40 days of repair work from early October, two industry sources told Reuters on Monday.	   The refinery processes mostly crude oil from Penglai 19-3, China’s largest offshore oilfield operated by U.S. firm Conocophillips which the Chinese government ordered last Friday to shut down due to oil spill issues. 	   “It’s a planned shutdown. Just that the timing for starting the turnaround has been slightly changed,” said one source. 	   CNOOC Ltd, which owns 51 percent of Penglai 19-3 field, said the government-ordered full suspension of production of the field would reduce its net output by a further 40,000 bpd, on top of an earlier production loss of 22,000 bpd.	   The production loss would mean the Huizhou refinery, operated by parent CNOOC, would have to seek additional crude supplies to plug the loss or reduce refinery production.	   “CNOOC has a contingency plan in place since last month, including to use crude stored in floating storage. If needed, to reduce refinery throughput,” said the source familiar with CNOOC’s refinery operations.  	   The Huizhou plant, in Daya Bay of southern Guangdong province, is CNOOC’s only major oil refinery.	   A second source said earlier on Monday that the Huizhou plant would reopen an 800,000 tonne-per-year aromatics unit in November after closure caused by a fire in July and planned a shutdown next month.

240,COP,WRAPUP 2-Storm Lee threatens US Southeast with heavy rains," * Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky threatened   * Heavy rain but little flooding in New Orleans   (Updates location, strength of Katia in paragraphs 21-22)   By Kathy Finn   NEW ORLEANS, Sept 5 (Reuters) - After testing New Orleans’ flood defenses over the weekend, Tropical Storm Lee moved northeast on Monday after weakening to a tropical depression, and threatened to bring heavy rains and flooding to a large section of the U.S. Southeast.   Moving slowly inland, the powerful rainmaker was on course to hit Mississippi on Monday and Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky on Wednesday and Thursday, the U.S. National Hurricane center said.   Even as a tropical depression, the remnants of Lee have the potential to dump 10-15 inches (25-38 cm) of rain across the Gulf region, forecasters said. Heavy rains are expected to spread into the Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachians through Tuesday with rainfall of 4-8 inches (10-20 cm).   “These rains are expected to cause extensive flooding and flash flooding,” the hurricane center said. It added that tornadoes were possible on Monday in sections of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle and southwest Georgia.   The rains could bring to the Tennessee Valley and Appalachian Mountains the same kind of flash flooding seen recently in Vermont after Hurricane Irene.   In Texas, winds from the storm whipped up wildfires that have burned more than 3.5 million acres (1.4 million hectares) of the parched state this season, with 1,000 homes threatened in Bastrop County, just east of Austin. [ID:nN1E78304T]   The National Hurricane Center said the remnants of Lee were 55 miles (90 km) west-southwest of McComb, Mississippi, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) around 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT on Monday). The storm was moving east-northeast at 7 mph (11 kph).   The storm has temporarily shut over 60 percent of offshore oil production. [ID:nN1E78304S]   In New Orleans, flood defenses appeared to pass one of their biggest tests since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005 despite up to 13 inches (33 cm) of rainfall since Lee developed late last week.   Half the city lies below sea level and is protected by a system of levees and flood gates.   Some street flooding was reported, but the city’s massive pumping system kept ahead of the volume and diverted the waters into Lake Pontchartrain.   New Orleans’ levees saw less stress because Lee’s winds were too weak to drive a massive storm surge into the city, as was the case during Katrina, which flooded 80 percent of the city, killed 1,500 people and caused more than $80 billion in damage to the popular tourist destination.   New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned residents to stay alert for flash floods and high winds expected before Lee departs, saying, “Let’s not be lulled to sleep by the breaks that we’ve had.”   There were isolated reports of flooding in roads and homes. No injuries or deaths were reported in Louisiana.   Wet conditions associated with the storm appeared to be a factor in an early morning car wreck in Mobile, Alabama, that killed one man and left several injured.   As of Sunday afternoon, 6,149 customers were without power in Louisiana and 609 in Mississippi, utility Entergy Corp (ETR.N) reported.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   For a factbox on outages click on         [ID:nN1E7810TM]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   More than 60 percent of U.S. offshore oil production, all based in the Gulf of Mexico, and over 44 percent of offshore gas production were shut as of Saturday, The U.S. government said.

Katia had top sustained winds of 100 mph (161 kph) and was expected to become a “major hurricane” by Tuesday, the hurricane center said.

The National Hurricane Center said the remnants of Lee were 55 miles (90 km) west-southwest of McComb, Mississippi, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) around 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT on Monday). The storm was moving east-northeast at 7 mph (11 kph).   The storm has temporarily shut over 60 percent of offshore oil production. [ID:nN1E78304S]   Even as a tropical depression, the storm remains a rainmaker, carrying the potential to dump up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rain over the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachian Mountains, forecasters said.   The remnants of Lee could still bring flash flooding and tornadoes to Mississippi on Monday, and to Alabama and Tennessee on Tuesday, the Miami-based hurricane center said.   In New Orleans, the storm recalled Hurricane Katrina, which flooded 80 percent of the city, killed 1,500 people and caused more than $80 billion in damage to the tourist destination. Lee has dropped up to 13 inches (33 cm) of rain on New Orleans since it developed late last week.   Half the city lies below sea level and is protected by a system of levees and flood gates.   Some street flooding was reported, but the city’s massive pumping system kept ahead of the volume and diverted the waters into Lake Pontchartrain.   Low-lying parishes around New Orleans did not fare as well, as Lee’s winds drove a tidal surge over levees and onto roads.   “For a while we got some false hope that we might be out of the woods, but we realized overnight we would get more rain,” Lafourche Parish spokesman Brennan Matherne said. “We’re getting call after call about street flooding.”   New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned residents to stay alert for flash floods and high winds expected before Lee departs.   “Let’s not be lulled to sleep by the breaks that we’ve had,” Landrieu said.   New Orleans’ levees saw less stress because Lee’s winds were too weak to drive a massive storm surge into the city, as was the case during Katrina.   “The levees at this point are really not being tested because the surge is not coming into the system,” said Colonel Edward Fleming of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. “This is mainly a wind and a rain event.”   There were isolated reports of flooding in roads and homes. No injuries or deaths were reported in Louisiana.   Wet conditions associated with the storm appeared to be a factor in an early morning car wreck in Mobile, Alabama, that killed one man and left several injured.   In Texas, just east of Austin, Lee’s gusty winds fed a 14,000-acre (5,700-hectare) wildfire that threatened 1,000 homes and caused evacuations. Wildfires have burned more than 3.5 million acres (1.4 million hectares) of Texas, which is in the grips of a historic drought. [ID:nN1E78304T]   Lee’s tidal surge could spur more coastal flooding in Louisiana, as well as in Mississippi and Alabama, before drenching a large swath of the Southeast and Appalachian regions in the coming days.   Storm winds have already pushed Gulf waters inland, slamming barriers in low-lying areas such as Lafourche Parish and prompting mandatory evacuations in the coastal communities of Lafitte, Crown Point and Barataria.   In Mississippi, local governments were taking precautions as forecasters predicted tides could be 2 feet to 4 feet (0.6 metres to 1.2 metres) above normal.   As of Sunday afternoon, 6,149 customers were without power in Louisiana and 609 in Mississippi, utility Entergy Corp (ETR.N) reported.

242,COP,CNOOC says oil field suspension to hurt output," HONG KONG, Sept 5 (Reuters) - China’s top offshore oil and gas producer, CNOOC Ltd , said its net production would be reduced by about 40,000 barrels per day due to the government-ordered suspension of operations at the entire PL19-3 oil field.

243,COP,"Sunoco to sell refinery business, keep retail","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sunoco Inc (SUN.N) plans to end nearly 120 years in the U.S. refining business, selling its two remaining plants as higher crude prices and slumping demand squeezed profits in the latest restructuring of the sector.  The Philadelphia-based company will remain a gasoline retailer through its 4,900 stations across the East Coast and Midwest, but will put its 335,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) Philadelphia refinery and 178,000-bpd Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania refinery on the block.  The move is the latest shift in the U.S. refining sector, which has seen a wave of companies disposing of refining assets, selling plants or mothballing them over the past two years as firms reorganize businesses to adjust to changing economics in oil product markets.  U.S. refiners have seen profits squeezed by sluggish demand due to the weaker economy and strong crude oil prices. Sunoco Chief Executive Lynn Elsenhans said the refining segment operated at a loss in eight of the last 10 quarters.  “It is in the best interests of shareholders to exit this business and focus on our profitable retail and logistics businesses,” Elsenhans said in a statement on Tuesday.  Sunoco’s share price rose $1.92, or 5 percent, on the day to $38.03 after the news.  If the company is unable to strike a deal to sell the plants by July 2012, it plans to idle the two main processing units at the facilities.  One option if no buyers can be found is to turn the refineries into terminals. Marcus Hook offers the better site for a terminal facility as it has storage tanks for crude oil and refined products as well as caverns for natural gas liquids storage, Elsenhans said.  The Philadelphia refinery would likely be better used as an industrial site and could process ethane from Marcellus Shale natural gas into ethylene, Elsenhans said.  The 513,000 bpd of refining capacity Sunoco is selling represents a significant portion of East Coast capacity. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated East Coast refining capacity at 1.7 million bpd, of which 1.27 million bpd is operating capacity, in a report from early 2011.  Energy investment bank Simmons & Co said in a Tuesday note that ConocoPhillips (COP.N) may be the next to put East Coast refineries up for sale, although the company said it had no such plan.  Conoco owns the 238,000-bpd Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, as well as the 185,000-bpd Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery.  In addition to its gasoline stations, Sunoco plans on retaining its logistics business, which has refined product and oil pipelines as well as terminals and is operated by Sunoco Logistics Partners SXL.N.  The company will hold a strategic review, assisted by Credit Suisse CSGN.VX, to explore ways to use its “strong cash position and maximize the potential for its logistics and retail businesses”.  Sunoco bought its first refinery in the 1890s as part of an early effort to diversify its oil production business.  Sunoco has had some initial interest from potential buyers, a company spokesman said, without elaborating further. Industry watchers said big refining players on the East Coast such as PBF and ConocoPhillips could be barred from purchasing due to concerns about market concentration.  “It would have to be private equity,” said Mark Gilman of New York-based The Benchmark Company, echoing comments from other analysts.  PBF, which purchased two East Coast plants — the idled Delaware City, Delaware refinery and the Paulsboro, New Jersey refinery — in recent years, declined comment. ConocoPhillips also declined comment.  Norwegian integrated oil company Statoil, a supplier of crude to refiners in the region, also declined to comment.  While refiners in other parts of the United States have somewhat rebounded from paltry margins because they can process cheap, dirty crude or sit near growing U.S. supply, East Coast refineries have lagged.  Midwest refiners, for example, have seen robust margins for months because of close access to increased supply from U.S. and Canadian shale oil plays. But East Coast refiners largely rely on more expensive imports.  U.S. Northeast refining margins have averaged $8.59 per barrel so far this year, Credit Suisse said in a report, $3.84 per barrel higher than a year ago, but nowhere near the $26.18 per barrel margin seen in the Midwestern United States.  Sunoco’s plants, which ran expensive, light, sweet crudes sourced from West Africa and other Atlantic Basin suppliers, also lack sophisticated coking capacity that would enable them profitably to run cheaper, heavy, sour crude, like refiners along the Gulf Coast.  “Sunoco has largely missed out on the strong recovery in refining profits over the last year because of its reliance on higher-cost waterborne feedstock and lack of Midcontinent refining capacity,” Morningstar Equity Research said in a note.  In addition, East Coast plants are further from South American markets, which Gulf Coast refiners have been supplying in greater volumes as demand there grows.  Elsenhans said the strategic review will look at every aspect of the company and determine the best way to unlock value for shareholders, including governance, management, uses of cash and potential sales of other operating units.  “Everything is on the table,” she said.  Sunoco expects a pretax non-cash charge of $1.9-$2.2 billion in the third quarter related to impairment of the plant and equipment in its refineries.  If the processing units are idled, additional pretax charges of up to $500 million may be incurred.  Sunoco has already completed the sale of its 170,000-bpd Toledo refinery in Ohio to PBF Holding for $400 million. In May, it sold a chemicals plant in Philadelphia to Honeywell International (HON.N) for about $85 million.  Sunoco also spun off its coal production unit SunCoke Energy (SXC.N).

245,COP,Conoco to spill more details on split,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) will divulge more details on Wednesday about its plan to split in two and analysts say the focus will likely be on its chemical joint venture, Canadian oil sands assets and pipelines.  In July, ConocoPhillips sketched out a plan to spin off its refining arm as part of its effort to boost shareholder value. At the time, it remained mum about where some assets would go, either to the refining arm or the exploration and production company.  Now, more details are expected to come from Chief Executive Jim Mulva in scheduled remarks at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power conference in New York on Wednesday morning.  Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N), a much smaller competitor, has announced a similar plan, but ConocoPhillips, unlike Marathon, has a maze of joint-venture deals, thousands of miles of pipeline and sophisticated assets that make its split more complicated, analysts said.  “I think we won’t see as clear a break up as we did with Marathon,” said Allen Good, an analyst with Morningstar. “They may have to get more creative with their joint-venture partnerships.”  For example ConocoPhillips has partnerships with Canada’s Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO). The partners have Foster Creek and Christina Lake producing assets, as well as two U.S. refineries.  Foster Creek and Christina Lake are expected to stay with ConocoPhillips’ exploration and production business, the company and analysts have said, but the fate of the refineries is less clear.  A representative from Cenovus said the company expects any change to be administrative, rather than operational.  “As far as the operations of both the upstream and the downstream, it will just continue as it has always been as far as we’re concerned now,” Cenovus spokeswoman Rhona DelFrari said. “We’re waiting for more details from them as well.”  Analysts at Simmons & Co International, a Houston-based energy investment bank, said the company’s exploration and production business will likely focus on five regions — Alaska, the lower 48 U.S. states, Canada, North Sea and Asia Pacific.  ConocoPhillips has also indicated it will sell two U.S. East Coast refineries — one in Linden, New Jersey and the other in Trainer, Pennsylvania — as part of its plan to shed older, less productive assets, according to Simmons.  A ConocoPhillips spokesman denied the report about the possible sale of two East Coast refineries.  Simmons also said it expects DCP Midstream Partners LP DPM.N, Conoco’s oil and natural gas gathering and processing venture with Spectra Energy Corp (SE.N) and Chevron Phillips, Conoco’s chemical joint venture with Chevron Corp (CVX.N), to end up with the refining arm.  Others see parts of the  DCP business fitting with both arms of the company.  “The problem with DCP is that some of the assets fit with upstream,” said Phil Weiss, an oil analyst at Argus. “And it’s got some pipeline assets that really fit with the downstream. Maybe in the interim they do a services agreement.”  Conoco shares fell 74 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $65.70 on the New York Stock Exchange trading.

247,COP,UPDATE 1-Conoco may put 2 refineries up for sale-analysts," * Analysts’ note says co. may put two refineries on block   * Company says has not made such a statement  (Adds company response)   HOUSTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) may put two refineries on the U.S. East Coast up for sale, energy investment bank Simmons & Co wrote in note on Tuesday.   “ConocoPhillips has indicated its intent to sell its East Coast Linden and Trainer refineries,” the note to clients said.   ConocoPhillips spokesman Aftab Ahmed said the company had not disclosed any such plan. “We’ve made no statements to that effect,” he said. “Not to anybody.”   Asked if the company aimed to sell those refineries, Ahmed said, “We have a disposition program, and our whole portfolio is under consideration. We haven’t specified anything beyond that.”   The company, which plans to make its refining unit a separate company next year, has repeatedly said publicly that it may sell less sophisticated refining assets.   The Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, has a capacity of 238,000 barrels per day (bpd), while the Trainer, Pennsylvania, plant can process up to 185,000 bpd.   Both are in the East Coast region, where refiners have struggled with low margins for at least two years.   Sunoco Inc (SUN.N) said on Tuesday that it planned to sell its two remaining refineries, both in Pennsylvania, after its refining segment posted losses in eight of the last 10 quarters. [ID:nNL3E7K622]   Refiners in other regions fare better, particularly in the Midwest, where refiners have raked in high profits for months as they exploit their close proximity to cheap landlocked crude oil in the United States.

253,COP,"US Cash Products-Gasoline weakens in Midwest, Northeast"," * Abundant supplies pressured Midwest gasoline  * Prompt Gulf Coast M3 gasoline firmed  * Harbor, Gulf jet fuel markets tumbled  NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Group Three gasoline weakened on Wednesday, with differentials to the New York Mercantile Exchange’s October RBOB futures contract falling about 3.00 cents a gallon as supply conditions in the region improved, traders said.  “Many shippers diverted barrels into the Group market off the Explorer (pipeline),” a Midwest trader said.  The latest drop was on top of an almost 2.00-cent slide in Group Three gasoline differentials on Tuesday.  Chicago gasoline fell a quarter cent following its losses on Tuesday.  Distillates in the Group Three market slipped, down about 1.90 cents, mimicking a slide in the Gulf Coast market caused by ample supplies.  On the Gulf Coast, differentials for M3 gasoline, the transitional summer-to-winter grade, climbed 0.75 cent per gallon, slightly rebounding from Tuesday’s late-day plunge of 3.00 cents per gallon on burgeoning supply.  “There’s too much gas(oline) around on the Gulf,” a trader said, noting that the higher 11.5 Reid vapor pressure of the M3 grade “means we can make more.”  Last week marked the last cycle of 2011 to trade the higher 9.0 RVP summer-grade M2.  Gulf jet fuel fell about 4.00 cents per gallon, in part because its latest five-day lifting cycle scheduled to move on the Colonial Pipeline, where space was limited because of allocations. [ID:nN1E7850M7]  A Gulf jet trader also attributed the plunge to thin trade and lack of liquidity in the market.  Gulf products markets had ignored Tropical Storm Lee last weekend as well as another system brewing Wednesday in the far southwest part of the Gulf of Mexico. [ID:nN1E7860TG]  “Like Lee before it, this one seems to lack clearly definable ‘steering’ forces, so most models have it just meandering around in that area for the next few days,” a Gulf trader said.”  Prompt F2 RBOB continued to weaken, as sellers attempted to get rid of summer-grade material and stock up on winter-grade F4 material. Prompt F2 RBOB tumbled by another 2.00 cents per gallon versus the NYMEX’ October RBOB futures contract, although no deals were reported done.  Prompt jet fuel nose-dived on a lack of buying interest, with offers heard at 7.00 cents over the NYMEX October heating oil futures contract against notional buying interest at 6.00 cents over. Heating oil firmed slightly, as did ultra-low sulfur diesel, each gaining about 0.75 cent on a differential basis.

255,COP,Conoco CEO sees integrated refining arm,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips’ chemical and pipeline operations will remain with the company’s refining business and fuel its growth after a spinoff, Chief Executive Officer Jim Mulva said on Wednesday.  ConocoPhillips first announced a plan in July to spin off its refining business, but many questions about the fate of the some of the company’s partnerships remained.  Mulva provided more specifics about the split on Wednesday to investors at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference.  The downstream business will be integrated and “not just focused on refining,” Mulva told investors.  After the separation, Chevron Phillips, the company’s chemical joint venture with Chevron Corp, will remain with the refining company.  DCP Midstream Partners LP, ConocoPhillips’ oil and natural gas gathering and processing venture with Spectra Energy Corp will also be part of the downstream business, Mulva said.  Paul Cheng, analyst at Barclays, told clients after the presentation that his firm still harbors doubts about ConocoPhillips’ separation plan.  “We do not believe the intended downstream spinoff creates value as we think the (refining and marketing) business should trade in line with other large (refining and marketing) companies, while the upstream business will likely trade at a slight discount,” Cheng said in a research note.  Production from unconventional assets in North America and liquefied natural gas projects will drive output in its separated exploration and production arm, Mulva said.  Mulva also told investors where assets from its partnership with Cenovus Energy Inc would land. The partners have Foster Creek and Christina Lake oilsands producing assets, as well as two U.S. refineries.  Foster Creek and Christina Lake will stay with ConocoPhillips’ exploration and production business, while the Wood River and Borger refineries will go to the downstream business, the executive said.  Capital spending for the exploration company will be about $15 billion per year, while refining and marketing spending is estimated at $2.5 billion.  The third-largest U.S. oil company plans to complete the spinoff of its refining company by the second quarter of 2012.

258,COP,COLUMN-Libya is last straw for Sunoco's refineries: John Kemp," (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)	   By John Kemp	   LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Sunoco’s decision to put its East Coast Philadelphia and Marcus Hook refineries up for sale has probably condemned both to closure. 	   In a world where seaborne light sweet oils are much more expensive than landlocked U.S. crude and heavier and sourer imports, Philadelphia and Marcus Hook are the two worst refineries to own in the United States.	   Both will struggle to find buyers, unless someone can be found willing to invest large sums of money to upgrade their desulphurisation and coking capacity, enabling them to improve margins by processing cheaper heavier and sourer crudes.	   With so much pressure on margins and surplus refinery capacity in North America and Western Europe, the prospect of a saviour emerging seems remote.	   Now the question is which refinery might be next up for sale or closure, with ConocoPhillips’ facilities at Bayway and Trainer seemingly most vulnerable.	   The best way to understand why Marcus Hook and Philadelphia are such terrible assets to own is to look at a snapshot of the crudes they were processing in June (the latest month for which detailed data is available) compared with other refiners across the country.	   In June, the United States imported 285.9 million barrels of crude oil. The weighted average sulphur content was 1.71 percent while the average API gravity was 28.34 degrees, according to company-level data published by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy.	   Given the scarcity of high quality crudes with low sulphur content and high yield of premium products, as a result of the war in Libya and North Sea maintenance, most refiners focused on acquiring the cheapest and sourest oils their refineries could handle to maximise margins.	   But struggling Sunoco imported 4.95 million barrels for Marcus Hook with an average sulphur content of just 0.17 percent and API of 36.8 degrees, much sweeter and lighter crude than other refiners. It also brought in 8.96 million barrels for Philadelphia with an average sulphur content of 0.18 percent and an API of 33.42.	   Unable to reduce the sulphur content or crack heavier molecules more aggressively to wring more valuable light products from its crude, Sunoco’s buyers were forced to chase some of the most expensive crudes in the market.	   In June, Sunoco brought in 3 million barrels of super-premium Nigerian light sweet for Marcus Hook, and another 3.5 million for Philadelphia.	   Sunoco’s buyers also landed 1.5 million barrels of ultra-light Norwegian crude — so light it was virtually straight-run gasoline (the Norwegian crude had APIs of 46-47 degrees, compared with straight-run gasoline around 50 degrees). They went as far afield as Azerbaijan to obtain 750,000 barrels of light sweet crude.	   The refinery processed some cheaper crudes from Angola, available at a discount because of their high acidity, to average down the acquisition cost. Even so, Sunoco’s refineries were paying among the highest average prices to buy crude oil for any refineries in the United States.	   If the 96 facilities for which detailed import data is available are ranked in terms of the weighted average sulphur content of the crudes they imported in June, then Marcus Hook and Philadelphia were processing the 6th and 7th sweetest crude slates in the United States. The refineries processing sweeter imported oils were far smaller (Table 1).	   In a ranking by API gravity, Marcus Hook and Philadelphia came in at 8th and 20th respectively. Of the big refineries, only ConocoPhillips’ facility at Trainer in Pennsylvania was bringing in lighter crudes in significant volume (Table 2).	   It is not surprising that in a note published Tuesday, boutique energy investment bank Simmons & Co speculated Conoco’s Trainer or Bayway refineries could be the next on the auction block, though Conoco denied having any plan to sell them.   	   East Coast refiners’ margins have been under pressure as they struggle with old facilities, rising product specifications, and fierce competition from Europe for both crudes to process and share in the gasoline market.	   Rivals in the Midwest are benefiting from cheap Canadian and North Dakota crudes trapped by the lack of export pipelines, while refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast have larger and more complex facilities capable of buying heavy sour crudes and processing them into a higher share of valuable gasoline and distillate.	   East Coast refineries have neither advantage. Most of their crude is imported, at prices linked to Brent rather than WTI, and their lack of complexity has forced them to buy the simplest and therefore most expensive crudes.	   Sunoco has not been a large buyer of Libyan oil. In 2010, Marcus Hook and Philadelphia imported just 4 million barrels of Libyan crude combined, according to EIA data.	   But loss of Libya’s exports and dwindling production from the North Sea, which pushed Brent-linked light sweet prices far above heavier sour grades, let alone WTI, proved the final straw for refineries that were anyway living on borrowed time.	   In 2007, East Coast refiners paid on average about $4.50 per barrel above the national average — including $5.50 more than rivals in the Midwest and $5 above Gulf refineries. By June 2011, East Coast refiners were paying almost $11 above the national average, more than $17 above the Midwest and $9 above the Gulf Coast.	   The East Coast figures are for all refineries in the EIA’s PADD 1 reporting region. Given that Sunoco’s Marcus Hook and Philadelphia refineries were buying lighter sweeter crudes than others, their price disadvantage was almost certainly greater.	   Marcus Hook and Philadelphia may be beyond salvage. Sunoco has written off the value of both almost entirely, taking a charge of $2.2 billion against its refining business, as my colleague Robert Campbell explained in a column Tuesday.  	   Some observers consider their only future may be as storage terminals for the new gas and liquids plays in the north-east linked to the Marcellus and Utica shales.	   Marcus Hook and Philadelphia are unlikely to be the last refiners facing sale or closure around the North Atlantic basin. Most refineries in the United Kingdom and other parts of Western Europe face an uncertain future.	   In the United States, the PADD 1 Trainer and Bayway refineries owned by Conoco are under most pressure. Conoco has already indicated it intends to demerge its upstream and refining activities.	   The problem for both refineries is they are almost indistinguishable from Philadelphia and Marcus Hook in terms of their reliance on expensive light sweet crudes.	   Trainer was actually importing even lighter and sweeter crudes in June, and both were bringing in very expensive oil from Nigeria, Congo and Colombia, averaged down with some Angolan acid crude.	   With refining margins under pressure, and light sweet oils in short supply, more refineries will have to close in the next couple of years to rebalance this segment of the market.

261,COP,China eyes controls as ConocoPhillips apologizes for spill,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on Wednesday that the government would strictly control new petrochemical projects around northern China’s Bohai Bay, as energy giant ConocoPhillips apologized for an oil spill there.  Wen, speaking at a Cabinet meeting, said Beijing would strive to cut pollution in and around the bay to ensure “harmony between man and sea,” according to a statement on the central government’s website (www.gov.cn).  “Strictly control new petrochemical projects,” the statement said without elaborating but in reference to the Bohai Bay.  The government will also establish a pre-warning mechanism for the bay’s marine environment, and improve controls to prevent heavy metal pollution, it added.  ConocoPhillips moved to repair its frayed relations with Chinese regulators earlier on Wednesday, apologizing for the oil spill and saying it will establish a fund to cover the clean-up costs.  The company said the proposed fund would be designed to address its legal responsibilities and benefit the general environment in Bohai Bay, but it did not say how large the pot would be.  “ConocoPhillips deeply regrets these incidents and apologizes for the impact that the incidents have had on the Chinese people and the environment,” Chief Executive James Mulva said in a statement.  A ConocoPhillips subsidiary said on Tuesday that all operations at an oilfield in Bohai Bay had been shut down, as ordered by China’s marine authority.  The State Oceanic Administration (SOA) last week ordered ConocoPhillips China to halt injection, drilling and production at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield — China’s largest — because it had failed to seal leaks that have lasted for nearly three months.  ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake of the oilfield and acts as the operator, while China’s top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC has a 51 percent stake.  Major Western firms, including ConocoPhillips, Unilever and Yum Brands have lately been under increasing scrutiny from China’s state media.  ConocoPhillips has been a particular target, enduring withering criticism from Chinese commentators and regulators. On Monday, a commentary in the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party, accused the company’s China operation of “delays, negligence, cover-ups and cheating.”  Analysts say that Western firms, lacking political protection, are easier targets for criticism. State-owned CNOOC has received comparatively little criticism, despite its joint ownership of the oilfield.  It was not immediately clear whether the apology and move to establish a fund for the bay would be enough to mollify the company’s critics.  “The key is the scope of this fund, whether it can really compensate losses of fishermen and ecological damage in Bohai Bay,” said Li Yan, head of Climate and Energy Campaign in Greenpeace in Beijing.  “If they can really establish this fund, then we can say they are doing the right thing. But it’s too early to draw this conclusion now.”  An official of ConocoPhillips China told Reuters that the company was currently working on the details of the fund.  Penglai 19-3 oilfield is one of ConocoPhillips’ biggest oil production facilities in Asia.  According to a statement posted on CNOOC’s website, the Chinese company’s chairman met ConocoPhillips last week to express its willingness to cooperate on a Bohai Bay fund.  ConocoPhillips China would seek to work with Chinese authorities and CNOOC regarding the establishment and operation of the fund, the company said in the statement.  As oil spills go, the Bohai Bay leak is not among the largest. ConocoPhillips China said on August 31 that as much as 3,200 barrels of oil and mud had leaked into the sea, and Chinese authorities said some 5,500 sq km (2,120 sq miles) of water had been polluted.  By contrast, the massive 2010 BP oil spill spewed more than 4 million barrels into the Gulf of Mexico.  The Penglai 19-3 oilfield is the country’s largest offshore oilfield, with total output of 8.4 million tonnes per year (168,000 bpd), about 20 percent of total crude oil production in Bohai Bay.  CNOOC has said it would lose 62,000 barrels per day of output because of the suspension at the field.  It had already been losing 22,000 bpd since the regulator ordered a halt to operations at two PL19-3 platforms on July 13 because of the leaks. CNOOC’s Hong Kong listed shares were trading 2.3 percent higher on Wednesday afternoon, after having fallen more than 10 percent following news of the output suspension.  The oilfield was producing 150,000 bpd before the oil leak, Standard Chartered Bank said in a research note on Monday.

268,COP,Mitsubishi to co-develop LNG field in Brunei: report,"(Reuters) - Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and three other oil firms will spend 700-800 billion yen ($9-$10.3 billion) to jointly develop a large-scale natural gas project in Brunei, Japan’s Nikkei business daily reported on Friday.  The partners, which include Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional, Murphy Oil Corp (MUR.N) and ConcocoPhillips (COP.N), will spend 70 billion yen to drill seven test wells over the next 2-3 years to determine the size of the reserves, the daily said.  Previous appraisals put the reserves at a few trillion to around a dozen trillion cubic feet, making it viable for commercialization, Nikkei reported.  Development on the project will start in 2013, with production to kick off the following year, the paper said.  The Japanese trading house will shoulder up to 50 billion yen of the total development costs.  The project is expected to produce 500,000 barrels of oil a day and 4 million tons of liquefied natural gas a year, at its peak, representing roughly 6 percent of Japan’s total LNG needs, the daily said.  Mitsubishi holds a 6.25 percent interest in the 5,000 sq. kilometer offshore natural gas block, while Malaysia’s state-run Petroliam Nasional is the largest stakeholder with a 45 percent interest, Nikkei said.  Shell owns 12.5 percent, Murphy Oil has a 30 percent stake and ConcocoPhillips’ share is 6.25 percent, the Nikkei said.

The midwater fleet, defined by the company as standard floating rigs that can drill in up to 4,500 feet (1,370 metres) of water, accounts for nearly a quarter of Transocean’s revenue.   The Transocean Legend signed up to drill for ConocoPhillips (COP.N) off Australia until October 2012 at a rate of $293,000 per day, down $5,000 from the last contract with Eni (ENI.MI).   From February 2012, the GSF Arctic I will keep working off Brazil, but for Panoro Energy, on $270,000 per day, up $20,000 from the current rate. The Sedneth 701, which had a contract off Gabon end in July, will work the rest of the year for Total (TOTF.PA) off Congo for $235,000 per day — up $25,000.   Contract additions in those three regions are good signs for Transocean, given that its chief executive had identified India, the North Sea and Southeast Asia as the most active midwater markets in a presentation to investors this month.   In Southeast Asia, a fourth midwater rig, the Actinia, received a three-month extension until December at a rate of $222,000 per day, up $32,000 from the existing contract with Petronas [PETR.UL] for work off Malaysia, according to Switzerland-based Transocean.

284,COP,Conoco may delay date for Trainer work -source," * Timing of Trainer, PA refinery maintenance uncertain   * Last major turnaround was in 2006   By Janet McGurty   Sept 16 (Reuters) - A major maintenance project may be delayed again at ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) 195,000 barrel per day (bpd) Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery, according to a source familiar with operations.   The plant was scheduled to go down sometime in October or November 2011 for its five-year maintenance — during which the refinery would be shut six to eight weeks for a complete overhaul.   The work, which was last undertaken in 2006, was then moved to spring 2012 and now it is not clear when it would be performed, said the source.   “We have done a little work since 2006. Some work on the isomerization unit, on the crude unit, the vacuum gas oil unit, but it was mostly little stuff,” he said.   ConocoPhillips confirmed there was no planned maintenance currently underway at the refinery but did not immediately respond to questions about planned maintenance schedules.   The materials and parts necessary for the turnaround are on hand and the company would need about two weeks to get the 1,500 contractors necessary to perform the work on site, the source said.   ConocoPhillips is in the process of splitting into two companies — one for the upstream and one for the downstream.   Given the weak refining profit margins on the U.S. East Coast, some analysts have suggested the company could sell or close its refineries there.

285,COP,Oil leaks from ConocoPhillips China oilfield rises," SHANGHAI, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The amount of oil leaked from ConocoPhillips’ oilfield in northern China’s Bohai Bay has risen, even though all operations have been shut down, state media Xinhua reported on Friday, citing the China’s State Oceanic Administration.	   About 6.56 litres of oil was found to have leaked from ConocoPhillips’ platform C in the Penglai 19-3 oilfield on Thursday, an increase from 1.66 litres on Wednesday, said China’s State Oceanic Administration (SOA).   The rise in leakage came despite Conoco having shut down all the field’s operations since Sept 6. 	    The Penglai 19-3 oilfield is the country’s largest offshore, with total output of 8.4 million tonnes per year (168,000 bpd), about 20 percent of total crude oil production in Bohai Bay.	   ConocoPhillips has a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as operator, while CNOOC Ltd , China’s top offshore oil and gas producer, has a 51 percent stake.

286,COP,UPDATE 1-Norway Kollsnes plant power demand cut in Sept," (Adds background)	   By Gwladys Fouche	   OSLO, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Power use at Norwegian gas plant Kollsnes will be cut to varying degrees during the planned outage at the Troll gas field, North Sea gas infrastructure operator Gassco said on Friday, giving some indication as to how much gas it will be able to export.	   The Troll A platform, which produces gas from Norway’s biggest gas field before it is sent to the Kollsnes plant onshore, is due to reduce activities for maintenance between Sept. 24 at 0900 GMT and Sept. 26 at 2100 GMT. 	   Kollsnes was expected to see its processing activities reduced as a result of Troll’s maintenance. 	   In August, Gassco said power comsumption would be cut to five megawatts (MW) from an installed capacity of 270 MW  between Sept. 24 at 0900 GMT and Sept. 27 at 0900 GMT.  	   On Friday Gassco gave further details as to how much power Kollsnes, which gets all its power from the country’s national grid, would consume during Troll’s maintenance work.	   Kollsnes would consume 20 MW of power, or 7 percent of its installed capacity, from 0900 GMT on Sept. 24, rising to 60 MW — or 22 percent — on Sept. 25. 	   A day later, power consumption would increase to 105 MW  — or 39 percent of installed power capacity — returning to normal from Sept. 27 at 0600 GMT. 	   Troll’s operator, Norway’s Statoil , has previously said that production would not be down for the whole period but that it will be affected for some of that period.	   Kollsnes has six compressors, which can process a total of 143 million standard cubic metres of gas per day.	   Troll A produces some 31 billion cubic metres of gas per year on average.

289,COP,"UPDATE 5-Tyco to split into three companies, shares rise"," * Commercial fire and security company will be largest   * Stand-alone companies could be takeover targets   * Sees one-time transaction costs of about $700 mln   * Expects to complete separation in about 12 months   * Shares up 3.7 percent  (Adds analyst and investor comment, byline; updates share movement)   By Nick Zieminski   Sept 19 (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Tyco International TYC.N is moving to separate its businesses into three independent publicly traded companies, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent.   Investors cheered the move on Monday amid speculation that smaller chunks of Tyco would become acquisition targets.   Consumer companies Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N and Ralcorp Holdings RAH.N, credit rating agency owner and book publisher McGraw-Hill MHP.N, and energy giant ConocoPhillips (COP.N) have announced plans to split their business as conglomerates are falling out of favor with investors. Also, ITT Corp (ITT.N) is planning to spin its defense and water segments into separate companies.   Tyco said the split would allow its three businesses — ADT North America residential security, flow control products and services, and its fire and security business — to have more options for growth, both from within and through acquisitions.   For a factbox on the three businesses, see [ID:nL3E7KJ26H]   Tyco’s Swiss incorporation makes a break-up more tax-efficient than a sale, said analyst Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners, but the individual pieces could be attractive to a long list of acquirers.   “We see all three pieces as possible takeover candidates,” Sprague said.   The ADT business could be attractive to AT&T (T.N), Verizon (VZ.N), Comcast (CMCSA.O), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) or to a private equity buyer, Sprague said.   Possible buyers for the commercial fire and security business include France’s Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA), Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and U.S.-based United Technologies (UTX.N), Honeywell International (HON.N) and Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Sprague speculated.   United Tech or General Electric (GE.N) could be interested in the valves business, he said. That unit could also merge with ITT’s flow unit, Flowserve (FLS.N) or Swiss-based Sulzer AG (SUN.S).   Tyco expects to complete the transaction in about 12 months, with transaction costs at about $700 million, mainly for debt refinancing, separation and restructuring.   “They got out ahead of the curve,” billionaire investor Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management said on CNBC television. “One or two of those companies might be an acquisition target. When boards do that, I congratulate them. They’re putting shareholders first.”   The break-up is the latest step in the nearly decade-long transformation of a diffuse conglomerate under Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen. He first broke up the company in 2007, then greatly expanded its security business via its $1.9 billion acquisition of Broadview Security in 2010.   The ADT North America residential business, which provides security and fire alarm systems in North America to more than 6 million homes and small businesses, will have an annual revenue of about $3 billion and 16,000 employees.   Plans call for it to be incorporated in the United States. Naren Gursahaney, president of the security solutions segment, will become chief executive.   The flow control business, with annual revenue of about $4 billion and 15,000 employees, will be headed by Patrick Decker, who is now president of that segment.   Tyco expects the segment, which sells valves and controls for the energy and other markets, to be incorporated outside the United States.   The company will combine the remaining commercial security business with the fire protection segment to form the largest new company, with annual revenue of $10 billion and 69,000 employees. Breen may be nonexecutive chairman of this business, while taking supporting roles at the others.   Tyco’s commercial fire protection business sells fire detection and suppression systems, while the security business serves commercial, industrial and governmental customers. The president of Tyco’s fire protection unit, George Oliver, will become the CEO of commercial fire and security.   In 2007, Tyco spun off its electronics division, now called TE Connectivity (TEL.N), and the healthcare company now named Covidien COV.N.   Tyco also recently sold a majority stake in its electrical and metal products business to private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, reversing plans for a spinoff of the division.   Shares of Tyco were up 3.7 percent at $45.33 in morning trading.

292,COP,Analysis: Conoco spill heightens scrutiny of offshore China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is clamping down on offshore oil drillers after a spill by U.S. firm ConocoPhillips in Bohai Bay, requiring tighter controls in a campaign to beef up environmental protection standards ordered by Premier Wen Jiabao.  The leak from the Conoco-operated field, while disastrous, emitted less oil in three months than BP’s Gulf of Mexico spewed out in a single day, but the response from Beijing has been swift and tough.  Firms are under orders to meet protection standards that some industry executives complain are nearly impossible. Approvals of environmental impact plans for new wells have slowed to a trickle as regulators pore over them more closely. Companies worry they will be barred from using the latest equipment if it hasn’t been tested in China.  The first shot from Beijing came earlier this month, when it ordered the shutdown of the 168,000 barrels-per-day Penglai 19-3 oilfield, in which China’s largest offshore oil producer, state run CNOOC Ltd, owns 51 percent.  CNOOC cut its output target, though the production loss is seen as having only a minor impact on supplies to the world’s No.5 crude producer.  Longer term, executives say, there will be a real impact on firms drilling in Chinese waters who are suddenly seeing offshore China as a more risky and costly place to operate.  “After the incident, companies were told by the authorities to implement ‘zero risk’. There is no such thing called zero risk — human error, mechanical error always exists,” said a Beijing-based foreign oil executive.  “But that means, from now on, everyone will need to pay more attention to the environment. The Chinese government is taking this opportunity to say we are also tough on the environment.”  Already, according to a second Beijing-based foreign executive, authorities have slowed or put on hold Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approvals for new wells near the Penglai field in Bohai Bay, effectively slowing drilling in the area.  “New technologies that have not been used before in China, such as rigs, platform design and well-plan design, will likely be held back on safety concerns,” said the second executive.  The oil executives all asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the case.  A CNOOC media official said CNOOC had not been notified about the slowdown in EIA approvals.  The spill drew withering criticism of ConocoPhillips by Chinese media, forcing the oil major to apologize and to establish two funds to clean up and compensate for any damages arising from the incidents.  Described by China’s marine authority as “the most serious marine ecological incident in China,” the spill has polluted 5,500 square kilometers of water and leaked around 3,200 barrels of oil and oil-based mud.  Chinese industry experts said the shutdown order from the State Oceanic Administration after Conoco failed to seal off the leaks was in answer to both the public outcry, and to orders from the very top, the State Council.  “The SOA is under huge pressure from Premier Wen to act,” said one Chinese state oil executive.  “It will be a transitional point for China’s offshore oil industry — China has reached a point that GDP is not the only barometer, it’s time to aim for more balanced development.”  China’s marine authority is preparing to file a lawsuit against ConocoPhillips seeking compensation for the spill, but analysts say litigation could be lengthy.  Any compensation by Conoco and CNOOC Ltd would set a benchmark for future pollution cases, said a CNOOC official.  Already, the government has ordered thorough safety checks on all offshore oil activity between September and December and Wen has said the government would strictly control new petrochemical projects around Bohai Bay.  Companies were also told to re-apply for certification for new equipment used in their operations, or even for change of minor equipment for repair works, said the first foreign executive.  “It definitely means higher risk and higher cost for foreign companies,” said the Chinese oil executive.  ConocoPhillips is one of the handful of international oil majors that operate in offshore China, where other investors are mostly independents such as BG Group, Anadarko, Roc Oil and Husky Energy.  Industry officials have argued that if the spill had been caused by a state-run company rather than a foreign firm, the response from authorities would been slower and less harsh.  “The whole thing was very frustrating. And it was so messy,” said one executive with an international oil major. A flood of reports in local media, some not well-researched, only complicated things further, the official said.  The incident was first revealed by China’s twitter-like microblogs, but companies and the regulator did not make it public for a month. State media have been accusing ConocoPhillips’ China operation of “delays, negligence, cover-ups and cheating.”  Analysts say China should seize the opportunity to revamp and tighten regulations and establish a mechanism to handle future spills.  “Oil companies are profit driven. It is necessary for the government to have clear policy signals and a clear mechanism so that oil companies can expect what situation they will face and what punishment they will have after an oil spill,” said Li Yan, who heads up climate and energy issues for Greenpeace in Beijing.  China has witnessed an increasing number of industrial pollution disasters over the past decade. Despite devastating results, state-owned companies often manage to pay relatively little in compensation.  Last year, an explosion of two crude oil pipelines in the northeastern port of Dalian triggered a major offshore oil spill. The government said about 1,500 metric tons (10,950 barrels) of oil had spilled into the sea, though Greenpeace estimated as many as 60,000 tons (438,000 barrels) of heavy crude oil could have leaked into Bohai Bay.  CNPC, the owner of the pipelines, has said no compensation plan has yet been agreed, local media has reported.  The ConocoPhillips spill has raised the bar for both foreign and domestic firms, analysts say.  “This incident is a landmark. If a state company like CNPC or CNOOC has another oil spill, it will be treated like ConocoPhillips and will be punished based on the new standards set this time,” said Lin Boqiang, director of the Center for Chinese Energy Economics Research in Xiamen University.  It is unclear how long the Penglai field will stay shut. A closure until the end of the year would mean about 18 million barrels of crude production lost, equivalent to around 1 percent of China’s total crude output, or four days of imports.  “Offshore oil production is a big driver of China’s domestic crude output growth,” said Hawaii-based Kang Wu, senior advisor at Facts Global Energy.  “We expect China’s domestic crude output to keep growing this year, but at a much slower pace than last year after this oil spill.”  If the oilfield remains shut until the end of the year, domestic crude oil production growth was likely to stand at 50,000 bpd, half the previous forecast of 100,000 bpd, he said.  China’s domestic crude oil production rose nearly 7 percent from the previous year to 4.06 million bpd in 2010.

The BLM released a draft plan for an upcoming lease sale that will offer 283 tracts in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, an Indiana-sized chunk of land on the central and western North Slope of Alaska.   Most of the leases that the BLM proposes offering in the sale are in the northeastern section of the reserve, the area closest to existing oil fields and pipelines already established on neighboring state land.   The lease sale will be held near the end of the year, but no firm date has been set yet, said Ruth McCoard, a spokeswoman for the BLM in Alaska. “We need to get through all of the public process,” she said.   Public comments on the BLM’s lease sale proposal will be received through October 21, the agency said.   The upcoming lease sale was planned after President Obama in May announced an initiative to hold annual leases in the federal land unit. A month later, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced his intention to hold the first of those annual lease sales this year.   There have been six lease sales in the reserve since 1999, and currently 1.36 million acres are under lease, according to the BLM.   ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N) have been the most active leaseholders and explorers. The companies are partners in some prospects near the eastern border of the reserve and have made commercial discoveries, with ConocoPhillips as operator.   The most advanced of those prospects is called CD-5. The companies are seeking to develop it an oil producer that will ship crude by pipeline to processing facilities at the Alpine field, a ConocoPhillips-operated facility located on nearby state land.   If CD-5 is successfully developed, it will provide the first commercially produced oil in the history of the 23 million acre petroleum reserve.   The reserve was established in 1923 by President Warren Harding as a potential energy source for the nation’s military forces, but over time the significant oil discoveries on Alaska’s North Slope turned out to be on state land well to the east, including the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk fields.

The country is lagging in its goal, producing 922,000 bpd this month, but is aiming for 950,000 bpd next year, with Chevron Corp remaining the top producer with a target of 357,000 bpd, while ConocoPhilips is expected to produce 57,000 bpd. 	   Thailand has a more competitive fiscal policy compared with Indonesia, Jim Taylor, President of U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips and chairman of the Indonesian Petroleum Association (IPA), told an energy conference.	   “Indonesia can reach 1 million in oil lifting given the investment climate is helping. Oil is declining but gas is increasing. They are waiting for successful exploration in oil,” he said.	   Taylor said to achieve the goal, Indonesia needs to triple its investments in the oil and gas sector and explore enhance oil recovery (EOR) technology for deep-water drilling.	   Declining output at ageing fields and sudden shutdowns in oil wells have often derailed Indonesia’s plans to meet annual  targets, which have fallen from its peak in 1995 of 1.6 million bpd, after Chevron Pacific Indonesia implemented EOR technology in its Sumatran fields.	   BPMigas said in June that oil and gas contractors need to use EOR technology to boost the country’s oil reserves by 10 percent, or an extra 4.3 billion barrels to its existing proven reserves of 3.7 billion barrels.  	   Chief Economic Minister Hatta Rajasa told the conference that Indonesia’s oil and gas production is now around 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) and aims to raise it to 4.0 million boed by 2015 and 6.0 million boed by 2020.	   To do that, the government will look into the pace of approving energy exploration applications and remove red tape.    “The government is prepared to debate all the issues, including its pricing policy,” he said.	   Domestic media has reported that Indonesia is putting pressure on companies holding oil and gas contracts to expedite their projects and will call up 149 contractors to discuss why they have failed to meet exploration commitments.	   “Previously, we were too lax in allowing contractors to delay their exploration projects. We’ll never do that again,”  Hardiono, deputy head of state energy watchdog BPMigas was quoted as saying. “If in six years the exploration commitments are not accomplished, we’ll terminate their licenses.

297,COP,Venezuela has proposed $1 billion compensation for Exxon,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela has proposed paying Exxon Mobil Corp. $1 billion in compensation for the nationalization of its assets in 2007, much less than the U.S. oil giant wanted, the energy minister said on Wednesday.  In a telephone call to Reuters, Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez also denied the government of President Hugo Chavez was negotiating with Exxon separately from an ongoing arbitration process at New York’s International Chamber of Commerce.  “Our proposal is $1 billion for its assets ... We are not in negotiations with Exxon Mobil, nor has it crossed our minds to approach them,” Ramirez said.  “There are no negotiations outside the arbitration tribunal. We have said that the ruling of the Chamber of Commerce is coming out soon, but we do not know when.”  Venezuela is battling about 20 arbitration cases triggered by nationalizations that were ordered by Chavez’s socialist administration. The biggest by far are the cases brought by oil majors Exxon and ConocoPhillips.  Verdicts against the South American OPEC member will likely run to billions of dollars, which could put pressure on public finances ahead of a presidential election in October 2012, when Chavez will be seeking a new six-year term.  Earlier on Wednesday, local media quoted a senior Venezuelan official, Prosecutor General Carlos Escarra, telling reporters the government was negotiating with Exxon and that the company had cut its compensation demand to $6 billion.  That was much more than Venezuela has banked on paying — but the comments caused speculation that a deal could be near.  The Exxon and Conoco cases stem from the 2007 state takeover of extra heavy crude projects in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt, one of the biggest oil deposits in the world.  The two companies originally claimed more than $40 billion in combined compensation, while Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA calculated the assets, after payments to creditors, were worth less than $2 billion.  The dispute with Exxon is particularly fractious. In early 2008 the company won a court order to freeze $12 billion of PDVSA assets. The freeze was swiftly overturned.  Earlier this year, Ramirez told Reuters that the Chavez government had calculated that it would pay no more than $2.5 billion in total to Exxon and Conoco.  Some analysts say PDVSA might have to sell overseas holdings to meet a big compensation bill. The company has cash flow problems despite high oil prices because most of its income goes toward funding Chavez’s socialist spending.  But Ramirez says PDVSA is fully solvent, would not have to sell assets, and already has a compensation plan in place.

301,COP,"REFILE-FEATURE-Libyan oil flows, foreign workers wait"," (Refiles to delete repeated word in first paragraph)	   This accompanies a special report on doing business in Liba. For a PDF: link.reuters.com/det83s  By Emma Farge	   BREGA, Libya, Sept 23 - Scribbled in blue marker in Arabic on the walls of Brega oil terminal is a message meant to cheer returning workers: “Gaddafi is gone and the place has been checked.”	   Oil production has restarted in some Libyan fields including Sarir in the east, but the near-deserted Sirte Oil headquarters to the east of Muammar Gaddafi’s hometown is testament to the damage the conflict has done to the country’s main industry.	   Amidst a cluster of crude oil storage tanks, gleaming white in the Mediterranean sunshine, stand at least two charred grey ones. The chimney of the site’s power plant lies in a gnarled wreck in the courtyard. A warehouse used for weapons storage, hit by a NATO bomb, is a tangle of wood and piping. A stash of missiles nestles in a petrochemical site, stored there by Gaddafi troops who took the gamble that NATO would not target expensive infrastructure.	   Brega is one of a cluster of export terminals and Libyan oil companies are eager to get things started in a business worth about $176 million a day before the conflict. The country provides only around 2 percent of global oil consumption but its oil is prized for being easy to refine.	   Some oil workers have marvelled that Gaddafi did not inflict damage to Libya’s oil facilities on the scale of Saddam Hussein, who ordered hundreds of oil wells to be set ablaze on his retreat from Kuwait in 1991. There has been no comprehensive survey of the Sirte Basin, which holds most of the country’s oil and gas fields, but interim oil minister Ali Tarhouni estimates the war has left 10-15 percent of Libya’s oil infrastructure damaged.	   Yet safety remains a major concern, especially after militia killed 17 guards at the nearby Ras Lanuf refinery last week. Brega is probably out of range of even the most sophisticated rockets in Gaddafi’s arsenal. But the area is full of mines, and the  country is strewn with ordnance dating back to World War Two.	   Fathi Issa, chairman of the management committee of state-owned Sirte Oil, waves a small, disk-shaped anti-personnel landmine the colour of milky tea, and tells reporters that 6,000 of the explosives have been found on Brega beach.	   “We will bring all the workers back when it’s safe. We find something new every day,” Issa told Reuters last week.	   According to official figures from the National Transitional Council (NTC), 40,000 mines were planted around the Brega area during this year’s fighting; Military spokesman Ahmed Bani told Reuters an order for 120,000 from Brazil was placed by a Gaddafi officer during the conflict, suggesting the number could be much higher.	   Rabea, an engineer at Sirte Oil who only gave his first name, commutes daily along the Brega-Ajdabiya coastal road which is flanked on both sides by war graves. He has tried three times to re-establish his daily routine since the war began, most recently in late August. “I’m not afraid. The mines are mostly on the seaside,” he said, his stoicism typical of many Libyans who have witnessed months of destruction.	   Foreign oil companies are less nonchalant.	   “I know many think we are cynical people ready to do anything to earn some bucks, but we are not going to put our staff in harm’s way. We need to make sure security is there,” said a French oil industry source.	   Sirte Oil’s Issa says that besides mines, one problem has been sabotage to the Hateiba gasfields south of Brega. The tops of wells were found exposed, causing gas to leak out. Looting has forced many companies to order new equipment. Ras Lanuf Oil and Gas Company, or Rasco, told Reuters its tugboats were stolen by Gaddafi troops who used them to shuttle arms back and forth to Misrata when it was under siege.	   Accommodation is hard to find. Some of the houses in the workers’ barracks are little more than sunken husks and there is no electricity or running water. An upturned armchair with loose stuffing is parked in the middle of the street. The forest-green uniform of a Gaddafi soldier lies on the pavement, apparently abandoned by its owner.	   Still, spirits are high in the oil-rich east, one of the spearheads in the military campaign against Gaddafi. For people here, restarting oil output is a matter of pride.	   In Benghazi, Yousef Mahmoud, an engineer at National Oil Company subsidiary Jowfe, has set up a society called the February 17 oil group, named to commemorate the day Libya’s revolt began. It has 4,000 members from Libyan oil firms. As well as restarting output, it wants to purge former Gaddafi sympathisers from the business and move the country’s umbrella oil firm NOC away from Tripoli and into the east.	   “We are trying to push people to work again and we try to make a full report of the damage,” he told Reuters, sitting in the Benghazi office of U.S. oil services company Baker Hughes.	   There was not an American to be seen in the office. Foreign oil firms have yet to return to Libya on a large scale. Economic sanctions have deterred many U.S. firms, even though the United Nations Security Council voted last week to ease them. Security is the main concern.	   International oil firms are accustomed to working in hostile environments, but as a general rule they rely on their own security firms. This grates with Libyans, who feel they are capable of securing the country after ousting Gaddafi. That’s turning into a sticking point in negotiations.	   “If security is good enough for Libyans it should be good enough for foreign workers,” said interim oil minister Ali Tarhouni. An oil official in the NTC told Reuters the country is planning to create a force of 5,000 security guards to secure oil and gas infrastructure.	   Libya’s oil industry can restart without foreign firms, but analysts say a speedy return to pre-war output of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) will depend on their return.	   In the short term, the priority for oil production is to serve the Libyan people, says Abdalil Salah, an official in the oil ministry. Imports are costing Libya’s interim administration around $330 million a month. Blackouts and fuel shortages at service stations are still common.	   Abdusalam el-Madani, head of administration for German oil company Wintershall in Libya, has visited his company’s oil sites which have not been mined or suffered major damage. “The facilities are ready to start operating and our foreign workers will be back by early October,” he said.	   Official estimates of how quickly Libya’s oil output can recover range from a year to 15 months. That may seem slow, but Iraq’s oil output has yet to return to its late-1970s and early-1980s levels eight years after the fall of Saddam.	   In messages broadcast from hiding, Gaddafi has threatened devastation similar to Saddam’s in Iraq. Until he is caught or killed, that remains a risk, particularly in remote desert areas like the Sirte Basin. In theory the area is under NTC control. But soldiers from Gaddafi’s desert strongholds could easily move eastwards.	   Despite their concerns, Libya’s oil companies take solace in the preparations they made ahead of the crisis. Libya’s crude in the Sarir field is particularly waxy, and when in the late 1970s British oil major BP was forced out by nationalisation, the company told the Libyans it would leave behind clogged pipelines.	   “They said they would leave us with the world’s largest candlestick,” said Younis Feituri, a member of Agoco’s management committee for exploration and production. This time around, the company mixed the crude with a thinner variety of oil and it is now flowing to the Tobruk export terminal. “We haven’t forgotten BP’s words.”	 	  	 	 	 	 	  ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/libya-oil/refile-feature-libyan-oil-flows-foreign-workers-wait-idUSL5E7KM21V20110923

303,COP,SPECIAL REPORT-How to win business in Libya," For a PDF: link.reuters.com/det83s  By Emma Farge, Lorraine Turner and John Irish	   BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) Sept 23 - In August, as rebels fought forces loyal  to President Muammar Gaddafi, two representatives of a British business consortium took a “rather long and arduous ferry journey from Malta” to the North African country.	   “To describe it as a ferry would be very polite,” according to an executive at a London-based global engineering company, whose interests the two men represented. “I think it was a trawler.”	   The men travelled to Libya at the invitation of the rebel administration. Britain, along with France and the United States, had given political and military support for the uprising against Gaddafi and sponsored the rebel leadership, the National Transitional Council (NTC). This was a chance to close some deals.	   “We had people on the ground in Misrata,” said the businessman, who spoke by phone on condition of anonymity. “You could still hear ordnance from the centre of Misrata, so it was very much an ongoing situation. But they were already talking about training and equipping fire brigades, training and equipping police.”	   The visitors keep coming. In the lobby of the Tibesti Hotel in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, opportunists mix with diplomats, journalists and aid workers. With NATO’s help, the rebels have deposed Gaddafi and now control Tripoli, the capital. Elsewhere fierce fighting continues and Gaddafi remains holed up. The country has yet to pay its workers, write a new constitution or even name a transitional government. But it is a land with deep pockets, and plenty of new friends.	   French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron received a heroes’ welcome last week when they became the first western leaders to visit since Gaddafi’s ouster. Interim leader Abdel Jalil said the rebels’ allies could expect preferential treatment in return for their help.	   It was a clear signal that countries which had not backed the NATO bombing campaign, including Russia, China and Germany, or which were slow to denounce Gaddafi, like Italy, stand to lose out.	   But if French and British politicians are tallying up the contracts, business executives are leaving little to chance. Foreign companies withdrew from Libya at the outset of the NATO bombing campaign; sanctions imposed on Gaddafi’s regime since February have added to the difficulty of doing business. 	   Despite this, dozens of executives from France, Britain, Italy and other countries have spent months building ties with potential Libyan partners. In a country fractured by tribe and politics, they say it is relationships that will prove decisive.	   The potential profits are huge. While there are pockets of damage to infrastructure and former Gaddafi command centres, the country is in far better shape than Iraq was after the fall of Saddam. At the same time, Libya needs new investment in everything from schools to services. According to the French business federation, Libya should offer around $200 billion in investment opportunities over the next 10 years. With a population of just over 6 million and Africa’s largest oil reserves, it has plenty to spend. Up to $170 billion worth of frozen Gaddafi-era assets alone should help pay for reconstruction.	   Here’s how companies are playing this new front in the latest scramble for Africa.	  	   Western firms, including trading houses Vitol, Trafigura and Gunvor have already been busy. A London-based team for Vitol sold oil products to the rebels in large volumes as early as April, and helped ship their first crude oil cargo. Trafigura expressed interest, although it is not clear if any deals were concluded. 	   France landed executives in Benghazi in June and July, according to Michel Casals, head of the Franco-Libyan Chamber of Commerce. 	   “There’s no point going when people are not ready, but we can’t go in six months when everybody has already been there,” says Thierry Courtaigne, director general of French business lobby Medef International, which represents the interests of France’s top companies overseas.	   At the same time, some firms remain wary of doing business with the rebels in case they break international sanctions. Though those sanctions are now easing — Europe and the United Nations have eased theirs — U.S. firms in particular are hesitant. One engineering executive expressed optimism about the potential in Libya “once things get going” and said he has been attempting to rekindle old relationships. But he, along with another U.S. company official, said sanctions left them unsure about how much they can do. Many told Reuters they are waiting for guidance from Washington.	   There are ways to work as you wait. These include employing free agents known as “fixers,” who offer on-the-ground intelligence, security, networking, and deniability in case of a legal challenge. Often former British military men, fixers are widely used by companies in resource-rich countries with weak governments. In Libya you can find a small community of them in hotels like the Tibesti — Benghazi’s main networking hub.	   One of their number is a former senior officer in Britain’s SAS special forces. In his early 60s and with a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, John Holmes is often seen with two other men at the Tibesti. He spends much of his time in the lobby, trying to catch the ear of NTC officials who could help open doors in the oil sector. 	   NTC officials say Holmes is working on behalf of British firm Heritage Oil, trying to finance field security and maintenance work in return for a stake in the country’s oil production. He refused to talk to Reuters, describing himself as a private person. Heritage also declined to comment on whether the firm had hired him. “They’ve been very aggressive, going out on a limb,” said one rival. 	   Others are more approachable, but still decline to be identified or say who they are working for because of the sensitive nature of their work. Many fixers are fresh from similar assignments in Iraq. One, dressed in desert camouflage and smoking British Lambert & Butler cigarettes, was responsible for liaising with local Iraqis. He doesn’t speak Arabic but says he has a mantra for life: have respect, be courteous and don’t promise something you can’t deliver.	   The job includes giving clients a flavour of local conditions and pinpointing opportunities. In one memo sent by a fixer and seen by Reuters, the author details meetings with Libyan officials and discusses a strategy for gaining access to remote oil facilities to check out the wartime damage. Such information could be priceless to oil companies weighing Libya’s still-considerable risks against the huge potential rewards.	   Political support can help with access, and with the law. Sarkozy has hotly denied talk of “under the table deals for Libya’s riches”, including reports that in return for French help, oil group Total will be given preferential access to Libyan oil. Nonetheless, Paris has been frank about the payback it expects in return for spearheading NATO’s mission.	   “The President took political and military risks, and all that creates an environment where the Libyan authorities and the people know what debt they owe France,” French Trade minister Pierre Lellouche told a Sept. 6 symposium on the NTC arranged by the Franco-Libyan chamber of commerce. “We aren’t going to get embarrassed by helping our companies benefit from this advantage.”	   In April, when Vitol shipped out rebel-produced oil, it had backing from the office of British Foreign Secretary William Hague, oil and diplomatic sources say.	   A special group referred to by UK media as a secret oil cell, backed by British Prime Minister David Cameron, was staffed by a handful of officials and supported by Britain’s MI6 secret ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/libya-rebuild/special-report-how-to-win-business-in-libya-idUSL5E7KM2Q720110923
304,COP,BP Migas to renegotiate gas supply swap to Singapore," JAKARTA, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s oil and gas regulator, BP Migas, is seeking to renegotiate a contract to swap gas supplies with Singapore buyers, the watchdog said on Monday. 	   Singapore now absorbs gas supplies allocated for Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company, from JOB Pertamina-Talisman Jambi Merang’s block. 	   “The Singapore buyer has agreed that the gas supply can be returned to its former allocation (PLN). Discussions on this are ongoing this week” said BP Migas spokesman, Gde Pradnyana.	   The swap mechanism would replace the remaining gas supply with several other producers, including the Jambi Merang block operated by Pertamina and Talisman Energy Inc , and the Koridor block operated by ConocoPhillips .

305,COP,UPDATE 1-Arrow raises offer for Australia's Bow Energy to $524 mln," * New resources would allow Arrow LNG trains 1 & 2 to expand to 4.6 mtpa   * Arrow LNG expects to make FID in late 2013   (Adds Arrow Energy CEO comments)	   Sept 26 (Reuters) - Arrow Energy, a venture between Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and PetroChina , has raised its offer for Australian gas explorer Bow Energy by 2 percent to A$535 million ($524.2 million).	   Bow Energy said in a statement on Monday it had recommended shareholders vote in favour of the A$1.52 per share bid, up from the previous offer price of A$1.48 per share. 	   Arrow Energy would use Bow’s gas assets to expand the first two trains on its liquefied natural gas project near Australia’s eastern port of Gladstone.	   “This transaction, should it go through has the real potential to allow us to strengthen our reserves base and expand our train sizes of our first two trains,” Arrow Energy chief executive officer Andrew Faulkner told Reuters on Monday.	   “What we have at the moment is a project where we are looking at 4 or 4.2 million tonne trains as our base case at the moment. We absolutely have the gas necessary to do that so we don’t require this deal, we have the existing gas reserves.” 	   The Arrow LNG project, which is expected to come online around 2017, is one of four coal-seam gas to LNG projects worth an estimated $70 billion near Gladstone. 	   The first phase of the project was expected produce 8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG, and Arrow Energy had been planning to eventually expand Arrow LNG to 16 mtpa. The Bow acquisition would allow Arrow LNG first phase to produce 9.2 mtpa and expand beyond 16 mtpa. 	   Arrow announced its initial offer on Aug. 22 in a bid to acquire resources to fuel its Australian gas-export project. The revised offer followed further talks between Bow and Arrow and comes after a steep sell-off in global financial markets.	   Shares in Bow closed at A$1.465 on Monday, down from a peak of A$1.565 last month, but well above its pre-bid price below 90 cents.	  Chief Executive Officer of Bow Energy, Mr John de Stefani, said: “Bow has developed its coal seam gas assets successfully to a point where the involvement of a major player is ultimately required to best take the projects to the next step.”	   Arrow Energy is expected to make a final investment decision on Arrow LNG at the end of 2013, joining a crowded field of coal seam gas to LNG projects in Australia’s eastern Queensland state. 	   The project may face stiff competition for labour and resources from other LNG projects, but Faulkner said it might also benefit from starting its projects a few years later than others. 	   “One of the benefits that Arrow might have being a year or two behind some of the others is that we will be able to pick up some of the labour force as they come off some of the other projects,” Faulkner said. 	  Two of the other coal seam gas projects in the area, Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips’ Australia Pacific LNG and BG Group’s Queensland Curtis Island LNG also have plans to expand their initial production capacity.

307,COP,"UPDATE 2-Venezuela says Helmerich lawsuit ""makes no sense"""," * Venezuela seized 11 drilling rigs last year   * U.S. company filed suit last week claiming damages   * Ramirez says it is yet another “frivolous” claim  (Recasts, adds quotes, details, background, bylines)   By Enrique Andres Pretel and Marianna Parraga   PUERTO LA CRUZ, Venezuela, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil minister said on Tuesday a lawsuit by Helmerich & Payne (HP.N) over the nationalization of its drilling rigs “made no sense” and the nation would not be “punished” for its choices.   Oklahoma-based Helmerich & Payne sued the government of President Hugo Chavez in a U.S. court last week, accusing it of violating international law and a breach of contract after the authorities seized the 11 rigs in June 2010. [ID:nL3E7KQ32E]   “It makes no sense. It’s a frivolous claim. There is a history of frivolous claims of this kind against Venezuela,” Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez told a news conference.   “This is not a cowardly government ... We have to shield ourselves against any possible aggression. We will not accept to make to be made an example of and punished by any country.”   The government seized Helmerich & Payne’s rigs following a year-long dispute over pending payments by state oil company PDVSA. The government said it would pay the company book value for the equipment and would negotiate a fair price.   Venezuela is battling about 20 arbitration cases triggered by nationalizations that were ordered by Chavez’s socialist administration. The biggest by far are cases brought by oil majors Exxon-Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N).   Verdicts against the South American OPEC member will likely run to billions of dollars, which could put pressure on public finances ahead of a presidential election in October 2012, when Chavez will be seeking a new six-year term.   The Exxon and Conoco cases stem from the 2007 state takeover of multibillion dollar extra heavy crude projects in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt.   Venezuela has proposed paying Exxon $1 billion in compensation, much less than the U.S. oil giant wanted, Ramirez told Reuters last week. [ID:nS1E78K26F]   The government said Exxon was demanding $6 billion, which it said was “outrageous, abusive and intended to charge the people for what is the sovereign exercise of its oil policy.”  (Writing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Bob Burgdorfer)   ",9272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-nationalizations/update-2-venezuela-says-helmerich-lawsuit-makes-no-sense-idUSS1E78Q1RG20110927
308,COP,Conoco to sell or shut Pennsylvania refinery,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) will sell or shutter its 185,000 barrels-per-day Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery, the latest struggling East Coast plant to fall victim to poor margins.  The company, which has moved to get rid of what it considers unprofitable operations, has already begun to idle the refinery and will close it permanently within six months if a buyer is not found.  A permanent shutdown will likely leave the East Coast, which has seen two other refineries come up for sale or closure in September alone, even more reliant on fuel imports from Europe and Eastern Canada.  The news helped push up gasoline prices both on the physical and futures markets, with RBOB gasoline futuresjumping nearly 5 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange. <O/R>  East Coast plants, typically heavily reliant on costly crude imports from the North Sea and West Africa, have seen profits squeezed by rising prices for those grades in recent years.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN.N) put over 500,000 bpd of refining capacity on the block this month, announcing it would shut its Marcus Hook and Philadelphia refineries in Pennsylvania if it could not find a buyer.  Analysts say the poor economics for the region mean finding a buyer may not be easy.  “I think it certainly is going to be a challenging thing for them to do,” said Ann Kohler, analyst at CRT Capital Group. “Certainly the pool of buyers today is vastly diminished from what we saw in the ‘90s.”  The plant could possibly draw interest from an international company like India’s Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), but it will be a tough sell, she said.  With East Coast refineries such as Trainer buying oil tied to the price of international benchmark Brent crude futures, the plants must pay more for their feedstock than refiners in the Midwest that run crude priced against U.S. benchmarked West Texas Intermediate.  U.S. crude futures used to trade at a premium to Brent, but are currently trading at $23 discount to the international benchmark due to a supply glut at the delivery point for WTI in the Midcontinent.  “The market for refineries on the East Coast is pretty poor,” said oil analyst Brian Youngberg with Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Several refineries have already shut down. They are just not as competitive. Conoco may find a buyer but it’s going to be tough.”  Youngberg said Conoco’s 285,000 bpd Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey was also a likely target for sale or closure.  Conoco, which plans to make its refining unit a separate company next year, has repeatedly said publicly that it may sell less sophisticated refining assets and other oil and gas properties it considers obsolete.  “We are very disappointed to hear the news that ConocoPhillips will permanently close its Trainer, Pa. refinery in six months if a buyer is not found,” said United Steelworkers Union International Vice President Gary Beevers in a release. USW represents 215 workers at Trainer.  Over the last year, Sunoco has shut down its 145,000 bpd Eagle Point, New Jersey, refinery and PBF Energy has bought Valero Energy’s (VLO.N) Paulsboro, New Jersey and Delaware City, Delaware, refineries.  Additionally, Hovensa LLC in the U.S. Virgin Islands, reduced the input capacity of its St. Croix refinery by 150,000 bpd. Western refining shut down its 66,300 bpd Yorktown, Virginia, refinery.  ConocoPhillips says it expects to recognize a non-cash charge of approximately $300 million after taxes in Q3 2011 for this action.  ConocoPhillips had earlier delayed scheduled October/November maintenance on the Trainer refinery, according to a source familiar with its operations.

309,COP,RPT-UPDATE 1-Hess chief says U.S. oil shale oil output to surge,"(Repeats, adds missing word “oil” to headline and first bullet point)   * U.S. shale oil output to double, Hess says   * Bakken costs rising on weather, floods   * Libyan oil production to return only slowly   * U.S. refineries to suffer as crude spread shrinks   STAMFORD, Conn,, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Companies that waged big bets on the U.S. shale oil bonanza will see output double in the coming few years, but the costs to tap the fields are rising, Hess Corp (HES.N) Chief Executive John Hess said on Tuesday.   Oil output from shale prospects in unconventional sources from North Dakota to Texas could reach 1.5 million to 2 million barrels-per-day (bpd) in the coming five to seven years, twice as much as the 700,000 bpd currently produced in these places, Hess told an IHS Herold energy conference.   “This is a game changer. It is lower risk with more returns. It’s great to have on your portfolio, especially being based in the (United States)” he said.   Hess is the largest gas producer and the third-largest oil producer in North Dakota, with over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.   Nonetheless, Hess said, regulations will pose the greatest risk to the exploding growth in output.   The federal government is currently evaluating new regulations on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing— the technology that spawned the shale revolution—although industry representatives argue state governments are best equipped to oversee their operations.   Rising costs for fracking and other drilling also present more risks to shale drilling in North Dakota and Texas, he said, since harsh winter weather and record spring flooding have forced the company to spend $7 to $10 million on each well in the region, the CEO added.   Industry experts had previously pegged Bakken well costs at $6 million per well.   Hess also said he was sceptical that oil production in Libya would return to levels seen before the fighting that dislodged Muammar Gaddafi.   Hess, whose company produced 22,000 bpd of crude in Libya, or 8 percent of its total output, said the uncertain security in the country made it unlikely that foreign companies would rush to put people back at facilities there.   Earlier on Tuesday, Libya’s port authority chief told Reuters the first Libyan crude cargo to be shipped in months sailed from the eastern port of Marsa el Hariga on Sept. 25 bound for Italy.   Hess also warned the price advantage that many of the land-locked U.S. refineries have enjoyed will disappear in the next two to three years as prices for WTI crude oil move back toward the international benchmark prices.   “In the long term, I think the refining industry has some serious economic challenges,” he said.   The U.S. benchmark WTI crude is currently priced about $22.50 per barrel below the Brent crude price, largely due to rising output of supplies in the Bakken and shipments from Canada that have created a glut of oil at storage facilities in Oklahoma.   Hess said that a poor refining outlook appeared to be the reason behind some integrated companies’ decision to split off their refining arms from their oil and gas producing businesses.   Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) split off its refining and marketing operations into Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) in June, and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has said it planned to separate into two businesses next year.   Hess currently has a joint venture in the St. Croix refinery in the Virgin Islands and operates a gasoline producing refinery in New Jersey.   The company has been steadily shifting its focus away from refining for years, he said, and currently directs less than 2 percent of its spending to that business.

Sergey Funygin, president of the local subsidiary of Russia’s TNK-BP, told reporters the stoppage was due to start in March or April 2012 and would last about a month.  TNK-BP is a partner in the upgrader, which converts tar-like crude from Venezuela’s Orinoco belt into lighter exportable oil, with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.  The stoppage fits with a broader plan of maintenance for the South American OPEC member’s four upgraders, which have been hit by failures and maintenance stoppages since 2009.  The socialist government of President Hugo Chavez nationalized the four Orinoco upgrader projects in 2007, expelling Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) after they refused to accept a minority stake.  TNK-BP has a 16.7 percent stake in Petromonagas after it bought the assets of BP (BP.L) in Venezuela.  Speaking on the sidelines of an oil conference hosted by PDVSA in Puerto La Cruz, Funygin said TNK-BP was preparing to ask PDVSA whether the Russian company could increase its stake in the upgrader to 40 percent, taking Exxon’s old share.

314,COP,"Conoco buys Libyan oil, 1st of U.S. majors -sources"," * To deliver to German Miro refinery - source   * Other U.S. majors also close to resuming buying   * Purchase to help further normalise Libya oil trade    By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Emma Farge	   LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips became the first U.S. major to buy Libyan oil following the end of international sanctions in a move to help the country restore normal oil trade after seven months of civil war.	   Trading sources told Reuters that tanker Hellas Warrior, which loaded 381,000 barrels of Sarir and Mesla crude, was bought by Conoco for delivery to France’s Mediterranean port of Fos/Lavera, and one source said it was destined for Germany’s MIRO refinery.	   Libya’s Arabian Gulf Oil Company (Agoco) gave the cargo to Vitol in payment for oil product deliveries, and Vitol then sold it to Conoco, the sources said.	   U.S. companies were among the most active buyers of light and low-sulphur Libyan crude before the civil war and were the first to stop purchases after Washington and the European Union slapped sanctions on the government of now-ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi.	   Sanctions against Libya have been removed or eased about a month ago, but sources at U.S. firms have said it will take a few weeks before they can resume purchases of Libyan crude.	   “We have done most of the work and are close to sorting out our internal problems to be able to buy again,” said a source at a major U.S. firm other than Conoco.	   A source at Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) confirmed that the transaction had taken place and said it expected to start dealing with U.S. oil firms directly in the near future.	   “That deal was done through Agoco. We have some contacts with the United States and they tell us they can start buying again,” he said.	   Agoco, a subsidiary of NOC, has been handling marketing operations in recent months because of international sanctions on the umbrella firm.	   The NOC source said that it would start marketing crude again by mid-October.   	   Oil is slowly starting to flow again from Libya after seven months of fighting and, if fresh projections prove correct, may beat the expectations of analysts, who think it could take three years to reach pre-war output levels.   	   Libyan oil industry is dominated by European players, although U.S. companies such as Conoco, Marathon , Hess  and Occidental are also involved in a number of exploration and production projects in the country, the holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves.

317,COP,Conoco locks in shale gas deal with Australia's New Standard," PERTH, Sep 30 (Reuters) - Australian energy exploration firm New Standard Energy said on Friday it finalised an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Goldwyer shale gas project in Western Australia’s Canning Basin to ConocoPhillips for A$109.5 ($107.529) million. 	   ConocoPhillips , the first oil major to step into the fledgling Australian shale gas industry, will acquire 75 percent of the Goldwyer project over four phases of exploration, New Standard said in a statement.  	   “The decision by ConocoPhillips to farm-in to the Goldwyer Project has validated our confidence in the unconventional gas prospectivity of the Goldwyer Project and we expect the on-ground exploration activity in 2012 to provide important endorsement,” New Standard managing director Sam Willis said. 	   Some in the industry have high hopes for shale gas to become Australia’s next wave of energy growth, following the nation’s  A$70 billion coal seam gas industry, but most experts agree significant production is still at least a decade away.   	   Australia has 396 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, equivalent to about 46 percent of U.S. reserves.

318,COP,Libya's Waha Oil faces tough task to fix war damage,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Forces loyal to deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi have destroyed vehicles and equipment at some fields owned by Libya’s Waha Oil company and at others security is still too shaky to visit, an engineer with the company said on Sunday.  Waha Oil is owned by Libya’s National Oil Corporation in a joint venture with American firms ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Amerada Hess.  Before the conflict, it pumped nearly half a million barrels of oil per day (380,000 bpd) but it is now producing no crude.  “They (company managers) sent a group of engineers and they have gone around to see the damage, although they were not able to make it to all locations as some are still dangerous because Gaddafi’s troops are still there,” said Abdullatif Hetwash, an engineer who has worked for Waha Oil for 36 years.  Waha operates four main oil fields, including Waha, Dahra, Samah and has its main base at the Es-sider terminal on Libya’s Mediterranean coast.  “Waha is not safe yet, Samah is not safe yet, but they managed to visit Gialo and reported that everything, the warehouse, facilities, accommodation, has all been destroyed by Gaddafi’s troops. They went in and they destroyed the equipment and have taken most of the spare parts,” he said.  “In one raid they took 127 trucks from Es-sider terminal and one of our transport managers gave up to Gaddafi’s troops 60 new Land Rovers. We have the report. He was pro-Gaddafi.” he said.  Most of Libya is nominally under the control of the new interim government, but security provision is patchy and fighting is still going on at Sirte, on the Mediterranean coast, and at Bani Walid, south-east of Tripoli.  Just weeks ago, 17 people were killed in a raid by militia at Ras Lanuf, Libya’s largest refinery.  “There’s no security, no electricity, no food and looting at the warehouses,” said Hetwash.  “In some areas 90 percent of spare parts and motors have been destroyed, and we cannot start production until they are replaced because it is dangerous,” he added.  It could take six months to restore the facilities at the fields seen by the Waha Oil team, Hetwash said, and the restart is being held up by key workers who say they will not return to the fields until managers, seen as remnants of Gaddafi’s regime, agree to step down.  He said if the internal dispute is resolved, engineers and other workers are ready to start the work of getting Waha Oil’s fields back on stream.  “Most of the people that produce the oil are here. We can do without them, the managers. We can start from tomorrow if we can have enough transport, equipment, tools and materials,” Hetwash said.  Along with hundreds of Waha Oil employees, Hetwash was at a rally on Sunday outside the company’s headquarters to demand a change of management.  The protest reflected the freedom that Libyans are now enjoying after Gaddafi’s autocratic rule came to an end, and the grievances that built up for decades. Before, security forces would stop any public show of dissent.  “The chairman and members must go immediately, and not wait another minute,” said Widad El Said, a secretary at the company for four years.  “Everything has stopped for eight months and this is not good for Libya. But all the employees in the fields have refused to go back because they will never trust the management again” she said.  In August, Marathon Oil said it has had preliminary discussions with the interim government, the National Transitional Council, on restarting output at the Waha field.  But the firm said it wouldn’t send staff back to Libya until it could ensure their safety.

320,COP,US Cash Products-Chicago diesel up on shut crude line," * Chicago ULSD up just under 3.00 cents a gallon  * Enbridge shut Oklahoma-to-Illinois crude pipeline  * Prompt RBOB rallies in Harbor on Trainer shutdown  (Updates with end-day prices)  Oct 3 (Reuters) - Cash diesel differentials in Chicago rallied on Monday after Enbridge Inc (ENB.N) shut its Oklahoma-to-Illinois crude pipeline which supplies Midwest refineries, traders said.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel differentials in Chicago rose 2.75 cents a gallon to 6.50 cents over November heating oil futures earlier in the day but pared gains and ended at 5.00/6.00 cents over.  Enbridge Inc (ENB.N) shut its Oklahoma-to-Illinois crude pipeline, which supplies Midwest refineries just as the autumn corn and bean harvest picked up.  “It’s a season when farm demand will be strong so any refinery cutback will be more severe on diesel prices,” a Midwest trader said.  The 231,000 barrel-per-day crude line was shut as a precaution after a section under the Mississippi River was found uncovered, Enbridge said in a statement. [nN1E792149]  In the New York Harbor, prompt gasoline differentials jumped to the highest since Sept. 9 in a continued reaction to the shutdown of ConocoPhillips’ COP.N 185,000 barrels-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania.  Prompt F4 RBOB traded at 9.00 and 9.25 cents per gallon over November RBOB futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 3.50 cents from Friday’s settlement, as buyers locked up barrels in the first five days of the new trading month.  While shipments of gasoline headed to the U.S. Atlantic Coast from Northwest Europe, traders noted that the arrival timings likely would not match prompt needs, which pushed differentials higher.  New York Harbor heating oil supplies, meanwhile, appeared to be well-stocked as differentials were seen mostly lower for prompt barrels.  Friday’s fire in a crude distillation unit at Petrobras’ (PETR4.SA) (PBR.N) 100,000 bpd refinery in Pasadena, Texas, east of Houston helped support cash products in the Gulf Coast market.  M3 gasoline differentials dipped early on Monday, paring most of Friday’s late-day gains as the well-supplied region digested news of the refinery’s shutdown. However, differentials rebounded and ended the day up by 0.75 cent per gallon at 3.00 cents over November RBOB futures on the NYMEX, traders said.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel differentials extended Friday’s gains with an increase of 0.75 cent a gallon.  Gulf Coast jet fuel differentials also gained 1.50 cents per gallon to about 7.50 cents over November NYMEX heating oil on a host of factors, including thin liquidity in a market, a veteran Gulf jet fuel trader said.

322,COP,Interior affirms disputed Alaska Chukchi lease sale," ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Monday formally approved a disputed Bush-era oil lease sale in the Chukchi Sea off northwestern Alaska, a remote site where Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) seeks to drill exploration wells next year.   Salazar’s move frees the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement to approve a Chukchi exploration plan submitted by Shell in May. That plan proposes up to three wells a year in 2012 and 2013 in the Chukchi.   The BOEMRE in August approved a separate Shell exploration plan that proposes up to two wells a year in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska’s northern coast.   Environmental and Alaska Native groups had challenged the the Chukchi lease sale, held by the Minerals Management Service in February of 2008 under the administration of President George W. Bush. The groups won a 2010 federal court order barring any exploration work in the Chukchi until deficiencies in pre-sale environmental reviews were corrected.   In his decision Monday, Salazar determined that the BOEMRE had conducted sufficient remedial analysis, including a new review of oil-spill risks, to support the lease sale as held.   A Shell spokesman in Alaska said Salazar’s decision puts the company closer to its goal of drilling in the Arctic offshore next year. “We believe the Chukchi plan we submitted in May of this year is technically and scientifically sound and we look forward to exploring this critical part of our Alaska portfolio in 2012,” Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said in an email.   But representatives of the groups that sued to overturn Chukchi oil leasing said Salazar’s decision puts a fragile ecosystem at risk.   The 2008 lease sale fetched over $2.66 billion in high bids, a record for any oil and gas lease sale in Alaska. Shell was the dominant bidder, putting up $2.1 billion to acquire exploration rights. Other energy companies that won exploration rights include ConocoPhillips (COP.N), which has said it plans to drill as early as 2013, and European firms Statoil (STL.OL), Repsol (REP.MC) and Eni (ENI.MI).

323,COP,Exclusive: Libya's NOC seeks $6 billion in sanctions debts,"LONDON (Reuters) - Libya’s top oil body is pursuing international oil firms for bills worth around $6 billion that were left unpaid this year due to U.N. sanctions imposed in March, a source in the National Oil Corporation (NOC) told Reuters this week.  Negotiations to recoup the unpaid money will put to the test relations between the OPEC member country and its partners from the period of Muammar Gaddafi’s rule, who are now seeking to rebuild ties with the new administration.  The outcome of the negotiations will also give an indication of the previously all-powerful NOC’s authority in the new Libya as rival bodies vie for control of its economic lifeline.  “We are starting to make arrangements for them to repay this money. It is more than $6 billion. They may be able to give us oil products,” said a senior source in the NOC who declined to give his name.  Libyan officials have shown a willingness to honor previous production agreements but with oil now trickling onto international markets, it remains to be seen if old contracts will stand in the trading arena.  Billions of dollars in oil payments were blocked in March when the United Nations introduced sanctions on the NOC after Gaddafi launched a violent crackdown on protesters.  The NOC source said the list of debtors included U.S. oil majors ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp, British major BP, Austrian energy group OMV, trading firm Vitol and Italian oil firms Eni and Saras.  Exxon said on Wednesday it will settle any outstanding debts with Libya.  While some firms took early action and stopped dealing with the NOC as early as February or March, others made the most of what was effectively free oil by taking advantage of NOC payments terms that typically allow a 30-day window for money transfers, trading sources said.  The uncertainty of the political situation earlier this year, when violent clashes were raging, made it unclear if or when they would have to pay the money back to Libya.  Reuters calculations showed that Libyan oil exports for March alone were worth a nominal $4.5 billion, based on the price of benchmark Brent crude, indicating that the NOC figure is likely to be a realistic estimate of lost revenues.  Saras, Eni, Vitol and OMV declined to comment.  BP and Exxon said they have complied with all international sanctions while Conoco was not available for comment.  Industry sources with knowledge of the matter said they expected the money would be paid once better ties have been established with the new Libyan authorities.  Two oil traders working for firms listed above confirmed that money was owed to the NOC and both said their companies planned to repay it.  “There is no benefit for us dragging our heels and we already have the money in a segregated account with interest but maybe other players won’t be as prepared,” one of the traders said.  Any big, unexpected pay-out could hit trading profits in the fourth quarter at a time when falling oil prices and uncertainty about economic growth are already creating a challenging trading environment.  One sticking point for the negotiations between the cash-strapped Libyan authorities and international firms could be interest payments. A Libyan oil industry source said that no agreement has yet been reached on this point.  Oil industry sources said that any attempt by companies to stall payments, or refuse to pay interest on payments, would damage future relations with the NOC and commercial prospects in the post-Gaddafi era.  “If people are scrambling to get in their good books, it wouldn’t make sense for them to play games,” the trader said.  Libya also owes money to some oil firms for fuel imports delivered to rebels this summer. Benghazi-based oil firm Agoco has promised to give half its early crude oil production to trading firm Vitol as repayment for a $1 billion fuel debt.  NOC’s efforts to recoup the unpaid money will be one of its first major tasks as it seeks to assert authority.  Headed by oil industry veteran Nouri Berouin, it was effectively paralyzed for months because of the sanctions, and had to delegate power to its Benghazi-based subsidiary Agoco in order for marketing to continue.  The U.N. voted to ease sanctions in mid-September and Libyan trade is beginning to pick up with even U.S. oil firms now starting to trade Libyan oil.  The NOC plans to resume marketing within the next month, although some subsidiaries have expressed resistance to the idea of an all-powerful NOC.[ID:nL5E7L43OW]  The future division of responsibilities between the NOC and the oil and finance ministry, headed by Ali Tarhouni, is unclear. Earlier plans to form a separate oil ministry for shaping policy appear to be floundering.  The head of the interim National Transitional Council said on Monday that oil issues “will return to the national oil authority when it becomes active in a period less than a week,” in what appeared to be a reference to the NOC.

He said output was shut early on Thursday to conduct a test of the emergency shutdown production system. Soon after the test was completed, staff discovered that one employee was missing and launched a search for him. 	   The man is a 48-year-old Norwegian citizen who works for a contracting firm.  	   The company previously said production was shut due to maintenance at two risers. 	   The man is still missing and the search has been expanded to the sea, with helicopters and ships involved. His relatives have been warned, Statoil said.	   “After we confirmed that we had declared a person missing ... we decided not to restart output again,” said the Statoil spokesman.	   Visund is expected to produce some 22,000 barrels of oil per day and 940 million standard cubic metres of gas per year in 2011, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.

The deal, which closed Sept. 26, gives ConocoPhillips full ownership of the LNG plant in Kenai, Alaska, said ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Natalie Lowman. The 42-year-old Kenai plant, which has been exporting mostly to Tokyo Gas and Tokyo Electric , is still scheduled for mothballing later this year, Lowman said. “It’s doing a final cargo in the next month,” she said. “Then, at that point, we’re doing what we said we were going to do.” The shutdown will preserve the plant, but it may not be a permanent closure, Lowman said. “We believe the plant does have options.” One potential plan is to convert the plant into an import facility to process LNG for local markets, Lowman said. “Or we could resume operations to export LNG some time next year.” Originally, ConocoPhillips and Marathon had planned to shut down the facility last spring. But energy supply problems resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March extended the short-term need for LNG exports from the Kenai facility.",10132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-lng/conocophillips-buys-marathon-share-in-lng-plant-idUSN1E79C1JF20111013

334,COP,UPDATE 1-China's CNOOC hit by fresh oil leak in northern waters,"BEIJING, Oct 15 (Reuters) - China’s biggest offshore oil producer, CNOOC Ltd , has been hit by another oil leak in north Chinese waters, state media reported on Saturday, following a June spill at a field run with ConocoPhillips that sparked an official uproar. The latest spill broke out near the Jingzhou 9-3 field operated by a subsidiary of CNOOC in the Liaodong Bay off northeast China, Xinhua news agency reported. CNOOC Ltd said on its website (www.cnoocltd.com) that “the oil spill was caused by the leak from a subsea connecting pipeline damaged by a work vessel during its operations.” The company said it had taken “effective measures to clean up the oil sheen as well as sent divers to survey the damaged subsea pipeline and seal the leaking source”. Production would be cut by about 1,600 barrels per day because of the shutdown, said CNOOC. Maritime administrators also sent a ship to the area after a belt of oil floated to the surface near a platform on the field on Friday, said Xinhua. It did not describe the scale of the spill and said the ship was still investigating. Liaodong Bay is linked to the bigger Bohai Bay, where CNOOC and its U.S. partner ConocoPhillips have been struggling with a spill in June that triggered government demands for tougher regulation of offshore oil operations.

343,COP,RPT-UPDATE 2-Petrovietnam bids for ConocoPhillips' Vietnam assets,"* Petrovietnam makes formal move for stakes in disputed water * Barclays Capital is adviser of deal * TNK Vietnam gets investment license, LUKOIL to drill 3 wells early 2012 HANOI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - State oil and gas group Petrovietnam has bid for $1.5 billion of ConocoPhillips  oil assets in the South China Sea, a senior Petrovietnam official said, its first formal move for the stakes in the disputed waters. The Hanoi-based group plans to do its utmost to acquire the assets, Nguyen Tien Dung, Petrovietnam’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer, told Reuters on Monday. “The investment is in our country, so we are determined, with our largest possible efforts, to buy,” Dung said. Barclays Capital is the adviser for the bid, a source with knowledge of the deal said. ConocoPhillips owns a 23.25 percent stake in a complex of four fields in block 15-1. The three oilfields and one gas field include the Su Tu Den and Su Tu Vang oilfields and two other fields that have not begun operations, according to Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC), one of the owners of the block. Petrovietnam already owns half of block 15-1. KNOC has 14.2 percent, South Korea’s SK Corp 9 percent and Monaco’s Geopetrol 3.5 percent. A KNOC official said last week that the South Korean state-run firm had made no decision yet on whether or not to consider buying ConocoPhillips’ stake and will decide based on the price made by the successful bidder. The U.S. company also owns 36 percent of the Rang Dong oilfield in block 15-2 in the Cuu Long basin and 16.3 percent in the Nam Con Son gas pipeline project. In July, Petrovietnam’s CEO said the company may buy the ConocoPhillips oil and gas interests in the South China Sea to help protect Hanoi’s territorial claims, adding that the U.S. energy firm may sell the assets as it was scaling back its presence, possibly as part of a restructuring. Energy assets are a touchy subject in the disputed waters. U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp recently said it had discovered hydrocarbons in August off central Vietnam, in an area also claimed by China. China on Monday warned foreign energy firms against exploration in the disputed South China Sea. Dung said that Russian oil and gas firms are also expanding their presence in the Southeast Asia country, with three operating firms — Gazprom , Zarubezhneft and LUKOIL  — while TNK-BP is now in the process of taking over assets newly acquired from its shareholder BP Plc . “This is a good trend,” he added. British-Russian joint venture TNK-BP will make its official presence in Vietnam within a few weeks, said Dung. TNK-BP said on Oct. 19 its subsidiary, TNK Vietnam, had received the investment license from Vietnam’s Ministry of Investment and Trade to operate offshore gas Block 06.1, part of the Nam Con Son Integrated Gas to Power Project. “Our company sees Vietnam as a very prospective market and will continue to review opportunities for deepening our presence in the country,” Maxim Barsky, the deputy chief executive of TNK-BP who will leave his post on Nov. 1 after overseeing its foreign expansion campaign, said in the statement. Russia’s third-largest oil company said it had acquired from BP a 35 percent stake in the offshore gas and condensate production Block 06.1, which contains the Lan Tay and Lan Do gas condensate fields. Russia’s No.2 crude producer LUKOIL recently said it had acquired the Hanoi Trough 02 block offshore the northern city of Hai Phong from Quad Energy. The firm would drill three wells by early next year and 12 locations could have promising oil deposits, Aleksander Nekhaev, Director of Lukoil Overseas Vietnam, said in Hanoi. Gazprom, the world’s largest natural gas company, has established a joint venture with Petrovietnam — Vietgazprom — which now explores five fields offshore Vietnam, the joint venture said on its website (www.vgp.zargaz.ru). Vietsovpetro, a joint venture between Russian state-run Zarubezhneft and Petrovietnam, has said it will extend cooperation to 20 more years, though its annual oil production will dip to a steady level of 6.0-6.1 million tonnes from next year, slightly below the expected 2011 output of 6.31 million tonnes (126,719 bpd).",11012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/vietnam-conocophillips/rpt-update-2-petrovietnam-bids-for-conocophillips-vietnam-assets-idUSL4E7M109O20111101

357,COP,UPDATE 2-TNK-BP expands eastern front with Conoco Vietnam bid,"* Petrovietnam already interested in Vietnam gas assets * Dodds may present new upstream opportunities to board * Capex seen up 10 percent next year to fund growth MOSCOW, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Russia’s TNK-BP, developing a gas project in Vietnam acquired from its major shareholder BP, has also bid for ConocoPhillips  assets in the Asian country, TNK-BP’s head of upstream operations Alexander Dodds said on Monday. “We did put a bid in,” Dodds told a news briefing in response to a question. TNK-BP, a 50-50 joint venture between BP and a quartet of Soviet-born businessmen, has already taken over some gas assets in the South China Sea from its British co-owner and expressed its interest in expanding in Vietnam. It has said it will bid for one block of nine blocks on offer by the Vietnamese government in a tender which opens this week. State oil and gas group Petrovietnam has already said it will bid for the ConocoPhillips assets, three oil fields and one gas field which are further north in the South China Sea. Their location at a fair distance from TNK-BP’s Vietnamese base means they are likely to be a low priority for the Russian producer, but the bid offers more evidence that TNK-BP’s expansion drive will not end with the first round of purchases. TNK-BP, which produces about 1.8 million barrels per day of oil equivalent, mostly at declining Soviet-era fields in Western Siberia, is going further afield to boost production to compensate for output losses in that region, which averaged 5 percent last year. It is deploying often-expensive new technology at some of Russia’s oldest fields, and at the same time planning to launch new production in the latter half of the decade in Yamal, an  Arctic peninsula which is Russia’s next energy frontier. The foreign projects are yet another way of hedging declines in Russia. TNK-BP management has board approval to pursue operations in three countries outside the former Soviet Union: Vietnam and Venezuela, where it bought assets from BP as it sold down its portfolio to pay damages for the Macondo disaster; and Brazil, where it bought into an exploration business. Dodds said he may present the company’s board with new upstream opportunities outside its existing asset base. “You never say never,” he said. “If something came to the table that was interesting, it is our responsibility to get the shareholders to look at it. If they want to pursue that is their call.” TNK has also said that it would like to apply some of the skills acquired at foreign projects to improve its operations in Russia, offering Venezuela’s experience with heavy oil as an example to be followed at its Arctic Russkoye field despite differences in climate. For now, greenfields account for one in seven barrels of output, it said in a presentation. Next up is gas from the Rospan field, due to start in 2015, then oil from another Yamal field, Suzun, in 2017. Francis Sommer, vice president for production and technology, said capital spending was likely to rise about 10 percent next year from this year’s estimated $4.6 billion to fund output growth. “Greenfield (spending) comes in big chunks,” he said. “There might be a big spend on Rospan in a certain year.” The government is in the process of re-engineering the tax regime to make upstream investment, particularly in brownfields, more attractive. “The brownfield issue is a challenging one for us,” Dodds said. “There is huge potential left in these fields (but) it will take money to develop.” The company says it can reduce those declines to 2 percent per year, but analysts who recently visited its Samotlor field, one of the world’s largest, said 1 percent seemed possible with use of new technologies and drilling approaches. “If you can change the recovery factor by just a little, it’s actually a large volume of oil,” Sommer said.",12052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/tnkbp-vietnam/update-2-tnk-bp-expands-eastern-front-with-conoco-vietnam-bid-idUSL5E7N524620111205

361,COP,"Shell, Conoco, Repsol increase Alaska oil holdings","* Oil companies win oil lease rights * Bids for state territories top $20.9 million * Bids for federal NPR territories top $3 million. By Yereth Rosen ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell on Wednesday acquired exploration rights to state territory off Alaska’s northern coast, while ConocoPhillips increased holdings on both state and federal lands on the North Slope. Shell, ConocoPhillips and Spanish oil company Repsol, which acquired significant North Slope acreage, were active bidders in a series of state and federal oil lease sales held in Anchorage. Those and other companies and groups submitted over $20.9 million in high bids for state onshore and offshore territory and over $3 million in high bids for federal onshore territory in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Shell won rights to 18 tracts in Harrison Bay, an area north of the federally managed NPR-A. Shell has been working on an ambitious program to drill offshore in federal waters off Alaska’s Arctic coastlines, but the move to state offshore territory is new for the company. Curtis Smith, spokesman for Shell in Alaska, said the company continues to concentrate on its exploration plans in federal waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas but is seeking to diversify its offshore operations. “We like the geology that we see beneath those particular leases,” Smith said. “We’re hopeful that there are synergies between the leases we purchased today and the leases we hold on the federal offshore.” Shell is waiting for government approval to drill up to three exploration wells a year in 2012 and 2013 in federal waters of the Chukchi Sea and up to two a year over the same period in the Beaufort. ConocoPhillips’ successful bids were for tracts near its CD-5 oil field prospect in the NPR-A and for about 30 tracts on state territory on the eastern North Slope, south of BP’s Badami field. The CD-5 prospect, which is expected to supply up to 18,000 barrels a day once commercial production starts, is located on the northeastern edge of the petroleum reserve, near state land. An agreement between federal agencies announced on Monday potentially clears the way for ConocoPhillips to build a road and a bridge linking CD-5 to existing oil field infrastructure on state land, making a pipeline and commercial operations feasible. Repsol acquired several tracts in the central North Slope and tracts on state lands near the border of the federally managed petroleum reserve. State officials said they were happy with the response to the sale results. “Today’s lease sale was an important, positive step that attracted additional investment to the North Slope,” Gov. Sean Parnell said in a statement. Federal officials also said the industry showed renewed enthusiasm for exploring the petroleum reserve, a vast Indiana-sized land unit on the western North Slope. The likelihood of commercial development in the near future at CD-5 bodes well for future development, they said. “As industry begins to build infrastructure and explore and develop oil and gas in this area of the North Slope of Alaska, we expect to harness the energy and economic benefits of the NPR-A for our nation,” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement. “In support of the President’s energy priorities, this lease sale in the NPR-A is an important part of our efforts to develop domestic resources on public lands safely and responsibly,” he said. Wednesday’s NPR-A lease sale was held in accordance with a directive issued last spring by President Obama. He ordered that lease sales in the federal unit be held annually.

ConocoPhillips spokesman Stig Kvendseth said it was too soon to estimate the amount of natural gas encountered. “We need further evaluation of the wells before we can calculate the size of the discovery,” he said. ConocoPhillips is the operator of the production licence, number 301C, with a 22-percent ownership interest. Its partners are OMV with 30 percent, DONG with 28 percent and Talisman with 20 percent. After finding the gas column in Jurassic rocks ConocoPhillips drilled a sidetrack well that found additional gas, but with “poorer reservoir quality than expected,” the directorate said. Although the water depth was only 72 metres, both wells were drilled under technically challenging high-temperature, high-pressure subsea conditions. “It’s hard to say at this point, but I don’t think it’s very big,” said oil analyst Trond Omdal of Arctic Securities.",12122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/conoco-norway/update-1-conocophillips-makes-n-sea-gas-find-tests-needed-idUSL6E7NC0TA20111212

366,COP,"ConocoPhillips to resume LNG exports from Kenai, Alaska plant","ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 16 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips  will restart exports from its liquefied natural gas plant in Kenai, Alaska, a 42-year-old facility that had been slated for shutdown, a company spokeswoman said late on Thursday. ConocoPhillips has acquired new contracts for natural gas supplies from Cook Inlet producers, including Buccaneer Energy Ltd., said company spokeswoman Natalie Lowman. “We’ve found enough gas supply to be able to resume exports,” Lowman said. ConocoPhillips has also leased an LNG tanker to restart the plant’s decades-long export business with Asian markets, she added. Exports are expected to resume in the second half of 2012, Lowman said. As of yet, there are no plans to seek an extension for the license that allows ConocoPhillips to export LNG until 2013, she added. Lowman declined to identify the prospective Asian LNG customers, saying ConocoPhillips was still working on contracts. ConocoPhillips acquired full ownership of the plant in September when it bought Marathon Energy’s 30 percent share in the facility. The plant opened in 1969 and, in its early years, supplied all the LNG used by Tokyo Gas and Tokyo Electric. Over time, availability of Cook Inlet natural gas diminished and the Japanese utilities acquired alternative sources of LNG, leaving the Kenai plant with short supplies and little customer demand. The Kenai plant was scheduled to be mothballed last spring. But energy shortages caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami spurred a temporary demand in Asia for extra deliveries, and the plant continued exports through November, when shutdown procedures started. In a statement, Australia-based Buccaneer said its supply contract with ConocoPhillips will commence this month, when production at its Kenai Loop property is expected to begin.",12162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/conocophillips-lng/conocophillips-to-resume-lng-exports-from-kenai-alaska-plant-idUSL3E7NG26820111216
367,COP,ConocoPhillips OK'd to drill in petroleum reserve,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips on Monday won a key permit that will allow construction of an oil field that is expected to provide the first-ever production from the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on the western North Slope. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it granted a modified wetlands-fill permit that will allow ConocoPhillips to build a road, bridge and above-ground pipeline connecting its CD-5 project with the Alpine oil field on state land just east of the petroleum reserve. The wetlands-fill permit — initially denied to ConocoPhillips nearly two years ago — is the last major government authorization that ConocoPhillips needs to build CD-5, said Natalie Lowman, a company spokeswoman in Alaska. Construction could start in 2014 and production could start in 2015, assuming that the project gets final approval and funding from corporate leaders at ConocoPhillips and its partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Lowman said.

369,COP,CNOOC to set up environmental fund after oil spill,"HONG KONG, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China’s top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd said on Friday that its parent plans to set up an environmental protection fund following a recent oil spill at the listed company’s Penglai 19-3 oilfield operated by partner ConocoPhillips. “The oil spill incident has reminded us that safety and environmental protection risks always exist,” CNOOC Ltd’s newly appointed Chief Executive Li Fanrong said in a statement. The statement said CNOOC’s board had approved a plan to contribute 500 million yuan as initial capital for the CNOOC Marine Environmental and Ecological Protection Public Welfare Foundation. The plan has yet to be endorsed by the central government, it added. CNOOC has said production in the third quarter fell 9.1 percent year on year to 80.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, mainly due to halted production at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield in Bohai Bay. CNOOC had been losing 22,000 bpd since July 13 when operations at two platforms at Penglai 19-3 were halted. A further 40,000 bpd was lost after China’s State Oceanic Administration ordered the suspension of all operations in the field, CNOOC executives have said. The State Oceanic Administration said earlier this month that the spill, which began in June, had polluted 6,200 square km of waters, describing it as a major accident caused by negligence. ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the 168,000 barrel-per-day oilfield and acts as operator, while CNOOC Ltd has a 51 percent stake.",12302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/cnooc-fund/cnooc-to-set-up-environmental-fund-after-oil-spill-idUSL3E7NU0P620111230
370,COP,ConocoPhillips seeks partner for oil sands assets,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is seeking a buyer for 50 percent of a large portion of its Canadian oil sands holdings, assets that could eventually produce more than half a million barrels a day, the U.S. oil major said on Monday. ConocoPhillips has retained Scotia Waterous to run the offering of a share in six Alberta properties that currently produce 12,000 barrels a day from an estimated 30 billion barrels of bitumen in place. It is doing so as interest in Canadian energy assets booms, especially from Asian buyers. Tim Bryant, vice-president of ConocoPhillips’ Canadian division, declined to say how much the company wants for the holdings, other than to say it would be in the billions of dollars rather than millions. “It’s substantial. These are world-class trophy assets,” he said. The one producing project in the package is Surmont, run in a joint venture with France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA). Located south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the steam-driven development pumps about 25,000 barrels a day. The partners are working to boost that to 136,000 bpd, starting in 2015. The other properties are the Thornbury, Clyden, Saleski, Crow Lake, McMillan Lake assets. The land totals 715,000 acres. It is difficult to put a potential value on a deal with the information currently available, CIBC World Markets analyst Andrew Potter said. “They give a bitumen-in-place number, but you have no idea how that’s attributed by different property,” Potter said. The Houston-based company, in the process of splitting its worldwide production and refining assets into separate companies, is offering the assets at a time when investments in oil sands are piling up, especially from Chinese and other Asian companies. In the latest deal two weeks ago, PetroChina (601857.SS) agreed to buy out its partner in a newly approved tar sands development for C$680 million ($674 million). Chinese enterprises have spent nearly $5.5 billion on Canadian energy assets in the past six months. ConocoPhillips is no stranger to such dealmaking, having sold its interest in the Syncrude Canada oil sands mining venture to Sinopec (600028.SS) for $4.7 billion in 2010. “I think you can presume that Asian buyers will be looking at it. There might also be some good opportunities for other operators to tuck in around some existing properties,” Potter said. The company also has a major oil sands and oil refining joint venture with Calgary-based Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO), under which the pair are developing the Foster Creek and Christina Lake projects. The sale of the other interests would be part of a three-year, $20 billion asset disposition the company is in the midst of, Bryant said. “And it’s common to go out and seek partners to try to move some of these bigger projects, he said.

377,COP,TEXT-S&P; affirms ConocoPhillips,"— U.S.-based ConocoPhillips is pursuing the spin-off of its refining and marketing, midstream, and petrochemicals businesses. — Based on our current assessment, we view the transaction as effectively neutral from a credit perspective. — We are affirming the ratings on ConocoPhillips and all related entities, and removing them from CreditWatch. — The stable outlook reflects the company’s significant ability to withstand periods of difficult market conditions, without jeopardizing the rating. Feb 7 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that it affirmed its ratings on ConocoPhillips, including its ‘A’ corporate credit rating and its ratings on all related entities (see list below). We removed these ratings from CreditWatch, where we had placed them with negative implications on July 14, 2011, following the company’s announcement of the planned spin-off of its downstream/midstream businesses. The rating outlook is now stable. “ConocoPhillips is planning to spin off a newly-formed company, called Phillips 66, through a special dividend to ConocoPhillips shareholders, in a transaction management expects will be completed during the second quarter of this year,” said Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Scott Sprinzen. He commented, “We now see little likelihood that the transaction will not be completed as planned.” Phillips 66 is to comprise ConocoPhillips’ refining and marketing, midstream, and chemicals businesses, leaving ConocoPhillips its well-positioned oil and gas exploration and production (E&P;) business. Based on our current assessment, we view the spin-off as effectively a neutral development from a credit perspective. Going forward, ConocoPhillips will have significantly less business diversity than previously exhibited, given that the company will lack oil refining and marketing, midstream, and chemicals operations—operations that have made substantial earnings and cash flow contributions during certain periods in the past. In addition, we view the spin-off transaction as adverse from the perspective of financial flexibility, given the value of the distribution to ConocoPhillips shareholders: ConocoPhillips’ net investment in Phillips 66 was $26 billion as of Sept. 30, 2011 (as disclosed in Phillips 66’s Form 10 dated Nov. 14, 2011). With its ‘A’ corporate credit rating, CononcoPhillips is rated at the highest level of any independent E&P; company. Given the extent of industry risk faced, we don’t currently foresee an upgrade within the next two years, notwithstanding ConocoPhillips’ strong business risk position. On the other hand, we believe ConocoPhillips has significant resilience in withstanding periods of difficult market conditions, without jeopardizing the rating. In this regard, though, maintaining funds from operations to total adjusted debt of at least 40% during trough periods is an important assumption in the rating.",2072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA959820120207

396,COP,"Insight: Coke, Conoco, Icahn among big fish on MF Global hook","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Oil major ConocoPhillips, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, Coca Cola and giant energy trader Mercuria are among a crop of previously unnamed, high-profile former clients of bankrupt futures brokerage MF Global, an examination of claims filed in the case shows. Fifty of MF Global’s bigger former customers — including large hedge funds, multinational powerhouses, and other major traders — had about $1.2 billion lodged with MF Global when it collapsed, according to a Reuters analysis of about 10,000 of the nearly 28,000 claims in the case. Together these top 50 accounted for more than a fifth of the broker’s total customer funds. The claims shed new light on what was once one of the world’s most active commodity brokerages, showing it attracted big-ticket clients along with the farmers, ranchers and retail investors who have raised the loudest cry over its collapse. Five directors of exchange operator CME Group have also filed claims, an indication of how the company’s bankruptcy caught even well-informed investors by surprise. “We had nothing against MF Global. We thought they were a good firm,” said Icahn, who has a claim but is not among the former clients baying for blood. Like most traders with commodity accounts at MF Global, Icahn has gotten about 72 percent of his money back. Even if he never sees the rest of those funds, Icahn said he will have made $15 million or so during the year the account was open. His account at MF Global backed a single options trader, a bit player in the scheme of Icahn’s $9 billion fund. It held $85 million on the broker’s final day of business, October 31. Marathon Petroleum Corp, Nestle SA, General Mills Inc, Anheuser-Busch Inbev, energy giant Tesoro Corp and Spam-maker Hormel Foods Corp are among the companies still waiting on the return of at least $333 million, based on the analysis, which may not capture all of MF Global’s biggest former customers. A spokesman for the trustee declined to identify the top MF Global claims, citing privacy concerns. Investors were attracted to MF Global, run by former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine, for its relatively low trading fees, name recognition and specialization in commodities trading. Nestle used its accounts in futures transactions for a mix of commodities, said Prashant Kulkarni, a risk management lead for the company. The chocolate maker has received back about 72 percent of the nearly $9.2 million in its accounts, he said. Options trader Billy Hunt moved his money to MF Global after Goldman Sachs, his broker of many years, told him it would no longer back individual traders like him. He selected MF Global because he was a former client of its predecessor, Refco. Hunt kept a large balance - $26 million when MF Global went under - in his accounts to back his specialized, high-margin trades. He shifted money to MF Global just two months before it collapsed and has yet to recover about $7.9 million. Other big traders were linked to MF Global because they worked with other brokerages that cleared trades through the firm. Daniel Bowman, a cattle trader in Chicago, saw his accounts transferred to MF Global when it bought his longtime brokerage Dowd Wescott. He had his life savings at MF Global, including a $5 million Treasury bill and $2.5 million in cash, he said. He is still waiting for $1.5 million back. “I’m at retirement age and he’s got all my money,” said Bowman, 74, referring to Corzine. It was hard for even big traders to escape MF Global in the days before it imploded. Many became nervous after the broker disclosed it had made risky bets on European sovereign debt. Magic Capital, a $25 million hedge fund that did its futures trading and kept virtually all its capital at MF Global, decided three days before the bankruptcy to pull its money out, said Jennifer Yu, a back-office manager at the Rockville, Maryland-based firm. But the transfer request did not go through in time. Now Magic is 28 percent smaller, due to the amount the bankruptcy trustee has held back. Segregated accounts were supposed to keep customer funds safe, even if the broker failed. MF Global’s European exposure also spooked Highridge Futures Fund, a hedge fund that had $50 million in accounts. Highridge general partner Michael Recine said he also tried to empty the accounts three days before MF Global collapsed but “for some reason my bank couldn’t handle the whole transfer.” DRW Holdings, one of Chicago’s biggest trading firms, is one firm that closed its accounts early enough. It had about $5 million at MF Global when the broker disclosed on October 25 that it had put a $6.3 billion bet on European sovereign debt. DRW immediately withdrew all but about $9,500 from its MF Global account. DRW chief Don Wilson says such debacles could be prevented through more transparency about where and how brokers invest their customers’ money. “If we had been aware of the risks they were taking ... we would have pulled our money much sooner,” he said. Other firms pulled money from MF Global before the bankruptcy, as well. MF Global had $8.8 billion in customer funds at the end of July and only $7.2 billion by the end of August, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows. By its collapse, the amount was $5.5 billion, according to CME Group. Stricter rules — including holding CEOs accountable for safekeeping of segregated funds — and stricter punishments, including potential criminal sanctions, are among proposals under discussion by industry groups including the National Futures Association and the Commodity Customers Coalition, which represents former MF Global clients. Industry insiders say it is not unexpected that MF Global — which was among the top 10 U.S. futures brokers — would have large hedgers as clients. Such companies were generally equipped to handle the collapse better than smaller investors. To these titans, the money still tied up at the failed brokerage is fairly inconsequential. Unlike the smaller players who made up the majority of MF Global’s 30,000 customers, most of the big firms had accounts at several brokers and giant trading desks. ConocoPhillips, the world’s No. 5 refiner which earned $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, had accounts valued at $310 million with MF Global on October 31, including $195 million in letters of credit to guarantee its trades. ConocoPhillips spokesman Aftab Ahmed said the bankruptcy “did not impact any of our underlying operations.” He declined to say how much of that balance had been returned to ConocoPhillips. Global trading company ITOCHU International also said the impact on business operations was minimal. Yet, the collapse “changed our view that our accounts are fully secured,” in-house counsel Keisuke Nomura said. “We need to pay more attention to the credibility of the companies like MF Global,” he said. Most large investors have kept their exposure to MF Global under wraps, while farmers, ranchers and individual traders have sounded off to the media, the trustee and Congress over the $1.6 billion in customer money still missing. Yet these larger customers are critical to the futures industry, and to exchanges like CME Group Inc and IntercontinentalExchange Inc, which could suffer if big-name investors take their business off the exchanges to over-the-counter deals. In contrast, farmers and ranchers have few options besides the regulated markets to hedge their products. CME and ICE have been clearing more over-the-counter contracts, but their main futures business generates higher margins. “What the exchanges care about is volume,” said Craig Pirrong, a professor at University of Houston. “If one or two of these big guys move to the over-the-counter markets or cuts down trading substantially, it could be a big deal.” At a recent roundtable convened by the CFTC, players such as bond fund giant Pimco, mutual fund company Vanguard and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System made clear that their main concern was that their money would be as protected in the futures markets as it is in the over-the-counter markets. CME has been working to hasten the return of, and protect, all customer funds, a spokeswoman said. Former MF Global clients Coca Cola Co, Hormel, General Mills , Anheuser Busch, Tesoro and Marathon Petroleum declined to comment for this story or did not return calls for comment. One measure of how MF Global’s bankruptcy caught even savvy investors by surprise is the five CME Group directors who filed claims. Two of them — former vice chairman Charles Carey and director Joseph Niciforo — are suing the broker. Jack Sandner, a former CME chairman, and director Robert Corvino also had small claims, while director David Wescott had $2.1 million in an MF Global account. All declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. Glenn Pankau, whose brother Ron is on the CME board, had banked some $650,000 at his MF Global account, much more than the $50,000 he needed to secure his personal trades. “I was always told it was the safest place my money could be,” Pankau said. On the Friday before the bankruptcy, Glenn Pankau had a conversation with Wescott, a CME director and MF Global officer. Wescott told Pankau he should take his money out of MF Global if he was uncomfortable. Pankau tried, but the check bounced. To date Pankau has retrieved only 66 percent of his money from MF Global. Wescott has received none. Now, Pankau keeps only enough money at his new broker to back his trades. “I am not going to be victimized again,” he said.

400,COP,UPDATE 1-Pennsylvania sees bigger toll from refinery closings -USW,"* Regional impact from closing refineries greater than thought * Leaked state report increases job and revenue loss estimates By Janet McGurty NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - The powerful steel workers’ union made a new push on Tuesday to forestall closure of the U.S. Northeast’s biggest refinery, saying the region’s economy has suffered more from refinery closings than experts had thought. In the latest salvo of an increasingly politicized debate around Sunoco and ConocoPhillips’ moves to sell or close struggling plants, the United Steelworkers Union (USW) said an unpublished January study by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry showed 20 percent more jobs would be lost. The USW cited a Delaware County Daily Times report on Sunday citing a study that showed 36,618 jobs were in jeopardy because of the closures of the ConocoPhillips Trainer, Pa., and Sunoco Marcus Hook, Pa., refineries and the soon-to-be-closed Sunoco Philadelphia refinery, the region’s largest. The report, which was published in January, has not been released to the public yet, a spokeswoman for the department said.  The USW represents 1,200 of the 2,200 workers in the refineries. It is likely to stoke debate about the economic impact of closures that may claim around 50 percent of the region’s refining capacity, not only reducing jobs but also making the populous U.S. Northeast more dependent on imported fuel. “This situation is worse than we thought,” said Jim Savage, president of USW Local 10-1 of the Philadelphia refinery. “Other studies told us that for every direct refinery job lost, another eight to 10 workers lose their indirect jobs. These job figures make it more crucial than ever that ConocoPhillips and Sunoco put more effort into finding buyers for these refineries.” All three of the East Coast refineries run costly light, sweet crude imported from overseas, and have struggled to compete with more efficient overseas plants or U.S. Midwest refiners who are soaking up discount landlocked crude. “Combine these alarming statistics with the fuel supply shortages and price hikes that are anticipated and we have a critical situation in the Northeast,” said USW Local 10-234 President Denis Stephano of Trainer. “The time is now for the government to act. Our country can’t afford these shutdowns.” Original estimates put total job losses at about 30,000 in January, based on the assumption that about 2,500 jobs would be gone with the refinery closures. The new study estimates that 18.3 jobs will be lost for each refinery job lost and that the total economic loss for the affected communities will be more than $566 million in state and local taxes. Pennsylvania’s Center for Workforce Information & Analysis also published re-employment assessment reports that said 39 percent of the ConocoPhillips workforce, 156 workers, would have a fair to difficult time getting a new job. Sunoco has already idled its 178,000 bpd refinery in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania and plans to shut down its 335,000 bpd refinery in Philadelphia if a buyer can’t be found. Another area refinery, ConocoPhillips has also ceased making products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  All three refineries are with in a 12 mile radius and account for about 50 percent of Northeast refinery  capacity. The majority of workers at ConocoPhillips’ 185,000 bpd Trainer refinery and Sunoco’s 178,000 bpd Marcus Hook refinery have already been let go. In a report released in late February, the U.S. government said price spikes in gasoline and diesel are expected if Sunoco closes the 335,000 Philadelphia refinery this summer as supplies tighten, pushing up prices.",3132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/pennsylvania-economy-refineries/update-1-pennsylvania-sees-bigger-toll-from-refinery-closings-usw-idUSL2E8EDHH920120313

406,COP,Conoco has multiple bids for Trainer refinery-sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has at least five bids for its 185,000 barrel per day Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery, according to sources familiar with the sales process on Thursday. “There is more than one bid to operate the plant as a refinery,” said one source. The other bids are to turn the refinery into a terminal to store gasoline and diesel to serve the U.S. Northeast, where refinery closures have cut operable capacity by over 25 percent so far. The Trainer refinery was idled at the end of September after the company decided to put it up for sale. A ConocoPhillips spokesman was unable to comment on the sales process other than to say that the company had recent interest from potential buyers. On Wednesday, ConocoPhillips said it was extending the sales deadline by two months to the end of May because of new potential sales interest. The news of renewed interest to buy the plant and run it as a refinery is good news for the region, where three refineries have closed by the end of 2011. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy, cut the baseline for calculating the region’s operable refining capacity by 430,000 bpd to about 1.2 million bpd to reflect the refinery closures. Most Northeastern refineries are designed to run only light, sweet crude oil imported from Europe and Africa, and priced at a premium to other crude oils which cuts profit margins, already down on slowing gasoline demand. Hardest hit by the closures is the Philadelphia region, where three refineries in a 12-mile (19-km) radius are closed or slated for closure. This includes the Trainer plant and neighboring Marcus Hook plant, a 178,000 bpd refinery owned by Sunoco Inc (SUN.N) which closed at the end of 2011. Sunoco also put its 335,000 bpd Philadelphia refinery up for sale. The company has said it has buying interest but said if a deal doesn’t come through it will close the plant, the longest continuously operating refinery in the nation, by July 2012. United Refining, a privately held refining company which operates a 65,000 bpd refinery in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania, has expressed interest in the facility. Sunoco is looking to exit the refining business where it has been losing money, the company said. If the plant closes, refinery closures in the U.S. Northeast will reach 50 percent, according to EIA calculations, leaving the area vulnerable to price spikes and supply disruptions. Also out of the EIA calculation of base operable refinery capacity is the 64,000 bpd Yorktown, Virginia refinery. That refinery was sold by Western Refining WNR.N to Plains All American (PAA.N) and will be used as a storage terminal for gasoline and diesel.

410,COP,"UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips, India's ONGC in pact for shale gas exploration","* ONGC, ConocoPhillips may jointly bid for overseas shale gas assets * India seen launching first shale gas licensing round by end-2013 MUMBAI, March 30 (Reuters) - India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp and U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips  signed a pact on Friday to explore and develop shale gas assets and look for opportunities in deepwater exploration. The agreement is for sharing technical expertise on shale gas explorations, but ONGC and ConocoPhillips could also jointly bid for shale gas assets overseas, the leading Indian oil and gas producer’s chairman Sudhir Vasudeva told reporters. India may launch the first shale gas licensing round by the end of next year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said last week, after the government pushed back plans to unveil a policy on exploration of unconventional gas resources trapped in rocks. “India has a lot of potential in shale gas. We want to exploit that with the technical expertise of ConocoPhillips,” ONGC’s Vasudeva said, adding the two companies will also explore opportunities in the U.S. and other countries. ONGC does not see any financial benefit from the agreement in the near future, he said. A lack of a policy framework and resource estimates have led to Indian companies turning their focus to shale gas assets overseas. Another Indian oil and gas producer, Oil India Ltd  is in talks with U.S.-based companies, including ConocoPhillips, to buy stake in shale gas assets in the U.S, the Indian state-run company’s finance chief said in January. Global energy majors have also been pushing to grab a slice of India’s oil and gas reserves and gain exposure to surging demand in Asia’s third-largest economy. BP paid $7.2 billion last year to acquire 30 percent stake in 23 oil and gas blocks owned by India’s Reliance Industries. UK-listed miner Vedanta Resources has also bought a controlling stake in explorer Cairn India in a deal valued around $6 billion. India, the world’s fourth-largest oil importer, meets about 80 percent of its crude needs through overseas purchases. It is scouting for oil and gas assets abroad to meet demand in a fast-growing economy, and to feed its expanding refining capacity. ONGC, which has been investing heavily to maintain output from its old fields, has said it aims to raise its crude oil production by 15 percent to 28 million tonnes, or 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), by March 2014.",3302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ongc-conocophillips/update-1-conocophillips-indias-ongc-in-pact-for-shale-gas-exploration-idUSL3E8EU6OS20120330

413,COP,Conoco pays Chinese fishermen for oil spill-report,"BEIJING, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant ConocoPhillips and CNOOC Ltd have agreed to jointly pay 305 million yuan ($48 million) in compensation to Chinese fishermen and restore the maritime environment in the Bohai Bay area after a major oil spill there last year, state media reported on Sunday. ConocoPhillips and China’s top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC reached a preliminary agreement to pay the compensation through the Qinhuangdao city government in the northern province of Hebei, state-owned China National Radio said. The oil spill at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, China’s biggest offshore oil field, which started in June 2011, has resulted in the release of about 700 barrels of oil, ConocoPhillips has said. The spill polluted more than 840 square kilometres of water, according to the State Oceanic Administration. ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the oilfield and acts as the operator, while the state-owned CNOOC has a 51 percent stake. ConocoPhillips and CNOOC reached a settlement with the Chinese government in January to pay 1 billion yuan ($158.78 million) as compensation, and also to designate 100 million yuan ($15.88 million) of its previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources in the region.

A senior energy official said on Sunday the U.S. company sought exploration rights in six new deep-water gas blocks in the Bay after a tribunal ruled last month in favor of Bangladesh in a decades-old maritime border dispute with Myanmar. “The U.S. firm has expressed its willingness to get more blocks to explore oil and gas in the deep sea,” said Muhammad Hussain Monsur, chairman of the state-run Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation known as Petrobangla. ConocoPhillips made no comment. ConocoPhillips, which was awarded two deep-sea blocks by Bangladesh four years ago to explore oil and gas, has already completed seismic surveys in those blocks and is hoping to proceed with exploration work soon. Neighboring Myanmar had previously protested against Bangladesh awarding the offshore blocks to explore gas and oil, claiming they overlapped Yangon’s territorial waters. “ConocoPhillips is now able to operate within the full area of DS-08-11 block as the maritime boundary dispute with Myanmar has been ended,” Monsur said.

That production growth “will take us to over 1.8 million barrels per day by 2016,” said Ryan Lance, who will head the spinoff company Phillips 66 but now leads international exploration and production for the integrated oil major. ConocoPhillips expects 2012 output of the spinoff to be 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. ConocoPhillips will spin off its refining, marketing and transportation arm, Phillips 66, at the end of April to create separate pure-play upstream and downstream companies. Lance was named in October to run the new independent producer. Lance told analysts that 26 percent of the company’s North American production in 2016 will come from liquids-rich U.S. shale opportunities in the Eagle Ford and Permian plays in Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota. The company also is seeking to expand its shale positions. “Initially, we just really scratched the surface right now and we’ve got to work on that,” Lance said. “You want to be certainly a first mover or a very, very fast follower, and that’s our intention.” He added that the biggest challenge to growing shale output “starts and ends with infrastructure in the U.S.” to transport and process oil and natural gas liquids Globally the company has 43 billion barrels of resources to convert to “captured” reserves that will “provide a means to deliver growth well beyond 2016,” Lance said.",4162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/conocophillips/update-1-conocophillips-upstream-spinoff-lays-out-growth-plans-idUSL2E8FG9UJ20120416

The company’s Mustang field, site of exploration drilling over the past two seasons, holds 40 million barrels of recoverable oil, Bart Armfield, chief operating officer, told Reuters. The Mustang site is near the edge of the ConocoPhillips  -operated Kuparuk River Unit, which holds the giant Kuparuk field and associated oil fields. Armfield said Mustang oil will feed into the Kuparuk pipeline but will not be a Kuparuk satellite. “We’re actually building our own facilities on it,” he said. “It’s a stand-alone field.” Getting the field to first production will cost about $300 million, while full development will cost $600 million to $800 million, Armfield said. Brooks Range, which has ongoing exploration projects near the ConocoPhillips-operated Alpine field and the BP -operated Prudhoe Bay field, is seeking partners in the Mustang project, he said. Anchorage-based Brooks Range was formed in 2006 as a subsidiary of the Alaska Venture Capital Group. The principals are veterans of North Slope oil operations and include Ken Thompson, a former president of ARCO Alaska Inc.",4202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-alaska/alaska-oil-firm-plans-production-at-new-field-in-2014-idUSL2E8FKFKR20120420

438,COP,UPDATE 3-ConocoPhillips profit lags Wall Street view,"* EPS ex-items $2.02 vs. Wall St view of $2.08 * Shares down 1.9 percent April 23 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, which is splitting into two stand-alone companies at the end of the month, reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hurt by weak refining margins and said its oil and gas output would slip in the second quarter. Net profit for the first quarter was $2.9 billion, or $2.27 per share, compared with $3 billion, or $2.09 per share, a year earlier. Excluding $330 million of net special gains, earnings were $2.02 per share. That fell short of the analysts’ average forecast of $2.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Refining and marketing profit fell to $452 million from $482 million a year earlier, while the oil and gas exploration and production arm’s earnings, excluding one-time items, declined to $2.13 billion from $2.2 billion. Revenues rose slightly to $58.35 billion. The company said its share buybacks, which totaled $1.9 billion in the first quarter, would rise to about $5 billion in the second quarter. Oil and gas production totaled 1.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, down 65,000 from a year earlier, but above the 1.62 million it had said earlier this month that it produced. The decline was due largely to assets sales and the shutdown of a field in Bohai Bay, China, after a leak there, the company said. Production would continue to decline in the current quarter from the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Sheets said in a conference call, largely because of maintenance at 50,000 to 60,000 boepd at projects in Australia, Britain, Alaska and a joint venture in Canada. Weak natural gas prices in the United States also weighed on profits during the quarter, and Sheets said the company was considering shutting in production above the 9,000 boepd it had already halted. Last week, ConocoPhillips said output from its oil and gas production arm would rise 3 percent to 5 percent annually, reaching 1.8 million barrels of oil per day by 2016.

439,COP,ConocoPhillips profit lags Wall Street view,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N), which is splitting into two stand-alone companies at the end of the month, reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hurt by weak refining margins, and its shares fell in premarket trading. Net profit for the first quarter was $2.9 billion, or $2.27 per share, compared with $3 billion, or $2.09 per share, a year earlier. Excluding $330 million on net special gains, earnings were $2.02 per share. That fell short of the analysts’ average forecast of $2.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Refining and marketing profit fell to $452 million from $482 million a year earlier, while the oil and gas exploration and production arm’s earnings, excluding one-time items, declined to $2.13 billion from $2.2 billion. Oil and gas production totaled 1.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, down 65,000 from a year earlier, but above the 1.62 million it had said earlier this month that it produced. The decline was due largely to assets sales and the shutdown of a field in Bohai Bay, China, after a leak there, the company said. Last week, ConocoPhillips said output from its oil and gas production arm would rise 3 percent to 5 percent annually, reaching 1.8 million barrels of oil per day by 2016. The company’s refining and marketing operations will be spun off into a stand-alone business named “Phillips 66.” Shares of ConocoPhillips were down 1.9 percent at $71.50 in premarket trading.

449,COP,"Corrected: Delta buys refinery, becoming first airline to make own fuel","(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) will buy a Pennsylvania oil refinery from ConocoPhillips (COP.N) for $180 million, an audacious bid to save money on fuel costs by investing in a sector shunned by many of the biggest oil firms. Atlanta-based Delta said the first ever purchase of a refinery by an airline would allow it to cut $300 million annually from jet fuel costs, which reached $12 billion last year. It said production at the refinery along with other agreements to exchange refined products for jet fuel would provide 80 percent of its fuel needs in the United States. The deal for the idled 185,000 barrel per day Trainer, Pa., refinery, which has puzzled analysts since it first surfaced last month, will come as some relief to politicians and officials, who had feared thousands of lost jobs and a potential summer spike in fuel costs if the plant was shut permanently. And while the initial investment is no more than a wide-body jet liner, even including an additional $100 million to upgrade the plant to maximize jet fuel production, it will put Delta in the unique position of hoping that the recent rebound in refinery profit margins — normally an indication of added costs for a fuel consumer — doesn’t prove too fleeting. While Delta will remain hostage to fluctuating crude oil costs, the facility would enable it to save on the cost of refining a barrel of jet fuel, which is currently more than $2 billion a year for Delta and has been rising in the wake of U.S. refinery shutdowns, said Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson. “What we’re tackling here today is the jet crack spread, which you cannot hedge in the marketplace effectively,” Anderson told reporters during a phone briefing. “It’s the fastest single growing cost in our book of expense at Delta.” As expected, Delta will effectively outsource all the oil trading requirements for the refinery, an increasingly frequent arrangement for smaller or less-experienced operators. But instead of JP Morgan (JPM.N), which had been initially named as the trader last month, oil major BP (BP.L) will supply crude oil to be refined at the plant under a three-year agreement. And BP and former refinery owner Phillips 66 will get a share of the gasoline, diesel and refined fuel to sell, in exchange for supplying Delta with jet fuel in other locations. It will be a familiar role for BP, which owned the plant in the 1990s before selling it to independent refiner Tosco in 1996 for $59 million, coupled with some additional assets. Tosco later merged with Phillips, which then merged with Conoco. The refinery is expected to resume operations in the third quarter, Delta said, about a year after ConocoPhillips idled the plant as rising imported crude oil costs, a collapse in demand and tough competition from foreign refiners crushed margins. Delta said the deal will include pipelines and other assets that will provide access to the delivery network for jet fuel reaching its Northeast operations, including its increasingly important hubs at New York’s LaGuardia and JFK airports. Fuel costs pushed major U.S. airlines into the red for the first quarter, although oil prices have since eased from March peaks. U.S. crude traded around $105 a barrel on Monday, while Brent crude was about $119 a barrel. The deal offers a reprieve to one of two key refineries that had been earmarked for permanent closure this year unless buyers were found. Delta will pay ConocoPhillips $180 million for the refinery, but will receive $30 million in state government assistance on the deal, reducing its cost to $150 million. “This announcement means the preservation of more than 5,000 jobs at the Trainer facility and in related industries,” Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said in a statement. But at the same time it will raise questions among oil sector analysts about whether the rush to revive one of the half-dozen East Coast facilities that has been shut in recent years may be premature given lingering questions over whether these plants can compete without access to cheap crude. Profit margins in April rose to their highest since 2008, according to a Credit Suisse analysis, and are up more than 60 percent from the average of last year as the planned closure of some 1.5 million bpd, including two refineries in the Caribbean, threatened to cut East Coast capacity to just a third of its peak in 2008. The cuts are deeper when factoring in Europe. But in addition to Trainer, private equity fund The Carlyle Group is in talks to buy the biggest refinery in Philadelphia, potentially pulling another plant back from the brink. The analysts at Credit Suisse say another 2.6 million bpd of refining capacity across the globe must be shut “to hit the “sweet spot” utilization level of 87 percent”. The Delta refinery would be run by a leadership team headed by Jeffrey Warmann, who last ran Murphy Oil USA’s Meraux, Louisiana, refinery. East Coast refineries, among the oldest and least advanced in the country, have been hammered by a series of bad turns: the 2008 recession that cut demand; the rapid injection of ethanol into the U.S. gasoline mix; tougher environmental norms; and the rise of new, more sophisticated plants in India and elsewhere. The final blow for many has been the surge in cheap shale oil production from North Dakota and West Texas, which has handed a bounty of cut-priced crude to Midwest and Gulf rivals who are now running their plants flat-out. Robert Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, New York, said Delta’s statement did not address how it will handle exposure to fluctuations in energy prices or refined product costs or the actual refining process costs. “It’s clearly a very innovative approach, but I think it will be a number of years before we know whether it actually works out,” Mann said. Delta is the world’s second-largest air carrier, behind United Continental Holdings (UAL.N). The airline expects the purchase to add to its earnings in the first year of operations. Delta’s Monroe Energy LLC unit expects to close the purchase in the first half. JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) advised it in the purchase, Delta said. Delta shares were little changed in extended trading after the announcement, which was widely expected.

453,COP,Exclusive: ConocoPhillips looking to exit Nigeria: sources,"LONDON/ABUJA, Nigeria (Reuters) - U.S. oil group ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has hired BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) to help sell its Nigerian assets, including on-shore, off-shore oil and gas fields and a stake in its LNG Brass facility, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. The assets were expected to attract interest from Nigerian companies such as Conoil (CONOIL.LG) and Oando (OANDO.LG) and Asian players including China’s Sinopec (000554.SZ), Indian company ONGC (ONGC.NS), and South Korean firm KNOC, the sources said on Tuesday. They could help ConocoPhillips raise about $2.5 billion and possibly more if they were sold separately, which is the most likely route, according to the sources. ConocoPhillips could not be reached for immediate comment. The on-shore assets are already fully functional and are seen as the most valuable part of the operations, while the early-stage Brass project could prove more difficult to value, one of the sources said. A Nigerian local content act passed in 2010 is likely to complicate any transaction as foreign suitors need to team up with a local indigenous player. The government passed the law, intended to give local firms priority when assets are being sold and in tenders for new projects, and it is likely to push for local ownership of Conoco’s assets. The state-oil firm, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, is the majority shareholder in Conoco’s on-shore and LNG assets and is seen as less likely to be among the interested parties, the sources said. NNPC told Reuters on Tuesday it was not aware that Conoco was exiting the country. Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer, pumping more than 2 million barrels per day. The OPEC member also holds the world’s seventh largest gas reserves, which are largely untapped. Shell’s recent disposals of on-shore oil fields in Nigeria have attracted interest from local firms, often through partnerships with established foreign companies.

458,COP,U.S. ethics group urges probe of natgas output cuts,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Washington-based ethics watchdog has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether energy firms conspired to fix natural gas prices by cutting production this year, an allegation the producers deny. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) said simultaneous production cuts by companies including Chesapeake Energy (CHK.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) in the face of decade-low prices may amount to collusion and violate competition law. “These companies are conspiring to restrict the nation’s supply of natural gas in order to raise its price,” CREW executive director and former federal prosecutor, Melanie Sloan, said in a letter to the DOJ on Tuesday. CREW, a non-profit organization, is funded by foundations such as George Soros’s Open Society, and the Carnegie Foundation, as well as private donors, Sloan said. Record increases in U.S. natural gas production over the past year have swelled inventories and pushed prices to 10-year lows in January and again in April. Natural gas prices are now about 30 percent higher than the April lows in part due to the belief that production has fallen off. The prolific development of shale deposits across the country has transformed the supply outlook but has crimped company profits and made natural gas drilling largely uneconomical. Many producers cut output and slowed new drilling in the first few months of the year, which helped bump prices higher, though they deny any wrongdoing. Chesapeake reduced production by 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in a two-phase cut in January and February, while Conoco said it had cut 0.1 bcfd in January. Conoco’s continued production cuts are expected to be about half that, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Canada’s Encana Corp (ECA.TO) also cut production by 0.25 bcfd in February. U.S. daily production is about 70 bcf. “These allegations are without foundation,” the ConocoPhillips spokeswoman said. “ConocoPhillips complies with all laws, including antitrust laws, and we do not discuss our investment decisions with competitors.” Chesapeake declined to comment and the DOJ was not immediately available to respond. “In order to be per se illegal, there has to be evidence of an actual cartel,” said Mark Cooper, research director at the Consumer Federation of America. “You have to show the collusive conduct.” CREW has no proof that collusion has actually taken place, although an investigation is warranted, Sloan told Reuters. “Clearly we can’t prove it, which is why we asked for a Justice Department investigation. It would be all about the communications between the firms,” she said. Founded in 2003, CREW regularly makes accusations against lawmakers and government officials for alleged ethical or legal transgressions.

464,COP,ConocoPhillips restarts LNG exports from Alaska,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has resumed shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its Alaska plant, an aged facility that was previously targeted for closure, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday. The company sent a shipment of LNG last month to Japan, spokeswoman Natalie Lowman said. ConocoPhillips expects to deliver four or five cargoes of Alaska LNG this year, all of them to Japan, Lowman said. However, she said she could not disclose the customer. The plant, in the Kenai Peninsula community of Nikiski, is the only LNG export facility in the United States. It began operations in 1969, supplying LNG to Tokyo Gas and Tokyo Electric for most of its operating life. In early 2011, ConocoPhillips and partner Marathon announced plans to close the facility, citing failure to strike a shipping contract with the Tokyo utilities and difficulties in securing natural gas supplies from the mature Cook Inlet basin. But new demand for Alaska LNG emerged in the aftermath of Japan’s massive earthquake and tsunami last year that wrecked the Fukushima nuclear power plant. ConocoPhillips in September bought Marathon’s 30 percent share in the plant and now has full ownership of the facility. The LNG plant was closed over the winter. The May shipment was the first since last fall. Plans for the LNG plant beyond 2012 are unclear, Lowman said. “It’s too early to speculate on what might happen after 2012, but all potential uses for the plant depend on local needs, the volume of Cook Inlet natural gas production, or the availability of a natural gas via a pipeline from the North Slope to Southcentral Alaska,” she said in an email.

466,COP,ConocoPhillips restarts LNG exports from Alaska,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has resumed shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its Alaska plant, an aged facility that was previously targeted for closure, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday. The company sent a shipment of LNG last month to Japan, spokeswoman Natalie Lowman said. ConocoPhillips expects to deliver four or five more cargoes of Alaska LNG between now and the end of the year, all of them to Japan, Lowman said. However, she said she could not disclose the customer. The plant, in the Kenai Peninsula community of Nikiski, is the only LNG export facility in the United States. It began operations in 1969, supplying LNG to Tokyo Gas and Tokyo Electric for most of its operating life. In early 2011, ConocoPhillips and partner Marathon announced plans to close the facility, citing failure to strike a shipping contract with the Tokyo utilities and difficulties in securing natural gas supplies from the mature Cook Inlet basin. But new demand for Alaska LNG emerged in the aftermath of Japan’s massive earthquake and tsunami last year that wrecked the Fukushima nuclear power plant. ConocoPhillips in September bought Marathon’s 30 percent share in the plant and now has full ownership of the facility. The LNG plant was closed over the winter. The May shipment was the first since last fall. Future plans for the LNG plant, beyond 2012, are unclear, Lowman said. “It’s too early to speculate on what might happen after 2012, but all potential uses for the plant depend on local needs, the volume of Cook Inlet natural gas production, or the availability of a natural gas via a pipeline from the North Slope to Southcentral Alaska,” she said in an email.

467,COP,REFILE-Refiners pay $21.6 mln to settle 'hot fuel' suits,"By Jessica Dye NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corp. and four other oil companies have agreed to pay a total of $21.6 million to resolve allegations they knowingly overcharged for gasoline by failing to adjust prices to account for changes in volume caused by summer temperatures. Gasoline is sold by volume, but as outside temperatures climb storage tanks heat up and fuel volume expands, diluting the amount of energy delivered per gallon. Several of the refiners had previously announced they had reached a settlement in principle in the case, which combines more than 50 separate lawsuits filed against oil producers and retailers over their so-called ‘hot fuel’ practices. The proposed settlement filed Friday in U.S. district court in Kansas reveals the financial details of the deal, reached after more than five years of litigation. ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell Oil Products US and two subsidiaries of BP PLC - BP Products North America Inc and BP West Coast Products LLC - will pay $5 million each, according to court documents. Citgo Petroleum Corp  and Sinclair Oil Corp will shell out $800,000 apiece. The funds will be distributed among retailers and wholesalers in the 29 U.S. states and territories where the hot-fuel suits were filed. Valero Energy Corp will not pay into the general settlement fund, but will provide up to $4.5 million in attorney’s fees, according to court papers. A spokesman for ConocoPhillips confirmed the settlement and declined further comment. Representatives for the other refiners did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gas retailers in the U.S. peg their sales at a wholesale level to an industry standard of approximately 60 degrees. Technology to monitor temperature at pumps has been used for decades in Canada, where the oil industry pushed for the law. Conversely, in the United States, consumer watchdogs say the oil industry has lobbied against such a measure despite record high earnings and the relatively modest cost of $800 to modify an existing pump.",6192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/exxonmobil-hotfuel-settlement/refile-refiners-pay-21-6-mln-to-settle-hot-fuel-suits-idUSL1E8HJ04320120619

469,COP,Chesapeake names ex-Conoco chief Dunham chairman,"(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) named former Conoco head Archie Dunham its new chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon as it seeks to quell a shareholder revolt over a governance crisis. McClendon, who co-founded the company 23 years ago and built it into the second-largest natural gas producer in the country behind Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), will continue as chief executive, but will report to a more independent board and an influential chairman who will likely rein in his free-spending ways. Chesapeake, struggling with weak cash flows amid the lowest natural gas prices in a decade and a massive $10 billion funding gap, is racing to sell assets as its focuses spending on its most profitable fields. In May, Chesapeake said it would split the job of CEO and chairman. That decision came in the wake of a Reuters report saying McClendon, both chairman and CEO at the time, had arranged more than $1 billion in personal loans using his interest in company wells as collateral. McClendon’s largest personal lender, EIG Global Energy Partners, is also a big source of funding for Chesapeake, a situation that could put the executive’s interests at odds with shareholders, academics and analysts have said. The arrival of Dunham, a former U.S. Marine who earned two degrees from the University of Oklahoma, heightened speculation the company could seek a buyer. “This guy’s got a lot of contacts around the world. He seems to me like he would be a good choice to run Chesapeake or sell it out,” said Mike Breard, an analyst with Hodges Capital Management. On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that China’s Sinopec Corp (0036.HK) was considering a multibillion dollar bid for Chesapeake assets. In addition to Dunham, Chesapeake’s board appointed four other new independent members proposed by the company’s top two shareholders. Southeastern Asset Management, the largest shareholder with a 13.9 percent stake, brought in Bob Alexander, Brad Martin and Frederic Poses, while activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns 7.6 percent, proposed Vincent Intrieri. At a rare public appearance, Southeastern CEO O. Mason Hawkins said Chesapeake’s shares were worth more than $50 apiece and would eventually top $100 if gas prices rebound. “Chesapeake is at the full position to have the best assets, so shame on us if we don’t produce a lot of earnings and a lot of cash flow,” Hawkins said at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago. “Chesapeake has a chance to deliver more units at higher prices.” Tim Rezvan, an analyst at Sterne Agee, said the board changes “should give investors confidence that a more palatable spending plan will be in place next year.” Dunham, 73, spent more than three decades at Conoco and served as its president and chief executive when it sealed the deal that created ConocoPhillips (COP.N) in 2002. He was chairman of ConocoPhillips from the merger until his retirement in 2004. Dunham has been credited with turning around a struggling Conoco in the 1990s when, as head of its oil and gas production business, he sold $2 billion of assets and focused spending on its best-performing fields. Some analysts wondered whether Dunham was selected to prepare Chesapeake for a possible sale, something that both Hawkins and Icahn have urged the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma company to consider. “Given (Dunham’s) age, I’m left wondering if his appointment doesn’t signal something bigger is afoot,” said Morningstar analyst Mark Hanson. “At 73, he obviously is a very accomplished guy. If this is his last hurrah, it’s not going to be waiting for gas prices to recover, it’s going to be a sale.” Another shareholder said Dunham’s membership on the boards of Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) and Louisiana-Pacific Corp (LPX.N) could weaken his focus on Chesapeake. “I would have thought the chairman would have been a little more hands on,” said David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management LLP, which owns about 1 million shares. “We’re not getting an active chairman.” A call to Dunham’s Houston home was not immediately returned. Despite being rejected by about three quarters of the company’s shareholders in a vote earlier this month, Chesapeake said it would keep V. Burns Hargis on the board to help complete a review of McClendon’s financing arrangements. “The news (of the appointments), which is welcome and positive, is tempered by the decision to keep Hargis,” said Michael Garland, head of governance for New York City Comptroller John Liu. “It’s a bad decision justified by flawed logic,” he said. “They are keeping the director who chaired the audit committee that failed in its oversight and is now investigating what went wrong.” The five new directors will replace Richard Davidson, Kathleen Eisbrenner, Frank Keating and Don Nickles - who resigned - and Charles Maxwell, who retired. McClendon retains some power despite the changes. The board amended company bylaws to give the CEO the authority to call board meetings and special shareholder meetings.

The storm’s threat alone had led oil and gas producers to shut nearly a quarter of production from the region that accounts for about 20 percent of the nation’s oil production and about 6 percent of natural gas output. “There has been a significant change in the forecast track” of Debby, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said late on Sunday. The NHC called the Sunday afternoon forecast a “low-confidence” projection that the sprawling Debby would move toward the Florida panhandle and away from offshore production areas off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. Earlier NHC forecasts had pointed the storm toward Texas or Louisiana. BP Plc, the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico, shut in all of its production. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the only U.S. port that can receive the largest oil tank ships, stopped operating due to rough seas. ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  had also shut some of their production as of Sunday as the first storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season to threaten offshore production gained strength in the Gulf. As of midday on Sunday, 22.7 percent of daily crude oil production, up from 7.8 percent on Saturday, and 22.9 percent of daily natural gas output, up from 8.16 percent, had been shut due to Debby, according to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which oversees oil and gas activity in the Gulf.",6242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/storm-debby-bp/update-3-storm-debby-shifts-east-may-miss-u-s-gulf-oil-patch-idUSL2E8HO30A20120624

476,COP,Conoco fights MF Global trustee over $93.5 million,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and MF Global Inc’s bankruptcy trustee are squaring off in a $93.5 million dispute that illustrates how hard it is to divvy up the assets of the failed brokerage, a Reuters analysis of a court filing shows. On Friday last week, the oil company — a longstanding MF Global MFGLQ.PK customer — filed an objection to the trustee’s treatment of its claim, calling his approach “flawed” and saying Conoco had not received the bulk of the distributions from its MF Global accounts to which it was entitled. The filing does not say how much Conoco (COP.N) believes it is still owed. A Reuters analysis based on figures included in the court filing, the trustee’s determination of Conoco’s claim, and the amounts the trustee has returned to most other customers shows the figure is around $35 million. The same analysis shows bankruptcy trustee James Giddens believes he has overpaid Conoco by about $58 million. The difference lies in the way Conoco and Giddens view $205 million in letters of credit that Conoco and its Canadian unit had lodged with MF Global to back energy trades. Giddens has returned the letters to Conoco, counting their full face value toward fulfillment of Conoco’s claim, but did not return any of the other collateral — amounting to about $92 million — in the accounts whose treatment Conoco is disputing. In Friday’s objection, Conoco called such an approach a “miscalculation”. It argued that the trustee should have distributed payments based on the amount in the accounts above and beyond the face value of the letters of credit. There is no indication in the filing that the trustee has sought the return of funds from Conoco. But an agreement covering part of the disputed claim, included as an exhibit to the filing, spells out the trustee’s view that Conoco has received more than its fair share so far. A Conoco spokesman declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. A spokesman for Giddens declined to comment on the $93.5 million difference of opinion, but said the trustee would respond to Conoco’s objection by the August deadline. “This effort is just one more example of how the trustee is working to expand the estates available for all customers in a fair and equitable manner,” said Kent Jarrell, Giddens’ spokesman. MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31, after investors and customers became rattled over the firm’s roughly $7 billion bet on European sovereign debt and downgrades by credit rating agencies, resulting in a liquidity crunch. Before its collapse, MF Global had improperly dipped into client funds for its own purposes, leaving customer accounts with a $1.6 billion shortfall, Giddens has said. Most customers have received, or are soon to receive, distributions totaling 80 percent of their funds. Those who traded on foreign exchanges are set to receive the first 5 percent of their money back in coming weeks. The trustee should have applied those percentages only to the amounts in Conoco’s accounts, excluding letters of credit, Conoco argued. The trustee never had any right to draw on the letters of credit, Conoco argued in its objection, and therefore should not have included them when calculating the payments to Conoco. That reasoning suggests the trustee should have distributed about $32.6 million to Conoco from accounts for U.S. exchange trading, and about $2.5 million for accounts using non-U.S. exchanges. Conoco, among MF Global’s largest ex-clients, is one of five former MF Global customers disputing the treatment of letters of credit held by MF Global, Giddens’ spokesman said, adding that the trustee is negotiating with all parties in an effort to find a resolution. The more success the trustee has in recovering the $1.6 billion in missing customer funds, the less the dispute with Conoco and other former customers matters. That is because with more assets available, the trustee will distribute more to all customers, including those with which he has disputes. But the trustee’s efforts to recover funds look likely to take years. Giddens is suing MF Global’s British unit for the return of about $640 million in a case not set for trial until next April. Meanwhile, at least one former MF Global customer with a letter of credit has agreed to Giddens’ treatment of such letters: CME Group (CME.O), whose GFX unit had a $15 million letter of credit at MF Global when the brokerage collapsed. As in Conoco’s case, CME’s letter of credit was never drawn, and the trustee simply returned it to the account holder. In return, CME paid the trustee $3 million, bringing the distribution from its account in line with the 80 percent that other account holders have, or will soon have, received.

The Houston company was a big buyer in the most recent U.S. Gulf of Mexico lease sale and also added to its deepwater position in Angola, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Sheets said in an interview. “We’ve had a fairly significant spend building up the exploration portfolio this year,” Sheets said, noting that the timing of planned asset sales had also affected capital expenditures. Second-quarter earnings at both companies topped Wall Street expectations, but analysts at Barclays characterized Conoco’s earnings as “neutral.” Hess’ production came in better than expected as its output in North Dakota’s Bakken field surged and Libyan production came back on line. The company raised it 2012 spending estimate by 25 percent, to $8.5 billion. Shares of Conoco were down 2.7 percent to $53.19 in afternoon trading. Hess shares were up 4.9 percent at $46.07. Conoco, reporting earnings for the first time since shedding its refining and chemicals businesses, said oil and gas output slipped below its full-year production goal as asset sales, maintenance and curtailed gas production weighed. But the company said its new projects were coming on line as planned. “I think Conoco operated well in this transition period,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil analyst at Edward Jones in Saint Louis. “Their projects are on time and progressing toward operation in the future.” Conoco profit fell 32 percent to $2.3 billion, or $1.80 per share. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share were $1.22, beating analysts’ average forecast by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s oil and gas output for the quarter fell 6 percent to 1.54 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), below its 2012 target of 1.55 to 1.6 million BOE but matching Wall Street expectations. “Our production was on target, our major growth projects are on track, and we are continuing to add to our conventional and unconventional exploration inventory,” Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement. Conoco’s average price for crude fell to $105.56 per barrel in the second quarter, down $7.39 from a year earlier, while its average natural gas price dropped 20 percent to $5.50 per thousand cubic feet. Conoco’s quarterly figures included one month of the refining operations, which were split off at the end of April. The bulk of Hess’ spending increase will come in the Bakken, where leases it has signed require it to drill in order to hold onto the land, the company told investors on a conference call. It is also changing its well completion process and using a more expensive material in hydraulic fracturing. “We’re in investment mode now, primarily due to the Bakken.” CEO John Hess told investors. The company now expects to spend $3 billion in the Bakken this year, up from a previous estimate of $2 billion. Hess’ profit in the second quarter fell nearly 10 percent to $549 million, or $1.61 per share.

The higher-than-expected production helped push earnings past Wall Street expectations. Excluding one-time items, Hess had a profit of $1.72 per share, topping analysts’ average forecast of $1.38. Driving the production increase was a jump in output at the Bakken, to 55,000 BOE per day from 25,000 BOE last year.

Inter Pipeline, which operates three regional pipeline systems serving oil sands projects, will expand its Cold Lake and Polaris pipelines in northern Alberta to add 820,000 barrels per day of new capacity, both to deliver diluent to the projects and to take bitumen to market. Diluent is blended into the tar-like bitumen produced in the oil sands so it can flow in pipelines. The agreement with Cenovus and its joint-venture partner, ConocoPhillips, comes as the competition heats up among pipeline companies to carry rising volumes from the oil sands. Both Enbridge Inc and Pembina Pipeline Corp  are expanding their regional networks in northern Alberta, while TransCanada Corp, the country’s largest pipeline company, recently said it was mulling a move into the region. “This is a competitive field, some people would even call it a crowded field,” said Steven Paget, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. The agreement will see Inter Pipeline move rising production from the Foster Creek and deliver diluent to the Christina Lake oil sands projects by mid-2014, and build new lines to the planned Narrows Lake project that will be in service in mid-2016. Inter Pipeline will add 840 kilometers (521 miles) of new pipeline and seven new pump stations as part of the expansion. The company plans to finance the expansion using a combination of debt and equity. Cenovus and ConocoPhillips have agreed to provide C$225 million to pay for the project’s up-front costs, such as land procurement and regulatory activities. Also on Tuesday , Aecon Group Inc, a Canadian construction c ompany, said a j oint venture between one of its units and pipeline builder Robert B. Somerville Co was a warded a $600 million contract for the expansion of the Cold Lake and Polaris pipelines.

The cuts took place before the expropriation of the project by the Venezuelan government, ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Davy Kong said.

493,COP,UPDATE 2-Indian state-owned firms bid for Conoco Canada oil assets,"* Bid of $5 bln submitted at end of July * ConocoPhillips put assets on the block in January * ONGC Videsh’s 2012/13 oil, gas output may lag last year’s By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Sept 24 (Reuters) - A trio of state-controlled Indian oil companies on Monday said it has bid $5 billion for stakes in Canadian oil sands assets owned by ConocoPhillips , in what could be the next major test of Canada’s appetite for foreign investment in its energy resources. A completed deal by a group that includes producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Oil India Ltd, along with refiner and retailer Indian Oil Corp, would be the first in Canada for Indian energy companies after years of strong public expressions of interest in the Alberta oil sands. “We have bid along with Oil India and Indian Oil Corp,” a source at ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, told reporters on Monday. A source at Oil India said the bid was submitted at the end of July. India is the world’s fourth-largest oil importer, buying nearly 80 percent of its needs from abroad. With demand and refining capacity rising, the government has told state firms to secure energy assets overseas to help power the expanding economy. In January, ConocoPhillips put stakes in six Alberta properties on the auction block. They produce 12,000 barrels of oil a day from an estimated 30 billion barrels of bitumen. The one producing project in the package is Surmont, run in a joint venture with France’s Total SA. Located south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the steam-driven development pumps about 25,000 barrels per day. The partners are working to boost that to 136,000 bpd, starting in 2015. ConocoPhillips declined to comment on the bid from the Indian firms, the timing for announcing the results of the auction, or the overall level of interest. “We do not comment on market rumors,” spokeswoman Davy Kong said. India’s bid comes as Canada undergoes an extensive study of its capacity for investment by foreign state-owned enterprises in the tar sands, the world’s third-largest crude source, following a $15.1 billion bid for Calgary-based Nexen Inc  by CNOOC Ltd, the Chinese state-owned oil company. The Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper has promised to release a framework for future deals when it announces its decision on the Nexen takeover later this year. India’s federal auditor last month flayed ONGC, the country’s top oil company, for its tardy pace of exploration and lax efforts in development. Its output has been almost stagnant for years. ONGC Videsh announced a shift in policy last year, when its then-managing director, Jomen Thomas, said his firm would seek to buy assets in politically less risky regions such as North America to cut its risk and boost output. It aims to invest $20 billion to help increase its output seven-fold by 2030. In 2011/12, ONGC Videsh produced 7.4 percent less oil and gas output than a year earlier, at about 175,000 bpd. Managing director D. K. Sarraf said on Monday that oil and oil-equivalent gas output from the company’s assets may also decline in the current fiscal year due to geopolitical problems in Sudan and Syria. He said he hoped output would improve in 2013/14 when new fields including those in Myanmar’s A1 and A3 blocks are commissioned. Sarraf declined to comment on a bid for ConocoPhillips but said: “The market (for mergers and acquisitions) is reasonably good. There is a lot of action in North America, Canada as huge credible resources are there.” The other properties in the ConocoPhillips package are assets known as Thornbury, Clyden, Saleski, Crow Lake, McMillan Lake. The land totals 715,000 acres. ONGC Videsh recently bought the 2.7 percent stake of Hess  in the large Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli (ACG) group of oil fields in Azerbaijan, and ONGC Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva said his firm could supply that equity oil to its refining unit MRPL , which recently raised capacity to 300,000 bpd. MRPL buys Azeri light crude through spot tender and short-term deals. The move will help MRPL in replacing some of the oil it used to buy from Iran, as western sanctions aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear program disrupt shipments.",9242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ongc/update-2-indian-state-owned-firms-bid-for-conoco-canada-oil-assets-idUSL4E8KO67Q20120924

496,COP,UPDATE 3-Indian state firms bid $5 bln for Conoco Canada assets,"* Bid of $5 bln submitted at end of July - source * ConocoPhillips put assets on the block in January By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Sept 25 (Reuters) - A trio of state-run Indian oil companies has bid $5 billion for stakes in Canadian oil sands holdings owned by ConocoPhillips, two sources said, as the world’s No. 4 oil importer continues to search for supplies to power its near $2 trillion economy. The bid from the group, which comprises producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Oil India Ltd with refiner and retailer Indian Oil Corp, is the first for by Indian energy companies for assets in Canada. It comes as India, which imports about 80 percent of its near 4 million barrels per day (bpd) oil needs, cuts purchases from major supplier Iran to secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. “We have bid along with Oil India and Indian Oil Corp,” a source at ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, told reporters on Monday. A source at Oil India said the bid was submitted at the end of July. In January, ConocoPhillips put stakes in six Alberta properties on the auction block.

ONGC Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva said on Tuesday the company had not yet made a bid but continued to look at international opportunities. The New Delhi government has told state firms to secure energy assets overseas as the country’s own output is well below the needs of its demand in an economy expected to grow 6.5 percent this year and already suffering hefty power shortfalls. But attempts to secure assets have not been very fruitful, even though there is ample cash available. International Coal Ventures Limited (ICVL), a consortium of state-run companies including Steel Authority of India  and Coal India, has struggled to buy a single asset in the three years since its inception. Its poor M&A; track record mainly stems from bureaucratic sloth as well as differences among the consortium members over ownership issues, said several banking sources who have previously worked with the state-run companies. “In any well-run auction process, Indian state-run companies will be at a disadvantage because they are not very efficient and don’t move fast enough,” said a resources M&A; banker with a European bank in Mumbai. “When you are a consortium of state-run firms, the entire process becomes very chaotic,” he said. “But energy security is a big theme for India and one good thing is there are not too many buyers for these assets due to global economic conditions.” In February, ONGC and state-run gas transportation company GAIL India Ltd said they were looking at an offer for Britain’s Cove Energy but after three months of silence dropped the idea. On their own, Indian energy companies have likewise had little success in closing large overseas acquisitions and tended to focus on individual deals. ONGC Videsh, which is expected to contribute about 46 percent of group production by financial year 2030 with investment of $20 billion, has stakes in 30 projects in 15 countries including producing assets in Sudan, South Sudan, Vietnam, Syria, Russia, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. It recently bought a 2.7 percent stake of Hess in the large Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli (ACG) group of oil fields in Azerbaijan. Foreign state-owned firms are increasingly looking at Canada’s tar sands, the world’s third-largest crude source. The Indian interest follows a $15.1 billion bid for Calgary-based Nexen Inc by CNOOC Ltd, the Chinese state-owned oil company. The other properties in the ConocoPhillips package are assets known as Thornbury, Clyden, Saleski, Crow Lake, McMillan Lake.

499,COP,Total content with Canadian oil sands pace,"* Total, Suncor plan two oil sands mines, upgrader * Decisions expected in 2013 * Pleased with current ConocoPhillips partnership By Jeffrey Jones CALGARY, Alberta, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Total SA is content with the pace of developing its Canadian oil sands assets even as Suncor Energy Inc, its joint venture partner, said it was in no rush to bring a host of multibillion-dollar projects on line, an executive said on Tuesday. Jean-Michel Gires, head of Total’s Canadian unit, said the French oil major is not looking to bulk up on more northern Alberta oil sands assets as it and Suncor move forward with studying two mines and an upgrading plant. “We want to take advantage of the inputs of the two companies in this partnership ... that is what we are doing. We are 18 months after the initial agreement and we are very pleased with the way this progressed,” Gires told reporters after speaking to a business audience. Total and Suncor are conducting the front-end engineering work on the Joslyn and Fort Hills mines and Voyageur upgrader that would process up to 200,000 barrels a day of production, and the companies have said they aim to make go-ahead decisions some time next year. Suncor Chief Executive Steve Williams said in July that he would no longer commit to an ambitious corporate growth program that would have seen output nearly double by the end of the decade to 1 million barrels a day, saying he was not interested in “growth for growth’s sake.” He also said each of the projects would be evaluated on its own merits, not necessarily as a package, amid speculation that decisions could be pushed to the end of the year. Williams made the comments as fears grew across the industry that inflation that plagued oil sands development in the last decade were returning as more projects move forward, driving up labor and materials costs. Gires said he would not give a target date for approving the projects. He said Total and Suncor are making progress with the engineering and making sure the developments are “aligned with each other.” “It’s more important that we can deliver good projects and make them profitable and align them correctly, so that’s what we are up to for the time being,” he said. Meanwhile, Gires said he believes Total it has enough projects to develop in Canada, including its Surmont steam-driven development, a joint venture with ConocoPhillips . A second phase at Surmont is expected to boost output from 25,000 barrels a day to 136,000 barrels a day by 2015. ConocoPhillips has a half share of its interest on the auction block along with stakes in a host of other undeveloped oil sands leases. Last month, sources said a trio of Indian companies led by Oil and Natural Gas Corp bid $5 billion for the assets, though ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Gires also would not say if Total was interested in the properties, which would be developed using steam-assisted gravity drainage technology, where steam is injected into the earth so the bitumen can be pumped to the surface. “For the time being we have 50 percent of this asset. We’re very pleased as well with the partnership with ConocoPhillips. The two companies have learned a lot about SAGD and in situ developments. We are on a very promising lease that can deliver probably other steps later on than just Surmont 1 and Surmont 2,” he said.",10022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/total-canada/total-content-with-canadian-oil-sands-pace-idUSL1E8L28ML20121002
500,COP,ConocoPhillips to exit Kazakh oil field: minister,"ASTANA (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is ready to exit the consortium developing Kazakhstan’s Kashagan oil field, Kazakh officials said, giving the state first option on increasing ownership of the biggest oil find since the 1960s. A more assertive Kazakhstan, seeking greater returns on the large energy projects that will drive central Asia’s biggest economy over the next decade, has sought to revise deals struck with foreign energy companies in the lean post-Soviet years. Asked on Tuesday whether ConocoPhillips would sell its stake in the consortium, Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev told reporters: “They have informed that they have the intention of selling.” ConocoPhillips would not confirm its plans for the Kashagan stake. “Unless formally announced by our company, ConocoPhillips does not comment on ongoing business development or commercial activities,” spokesman Daren Beaudo said in an email. The Houston-based company, however, has been conducting a disposal program to reduce its non-core overseas assets. It has already exceeded its target of asset sales worth $20 billion by the end of 2012, including the sale of its stake in LUKOIL (LKOH.MM), Russia’s second-biggest oil producer. Proceeds from the disposals are to be used for debt reduction, dividend payments and exploration. Kazakhstan, home to 3 percent of the world’s recoverable oil reserves, has moved to exert greater management control and secure bigger revenues from foreign-owned oil and gas developments. Previous reshuffles of North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), the consortium developing Kashagan, have seen state company KazMunaiGas muscle in, prompting Western partners to seek assurances that they will be able to develop the offshore field’s more lucrative second phase. KazMunaiGas first entered the Kashagan consortium as a shareholder in 2005 and later doubled its stake to 16.81 percent. Identical stakes are held by Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) and French company Total (TOTF.PA). Japan’s Inpex (1605.T) owns 7.56 percent. The Kazakh state company would have first option on buying the 8.4 percent stake owned by ConocoPhillips, and Chief Executive Lyazzat Kiinov said it was “displaying interest” in buying the stake. Daniyar Berlibayev, Kiinov’s deputy at KazMunaiGas, also indicated that ConocoPhillips planned to sell its stake. Whether or not KazMuaniGas would acquire the share would depend on the price, he said. “They will exit the project, but nobody has come to us with an offer,” Berlibayev told Reuters. “We, as the national company, wouldn’t refuse the idea of increasing our share. How we might finance this is another question.” Exxon Mobil, the world’s biggest non-state oil company, would be a possible buyer of the stake if KazMuaniGas decided not to pursue its interest in the ConocoPhillips stake. Exxon Mobil senior vice-president Mark Albers declined to comment when asked about his company’s plans for Kashagan. Kazakhstan, the world’s ninth-largest country by area but with a population of only 17 million, expects Kashagan to be one of three main drivers of its plans to raise oil output by 60 percent by the end of the decade. Mynbayev said that Kazakhstan planned to raise output to 130 million metric tonnes (143.3 million tons) by 2020, from 81 million tonnes this year, through expansion at Kashagan, the Chevron-led (CVX.N) Tengiz field and the Karachaganak oil and gas condensate field Kashagan’s first phase, which has been delayed by rising costs and technical complications, is likely to pump its first oil by the end of March 2013, the minister said. The first phase of production is expected to yield between 370,000 and 450,000 barrels per day (bpd). A second phase, yet to be agreed with the government, could raise output to 1 million bpd. With output set to begin, consortium members are lobbying for assurances that they will be able to recoup the tens of billions of dollars already invested before the expiry of their 40-year production-sharing agreement, signed in 1997. President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled Kazakhstan throughout its two decades of independence, has already talked to ENI Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni to discuss “cooperation in the oil and gas sector”, including Kashagan, his website said.

502,COP,Kazakhstan says ConocoPhillips to sell Kashagan stake,"ASTANA (Reuters) - U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is ready to sell its stake in the giant Kashagan oil field, Kazakhstan’s oil minister said, as the Central Asian nation tries to wring increasing revenue from foreign-owned oil and gas developments. Kazakhstan, home to 3 percent of the world’s recoverable oil reserves, has sought in recent years to revise deals struck with foreign energy firms in lean post-Soviet years and boost its returns from foreign oil and gas companies. Development of the mammoth offshore field, the biggest oil discovery since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in the 1960s, has been beset by delays, rising costs and technical complications since it was declared commercially viable 10 years ago. Oil production is now expected to begin in March 2013. Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev said that ConocoPhillips is ready to sell its 8.4 per cent stake in North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), the consortium developing Kashagan. “They have informed that they have the intention of selling,” he told reporters. Lyazzat Kiinov, head of Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas, said that the company was “displaying interest” in buying the ConocoPhillips stake. ConocoPhillips was not immediately available to comment on the oil minister’s claim. KazMunaiGas and six international oil companies control NCOC. KazMunaiGas, Eni (ENI.MI), ExxonMobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) each own about 16.8 percent. Japan’s Inpex (1605.T) owns 7.56 percent, with ConocoPhillips completing the group. Mynbayev said that Kashagan was expected to produce its first oil by the end of March 2013. “The consortium had the intention of starting production this December, but it looks like they won’t manage it. They will move it to some time around the end of March,” Mynbayev told reporters on the sidelines of an international energy conference. Kazakhstan, the world’s ninth-largest country by area but with a population of only 16.7 million, expects the field in the Caspian Sea to be the main driver of its plans to raise oil output by 60 percent by the end of the decade, from 80 million metric tonnes (88.18 million tons) in 2011.

507,COP,US regulator intervenes in Conoco battle with MF Global trustee,"CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday won court approval to intervene in a $205 million dispute between oil major ConocoPhillips and the bankruptcy trustee for MF Global Inc. At issue is the treatment of letters of credit that the oil company — a longstanding MF Global customer — had lodged with the now bankrupt brokerage to back its energy trades. The CFTC told a federal court in a filing last week it should be allowed to intervene because of the public policy interest in “the correct interpretation” of law and rules governing the futures industry. A judge approved its application to intervene on Monday. The regulator, which favors the trustee’s interpretation of the letters of credit issue, will be able to present its views in court and try to influence a decision that could cost Conoco tens of millions of dollars should it go against the company. The dispute focuses on the value of the letters of credit and how much Conoco is owed in compensation by MF Global. The brokerage’s bankruptcy trustee has returned some money to former customers, with as much as 80 percent for some kinds of account holders, and less for others. None have received all back and bankruptcy law requires customers to share equally in any losses. In the case of Conoco, MF Global bankruptcy trustee James Giddens returned the undrawn letters of credit to the company and counted the full face value of the letters towards Conoco’s compensation claim. If that accounting is allowed to stand, Conoco could be required to return tens of millions of dollars to the estate, under the argument that the letters of credit are worth more than the percentage of its accounts to which Conoco is entitled. For a FACTBOX on the Conoco-MF Global trustee dispute, please see [ID: nL2E8HRFJ2] Conoco argues the letters of credit should not be counted against its claims, and that it is owed money from the MF Global estate. The trustee, James Giddens, says letters of credit are treated like cash for the purposes of repayment because they were put up as collateral in place of cash. The CFTC sides with Gidden’s position. The oil company earlier this year asked the New York federal court to remove the dispute over the letters of credit from bankruptcy court.

509,COP,"Occidental, Conoco profits fall on lower prices","(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates as they produced more oil and gas than expected, even as lower prices hurt profits. Shares of Conoco and Occidental rose about 2 percent on afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading on Thursday. During the third quarter the companies increased drilling in North America, where large oil companies are spending more in a bid to increase production. Conoco had record output in the Eagle Ford basin in south Texas, while Occidental saw strong production of higher-priced crude oil in the Permian Basin. “(Conoco’s) ramp-up in the Eagle Ford is on track or exceeding the market’s expectations,” said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer. “They delivered on everything they said they would, and more.” North American shale fields are increasingly seen as a relatively low-cost, reliable source of both oil and natural gas in an era when nations like Russia and Brazil are tightening control of their resources. Natural gas prices in the United States fell 30 percent in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier, to $2.83 per million British thermal units, burdened by heavy supplies. The average Brent oil price of $110 per barrel in the quarter was down $2, hit by worries about slowing demand. Conoco’s third-quarter profit fell 31 percent and Occidental’s declined 22 percent, hurt by the lower oil and natural gas prices. Conoco’s oil and gas output in the quarter was 1.53 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE), down from 1.54 million a year earlier. For the fourth quarter, Conoco sees production gains from the previous quarter, with higher output coming from the Eagle Ford and the company’s oil sands properties in Canada. It expects to spend $15.5 billion to $16 billion this year, reaching the upper end of that range if it buys acreage in shale basins. Conoco’s budget for 2013 will be of a similar size, Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance told analysts on a conference call. This was Conoco’s first quarter to report earnings as an standalone exploration and production company. Earlier this year, it split off its refining business. Now, Conoco is selling assets and increasing dividends as part of an effort to return cash to shareholders. Excluding items related to asset sales and taxes, Conoco, the No. 3 U.S. oil company, had a profit of $1.44 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.19. Occidental, the No. 4 U.S. oil company, said net profit fell to $1.38 billion, or $1.69 per share, from $1.77 billion, or $2.17 per share, a year earlier. Analysts looked for $1.63 per share, according to the average on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “(Occidental’s) earnings were strong across the board, driven by higher-than-expected U.S. oil production, lower unit costs and strong chemicals segment income,” Sterne Agee analyst Tim Rezvan said. Output rose 4 percent from a year ago to 766,000 barrels per day. Still, Occidental’s CEO Stephen Chazen expressed concern about the company’s returns when speaking on a conference call with analysts. “If I don’t see real improvements in the returns, you know, in the next couple of quarters, strategy will change,” said Chazen, adding that could take the form of higher dividends or even farming out wells to other companies. Shares of Conoco rose 94 cents to $56.89, while Occidental’s shares climbed $1.82 to $82.50 on the NYSE. Smaller oil company Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) reported a 50 percent drop in third-quarter profit as output was hit by disruptions resulting from Hurricane Isaac. Oil and gas sales were 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 11 percent from a year earlier. Noble Energy shares rose 2.4 percent to $91.38.

Still, Occidental’s CEO Stephen Chazen expressed concern about the company’s returns when speaking on a conference call with analysts. “If I don’t see real improvements in the returns, you know, in the next couple of quarters, strategy will change,” said Chazen, adding that could take the form of higher dividends or even farming out wells to other companies.

517,COP,"Exclusive: Venezuela sees Exxon, Conoco arbitration rulings in late 2013","CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela expects international arbitration rulings by late 2013 in multi-billion-dollar claims by Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips over nationalizations by President Hugo Chavez’s government, the oil minister said. Of more than 20 cases against Venezuela at the World Bank and the International Chamber of Commerce’s panels, the biggest involve Conoco (COP.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which are seeking some $40 billion between them. Both companies filed for arbitration after Chavez ordered foreign firms to slash their stakes in production and upgrading projects for heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt as part of a 2007 wave of state takeovers. “We don’t expect resolutions this year. Probably the biggest cases (Conoco and Exxon) will be resolved in the second half of 2013,” Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez told Reuters. He did not give more details of the ongoing cases. A huge compensation bill would be painful for cash-strapped state oil firm PDVSA, which has been unable to boost production significantly while facing an ever-growing commitment to finance Chavez’s flagship welfare policies in the South American nation. Industry analysts estimate Venezuela will end up paying considerably less than the companies want - perhaps around $7 billion to $9 billion - based on the market value of the assets at the time. Venezuela has said it expects to pay no more than $2.5 billion. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a Paris-based group that settles cross-border business disputes, in December ordered Venezuela to pay Exxon $908 million in compensation for lost revenue from the nationalized Cerro Negro project. The Chavez government quickly made the payment. The principal disputes with Conoco and Exxon are being heard at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The ICC in September ordered PDVSA to pay Conoco $66.8 million in a dispute over OPEC production cuts - unrelated to the nationalizations - applied in 2006 and 2007 to Orinoco Belt heavy crude upgrader Petrozuata. Ramirez, speaking in a brief telephone chat with Reuters, said Venezuelan lawyers were studying that ruling. Venezuela’s plethora of compensation cases are being closely watched by the global oil industry for precedents in future disputes between companies and producer states, which increasingly want a greater share of oil revenue as prices have risen and new reserves become tougher to find. Ramirez put current Venezuelan output at between 3 million and 3.1 million barrels per day - well short of PDVSA’s target of 3.5 million for the end of 2012. Nevertheless, Venezuela has a record 373 rigs active, giving it the platform for future increased output, mainly from new Orinoco projects, Ramirez said. The OPEC nation is pinning hopes for its oil industry on a string of ambitious projects with foreign partners - largely from politically allied nations such as China and Russia - to develop the Orinoco Belt. The region is one of the biggest, mostly untapped reserves of hydrocarbons left in the world. Ramirez said the Mariscal Sucre offshore natural gas project was still expected to begin production in December after years of delays, raising national production to 8 billion cubic feet per day from 6 billion to 7 billion in recent years. Venezuela wants to boost gas production to meet growing domestic demand that has forced it to import from neighboring Colombia even though it sits on some of the world’s biggest gas reserves. The government says it will eventually certify as much as 400 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in reserves, up from 195 tcf now. That would propel Venezuela to fourth in the world behind Russia, Iran and Qatar, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

The warrants, which convert into shares, were sold to Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ** McGraw-Hill Companies Inc said it will sell its educational publishing unit to Apollo Global Management LLC  for $2.5 billion. ** Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp will buy U.S.-based insurance brokerage USI from Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s private equity fund for $2.3 billion to expand its financial services footprint. ** GlaxoSmithKline Plc plans to spend more than $1 billion to raise stakes in its Indian and Nigerian consumer healthcare arms, as Britain’s biggest drugmaker deepens its emerging markets and non-prescription consumer health footprint. ** Knight Capital Group, currently in talks with at least two firms on the possible sale of its largest business unit, is well capitalized and would only pursue a deal if it created value for its shareholders and clients, Knight’s chief executive said in an internal memo. ** Dutch group Boskalis, the world’s biggest dredger, has offered 682 million euros ($884 million) for maritime transport group Dockwise to expand in oil and gas services. ** Italy’s Eni said on Monday it planned to sell around 6 percent of Portuguese energy company Galp Energia , a stake worth about 607 million euros ($787 million) at current market prices, as it presses ahead with plans to focus cash on upstream development. ** Struggling Indian carriers Jet Airways India Ltd  and SpiceJet Ltd are in talks with Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways and Malaysia’s AirAsia Bhd to sell minority stakes, a senior government official with direct knowledge of the talks said. However, the Malaysian budget carrier dismissed the speculation. ** Card payment processor Network International, which is owned by Abraaj Capital and Dubai’s largest bank, said on Sunday it has bought a majority stake in an online remittance firm held by a unit of India’s biggest media group. Network International Chief Executive Bhairav Trivedi said the purchase of a stake in TimesofMoney, a unit of India’s Times Group, was a prelude to further acquisitions by the Dubai-based firm. ** German retailer Metro AG is in talks with several parties interested in buying the east European arm of its Real supermarkets chain, with French rival Auchan as frontrunner, two sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters on Sunday. ** British home builder McCarthy & Stone is set for a sale, an initial public offering (IPO) or a 500-million-pound ($800 million) loan refinancing three years after it was taken over by lenders in a debt-for-equity swap. ** Indian tractor maker Mahindra and Mahindra  hopes to strike a deal to buy up to half of British luxury sports car maker Aston Martin by the end of this week, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday. The source said an initial 40-percent stake could rise to 50 percent for a total price unlikely to top $400 million. ** Singapore’s Straits Trading Co has signed non-binding agreements that may lead to the sale of most of its hotel operations to the Far East Organization property group, the companies said.",11262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/deals-day/deals-of-the-day-mergers-and-acquisitions-idUSL4N0961PC20121126
519,COP,ConocoPhillips to sell Kazakh stake for $5 billion to ONGC,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is to sell its 8.4 percent stake in Kazakhstan oil field Kashagan for about $5 billion to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS), a state-run Indian group looking to boost production. Kashagan, the world’s biggest oilfield discovery since 1968, holds an estimated 30 billion barrels of oil-in-place, of which 8 billion to 12 billion are potentially recoverable, with first production expected next year. Start-up of the field has been delayed since 2005 due to cost overruns and disputes with authorities over taxes. With ONGC’s domestic output flat for years, India now buys nearly 80 percent of its oil needs and is the world’s fourth-biggest oil importer. ConocoPhillips, which has been shedding overseas assets to cut debt and increase its investment in lower-cost domestic shale oil and gas, said on Monday the book value of assets related to its Kashagan interest was about $5.5 billion as of September 30, and it would take an after-tax impairment of about $400 million. The deal was expected to close in the first half of 2013. Fadel Gheit, oil analyst at Oppenheimer, said ConocoPhillips was cutting its losses by selling its stake. “This project has been plagued by problems,” said Gheit. “All along it was poorly handled. It is over budget and behind schedule.” ONGC, India’s fifth-biggest company by market value, has been investing to maintain output from its old fields and has capital spending plans of around 340 billion Indian rupees ($6.1 billion) this year and next. It is under pressure from the government to meet rising demand. With Indian state companies having often lost out to China in bidding for global energy assets, the Kashagan acquisition is the largest ever for ONGC. It is also the biggest outbound deal from India since mobile phone operator Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) bought mobile phone operations in Africa for $9 billion in 2010 from Kuwait-based Zain (ZAIN.KW). ONGC Videsh, the arm of ONGC that invests overseas, said the acquisition would likely add 1 million metric tons (20,000 barrels per day) to its annual production over 25 years, with its share of output significantly higher in later stages of development. ONGC Videsh’s production in the year to March was 8.7 million metric tons. The deal comes as India pushes to diversify crude supplies away from Iran, which used to provide about 12 percent of the country’s 3.5 million bpd or so of imports before sales were hit by western sanctions aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions. It puts ONGC Videsh into what has been a fraught and expensive partnership between Kazakhstan and some of the world’s biggest oil companies, which hope to use the departure of ConocoPhillips to gain greater operating control and extend their production-sharing agreements with the state beyond 2041. Kazakhstan, home to 3 percent of the world’s recoverable oil reserves and the largest former Soviet oil producer after Russia, has sought to revise deals struck with foreign energy companies in the lean post-Soviet years. ConocoPhillips, which has been disposing of non-core overseas assets to cut debt and increase its exploration and dividend budgets, has already beaten its target of asset sales worth $20 billion by the end of 2012, including the sale of its stake in Lukoil (LKOH.MM), Russia’s second-biggest oil producer. Last month, Kazakh oil and gas minister Sauat Mynbayev said ConocoPhillips planned to sell its stake. ONGC was also said to be one of a trio of Indian companies that had bid $5 billion for stakes in six of ConocoPhillips’ Canadian oil sands assets, which the Houston-based oil major put on the block early this year. ConocoPhillips is still evaluating bids for the assets following “substantial” interest, said Rob Evans, spokesman for the company’s Canadian operations. That asset package includes and interest the producing Surmont project, run in a joint venture with France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA), and undeveloped leases. The ONGC deal is subject to government approvals as well as the pre-emption rights of Kazakhstan and other participants in the Kashagan field which is jointly controlled by state-run KazMunaiGas and six international companies, including Eni (ENI.MI), ExxonMobil (XOM.N), Inpex Corp (1605.T), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), and Total (TOTF.PA). It is unlikely that Exxon or Shell would exercise their right of first refusal, citing the project’s ongoing problems, Oppenheimer’s Gheit said. “I’m not sure you want more of a bitter pill,” Gheit said.

521,COP,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-ConocoPhillips to sell Kazakh oilfield stake to India's ONGC for $5 bln,"(Corrects paragraph 6 to say ONGC is India’s fifth-biggest company by market value, not third) Nov 26 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said it plans to sell its 8.4 percent stake in Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan oil field to India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd for about $5 billion as the Indian company looks to make up for flagging production. Kashagan, the world’s biggest oilfield discovery since 1968, holds an estimated 30 billion barrels of oil-in-place, of which 8-12 billion are potentially recoverable. First production from the field is expected in 2013. India, the world’s fourth-biggest oil importer, buys nearly 80 percent of its oil needs as expanding refining capacity has outpaced local oil output. State-run ONGC’s local oil output has been almost stagnant for years. ConocoPhillips said the carrying value of the assets related to its Kashagan interest was about $5.5 billion as of Sept. 30. The company said it would take an after-tax impairment of about $400 million in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2013. ONGC, India’s fifth-biggest company by market value, has been investing to maintain output from its old fields and has capital spending plans of around 340 billion Indian rupees ($6.12 billion) both this year and next. The company is under pressure from the government to meet rising demand. The acquisition is the largest ever for ONGC, and marks the biggest outbound deal from India since mobile phone operator Bharti Airtel bought mobile phone operations in 15 African countries for $9 billion in 2010 from Kuwait-based   telecoms group Zain. ONGC Videsh, the arm of ONGC that invests in overseas assets, said the acquisition would likely add 1 million tonnes (20,000 barrels per day) to its annual production over 25 years with the company’s share of output significantly higher in later stages of development. ONGC Videsh’s production in the year to March 31, 2012 was 8.7 million tonnes. Kazakhstan, home to 3 percent of the world’s recoverable oil reserves and the largest former Soviet oil producer after Russia, has sought to revise deals struck with foreign energy companies in the lean post-Soviet years. ConocoPhillips has been conducting a disposal program to reduce its non-core overseas assets to reduce debt and increase its exploration and dividend budgets. It has already exceeded its target of asset sales worth $20 billion by the end of 2012, including the sale of its stake in Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest oil producer. “(The) purchase price of $5 billion is at the high end of our prior expectation of $4 to $5 billion,” analysts at Simmons and Co wrote in a note to clients. “This is a positive for ConocoPhillips as it marks important progress on their asset divestiture program, which is needed to support the capital program and dividend.” ConocoPhillips shares down slightly at $56.39 in early trading. The company said it notified government authorities in Kazakhstan, and its partners in the North Caspian Sea production-sharing agreement of its intention to sell the stake. Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev last month disclosed ConocoPhillips’ plans to sell its stake in the field.

528,COP,UPDATE 1-Vivergo UK biorefinery starts operations,"* Biorefinery will be one of the biggest in Europe * Potential customers include ConocoPhillips and Total LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Vivergo Fuels said on Thursday that its biorefinery near Hull in eastern England has started bioethanol production and is expected to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2013. The Saltend biorefinery, which will be one the biggest in Europe, will have the capacity to use 1.1 million tonnes of feed-grade wheat a year to produce 420 million litres of bioethanol, a type of alcohol that can be used as a petrol substitute. It will be Britain’s second large biorefinery and will also be able to produce 500,000 tonnes a year of animal feed. Vivergo is a joint venture between AB Sugar, BP  and DuPont. The other big biorefinery is operated by Ensus, which is owned by U.S. private equity funds the Carlyle Group and Riverstone. The Ensus plant in northeast England has similar capacity to the Vivergo operation. Biorefining breaks down the starch in wheat to sugars, which are then fermented into alcohol through a similar process to that used in a whisky distillery. The fuel produced by Vivergo has two potential customers near by in the ConocoPhillips Humber refinery and Total’s Lindsey Oil Refinery, but it can also be transported on tankers to major markets such as Rotterdam.",12062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/vivergo-biofuels/update-1-vivergo-uk-biorefinery-starts-operations-idUSL5E8N66DC20121206
529,COP,UPDATE 1-Conoco sets 2013 budget flat at $15.8 bln,"Dec 7 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said on Friday its capital budget next year will be flat at $15.8 billion, with more than half of the U.S. oil company’s spending directed toward North American oil and gas projects. Moderating North American crude oil prices and low gas prices are prompting many exploration and production companies to hold the line on spending in 2013 following several years of robust growth. Still, shale formations, seen as a less risky, lower-cost means of producing crude, are still attracting investment from companies both large and small. In 2013 about 60 percent of the U.S. oil and gas company’s capital expenditures be allocated to the company’s properties in basins like the Eagle Ford in south Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota that produce more valuable crude oil, Conoco said. Conoco also said it expects to complete its plan to sell up to $10 billion in less profitable assets next year. When the company has finished shedding oil and gas assets it no longer considers strategic, it will be “on track to deliver on our long-term annual growth goals of 3 to 5 percent on both volumes and margins, with a compelling dividend,” Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.

531,COP,UPDATE 1-India state oil firms persist on Canada oil sands bid,"* Consortium says still in running for oil sands assets * Expects that new Canadian rules will not rule out deal * No time frame for ConocoPhillips decision By Prashant Mehra and Nidhi Verma MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - India’s state oil companies intend to press ahead with plans to buy stakes in Canada’s oil sands and believe they will not run afoul of tougher Canadian rules on foreign ownership of the sector. A consortium of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Oil India Ltd and refiner Indian Oil Corp is among three bidders short listed to buy stakes in Canadian oil sands owned by ConocoPhillips. The assets could be worth up to $5 billion. “We are very much in race for Conoco’s assets,” an official at one of the Indian consortium partners told Reuters, declining to be identified. The consortium submitted its bid in July. “Our deal will not be affected as our understanding of the new rule is that JV (joint-venture) stake sale or non-controlling stake sale are welcomed by Canada. However complete takeover will be approved as an exception,” he added. On Friday, Canada approved a $15.1 billion bid by China’s CNOOC for Nexen and a $5.3 billion takeover of Progress Energy by Malaysia’s Petronas, but shut the door on similar deals in the future. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada would not deliver control of the country’s oil sands — the world’s third-largest reserves of crude — to another government. The tougher new approach restricts state-owned enterprises to minority stakes in Canadian enterprises except in “exceptional circumstances”. However, when announcing the changes last week, Harper said that state oil companies would still be allowed to take minority stakes in tar sands properties. “Our understanding is the restriction would apply only in the case of transactions at the corporate level and not at the asset level,” said a resources banker with a leading U.S. bank in India, declining to be identified. The ONGC-led consortium has not asked for any clarification yet on the new rule, the official said. T.K. Ananth Kumar, director of finance at Oil India Ltd, one of the consortium partners, said the group would be discussing the development with bankers. “Getting into unconventional energy is important for us. We want to get into this if the returns are good, that is why we have agreed to partner,” he told Reuters. In January, ConocoPhillips put stakes in six Alberta properties on the auction block. They produce 12,000 barrels of oil per day from a resource estimated to be as large as 30 billion barrels of bitumen. The one producing project in the package is Surmont, run in a joint venture with France’s Total SA. Located south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the steam-driven development pumps about 25,000 barrels per day. The partners are working to boost that to 136,000 bpd, starting in 2015. ConocoPhillips has not yet said when it will wrap up the sale process. Ken Lueers, the president of Conoco’s Canadian unit, declined to specify how many bids had been received for the properties. “We had targeted to raise $8 (billion) to $10 billion dollars in asset sales by the end of 2013,” Lueers told Reuters following a speech to a Toronto investment conference. “So we went through the marketing, we received the bids, a number of bids actually, and we’re continuing to evaluate them.” Rising energy demand in India and stagnant domestic output have made the country the world’s fourth-biggest crude importer. Western sanctions squeezing Iran, once India’s second-biggest supplier, have added urgency to New Delhi’s quest to secure additional energy sources. India’s state oil companies, tasked with scouting for oil and gas assets abroad to meet rising demand in the nearly $2 trillion economy, have moved with uncharacteristic speed in recent months to secure interests overseas. Last month, ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state-run ONGC, agreed to pay about $5 billion for ConocoPhillips’ 8.4 percent share of the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest oilfield discovery in four decades — which could boost its output by about 16 percent within a year. Earlier this year, it also agreed to pay $1 billion for a small stake in the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli (ACG) group of oil fields in Azerbaijan and a stake in an associated pipeline. State-run GAIL India is also considering buying liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets in Canada, Peru, and Trinidad put up for sale by Spain’s Repsol. The recent spate of expenditure could, however, hinder ONGC’s immediate efforts to make large-size deals such as the one for Conoco’s Canada assets, analysts said. “Because ONGC has just announced the Kashagan deal, it (the Canada deal) may be too much for them to take on quickly. There may not be such big deals for next 6-8 months,” said Dayanand Mittal, an oil and gas sector analyst at Mumbai’s Ambit Capital. “The IRR (internal rate of return) will be lower versus conventional oil-and-gas assets since capital expenditure is significantly higher,” he added.",12112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-canada-oil/update-1-india-state-oil-firms-persist-on-canada-oil-sands-bid-idUSL4N09L4EK20121211

533,COP,UPDATE 1-NuStar to further expand Eagle Ford crude oil system,"Dec 13 (Reuters) - NuStar Energy L.P will expand its crude oil pipeline system in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and build a new ship dock in Corpus Christi to better handle production growth in the prolific play, the company said on Thursday. The plan includes a long-term pipeline and terminal services agreement with ConocoPhillips, one of the Eagle Ford’s major producers. The pipeline system expansion will include a new 100,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) pipeline originating near Pawnee, Texas, that will connect to NuStar’s existing 12-inch system between Pettus and Three Rivers. NuStar also will connect its existing 12-inch pipeline to the company’s Oakville, Texas, terminal to deliver crude to its North Beach terminal. The company also aims to build the new ship dock to support the North Beach terminal under a long-term lease with the Port of Corpus Christi. That private dock and refinery connections will allow for more pipeline system expansions as Eagle Ford output grows, the company said. The pipeline expansion and dock projects will cost $100 million to $120 million. The pipeline project is slated to be finished in the fourth quarter next year, while the dock project is expected to be done by the first quarter of 2014, the company said. In July, NuStar completed a third pipeline to carry Eagle Ford crude to the Port of Corpus Christi, which gave the company ability to move 250,000 bpd to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.",12132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/nustar-expansion-eagleford/update-1-nustar-to-further-expand-eagle-ford-crude-oil-system-idUSL1E8ND8VS20121213

Houston-based ConocoPhillips’ will be a new entrant into a the sector in the world’s top energy user, which is believed to hold the world’s largest reserves of the gas. Shale gas is trapped in rocks and requires a technology called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to unleash. The Sinopec Exploration Southern Company, a Sinopec subsidiary will conduct research on the exploration, development and production of shale gas with ConocoPhillips’ China subsidiary in the Qijiang block, an area located in the southwestern Sichuan Basin, where rich shale gas is deeply embedded, Xinhua said, citing a statement from Sinopec Group  . ConocoPhillips will carry out two-dimensional seismic surveys and drill two wells in the block, according to the report. China officially launched the search for shale gas from late 2009 and has tiny commercial operations so far. The government expects large-scale shale gas development after 2015, saying the industry needs to first identify technology suitable to China’s complex geology. As many as 83 companies have made 152 bids for the right to explore shale gas deposits throughout China in a tender that opened in September and closed on Oct. 25. It covered 20 blocks with a total area of 20,002 square km (7,722 square miles).

536,COP,China's CNOOC a step closer to restart largest offshore oilfield,"BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - CNOOC Ltd is a step closer towards restarting China’s largest offshore oilfield after the government’s top economic planning agency approved a development plan for the Penglai 19-3, a company official said. The oilfield, in northern Bohai Bay, was shut in September 2011 after an oil spill. The National Development and Reform Commission has now approved an overall development plan for the oilfield, one of several steps necessary to restart production, said the official who declined to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. “The restart of production at Penglai 19-3 oilfield will still need to go through other government institutions and meet other requirements,” the official said without giving further details. U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips owns a 49 percent stake in the 168,000 barrel-per-day oilfield and acts as operator, while CNOOC Ltd has a 51 percent stake. The China’s State Oceanic Administration had described the spill, which began in June 2011, as a major accident caused by negligence. It said 6,200 square km of waters had been polluted. Operator ConocoPhillips China was ordered to halt all operations at the oilfield in September 2011 after failing to stop the leak.

540,COP,UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan buys ConocoPhillips stake in offshore oil block,"By Dmitry Solovyov ALMATY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan, seeking a greater role in large oil projects, has bought a 24.5-percent stake held by ConocoPhillips in the promising offshore oil block Nursultan in the Caspian, as the U.S. firm sheds overseas assets. Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas (KMG) will now own a 75.5-percent stake in the exploration and development project, and Abu Dhabi state investment company Mubadala  the remaining 24.5 percent, KMG said in a statement. The block, located in western Kazakhstan and covering an area of about 8,100 square km, contains an estimated 270 million tonnes of recoverable oil reserves and is expected to start commercial oil output in 2016. The deep-water field, which is also widely known as Block N, is currently being explored under a subsoil use contract signed by KMG, ConocoPhillips and Mubadala in 2009. “KMG’s increased participation in the N project demonstrates  systematic efforts taken by the national company to strengthen its role in exploration projects in Kazakhstan’s sector of the Caspian Sea,” the company said in a statement. Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s largest economy and second-largest oil producer after Russia, aspires to boost oil output to 130 million tonnes by the end of this decade. It plans to produce 82 million tonnes this year compared to 79.2 million tonnes in 2012. ConocoPhillips, which has been shedding its foreign assets to cut debt and increase investment in lower-cost domestic shale oil and gas, has also announced plans to sell its more valuable asset — an 8.4 percent stake in the mammoth Kashagan offshore field in the Caspian. Kashagan, the biggest oilfield discovery in over four decades which is expected to start production in the middle of this year, is instrumental in achieving Kazakhstan’s ambitious goal of boosting oil output by 60 percent by 2020. ConocoPhillips has said it intends to sell its Kashagan stake to ONGC Videsh, the investment arm of India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp, for about $5 billion. Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of global recoverable oil reserves, has expressed interest in buying the stake and has the right of first refusal on it. Kashagan holds an estimated 30 billion barrels of oil-in-place, of which 8-12 billion are potentially recoverable.

543,COP,Conoco shares off 4 percent; output forecast disappoints,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) shares were down 4 percent on Thursday, a day after the U.S. oil and natural gas company issued a production forecast that fell short of some Wall Street expectations. Conoco is pursuing a strategy aimed at growing production and growing returns to shareholders. To achieve that aim, Conoco is shedding older, less-profitable assets like its Nigerian operations while investing in high-growth areas like the oil-producing Eagle Ford formation in South Texas. The company has said its long-term production goal is for 3 to 5 percent growth, but output in the fourth quarter was flat at 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe) as asset dispostions weighed. [ID:nL1N0B006N] And on Wednesday Conoco said it sees full-year 2013 production of 1.475 million to 1.525 million boe per day. Maintenance and seasonal factors will negatively affect production in the second and third quarters, while a rebound is seen in the fourth quarter as output from new projects is added, the company said on a Thursday conference call with analysts. Analysts at Houston energy investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt characterized Conoco’s production forecast as “negative.” Tudor Pickering had expected full-year output of 1.531 million boe per day, it said in a note to clients.

PetroChina will acquire 20 percent of Poseidon gas field in the Browse Basin offshore Western Australia and 29 percent of onshore shale formation Goldwyer in the Canning Basin in the same region. According to Conoco’s website, the company owns 60 percent of some exploration permits in the Browse Basin. Karoon Gas Australia Ltd holds the remaining interests. The deal comes two months after PetroChina agreed to buy BHP Billiton’s  stake in the Woodside Petroleum-led  Browse LNG project, estimated to cost $30 billion to build. State-owned Petrochina has set aside $16 billion for overseas investment in 2013. China’s state-owned energy giants have been bidding aggressively for foreign oil and gas fields as Beijing looks to secure energy supplies to meet rising demand. The country aims to double the share of gas in its overall energy mix to more than 8 percent by 2015. Under Wednesday’s deal, ConocoPhillips and PetroChina will also study the potential for unconventional resource development in the 500,000 acre Neijiang-Dazu Shale formation in the Sichuan Basin in southwestern China.

551,COP,Alaska villagers sue to void key permit for Conoco field,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Residents of an Inupiat Eskimo village on Alaska’s North Slope have sued the U.S. government in an effort to overturn a crucial permit allowing a ConocoPhillips oilfield near their homes. The lawsuit, filed late on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, challenges a wetlands-fill permit issued in 2011 that allows ConocoPhillips to build a road, bridge and above-ground pipeline connecting its CD-5 prospect to existing oilfield facilities. The plaintiffs are seven residents of Nuiqsut, a village of 428 people located 9 miles southeast of the CD-5 prospect. “This project will add a bridge, road and traffic to one of our most important fishing and hunting areas,” Sam Kunaknana, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement on Thursday. The CD-5 field, which ConocoPhillips hopes to bring into production in late 2015, would provide the first commercially produced oil ever from the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a huge federal land unit on the western North Slope. It would also be the North Slope’s western-most producing field and, its supporters hope, a gateway to small satellite fields in the reserve that would feed into the Conoco-operated Alpine field, a major oil producer located on state land. ConocoPhillips temporarily shelved the CD-5 project after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 2010 denied its application for a permit allowing the bridge, road and suspended pipeline. The Corps had ruled, based on opinions from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Environmental Protection Agency, that the field could be developed with an underground pipeline instead. ConocoPhillips has long argued that the bridge, roads and above-ground pipeline are necessary to build CD-5 and ship out its oil. Development of other oilfields farther west is feasible only if all that is built, Conoco and Alaskan leaders argue. The Corps in December 2011 reversed its permit denial, after ConocoPhillips appealed and the Fish and Wildlife Service relented on its opposition. The Corps cited design changes and reconsideration of maintenance challenges for a buried pipeline. ConocoPhillips in October formally sanctioned CD-5 development, and construction was expected to start in the winter of 2014. But the Nuiqsut villagers argue that the Corps should have stuck with its original decision. “Things haven’t changed since the first finding by the Corps that building the bridge was not the least environmentally practicable alternative,” said the villagers’ attorney, Brian Litmans of environmental law firm Trustees for Alaska. Allowing a riskier alternative violated the Clean Water Act, he added. The planned multi-segment bridge threatens villagers’ fish supplies, among other resources, while any spill from the pipeline would be “catastrophic,” tainting an entire river delta considered a highly important Arctic habitat, the lawsuit says. A spokesman for the Corps’ Alaska District said the agency could not yet comment on the lawsuit’s specific allegations. “We have just received a copy of the complaint filed and have not had a chance to review it in its entirety. However, the Corps went through a very rigorous review of the project and is confident in the record of decision,” spokesman Curt Biberdorf said in an email on Thursday. ConocoPhillips had no comment on the lawsuit, a spokeswoman said. Another lawsuit challenging the CD-5 permit is pending. The Center for Biological Diversity on Thursday sent notice to the Corps of its plans to sue over alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act.",3012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/conocophillips-alaska/alaska-villagers-sue-to-void-key-permit-for-conoco-field-idUSL1N0BT00X20130301

553,COP,ConocoPhillips on track to drill in Arctic waters next year,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska, March 7 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips  plans to drill up to two exploration wells in remote Arctic waters next year and is undeterred by numerous setbacks suffered there by rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc, a Conoco official said Thursday. The oil major is targeting a prospect called Devils Paw in the Chukchi Sea, Mike Faust, the Chukchi program manager, said at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) annual Arctic Open Water Meeting. ConocoPhillips’ exploration plan is under review by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and the company expects to submit additional information next week, Faust added. The Chukchi, off northwestern Alaska, is where Shell began drilling its Burger prospect in a season abbreviated by permit problems, floating ice interference and vessel mishaps. Shell also started drilling a well in the Beaufort Sea off northern Alaska. Shell announced last week it would skip drilling in 2013 so it can improve its equipment, including a drillship damaged in a Dec. 31 grounding in the Gulf of Alaska and another that needs repairs to be allowed back into Arctic waters. Both vessels are bound for Asian shipyards. Faust said ConocoPhillips would take Shell’s experience into account, but said there were key differences between their respective Arctic efforts. Devils Paw is farther south in the Chukchi than Shell’s prospects, so ConocoPhillips’ operations will be in an area where sea ice melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the fall, meaning a longer open-water season in most years, he said. ConocoPhillips also plans to use a jackup rig, with legs that will rest directly on the sea floor, rather than a mobile drillship like the two used by Shell. The rig ConocoPhillips will deploy is being built by Noble  and will be designed for extreme weather conditions, Faust told the NOAA meeting. “We’re not going to bring up a 30-year-old piece of equipment,” he added. Shell’s drillships are decades old, and refurbished for Arctic conditions. The Kulluk, which is grounded, is owned by Shell and was used in the Beaufort, while Noble-owned Discoverer operated in the Chukchi under contract. Both racked up several air-quality violations, and the Discoverer was cited by the U.S. Coast Guard for 16 safety and environmental deficiencies now being investigated by the Justice Department. Alaska Native leaders at the NOAA meeting said they were skeptical about ConocoPhillips’ ability to avoid ice hazards and control pollution and noise that would disturb marine mammals. Even the name is bothersome for an “area we use for resources,” said Harry Brower, head of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission. “Devils Paw - that’s kind of insulting,” he added. Faust said the rig would be able to pull out of the area quickly if ice conditions became dangerous. He promised that ConocoPhillips would consult with Inupiat Eskimo residents to avoid conflicts, and cited a long history in Arctic Alaska. As for the name, it came from a mountain peak in the Wrangell Range of eastern Alaska, he added.",3082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/conocophillips-alaska/conocophillips-on-track-to-drill-in-arctic-waters-next-year-idUSL1N0C01I220130308

556,COP,China eyes ConocoPhillips' Kashagan stake-Kazakh minister,"ASTANA (Reuters) - China has shown an interest in buying the stake of U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips (COP.N) in a multinational consortium developing Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan oilfield, Kazakh Oil & Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev said on Tuesday. “Kazakhstan has not yet taken such a decision, but there is such a possibility,” Mynbayev told reporters. He declined to say which company or government body represented China in talks with Kazakhstan over Kashagan. Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s largest oil producer and the second-largest post-Soviet producer after Russia, has the pre-emptive right to buy out the 8.4-percent stake owned by ConocoPhillips in Kashagan. ConocoPhillips, which has been shedding overseas assets to cut debt and increase its investment in lower-cost domestic shale oil and gas, has said it intends to sell its Kashagan stake to India’s state-run oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS) for about $5 billion. Kazakhstan has until late May to decide whether to buy out the stake of ConocoPhillips, and Mynbayev said that further options would depend on the terms to be proposed by other parties also wishing to own this stake. He declined to speculate whether India or China would have a better chance of owning the stake. “If the terms offered by one side are significantly better than those of the other potential buyer, then the logic (of choice) of the authorities of Kazakhstan will be crystal-clear,” Mynbayev said. Kashagan, the world’s biggest oilfield discovery in more than 40 years, holds an estimated 30 billion barrels of oil-in-place, of which 8 billion to 12 billion barrels are potentially recoverable, with first production expected in the middle of this year. Kazakhstan, a vast nation of 17 million, is home to 3 percent of the world’s recoverable oil reserves. It has moved in recent years to exert greater management control and secure bigger revenues from foreign-owned oil and gas developments.

The purchase would highlight a growing strategic partnership between Kazakhstan and China as Astana diverts more crude eastward towards its energy-hungry neighbour and away from saturated European markets. A sale of Kashagan equity to a Chinese company would ensure that a healthy share of oil from the Caspian Sea field, containing 12 billion barrels of reserves, will flow over the shared eastern border between the two countries. One of the source said the Chinese side, likely China National Petroleum Corp, would pay around $5.3-$5.4 billion for the stake in the North Caspian Operation Company (NCOC), but the final price was not determined. The other two sources did not provide price details. CNPC was not available for comment. “(They) will chase (the stake) very aggressively as the Beijing authority is desperate to fill the empty oil pipeline from the Caspian side to Xinjiang,” said Keun-Wook Paik, a fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies specialising in China’s energy ties with former Soviet states. The sale could be a complex three-sided one, with state oil company Kazmunaigas taking control of the 8.4 percent stake in the field operator from ConocoPhillips, which is whittling down its worldwide portfolio, possibly backed by a Chinese loan. Then the stake could be resold to a Chinese oil company, whole or in part, two of the sources said. Kazakhstan has pre-emptive purchase rights and its decision is due on Tuesday, July 2.

565,COP,UPDATE 1-CNPC to pay over $5 bln in Kashagan oil stake,"(Adds background, details) By Katya Golubkova MOSCOW, July 1 (Reuters) - Chinese state oil firm CNPC  will buy a stake in Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan oil project, through back-to-back deals with Kazmunaigaz through which ConocoPhillips will exit, the Kazakh state oil firm said on Monday. Lyazzat Kiinov, chief executive of Kazmunaigaz, confirmed the deal structure on the fringes of a summit of gas exporting nations in Moscow, telling Reuters that CNPC would pay more than $5 billion for the stake. Conoco, which is in the process of whittling down its worldwide portfolio, has an 8.4 percent stake in the Kashagan project operator. Kiinov said he hoped the transaction would be completed quickly. Sources familiar with the deal told Reuters last Friday CNPC was set to win Conoco’s stake in the world’s largest oil find in five decades, as Kazakhstan diverts more oil eastward towards energy-hungry China and away from saturated European markets. They evaluated that CNPC would pay around $5.3-5.4 billion for the stake in the giant offshore field in the Caspian Sea. Kazakhstan, home to 3 percent of the world’s recoverable oil reserves, has moved in recent years to exert greater management control and secure bigger revenues from foreign-owned oil and gas projects. Kazmunaigas entered the Kashagan consortium as a shareholder in 2005 and has since then doubled its stake to 16.81 percent. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and visiting British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday cut the ribbon to open the Bolashak (Future) oil plant which will process crude flowing from Kashagan. Kashagan, with reserves estimated at 35 billion barrels of oil in place, is expected to produce its first oil in September. Nazarbayev, who has ruled his resource-rich Central Asian nation of 17 million for more than two decades, said last week that a multinational consortium developing the field had  invested $48 billion in about 13 years, making it the costliest oil project in the world. During Kashagan’s development, production will be gradually ramped up to 370,000 barrels per day in the second stage from 180,000 bpd in the first stage in 2013-14, North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), which develops the field, said in a statement. “Future development projects bear the potential to significantly increase production volumes and position Kashagan as an important contributor to the world energy market,” it said. Italy’s ENI, U.S. major ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and France’s Total currently all hold 16.81 percent stakes in Kashagan. Japan’s Inpex  owns 7.56 percent.

566,COP,ConocoPhillips raises dividend by 4.5 percent,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) raised its dividend by 4.5 percent, the first hike in more than two years, as it seeks to increase returns to shareholders by shedding assets and boosting output. ConocoPhillips is selling older, less-profitable assets while investing in high-growth areas such as the oil-producing Eagle Ford formation in South Texas. It is looking to offload its Nigerian assets and will sell its stake in a Kazakhstan oilfield. The company said it would pay a dividend of 69 cents per share, up from 66 cents a share. The dividend is payable on September 3 to shareholders at the close of business on July 22.

569,COP,"ConocoPhillips to pay BP, Exxon for Alaska pipeline costs","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, Alaska’s top-volume oil producer, will pay about $264 million to BP Plc to help cover the cost of transporting crude through the Trans Alaska Pipeline (TAPS), under a settlement approved on Tuesday by federal officials. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it approved the deal between the three TAPS owners - BP, Conoco and Exxon Mobil Corp - on how to share costs for shipping oil down the 800-mile pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to the port of Valdez. Under the plan, first proposed in September, Conoco owes the $264 million to BP, which has the biggest share of TAPS, for pipeline costs dating back to August 1, 2012, according to the settlement. Conoco agreed to pay Exxon $8.89 million for costs over the same period, while BP will pay Exxon $1.8 million. BP owns nearly half of TAPS, while Conoco has 29 percent and Exxon the rest, according to operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. But Conoco, with a 36 percent share in the Greater Prudhoe Bay unit and large stakes in other fields, produces over 35 percent of the oil coming from Alaska’s North Slope, according to state and company figures from 2012. “This agreement seeks to better align how costs are distributed among the TAPS owners,” Dawn Patience, a spokeswoman for BP in Alaska, said in an email. The settlement covers a period that started when the three major North Slope producers became sole owners of TAPS. Two companies with minor shares, Koch Industries’ Koch Alaska Pipeline Co and Chevron-owned Unocal Pipeline Company, relinquished their combined 4.4 percent ownership last summer, allowing their shares to be allocated between the other three. There are lingering questions about how the shares of the what FERC calls the “Exiting Carriers” will be managed and how costs prior to August 1, 2012, are allocated, but they fall outside of the settlement approved on Tuesday. Neither Koch, Chevron nor the state of Alaska objects to the new deal between the remaining three, the approval order said. Over the years, there have been many disputes about pipeline costs and how they should be shared. In 1985, the FERC approved a settlement between the state of Alaska and the then-numerous pipeline owners that allowed specific transportation tariffs for each company. That settlement deal expired at the end of 2008. Since the mid-1980s, the number of TAPS owners has dwindled, largely because of company mergers. North Slope output averaged 515,646 barrels per day for the first half of July, according to state figures. It peaked in 1988 above 2 million barrels a day.

575,COP,"Conoco in $720 million oil sands deal with Exxon, Imperial","(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is selling its stake in a Canadian oil sands project to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) for about $720 million as it focuses on its U.S. shale oil and natural gas operations. The all-cash deal involves the sale of 226,000 acres of undeveloped land, roughly 93 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta, to Exxon Mobil’s Canadian unit and Imperial, which is 70 percent controlled by Exxon. After the deal closes, Exxon Canada will own a 72.5 percent interest in the land, known as the Clyden oil sands leasehold, with Imperial controlling the rest. The deal is a natural fit for Exxon, which has invested $11 billion in its Kearl oil sands project in northwest Alberta, and gives it access to even more oil to boost its global daily production, which has slid in recent quarters. Calgary-based Imperial already operates four oil sands projects in Canada and said the stake it is buying from Conoco is a “high-quality addition” to its portfolio. Conoco, which has been trying to sell the Clyden stake for months, expects to record a after-tax gain of about $450 million from the sale. The deal, worth about $3,186 per acre, is a “fair price” for Conoco, said Simmons & Co analyst Jeff Dietert, considering the Clyden land is largely undeveloped and similar deals since 2005 have sold for an average price of $2,550 per acre, “We think this is a positive deal for (Conoco) and marks the first of potentially more deals in their oil sands rebalancing efforts as they reduce their oil sands footprint through the remainder of this year and into next,” he said. Exploration and production companies such as Conoco and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) have placed billions of dollars of oil and gas properties up for sale in the past year to focus capital on projects that generate higher returns. Since the beginning of 2012, Conoco has sold stakes in projects in Montana, North Dakota, Australia, Nigeria and Algeria for a total of about $13.5 billion. On a conference call last week with investors, Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance said the company would continue to sell “non-strategic assets,” such as oil sands properties, and use the cash to invest in growth areas like the Texas Eagle Ford shale. “These are great assets, but one where we believe we’re a bit overweighted in our portfolio today,” Lance said on the call, speaking of Canadian oil sands and other assets he may sell. Last year Conoco spun off its refining operations into Phillips 66 (PSX.N). Investors mostly shrugged off the deal. Shares in Conoco rose 0.6 percent to $66.91.

579,COP,ConocoPhillips plans new well in Alaska national reserve,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has applied for permits to develop a new field in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, a vast unit of federal land that has yet to yield commercially produced oil, according to the federal agency managing the reserve. ConocoPhillips applied to drill a production well at a site it calls GMT1, part of the Greater Mooses Tooth unit established in an area where its exploration wells struck oil, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) spokeswoman Erin Curtis said on Friday. The company has also applied for a permit to build roads and other infrastructure needed to access the site, Curtis said. A decision by senior corporate leaders on whether to sanction the project is expected in the second half of 2014, said Amy Burnett, a spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips in Alaska. The Indiana-sized reserve, on the western side of the North Slope, was established in 1923 by President Warren Harding to provide fuel to the military. However, the big North Slope oil discoveries and all production to date have been east of the reserve on state land in and around the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk fields. Conoco, with minority partner Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N), aims to change that pattern and produce oil from federal land on the North Slope. They have been the most active explorers in the reserve since the BLM launched a series of lease sales in 1999. The companies are developing another field, called CD-5, on the far eastern edge of the reserve that is expected to come on line in 2015. CD-5 would be linked by pipeline and a road to the Conoco-operated Alpine field under the company’s plan. CD-5 construction is expected in the winter of 2014, Burnett said. That development was delayed by a dispute over a wetlands-fill permit needed to build the road, pipeline and an aircraft landing strip. The Army Corps of Engineers then issued it a permit in late 2011 after Conoco, the Fish and Wildlife Service and other organizations negotiated a compromise plan. Expansion at GMT1 was eased by the planned CD-5 development, Burnett said in an email, adding that a recent controversial cut in state oil taxes also helped. The plans to expand in the reserve come after Conoco put ambitious offshore Arctic plans on the back burner. It said in April it would not seek to drill in 2014 in the remote Chukchi Sea off northwestern Alaska, where it spent more than $500 million in 2008 to acquire leases. Other companies also have plans to drill in the reserve. Three permits are held by Australia-based Linc Energy and two by Houston-based Hilcorp, both relatively new operators in Alaska. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the sprawling reserve contains 896 million barrels of technically recoverable oil. It is also home to wildlife and considered by the region’s native Inupiat people to be an important area for fishing and hunting. The BLM plans another lease sale in November, the ninth in the series that started in 1999. Curtis said the level of industry interest is as yet unclear.

Poland, whose hopes for shale gas faded after three international firms quit after disappointing drilling results, has been looking for signs of bigger quantities of the unconventional gas, which could help it reduce its reliance on Russia. “Lane Energy Poland confirms the Lebien 2H well is currently flowing some natural gas, however at non-commercial rates,” Laurie St. Aubin, President of Lane Energy said in a statement sent to Reuters, confirming a report by Rzeczpospolita daily. Lane Energy started production testing at its well in the northern city of Lebork in July. Although the daily amount of gas being produced there still does not qualify as commercial production, is the largest obtained in any shale gas well so far in Europe, the newspaper said. “It is too early in the exploration phase to determine if there is opportunity for commercial success,” St. Aubin also said, adding that more wells will need to be drilled to confirm gas can be flowed at commercial rates. The company plans two or more wells through 2014. “This is very good news for Poland and European oil geology,” Piotr Wozniak, deputy environment minister and Poland’s chief geologist, was quoted as saying.

Poland, which consumes 15 billion cubic metres of gas a year, mostly imported from Russia, has estimated its recoverable shale gas reserves at up to 768 billion cubic metres. It has issued more than 100 shale gas exploration licences to local and international firms which have drilled 48 wells to date.

585,COP,Venezuela lacked good faith in ConocoPhillips seizure - World Bank,"HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela failed to act in good faith or properly compensate ConocoPhillips (COP.N) for three big oil assets the country expropriated in 2007, a World Bank arbitration panel said on Wednesday The partial ruling, which limited the scope of the company’s claims by excluding future tax credits, did not determine how much money Venezuela must pay the U.S.-based company. The company’s projects were taken over during the leftwing administration of deceased former President Hugo Chavez, who led a wave of nationalizations that included the oil, electricity and steel industries. “The respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value,” said the ruling by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The company claimed victory, but a final ruling on damages could take one or two more years, according to experts. “This ruling sends a clear message that countries cannot expropriate their investments without fair compensation,” said Janet Langford Kelly, a senior vice president of the company. ConocoPhillips initially asked Venezuela for $30 billion in compensation for its stakes in the Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy crude upgraders and a separate offshore project called Corocoro, but Venezuela offered no more than $2 billion. The core of the dispute, the biggest against Venezuela before an arbitration body, is over how to place a value on the assets. ConocoPhillips demands payment based on market prices, while Venezuela has offered to pay according to book value, which would be much lower. In 2007, ConocoPhillips took an after-tax charge against its earnings of $4.5 billion related to its properties in Venezuela. At the time, the Houston-based company said it believed the assets were worth much more, but that was the amount allowed under U.S. accounting rules. Wells Fargo said that the initial write-down value is “a good place to start” when determining what the payment should be, even though it is significantly less that ConocoPhillips’s estimate. ConocoPhillips shares were up 1.4 percent in afternoon trade at $67.73. Venezuelan Petroleum Minister Rafael Ramirez harshly criticized the panel and ConocoPhillips. “We reject the tribunal’s affirmation that we did not negotiate in good faith. We reached deals with other companies, such as Chevron,” he said. Several major foreign oil companies, including Chevron Corp (CVX.N), reached agreements with the Chavez government to pay higher taxes and royalties, and give up majority stakes in projects while hanging onto minority ones. ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips did not reach accords with Venezuela and eventually pressed their claims in arbitration. Venezuela has more than 20 arbitration cases pending at ICSID and other courts stemming from Chavez’s nationalizations. The country pulled out of the ICSID in 2012, but will still be subject to cases submitted beforehand. Analysts said the ruling could bode well for ExxonMobil’s case at ICSID. Exxon received $908 million from state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) last year after a separate ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce over the same claim. Ramirez said he would ask for a new chance to show the panel that the country acted in good faith. “Let’s see if the court respects what PDVSA and Conoco signed when they became partners. They agreed at that moment that any indemnification would have a top of $27 per barrel, not 100 dollars that is the current crude price.

586,COP,UPDATE 2-Venezuela lacked good faith in ConocoPhillips seizure -World Bank,"* Final ruling may take 1-2 years * Company took charge of $4.5 billion * Venezuelan minister says will ask panel to review finding By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON/CARACAS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Venezuela failed to act in good faith or properly compensate ConocoPhillips for three big oil assets the country expropriated in 2007, a World Bank arbitration panel said on Wednesday The partial ruling, which limited the scope of the company’s claims by excluding future tax credits, did not determine how much money Venezuela must pay the U.S.-based company. The company’s projects were taken over during the leftwing administration of deceased former President Hugo Chavez, who led a wave of nationalizations that included the oil, electricity and steel industries. “The respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value,” said the ruling by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The company claimed victory, but a final ruling on damages could take one or two more years, according to experts. “This ruling sends a clear message that countries cannot expropriate their investments without fair compensation,” said Janet Langford Kelly, a senior vice president of the company. ConocoPhillips initially asked Venezuela for $30 billion in compensation for its stakes in the Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy crude upgraders and a separate offshore project called Corocoro, but Venezuela offered no more than $2 billion. The core of the dispute, the biggest against Venezuela before an arbitration body, is over how to place a value on the assets. ConocoPhillips demands payment based on market prices, while Venezuela has offered to pay according to book value, which would be much lower. In 2007, ConocoPhillips took an after-tax charge against its earnings of $4.5 billion related to its properties in Venezuela. At the time, the Houston-based company said it believed the assets were worth much more, but that was the amount allowed under U.S. accounting rules. Wells Fargo said that the initial write-down value is “a good place to start” when determining what the payment should be, even though it is significantly less that ConocoPhillips’s estimate.

588,COP,Venezuela seeks new World Bank hearing in Conoco dispute,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Wednesday that U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) rejected its latest offer of compensation for the 2007 nationalization of oil projects and the South American country now seeks a new hearing on the matter with the World Bank. Venezuela was responding to a World Bank arbitration panel, that last week said the South American country had failed to act in good faith or properly compensate the U.S. company for three big oil projects that were expropriated by the socialist government of the late Hugo Chavez. Venezuela’s lawyers Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP - in a letter published by Energy Ministry Rafael Ramirez on Twitter on Wednesday - denied the allegations and asked the tribunal for a hearing. “ConocoPhillips was ready to reach a deal for $6.5 billion,” the letter said. But, Venezuela only offered $2.3 billion, it said. Venezuela’s lawyers said $2.3 billion was higher than the estimate of the assets’ value which their experts had arrived at: about $1.8 billion, excluding tax and royalties claims. “An offer in excess of a professional, good-faith valuation is by definition a good-faith offer,” the letter said. A ConocoPhillips spokeswoman rejected that interpretation. “Venezuela never formally offered to pay ConocoPhillips fair compensation for our expropriated assets. In fact, the Tribunal’s recent decision found that Venezuela failed to negotiate in good faith,” the spokeswoman told Reuters on Wednesday. Last week’s partial ruling by the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) did not determine how much money Venezuela must pay the U.S.-based company.

591,COP,UPDATE 3-Conoco turns homeward for oil growth,"* Expects about $9 bln from asset sales in Kazakhstan, Algeria, Nigeria * Third-quarter profit up 39 pct, beats estimates * Trims full-year production forecast, cites Libya disruption * A Libya sale would be difficult-CFO By Garima Goel and Anna Driver Oct 31 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, abandoning higher-risk assets in favor of oilfields closer to home, said it expects proceeds of nearly $9 billion from the sale of its interests in Kazakhstan, Algeria and Nigeria. Conoco’s plan to focus on North America was reinforced on Thursday when the largest independent U.S. oil producer trimmed its output forecast for the year due to unrest in Libya. The reduced forecast was the main black spot in Houston-based Conoco’s third-quarter results. The company reported a better-than-expected 39 percent jump in profit, due in part to higher oil and natural gas prices. ConocoPhillips, like rival U.S. oil producers Occidental Petroleum Corp and Hess Corp, is selling some of its assets abroad to reduce exposure to conflict and political risk, focusing instead on the shale oil boom at home. “What they are doing now is derisking the portfolio by returning more toward North America,” said Brian Youngberg, an energy company analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Conoco has sold its minority interest in the international consortium developing the Kashagan project in Kazakhstan - a mammoth project in the Caspian Sea that has proven to be the world’s most expensive oilfield. The company has struck separate deals to sell its Algerian business unit to Indonesian state oil firm Pertamina, and its Nigerian assets to a local oil firm, Oando. Conoco said on Thursday that these three transactions were expected to generate proceeds of about $9 billion. It did not say when it expected to realize these proceeds. With the Kashagan sale having closed, it was a “clear positive” that Conoco would now be able to access the proceeds, analysts at Houston-based energy investment bank Simmons & Co wrote in a note. The company said its third-quarter profit, which rose to $2.5 billion from $1.8 billion a year earlier, was also bolstered by the sale of the undeveloped Clyden oil sands in Canada and assets in Trinidad and Tobago. But Conoco, citing “ongoing production disruptions” in Libya, said it expected full-year production from continuing operations to be in a range of 1.505 million to 1.515 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day. It had earlier forecast output in 2013 to be 1.515 million to 1.530 million boe per day. “Libya for us is about 50,000 barrels a day that’s now at zero essentially and we don’t have any good insight as to when that might return to production,” Conoco Chief Financial Officer Jeff Sheets said in an interview. “We don’t anticipate we are going to do anything with our Libya position in the near term because there is a fair bit of uncertainty there.” A sale would be difficult in today’s market, the executive said. Libya’s oil exports have plunged in recent weeks to around 10 percent of its capacity before the 2011 civil war broke out, as renewed protests have halted operations at ports and fields. The interim government there has struggled to kick-start development and deliver on expectations of a higher living standard since Muammar Gaddafi’s fall. Hess Corp, which reported its third-quarter results this week, also cited unrest in Libya as the main reason for a sharp reduction in production and profit. “Nothing really positive is coming at this point from Libya for anybody,” said Youngberg. Back home in the United States, production from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian shale deposits rose 40 percent in the third quarter, Conoco said. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.47 per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with the average analysts’ estimate of $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Conoco’s shares edged up 49 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $73.74 on the New York Stock Exchange.",10312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/conocophillips-results/update-3-conoco-turns-homeward-for-oil-growth-idUSL3N0IL56020131031

605,COP,Legal challenges delay Chevron's $1 bln Nigeria oil block sales,"* Delays could limit sale profits, scupper deals * Shell, Total, Eni, ConocoPhillips also divesting * Nigeria firms, partnered with foreign, bidding By Joe Brock ABUJA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Chevron faces delays in closing sales of oil blocks in Nigeria worth up to $1 billion because of legal disputes involving potential buyers, industry sources say, highlighting a risk other oil majors could face. Chevron is joining competitors ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, France’s Total and Italy’s Eni  in disposing of stakes in onshore and shallow water offshore fields in the Niger Delta region. OPEC-member Nigeria has the potential to double its 2 million-2.5 million barrel per day oil output in the next five years but problems with oil theft, pipeline sabotage and regulatory uncertainty are putting off investment. Oil majors want to keep hold of the biggest producing fields, offshore assets and key pipelines and export terminals.  But they are disposing of less profitable onshore blocks and  fields that the government could strip from them if they remain undeveloped for ten years, notably in the restive Niger Delta. Chevron has chosen its preferred bidders for the five blocks it put up for sale in June but the deals have not closed because rival firms have disputed its decision, with one taking the U.S. company to court, sources close to the deals said. A Chevron spokeswoman said the company did not comment on ongoing transactions. Nigerian firm Brittania-U, run by former Chevron executive Catherine Uju Ifejika, was the highest bidder at over $1 billion for the biggest cluster of blocks - OML 52, 53 and 55 - and Chevron began discussions with the company over the sale, two banking sources close to the deal said. Chevron decided to look at alternative bids after Brittania-U did not show sufficient evidence it could muster the amount promptly, banking and oil industry sources said. Brittania-U did not respond to requests for comment. Chevron then agreed to sell the biggest block, OML 53, to Seplat, which is partly owned by French oil explorer Maurel & Prom and Swiss-based commodity trader Mercuria, while OML 52 would go to local firm Amni Petroleum and the smallest, OML 55, to Belema Oil, run by a local Delta community. None of the companies responded to request for comment. A Nigerian federal high court issued an interim injunction in December stopping Chevron from selling the blocks to Seplat and others after Brittania-U brought action against the U.S. major saying it had already agreed a deal to buy the assets, court documents showed. Chevron could earn between $700 million and $900 million for the three blocks, two sources involved in bids said. The three blocks had proven reserves of 555 million barrels of oil equivalent, with the biggest block OML 53 holding 310 million of those reserves, two oil industry sources said, citing a Chevron memorandum given to bidders. Court cases can drag on for years in Nigeria and the longer the delay the less profit oil majors are likely to make from the deals and the greater the chances the sales could fall through altogether. Such litigation also slows down the potential oil and gas production increases that could be felt from new buyers exploiting assets left undeveloped by oil majors. ConocoPhillips has waited for more than a year to close a $1.6 billion deal with Nigeria’s biggest energy company, Oando  , for its business in Africa’s biggest oil producer because the local firm has taken more than a year to raise finance. Oando plans to raise $193 million in a share issue to help finance the deal, banking sources said in December, and the company has said the acquisition will be completed early this year. Chevron has also agreed to sell two smaller blocks - OML 83 and 85 - to Nigerian firm First Exploration and Production with a bid of around $100 million but the deal has not been completed and rival bidders are also considering disputing this deal, the two banking sources said. They did not give details of which companies might challenge the sale. First E&P;’s Chairman Henry Odein Ajumogobia is a former foreign affairs minister and its Managing Director Ademola Adeyemi-Bero spent five year working at BG Group. Chevron and First E&P; declined to comment. Shell, Total and Eni are selling a combined 45 percent stake in at least four more oil blocks with combined production of around 70,000 barrels per day. Bids on these blocks are due next month, sources said. Shell, the biggest producer in Nigeria, has sold eight oil blocks in the Niger Delta for a total $1.8 billion since 2010 and some industry sources believe the Anglo-Dutch major may have the experience needed to get deals agreed. “It’s not about the highest bid, it’s about which buyer has the know-how and the connections to get the deals done,” one executive at a Nigerian company said.",1132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/chevron-nigeria/legal-challenges-delay-chevrons-1-bln-nigeria-oil-block-sales-idUSL5N0ID3A220140113
606,COP,Conoco beats expectations as bigger oil rivals struggle,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil producer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) outshone larger competitors on Thursday with a quarterly profit that beat expectations as it moved to overcome the problems of high costs and lack of fresh reserves that have nagged at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil company without refining operations, said its profits were helped by the sale of its Algerian business and by higher crude oil production in North America. The company shed its refining business in 2012 and has sold billions of dollars of lower-yielding assets to focus on more profitable oil production from North American shale basins such as the Eagle Ford in south Texas. Analysts said Conoco’s plan is beginning to pay off at a time when the industry faces pressure from shareholders to lift returns despite flat oil prices and rising costs for risky exploration work designed to replace reserves. Conoco’s profit in the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, or $2.00 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, profits inched down, though analysts characterized Conoco’s reserve replacement ratio, a measure of a company’s ability to find new oil and gas reserves to replace what is produced, as strong. On a preliminary basis, Conoco’s proved reserves rose 3 percent from a year earlier to 8.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). Proved organic reserve additions are expected to be about 1.1 billion BOE for a replacement ratio of 179 percent of 2013 production. In a note to clients, Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse dubbed Conoco the best performing large oil company, citing 7 percent growth in cash flow despite asset sales, a reduced share count and more cash on the balance sheet. “I think we’re seeing pretty good evidence that the strategy is working,” Jeff Sheets, Conoco’s chief financial officer, said, citing cash margin growth and expected gains in production. Conoco’s shares rose slightly, while those of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), the fourth-largest U.S. oil and gas company, edged lower even though it reported a quarterly profit that beat expectations. At $2.04 per share, Occidental’s earnings were significantly higher than the 42 cents per share earned a year earlier, when the company wrote down the value of gas properties in the U.S. midcontinent by $1.1 billion. At Shell, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, just a month on the job, set out plans to make the world’s No. 3 investor-owned oil company leaner, putting a new focus on increasing cash, while scrapping an Arctic drilling program. “Our overall strategy remains robust, but 2014 will be a year where we are changing emphasis, to improve our returns and cash flow performance,” van Beurden said. “Our returns are at this point in time too low to be considered competitive.” This year, Shell plans to slash spending to $37 billion from $46 billion and to increase asset dispositions to $15 billion - about 6.5 percent of its $228 billion market capitalization - from $1.7 billion in 2013. The promises, along with a higher dividend, helped lift Shell’s shares 1 percent to 2,147 pence. Shell’s fourth-quarter earnings, excluding identified items and on a current cost of supply basis, came in at $2.9 billion, 48 percent lower than in the year-before quarter but in line with the downgraded forecast Shell gave on January 17, making the quarter its least profitable for five years. Shares of Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company by market value, were down 0.5 percent at $94.60 after the company posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and failed to offset declining production with fresh reserves. The results reflected a “mediocre quarter” for Exxon, especially in international production, Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said. “They’ve lost momentum already, reverting back to declining production and stagnant earnings.” Exxon’s oil and natural gas production fell 1.8 percent from year-before levels, with natural gas production falling around the world and oil output slipping in half the regions in which the company operates. Still, Exxon executives said they were confident new projects in the Middle East, Asia and the United States would help boost production. The blip in fourth-quarter results doesn’t change Exxon’s investment appeal, or for that matter the sector’s, said Oliver Pursche of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, who manages Exxon shares for clients. “There’s nothing in this report that’s overly alarming,” he said. “Exxon to us is a core, long-term holding.” ",1302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-oil-results/conoco-beats-expectations-as-bigger-oil-rivals-struggle-idUSBREA0T1TG20140130

613,COP,"As global gas output surges, U.S. seen to rival Russia in Europe","LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of the decade is likely to challenge Russian gas for market share in Europe as the region becomes increasingly dependent on imports, ConocoPhillips’ head of LNG trading said. A surge in production worldwide, driven by new projects in the United States, Australia, East Africa, Russia and Canada, could double LNG output to 600 million tonnes annually from 2018 and provide ample new supply to global markets, industry estimates suggest. Kicking off the export growth, after years of stagnating supply, will be Exxon Mobil’s Papau New Guinea LNG plant in the third-quarter of this year, followed by BG Group’s  Queensland Curtis project in Australia by year-end. Most new Australian and east Africa supplies are expected to reach Asia to fill demand, while significant output from the United States and elsewhere is expected to arrive at European terminals. “We believe that the European gas market will be a balancing market for global gas,” said Birger Balteskard, global LNG marketing manager at ConocoPhillips, told the International Petroleum Week industry conference. Balteskard said Europe’s dependence on gas imports will grow as its domestic fields age and that America’s proposed LNG export terminals will help meet that need. “There is a potential large gap between demand and supply into Europe. We think by 2025 that will be as much as 25 (billion cubic feet) a day, which is significant,” Balteskard said. The United States, meanwhile, is producing record amounts of gas from shale, and more than a dozen export projects have been proposed, some of which could target Europe from 2015 onwards. Europe’s biggest supplier Russia charges high prices for supplies, offering U.S. LNG shippers a chance to grab market share through cut-rate deals. In Europe, a case could be made that “there will be competition between Russian pipe gas and LNG from the States and potentially East Africa”, Balteskard said. In Asia, gas demand has outstripped supply. Japan, the world’s top LNG buyer, has shifted more to gas following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, while second-biggest buyer South Korea has stepped up purchases after a nuclear safety scandal. Asian gas prices currently trade above $20 per million British thermal units, while European prices are around $10 per mmBtu. Atlantic Basin LNG producers have in recent years diverted cargoes to the higher-paying Asian and South American markets, halving Europe’s intake. But as producers open the taps from new projects to fill Asian demand, and as Mexico and some South American energy producers work to wean themselves off costly LNG imports, deliveries to Europe could rebound. Some uncertainties remain, however, that could still skew this scenario. If China’s demand grows faster than expected, it could potentially limit the availability of gas supplies to Europe. Similarly, any decision by top LNG importer Japan to uphold its atomic energy ban means it will need gas to meet any growth in energy needs. “Assuming East Africa, the U.S. and Australia do happen the way we think, the main thing to look at is what is going on in China. How much energy will it be able to absorb?” Balteskard said.",2212014,http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-lng/as-global-gas-output-surges-u-s-seen-to-rival-russia-in-europe-idUSL6N0LP4M320140221
614,COP,World Bank panel rejects Venezuela's appeal over Conoco,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank panel has rejected Venezuela’s request for a new hearing to contest a 2013 partial ruling that it failed to act in good faith regarding negotiations to compensate U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) for expropriations. The dispute dates from then-President Hugo Chavez’s socialist government’s takeover of three oil projects in 2007. “The majority of the tribunal concludes that it does not have the power to reconsider the decision,” the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) said on its website. Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA said that decision last year was unfair because it had offered $2.3 billion in compensation, which was higher than its $1.8 billion estimate of the assets’ value, excluding tax and royalties claims. While saying Venezuela had not acted in good faith, September’s partial ruling did not determine how much money it must pay the U.S.-based company. It also limited the scope of ConocoPhillips’ claims by excluding future tax credits. The company claimed victory in last year’s decision, but experts say a final ruling on damages in the biggest arbitration case that Venezuela is facing could take one or two more years. The latest ICSID ruling said a date for a hearing to discuss the compensation amount would be fixed “in consultation with the parties, in due course.” ConocoPhillips initially asked Venezuela for $30 billion in compensation for its stakes in the Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy crude upgraders and a separate offshore project called Corocoro. Several major foreign oil companies, including Chevron Corp (CVX.N), were able to reach agreements with the Chavez government and give up majority stakes in projects while hanging onto minority ones. ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips did not reach accords and eventually took their claims to arbitration. Venezuela has more than 20 arbitration cases pending at ICSID and other courts stemming from Chavez’s nationalizations.

Myanmar has awarded 10 shallow-water blocks and 10 deepwater blocks in an auction process that began in April last year, according to a posting on the ministry’s website on Wednesday. Winners of deepwater blocks will be able to explore and operate the blocks on their own, while shallow-water winners will need to work with a registered local partner, according to the terms of the production sharing contracts. Myanmar’s oil and gas sector attracts the largest share of foreign investment, accounting for $13.6 billion, or 40 percent, of total accumulated foreign investment through September,  according to the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO). Myanmar exported $3.7 billion worth of gas in the fiscal year to March 31, 2013, mostly to neighbouring Thailand, up from $3.5 billion the year before. The country’s proven natural gas reserves totalled 7.8 trillion cubic feet (tcf) at the end of 2012, according to BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy. A total of 160 local companies have registered with the Ministry of Energy as potential partners for winners of the shallow-water blocks, but industry sources say only a few of them have any oil and gas experience.

617,COP,"Shell, Statoil, Total, others win Myanmar oil, gas exploration blocks","YANGON, March 26 (Reuters) - International oil majors including Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil, ConocoPhillips and Total  won rights to explore for oil and gas off Myanmar, according to the Southeast Asian country’s Ministry of Energy. Myanmar has awarded 10 shallow-water blocks and 10 deepwater blocks in an auction process that began in April last year, according to a posting on the ministry’s website on Wednesday. Winners of deepwater blocks will be able to explore and operate the blocks on their own, while shallow-water winners will need to work with a registered local partner, according to the terms of the production sharing contracts. Myanmar’s oil and gas sector attracts the largest share of foreign investment, accounting for $13.6 billion, or 40 percent, of total accumulated foreign investment through September,  according to the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO). Myanmar exported $3.7 billion worth of gas in the fiscal year to March 31, 2013, mostly to neighbouring Thailand, up from $3.5 billion the year before. The country’s proven natural gas reserves totalled 7.8 trillion cubic feet (tcf) at the end of 2012, according to BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy. A total of 160 local companies have registered with the Ministry of Energy as potential partners for winners of the shallow-water blocks, but industry sources say only a few of them have any oil and gas experience.

618,COP,Norway's Ekofisk oilfield will next shut for planned maintenance in summer 2016,"STAVANGER, Norway, April 8 (Reuters) - The Ekofisk oilfield will next be shut for planned maintenance in the summer of 2016, a top executive at the field’s operator, ConocoPhillips, said on Tuesday. “We have no big work plans this year. We had a maintenance stop every third year and we had one last year,” Steinar Vaage, head of ConocoPhillips’ Norwegian activities, told Reuters. “So our next planned maintenance is in the summer of 2016. We have no plans for this year or the next,” he said on the sidelines of an oil conference. ConocoPhillips is the operator of Ekofisk, which is one of the four crude streams that is the base for the Brent oil benchmark.

619,COP,Conoco exporting shale drilling know-how to other places,"HOUSTON, April 10 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, the largest independent oil company, is using the knowledge it gained drilling in Texas’ Eagle Ford rocks to fuel growth in less-developed shale formations in North American and even Poland. “The value associated with that learning curve has been pretty tremendous,” Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance told the company’s annual analyst meeting. Conoco and many other companies are spending ever higher amounts to coax more profitable and lower-risk crude oil and natural gas liquids from shale and other rocks in North America. This year, Houston-based Conoco said about one-third of its $16.7 billion budget will be spent on so-called unconventional resources in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shales with the aim of raising that output more than 20 percent by 2017, the Houston company told its annual analyst meeting. Now, Conoco is taking the success it has seen drilling in the Eagle Ford and exporting that to horizontal wells in Texas’ Permian Basin, Canada, Colorado and Poland. “We were one of the first people to produce shales gas in Poland,” said Matt Fox, Conoco’s head of exploration and production. Of a planned well in Poland he said, “We’re going to drill it like an Eagle Ford well, we’re going to frack it like an Eagle Ford well.” Knowledge gained drilling in the Eagle Ford and Bakken is enabling Conoco to increase efficiencies, lower costs and raise the amount of oil and gas it expects to produce over the lifetime of a well in other places, it said. Conoco left its major targets unchanged, saying it still sees overall production and margin growth of 3 percent to 5 percent through 2017. This year, Conoco sees production of 1.51 to 1.55 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boepd), with a year-end exit rate of 1.6 million boepd. Shares of Conoco fell $1.38 to $70.16, down 1.9 percent.

620,COP,UPDATE 1-U.S. renews ConocoPhillips' permit for Alaska LNG exports,"(Adds details from order, background) By Ayesha Rascoe WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department on Monday renewed ConocoPhillips’ permit allowing the company to export liquefied natural gas from Alaska to all countries. The approval was largely expected, as the U.S. government has long allowed LNG exports from Alaska’s Kenai terminal, issuing its first permit allowing the shipments in 1967. With the latest permit, ConocoPhillips will be able to export up to 40 billion cubic feet of LNG from Kenai over the next two years. ConocoPhillips’ previous permit lapsed in March 2013 amid concerns about falling gas output in the Cook Inlet region. Last September, Alaska’s Department of Natural Resources asked ConocoPhillips to resume LNG exports to help support local natural gas production and provide natural gas supply security in Southcentral Alaska. “Today’s announcement by DOE ... highlights the growth that’s occurring in Cook Inlet, where there is now ample gas supply to both meet local needs and help out our friends overseas,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the top Republican on the Senate energy committee. The recent push to export substantial amounts of LNG from the lower 48 states has faced opposition from some heavy industrial companies concerned that exports may cause shortages and price spikes. However, Alaskan gas exports have not been a major source of controversy because the state’s geographic isolation means not much of its gas goes to the lower 48. Japan has typically been the main buyer of Alaskan LNG. ConocoPhillips shares were up about 0.8 percent at $64.30 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

623,COP,"Exxon, Conoco see a quarterly payoff from natural gas","HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil companies Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips both reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations on Thursday, helped partly by higher natural gas prices. A brutal winter in North American sapped supplies of natural gas and boosted prices at key delivery point Henry Hub by more than 50 percent in the quarter, propping up profit at both companies, analysts said. Both Conoco and Exxon have increased investment in North American shale fields that produce crude oil and natural gas liquids. On Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell reported better-than-expected quarterly results that were also boosted by gas earnings. Jeff Sheets, chief financial officer of Conoco, said the company was unlikely to see a similar benefit from natural gas prices in the current quarter because markets had returned to a more normal state. “It was a very unusual quarter because of weather. What you saw in our results is that we had the ability to supply some of the markets where prices were higher than supply based on Henry Hub,” Sheets said. Conoco also said it plans to ship the first of six cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its Kenai plant in Alaska this month since renewing its export license in April. The companies appear to have had better luck in U.S. shale plays than BP PLC, which on Tuesday reported a 24 percent drop in quarterly profit and wrote off $521 million as it scrapped a shale project in the Utica basin. Exxon remains the largest U.S. producer of natural gas and spent $30 billion in 2010 to acquire gas producer XTO Energy. Since the XTO deal closed, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale unlocked vast supplies of natural gas that had depressed prices until this winter. “I think that (Exxon’s) finally beginning to derive some benefit from the XTO acquisition even though volumes were lower,” Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones said, adding that Conoco also reaped the benefit of higher commodity prices. Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 96 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $101.45 in afternoon trading, while Conoco’s stock was up 70 cents at $75.01, or nearly 1 percent. The past winter, which affected much of the country in January and February, lifted Exxon Mobil’s average U.S. natural gas sale price by 49 percent, helping offset a dip in global production. Prices for natural gas rose around the world as well, even as the price that the Irving, Texas company receives for its crude oil slipped both in the U.S. and internationally. Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter net income of $9.10 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared with $9.50 billion, or $2.12 per share, in the year-ago quarter. The results surpassed analysts’ expectation for profit of $1.88 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total production fell about 6 percent to 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). Conoco’s first-quarter profit was flat at $2.1 billion, or $1.17 per share. Excluding items, the Houston company earned $1.81 a share, beating analysts’ estimates for $1.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

631,COP,World Bank panel sustains arbitrators in Venezuela-Conoco dispute,"CARACAS, May 6 (Reuters) - A World Bank panel said on Tuesday it has rejected Venezuela’s request to change the arbitrators reviewing a dispute over compensation sought by U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips for 2007 expropriations. The International Centre for Resolution of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, in March shot down Venezuela’s appeal for a new hearing to contest a 2013 partial ruling that it failed to act in good faith in compensation negotiations with Conoco. The dispute dates from then-President Hugo Chavez’s socialist government’s takeover of oil projects in 2007 including two multi-billion dollar heavy oil operations in the vast Orinoco Belt. Venezuela had sought to remove Kenneth Keith and L. Yves Fortier from the panel hearing the case, complaining of their “general negative attitude” and “propensity to decide  by ‘sheer fiat.’” Conoco said the request constituted “meritless and desperate delaying tactics by Venezuela.” Despite formally withdrawing from ICSID in 2013, Venezuela still faces about 20 claims stemming largely from compensation disputes over the late Chavez’s wave of nationalizations.

632,COP,UPDATE 1-Conoco to soon argue damages in Venezuela dispute -CEO,"By Anna Driver HOUSTON, May 13 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance on Tuesday said his company and Venezuela are due to argue damages before the World Bank’s arbitration panel as their dispute over oil assets in the South American country moves forward. The arguments are “imminent,” Lance told reporters after the company’s annual meeting, adding it was uncertain when the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) would issue a final ruling. Conoco’s projects were taken over during the socialist administration of deceased former President Hugo Chavez, who led a wave of nationalizations that included the oil, electricity and steel industries. In a partial resolution, the arbitration panel in September said Venezuela failed to act in good faith or properly compensate ConocoPhillips for three big oil assets the country expropriated in 2007. The court also limited the scope of the company’s claims by excluding future tax credits . This month the panel also said it rejected Venezuela’s request to change the arbitrators reviewing the dispute. Independent lawyers expect a final ruling, including a compensation amount, in 2014-2015. ConocoPhillips initially asked Venezuela for $30 billion in compensation for its stakes in the Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy crude upgraders and a separate offshore project called Corocoro, but Venezuela offered no more than $2 billion. The Andean country has more than 20 arbitration cases pending at ICSID and other courts stemming from Chavez’s nationalizations. The country pulled out of the ICSID in 2012, but will still be subject to cases submitted beforehand.

633,COP,Top court mostly upholds Obama bid to curb carbon emissions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday largely upheld the Obama administration’s authority to curb greenhouse gases from major emitters like power plants and refineries in a ruling that nonetheless exempted some smaller sources from the regulation. On a 7-2 vote, the court rejected an industry-backed argument that most emitting facilities should not be regulated for greenhouse gases under one particular air pollution program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But industry could claim a partial win because the court ruled on a 5-4 vote that some facilities the government had wanted to regulate will be exempted. Some landfills, pulp and paper facilities, electronics manufacturing plants, chemical production plants and beverage producers are among the small industrial sources likely to be exempted, an EPA spokesman said. “It bears mention that EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,” Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, read from a statement in court. The ruling brought an end to what started out as a broad legal challenge to the Obama administration’s first suite of greenhouse gas regulations issued in 2009 and 2010. The administration won on every count except in the mixed ruling announced on Monday. The case focused only on the “prevention of serious deterioration” or PSD program, which requires any new or modified major polluting facility to obtain a permit before any new construction is done if it emits “any air pollutant.” The EPA said in a statement: “The Supreme Court’s decision is a win for our efforts to reduce carbon pollution because it allows EPA, states and other permitting authorities to continue to require carbon pollution limits in permits for the largest pollution sources.” Industry groups also claimed victory. The American Petroleum Institute said in a statement that the decision was a “stark reminder that the EPA’s power is not unlimited.” The justices were split in multiple ways. The four liberals voted with Scalia on one point but would have ruled for EPA on all counts. Conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas would have ruled against the government across the board. Scalia was critical of the administration, saying its interpretation of the law “would bring about an enormous and transformative expansion of EPA’s regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.” The parties agreed that as a result of the ruling roughly 83 percent of greenhouse gas emissions that could potentially be regulated under the EPA’s interpretation of the law would still be covered, compared with the 86 percent of emissions that the EPA had hoped to regulate. Under the program, operators have to show they use the best technology available to reduce emissions of covered pollutants. More than 300 facilities have applied for permits. The small-bore nature of the case was in stark contrast to the broader legal challenges initially made by industry groups and states. When the administration’s first four climate change rules were issued, armies of lawyers were lined up to fight them. Some even questioned the landmark Massachusetts v EPA ruling from 2007, in which the Supreme Court said greenhouse gases were pollutants that could be regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the rules in a unanimous June 2012 decision. The challengers sought Supreme Court review and, in October 2013, the justices agreed to hear the narrow case that was decided on Monday. The court opted against hearing any of the broader legal challenges, leaving intact the EPA’s finding that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act and the agency’s first regulations for cars and light trucks. Ultimately, the all-out legal assault largely fizzled. It constituted “sound and fury, signifying much less than it should have,” said Eric Groten, a lawyer with the Vinson & Elkins law firm, who represented one of the challengers. The Supreme Court decision is not expected to affect the administration’s ability to set air pollution standards for greenhouse gases under a separate provision of the Clean Air Act.

Inter Pipe said the new line will deliver as much as 350,000 barrels per day of diluent, an ultra light form of crude oil blended into the tar-like bitumen from the oil sands so it can flow on pipelines, to the Foster Creek and Christina Lake projects co-owned by Cenovus and ConocoPhillips. The new line, which runs 290 kilometers (180 miles) from near Edmonton, Alberta, to Christina Lake and Foster Creek, is the largest part of Inter Pipeline’s C$1.4 billion Polaris project, which will also include a link to the planned Narrows Lake oil sands development planned by Cenovus and its partner and to other operations in northwestern Alberta. When complete, the Polaris system will have the capacity to deliver as much as 700,000 bpd of diluent.

636,COP,ConocoPhillips deal propels Oando to Nigeria's top league,"PARIS (Reuters) - Nigerian oil company Oando (OANDO.LG) completed a $1.5 billion deal to buy ConocoPhillips’s assets in Nigeria on Wednesday, catapulting it to be one of the top players in the West African country’s emerging indigenous oil and gas exploration industry. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has waited for more than a year to close the deal with Oando, which is listed in Lagos, Toronto OER.TO and Johannesburg, because the local firm struggled to raise finance and had to navigate local bureaucracy.      But for Oando’s chairman, the deal means as much for the young Nigerian company as for the country as a whole. “It’s a significant transaction: it’s the largest single upstream acquisition done in Nigerian industry by an indigenous company,” Wale Tinubu told Reuters in an interview in Paris, where a ceremony was held on Wednesday. “In the long term it will be good for the country, in terms of being able to retain value in the country, as opposed to the exploitation or the exports of profits outside the country,” he added. Since 2010, Nigeria has had a policy of encouraging more direct ownership of its oil and gas by Nigerians, either through the state oil company or local private firms. That has raised concerns among foreign oil majors they may lose smaller assets if they do not sell now, industry experts say. ConocoPhillips is joining competitors Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France’s Total (TOTF.PA) and Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) in disposing of stakes in onshore and shallow water offshore fields in the swampy Niger Delta region. Oando’s chairman said encouraging the local industry did not mean there was no place left for international majors, however. “The offshore belongs to the international oil companies. There’s so much oil offshore! I think we need that capital, we need that expertise to develop offshore,” he said. Tinubu said the company was interested in doing similar deals with oil majors to grow more in the next 2 to 3 years. “We’re looking for similar assets, with sizeable, proven and developed reserves, with their own export facilities.” Asked if Oando could bid for the OML 138 block that France’s Total failed to sell to Sinopec, the chairman said: “It’s a good asset but the price was quite high. $24 per barrel, I think it’s a bit too expensive.” A LOT OF SELF-HELP Tinubu said he believed a bigger indigenous participation in the country’s oil and gas industry will also help Nigeria deal with issues such as oil theft, pipeline sabotage and regulatory uncertainty that are putting off investment. “If you live in an emerging market, or in an place like Nigeria, you realize that a lot of self-help is required,” he said. “Everybody has private guards, everybody builds their own fences, there’s a neighborhood watch. “ “That same principle will apply to oil and gas assets, with more fragmented pieces owned by indigenous companies who provide protection for these assets,” he said.   If it fixes these issues, OPEC-member Nigeria has the potential to double its 2 million-2.5 million barrel per day oil output in the next five years, analysts said. Tinubu said he was aiming to bring Oando’s production to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the current 46,700 boepd. Rival firm Seplat, which raised $500 million in a debut stock market listing in Lagos (SEPLAT.LG) and London (SEPL.L) in April, produces about 23,000 barrels per day, while London-listed Afren AFRE.L produces about 47,000, according to Oanda’s estimates. Asked if he expected consolidation in the Nigerian industry in the future, Tinubu said: “If you ask me, I think there will be 3 to 5 champions coming from Nigeria. And you will find a lot of small, profitable players,” he said.

637,COP,ConocoPhillips profit slightly higher; output rises,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the largest U.S. independent oil and gas company, on Thursday reported a quarterly profit that just beat Wall Street expectations, helped by a bigger-than-expected increase in oil and gas production. ConocoPhillips, like many other oil and gas companies, is drilling more in U.S. shale fields where wells bring better profits and steady production growth is easier to achieve.  For example Conoco’s production in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota rose 38 percent in the second quarter.   Income totaled $2.08 billion, or $1.67 per share, compared with $2.05 billion, or $1.65 per share in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, Conoco’s profit was $1.61 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.60, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Conoco posted a clean operational beat with higher production and in-line margin performance,” Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read said in a note to clients. “In spite of the beat, we take a neutral stance, as natural gas drove the out-performance.” The Houston company’s oil and natural gas output from continuing operations was 1.56 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boed) in the quarter, up from 1.51 million boed a year earlier. On a conference call with analysts, the company said it had put its 50 percent interest in Rosneft’s (ROSN.MM) Polar Lights project on the market. So far U.S. sanctions have not affected that process, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Sheets said in an interview. “Once we made the decision to exit the joint venture we had with Lukoil, it doesn’t make sense for us to have this really small asset in Russia,” said Sheets.      Conoco completed the sale of its 20 percent stake in Russian oil company Lukoil in 2011. Polar Lights produces only about 3,000 to 4,000 barrels per day for Conoco, Sheets said.  While production was forecast to be lower in the third quarter due to maintenance, Conoco said it was raising the midpoint of its full-year production outlook for continuing operations. It now expects output of about 1.525 million boed to 1.550 million boed. Shares of Conoco closed down $2.13, or 2.5 percent at $82.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

642,COP,"UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire reveals Charter stake, cuts DirecTV","NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter. Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30. Charter is “the play of choice on cable consolidation,” said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan. “You’ve got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,” he said. DirecTV is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T; for $48.5 billion. Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire’s larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz. The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire’s cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion. That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday’s filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc, an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc , whose stock Berkshire also owns. Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp, IBM Corp, Suncor Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips, former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co, National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

643,COP,UPDATE 1-Alaska voters narrowly backing tax cut for oil industry,"(Adds details on results) By Steve Quinn JUNEAU, Alaska, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Alaskan voters appear to have narrowly upheld a new law that cut taxes on oil production and is worth up to $1 billion a year for companies such as ConocoPhillips, BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp , according to results available on Wednesday. With 98 percent of voting precincts reporting from Tuesday’s primary, those favoring the lower taxes held a four-point lead, according to unofficial returns posted by the Alaska Division of Elections. Upholding the eight-month-old tax cut ushered in by Governor Sean Parnell means the state would not revert back to the system implemented by his old boss, Sarah Palin, who raised taxes in 2007. Results will not be certified until Sept. 2, said state elections director Gail Fenumiai, who added that nearly 14,600 absentee and early voting ballots needed to be counted over the next 10 days to see whether the repeal effort failed.

We agree with the voters that oil tax reform is working, and BP is committed to doing its part to make sure that continues.” Parnell, who claimed his own victory in the state’s Republican primary election on Tuesday night, has said his tax rollback will make Alaska more competitive for investment and North Slope oil producers.

648,COP,Conoco files for ICC arbitration against Venezuela's PDVSA,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips on Friday said it has filed for arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce against Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA for compensation related to the termination of its partnership contract after the nationalization of oil projects. The ICC filing is separate from the U.S. oil company’s arbitration pending before the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement for Investment Disputes (ICSID), it said. “By filing ICC arbitration against PDVSA, we are pursuing contractual remedies that are available to us,” said Janet Langford Kelly, ConocoPhillips’ senior vice president, Legal, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. A representative at PDVSA was not immediately available to comment. In September 2013, the ICSID tribunal ruled that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips’ investment in the Petrozuata and Hamaca oil projects. The tribunal is now determining compensation for the assets. On Thursday, ICSID ordered Venezuela to pay Exxon Mobil Corp $1.6 billion for oil assets that were nationalized in 2007. PDVSA said it expects to eventually pay closer to $1 billion. Exxon had also filed for a separate ICC arbitration, to recover $907.6 million for the termination of its contract with PDVSA. ConocoPhillips operated two heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Belt and another offshore project in Venezuela. Shares of ConocoPhillips were down $1.16 or 1.6 percent at  $70.28 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, hurt by a 1 percent decline in crude prices.

652,COP,"Conoco sees third-quarter profit rise, 2015 capex seen lower","(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the largest U.S. independent oil and gas company, on Thursday reported higher third-quarter profit after the sale of its Nigerian unit and said overall spending would decline next year, partly in response to falling crude oil prices. Crude oil prices have tumbled more than 20 percent in recent weeks as global demand slows and supplies rise. Crude traded in New York fell to a more than two-year low on Monday at $79.44 a barrel but recovered a bit to above $81 on Thursday. Conoco expects to spend less than $16 billion next year, down from the $16.7 billion projected for 2014, Ryan Lance, the chief executive officer, told investors on a conference call to discuss earnings.  Over the last several years, Conoco has shed lower-margin assets, directing more capital to projects like shale drilling in Eagle Ford area in south Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota that offer higher returns and faster production growth.  Even with a drop in spending, the company expects to meet its forecast to boost oil and gas output 3 percent to 5 percent in 2015, Lance told investors.  Conoco will continue to invest near current levels in Eagle Ford and Bakken, but has the flexibility to pare spending in exploration and on less-developed fields in such places as the Permian Basin in West Texas and western Canada, it said. “Beginning in 2015 capital in our major projects begins to taper off,” said Lance, “We have significantly more flexibility to ramp up or down our capital as circumstances dictate.”  Profit rose to $2.7 billion, or $2.17 per share, from $2.5 billion, or $2.00 per share, in the 2013 third quarter. Excluding items such as the proceeds from the sale of its Nigerian business in July and a tax benefit, Conoco had a profit of $1.29 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The proceeds from the Nigerian sale were $1.4 billion. ConocoPhillips had third-quarter oil and gas production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, of 1.473 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boed), up 25,000 boed from a year ago. For the fourth quarter, Conoco forecast production from continuing operations rising to 1.545 million boed to 1.575 million boed, excluding Libya. Previously, it said it would produce as much as 1.590 million boed to 1.640 million boed. The production cut is due in part to third-party infrastructure constraints in Malaysia and a depressed market for the natural gas liquid (NGL) ethane in the United States, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.

Crude oil prices have tumbled more than 20 percent in recent weeks as global demand slows and supplies rise. Crude traded in New York fell to a more than two-year low on Monday at $79.44 a barrel but recovered a bit to above $81 on Thursday.

657,COP,East Timor kicks out judges over ConocoPhillips tax fight,"MELBOURNE, Nov 5 (Reuters) - East Timor has ordered five foreign judges out of the country after a court ruled in favour of U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips in cases tied to $236 million in disputed tax assessments. ConocoPhillips operates the Bayu Undan gas field in the Timor Sea between East Timor and Australia. Royalties and taxes from the field are the main source of revenue for East Timor, one of the world’s poorest nations. The young country, which won independence from Indonesia in 2002, had hired international judges and prosecutors to beef up its judicial system, but Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao has been unhappy about the rulings on the tax cases, among other issues. The government’s move on the judiciary raises concerns about the rule of law in East Timor, which needs foreign companies to develop its oil and gas resources. An East Timor embassy spokeswoman in Canberra, Australia, confirmed on Wednesday that five judges and two prosecutors had been ordered to leave the country on Tuesday. She said it was not yet clear when they would depart. ConocoPhillips has challenged the government in 28 cases over tax assessments that were higher than what the company says it owes, and has won all seven that have been decided so far. The government’s move to expel the judges and prosecutors was done according to the law to “protect the interests of our people”, East Timor Foreign Minister Jose Luis Guterres said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. ConocoPhillips says it has paid all the taxes that are due under East Timor law and has paid “under protest” all taxes, interest and penalties assessed by the government, adding that it still highly values its relationship with the government. “In our view, an independent and impartial court system is crucial to create a good investment climate for Timor-Leste,” ConocoPhillips President Australia-West Todd Creeger said in an emailed statement commenting on the deportations. “If the business community and potential investors are confident they will be treated fairly, Timor-Leste’s long term economic development will benefit.” The move by East Timor comes amid talks with the Australian government to try to resolve a long-running dispute over the treaty that gives East Timor a 50 percent share of the royalty revenue from another gas field, Greater Sunrise, which straddles the maritime boundary between the two countries. The governments recently agreed to adjourn an international arbitration over the dispute for at least six months to try to resolve their differences directly. A resolution would help clear the way for a decision to develop the Greater Sunrise project, which remains untapped 40 years after its fields were discovered, and is key to the growth prospects of Australia’s biggest oil and gas producer, Woodside Petroleum. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the talks do not involve negotiating permanent maritime boundaries with East Timor and that Australia continues to support current treaty arrangements. “Through the consultations we hope to find a way to resolve our differences amicably, rather than through litigation,” a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

658,COP,ConocoPhillips plans to spend less in 2015 as crude slides,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said its 2015 capital budget would be 20 percent, or about $3 billion, lower than this year’s, the biggest spending cut by a U.S. oil and gas producer in dollar terms as oil prices hit five-year lows.  Shares of the company, which set a budget of $13.5 billion for 2015, fell as much as 3.5 percent to $65.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.  ConocoPhillips said it would “defer significant investment”  on less developed projects in the Montney and Duvernay fields in Canada, the Permian Basin in Texas and the Niobrara shale field, which extends over Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas.  “The announced budget is well below our expectations of $15 billion,” Simmons & Co analysts wrote in a note. ConocoPhillips, which is focusing on the Eagle Ford shale in Texas and North Dakota’s Bakken shale, said it would also spend less on major projects, many of which are nearing completion.  Global oil and gas projects worth more than $150 billion are likely to be put on hold next year, according to Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy. Despite lower investment, ConocoPhillips said it expected production from fields outside of Libya to rise 3 percent in 2015. In October, the company forecast 3-5 percent growth. “This plan demonstrates our focus on cash-flow neutrality and a competitive dividend, while maintaining our financial strength,” Chief Executive Ryan Lance said. Several oil producers, including Denbury Resources Inc and Halcon Resources Corp, have set lower budgets for 2015, following a 42 percent drop in crude prices since June.

Driller Hercules Offshore Inc announced last month a 15 percent workforce reduction.

Kaeser, who took the helm in a boardroom coup last year, splashed out $7.6 billion in September to buy U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand, paying a relatively high price to beef up the group’s presence in the U.S. shale oil and gas industry. “Of course new business could be affected if the oil price continues to be down,” Kaeser said at an investor conference on Tuesday. However, he added that falling prices should boost demand for high-margin services as customers seek to cut costs. Crude oil prices have dropped to five-year lows and billions of dollars worth of oil and gas exploration projects are expected to be put on hold in the coming months. ConocoPhillips said on Monday that its 2015 capital budget would be 20 percent, or about $3 billion, lower than this year’s, the biggest spending cut by a U.S. oil and gas producer in dollar terms. Kaeser said he would not consider pulling out of the Dresser-Rand deal, Siemens’s biggest since it bought Dade Behring in 2007, despite the oil price fall. “The average cost of taking out oil in the United States has come down from $72 (per barrel) in 2012 to $57 in 2013, so you can see that the productivity that oil & gas service providers helps companies a lot to bring down costs,” he said. JP Morgan recently said that the market underestimated the risk that falling oil prices posed for Siemens’s business because relatively healthy U.S. demand for gas turbines would not be sufficient to offset declining sales in the Middle East and other oil producing countries. It said it preferred the stocks of Siemens rivals with a lower exposure to oil-producing sectors and countries, such as Schneider Electric, Philips or Rexel  to Siemens and Switzerland’s ABB. Siemens, whose products range from gas turbines to high-speed trains and industrial automation software, unveiled a corporate overhaul in May that will focus more on high-margin services and help it make up ground on more profitable rivals such as Switzerland’s ABB and U.S.-based General Electric . Shares in Siemens were down 1.8 percent at 92.41 euros by 1326 GMT, underperforming Germany’s blue-chip DAX index , which was 1.4 percent lower.

662,COP,Conoco seeks U.S. guidance on light oil exports -CEO,"WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has asked the U.S. Commerce Department for guidance on whether it can ship its minimally treated light oil abroad, though the company does not believe it makes sense to export it now, the company’s CEO said on Wednesday. U.S. oil drillers that have enjoyed a boom over the last six years are pressuring the government to lift the 40-year ban on oil exports, a remnant of the 1970s Arab oil embargo that led to fears of energy shortages. The Bureau of Industry and Security at the commerce department said on Dec. 30 that it had given permission for exports of treated light oil called condensate to “some” companies without going into detail. The permissions do not lift the export restriction, but have given confidence to companies that want to ship light oil to markets in Asia and Europe. Conoco Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told reporters at the Center for Strategic and International Studies research institute that the company has “an application in front of” the Department of Commerce. “We’re looking at the rulings and taking a look at how our condensate compares to the condensate that they have ruled in,” Lance said. Another energy major, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said earlier this week that it received U.S. approval to export condensate. With oil prices falling by more than half since June to less than $50 a barrel, Shell said it would export the condensate when it was sufficiently profitable. Conoco’s Lance said now might not be the time for Conoco to export any condensate. “We don’t think we have significant differentials to being able to export, but if that situation were to change we would look at that, and we are looking at that,” Lance said. The Commerce Department has given previous approvals to Enterprise Partners, Pioneer Natural Resources  and Peaker Energy. Some analysts have said condensate exports could rise from 200,000 barrels per day to as much as 1 million bpd by the end of next year. Lance questioned whether drillers could produce that much condensate, however.

Britain’s North Sea oil and gas sector employs more than 400,000 people and has generated in excess of $200 billion (131 billion pounds) in tax revenue for the government. But there are growing pressures on the sector after oil prices slumped almost 60 percent over the past month, leading to job cuts at BP, ConocoPhillips and other majors. “The oil and gas industry is used to volatile prices in world markets and will get through the latest downturn as it has in the past,” said Energy Secretary Edward Davey in a statement on Thursday. “Given the huge value of the UKCS (UK Continental Shelf) to the nation and the relatively high cost base that it has, I am concerned to make sure that it does so in the best possible shape for the future,” Davey added.

666,COP,"UPDATE 1-Chevron to partner BP, Conoco for Gulf of Mexico leases","(Adds details, background, share price) Jan 28 (Reuters) - Oil producer Chevron Corp said it would work with peers BP Plc and ConocoPhillips  to explore and appraise 24 jointly held offshore leases in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The region is poised to deliver more than 700,000 barrels per day of new crude over three years, reversing a decline in production as it resurges after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history in 2010. The potential rise in production is attracting oil companies, who are keen on joint ventures as exploration costs in offshore fields are much higher. Chevron said on Wednesday it would operate the leases, for the Gila and Tiber fields and the Gibson exploration blocks east of Gila, in the northwest part of Keathley Canyon. BP said it would sell about half its equity interests in Gila and Tiber to Chevron. (bit.ly/1zbpdsF) BP, whose Macondo oil well blowout caused the 2010 spill, rejoined bidders for exploration and production leases in the Gulf of Mexico last year, after the U.S. government lifted a ban barring the company from new federal contracts.

667,COP,"Conoco, Occidental and Shell cut 2015 budgets on crude slide","HOUSTON/WILLISTON, N.D. (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) on Thursday slashed exploration spending plans for this year, as the third- and fourth-largest U.S. oil companies attempt to cope with a steep slide in crude prices. The cuts follow similar steps by rival Hess Corp (HES.N) earlier this week while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Europe’s largest oil company, said on Thursday it would reduce its spending the next three years by $15 billion.   Rising supplies of oil, from sources including North American shale basins, and weakening demand have flooded global markets with crude, sending prices plummeting almost 60 percent since June. On Thursday, crude traded in New York at $43.80 per barrel, much lower than many oil and gas projects require to make money. In response to the price collapse, oil and gas companies have made drastic cuts to budgets, idled drilling rigs and in some cases, cut jobs. For a factbox on capex cuts, click on: Conoco, which said in December it would cut 2015 spending by 20 percent to $13.5 billion, now expects spending to be scaled back by a further 15 percent to $11.5 billion. Occidental said it would slash its capital budget by 33 percent to $5.8 billion this year. “There’s a lot of debate right now about the duration of the current low oil prices. But we’re assuming that they will stay low for 2015 and we’re taking decisive actions accordingly,” Ryan Lance, Conoco’s CEO, said on a conference call.  Conoco’s second trimming of its 2015 capex budget raised the specter that others in the industry could further reduce their own spending, potentially reinforcing a dip in U.S. production that the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts to occur this summer.  That would mark a sharp turnabout for the U.S. oil industry, which has enjoyed five years of blistering output growth thanks to the shale oil boom.  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil producer, has yet to unveil 2015 spending and may do so on Friday when it reports quarterly results.   Conoco said it would defer drilling some U.S. onshore exploration programs and delay spending on some major projects. Occidental said it will pull back spending in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale and in Bahrain. “We think it is imprudent to accelerate some of these opportunities in the current low product price environment,” Occidental Chief Executive Stephen Chazen told investors. Analysts at Houston-based investment bank Simmons & Co said Conoco’s plan to further reduce capital spending is the right move to make, in this “challenging environment.” Neither Conoco nor Occidental are running out of cash, despite the low prices, though. Indeed, Occidental last quarter spent $1.3 billion on 100,000 acres in the Permian, a prolific shale formation in Texas. Chazen said the deal was to better connect existing acreage and boost drilling efficiencies.  Both companies also expect oil and gas output to rise this year, although possibly at a slower rate. Conoco now expects oil and gas output to grow 2 percent to 3 percent. That compares with a previous forecast for growth of 3 percent. Occidental said its production will ramp up 6 percent to 10 percent, helped by wells in the Permian Basin. Excluding one-time items, both companies reported earnings that topped analyst expectations. Conoco was helped by better-than-expected results in its Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, while Occidental’s adjusted earnings were lifted by its chemicals business. On a net basis, both companies reported a quarterly loss. Conoco had a fourth-quarter loss of $39 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a profit of $2.5 billion, or $2.00 a per share. One time-items including the termination of the Freeport LNG agreement.  Occidental reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $3.41 billion, or $4.41 per share. It earned an income of $1.6 billion, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier. In afternoon trading Thursday, shares of Conoco fell about 1 percent to $61.90 per share, while shares of Oxy rose 1 percent to $77.30.

675,COP,Oil's fall rocks already reeling Polish shale gas hopes,"* ConocoPhillips the only U.S. energy major left * Low oil prices prompting exploration budget cuts * Industry says subsidies could help * Government says shale, energy security remain priorities By Agnieszka Barteczko and Anna Koper WARSAW, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Poland, once Europe’s greatest hope for shale energy, is reeling from a rapid change in fortunes as U.S. companies walk away and low oil prices postpone any realistic start to commercial drilling. Facing EU environmental targets in 2020 and beyond, Poland needs to find alternatives to burning coal. It also wants to reduce imports of Russian energy by producing more of its own. Yet hopes that drilling for shale gas can replace these have dimmed, with Chevron the latest major energy company to quit Poland. ExxonMobil, Marathon and France’s Total  have all been and gone. A drastic cut in Poland’s estimated shale gas reserves marked a first blow in 2012. A 50 percent drop in oil prices since last June has proved a second. “For us the situation is dramatic. All projects have to be put on hold,” said one manager at a small energy company in Poland, pointing to hundreds of layoffs as investors withdraw and servicing firms remain idle. While exploratory drilling has been done, Poland has not delivered a single commercial well and the only global major company left is ConocoPhillips. “We continue to evaluate results of our recent testing in Poland,” said a spokesman when asked about Conoco’s outlook. Market sources said Conoco was looking for a local partner but the spokesman declined to comment on the matter. That leaves the rest of the field to Polish state firms and small independents with a handful of wells. And industry insiders say it will be at least 12 months before exploratory drilling gathers pace again even at state-run firms such as PGNiG and PKN Orlen as they, like their foreign peers, slash spending to ride out the low oil prices. When drilling does pick up, the pace of activity could hinge on whether the government offers subsidies, the industry sources said. At the start of Poland’s hoped-for shale boom, Jakub Kostecki, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, set up his firm, New Gas Contracting, to provide support services to foreign majors clamouring to get in. Now, he has folded his company and relocated to Denver, Colorado. “Most of our customers left,” said Kostecki of his business in Poland. In a sign of the decline, he said he is now placing Polish specialists with U.S. firms because there is no work for them at home. The numbers illustrate the decline: shale gas licences in Poland have fallen by half in the last two years to 53. Just 10 investors remain in the Polish Exploration and Production Industry Organization, a lobby group that had 23 members in 2013. PKN Orlen, which holds nine shale gas permits, said that all operators had to be cautious in allocating money to shale gas because of trends in energy prices. Investors will also be looking out for a report due from the Polish Geological Institute, probably by mid-year, on the most updated reserves estimates. “If the estimates turn out lower then either some incentives will be needed or only PGNiG and PKN Orlen will remain,” said a manager at a small shale company, referring to measures including state subsidies. “Shale gas and energy security will still be our priority,” Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz told a news conference this month, but it remains unclear if subsidies will be offered.

Oando bought ConocoPhillips’s upstream oil and gas business in Nigeria last July for $1.5 billion, helping it transition from a marketer of refined petroleum products into one of the top players in the West African country’s oil industry.

686,COP,ConocoPhillips puts some Western Canada assets up for sale,"March 27 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said on Friday it is looking to sell about 20 percent of its production in Western Canada, outside the oil sands, as tumbling oil prices have made operations in the country less profitable. ConocoPhillips, which operates conventional and oil sands operations in Canada, had announced last week plans to cut about 7 percent of its workforce, or about 200 employees, in the country. The cuts come amid continued weakening of oil prices, which have fallen more than 60 percent since June. The properties being considered for divestiture are mainly located in Southern and Eastern Alberta, Saskatchewan and northeastern British Columbia, spokeswoman for the company Andrea Urbanek said in a statement to Reuters. These natural gas-rich assets produced a total of about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, 2014, the company said. The company has hired a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia to advise on the process of divestiture. Scotia Waterous Inc earlier made the announcement on the sale of the assets on its website. Details on the assets and divestiture process are expected to be provided in the second quarter, the bank said.

688,COP,ConocoPhillips has U.S. approval to export ultra-light oil,"HOUSTON, April 8 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has received U.S. government approval to export ultra-light domestic oil, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. That makes the largest independent U.S. oil and gas producer the latest to obtain approval to export minimally processed, super-light oil known as condensate. Others with similar approvals include Royal Dutch Shell and pipeline companies Enterprise Products Partners and Plains All American LP. If processed in a stabilizer, which removes natural gas liquids (NGLs) but does not make motor fuels, condensate qualifies as an exportable refined product and can be shipped out without violating the U.S. crude export ban, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. ConocoPhillips has three stabilizers in the condensate-heavy Eagle Ford shale in South Texas with a combined capacity of 135,000 barrels per day. Such stabilizers are common in the Eagle Ford to shave off NGLs so output will meet requirements to move via pipeline. Earlier on Wednesday during the company’s annual analyst meeting in New York, Chief Executive Ryan Lance said ConocoPhillips plans to add drilling rigs in 2017 in key U.S. shale acreage based on its expectations for crude prices to recover.

689,COP,Conoco CEO sees ramping up shale rigs when oil price recovers,"HOUSTON, April 8 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, the largest independent producer of oil and natural gas, plans to add drilling rigs in 2017 in key U.S. shale acreage based on its expectations for a crude price recovery, the company’s chief executive said on Wednesday. Conoco, which slashed its capital spending plan nearly 30 percent to $11.5 billion this year, told investors it expects to increase the number of rigs in its Eagle Ford acreage in South Texas to 12 in 2017 from an average of seven this year. In North Dakota’s Bakken, the rig count will double to 10 over the same period. The company’s rig forecast is a strong sign that producers firmly believe in the long-term viability of drilling for shale oil, which has boomed over the last decade but been scaled back sharply since U.S. oil prices tumbled 50 percent since June to around $50 a barrel. “While we’ve ramped down to adjust to current market conditions and lower commodity prices, our intention is to ramp back up with rig count in both those two plays,” Conoco CEO Ryan Lance told a small group of reporters on a conference call. Those shale projects have higher margins, a shorter cash cycle and provide higher returns, the executive said. While a commodity price recovery is likely to be “volatile,” Lance said the proposed $70 billion deal by Royal Dutch Shell  to acquire BG Group Plc may signal the market has bottomed out as U.S. supply and demand return to balance. “As refineries in the U.S. are coming back on, we’ll get some of the inventories in Cushing worked off. We ought to see some recovery in price as the supply starts to react to the low price as well,” he said. On the cost side, Lance said Conoco expects to save as much as $1 billion in operating costs through 2016, a figure that likely could grow if U.S. onshore drilling costs keep falling.

692,COP,Exclusive: ConocoPhillips to launch U.S. asset sales - sources,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is preparing the sale of noncore oil and gas producing acreage in the United States, in the latest sign that oil majors are becoming more accepting of lower oil prices, according to people familiar with the matter. While the world’s oil and gas companies have been looking to buy assets on the cheap since oil prices plummeted, epitomized by Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s (RDSa.L) agreement earlier this month to buy BG Group Plc BG.L for $70 billion, they have been reluctant to sell assets in case oil prices recover and they can fetch more. ConocoPhillips has hired Wells Fargo (WFC.N) to sell some of its noncore U.S. assets, the people said on Monday. These assets include oil and gas properties in the Rockies, East Texas, South Texas and Northern Louisiana, according to one of the people. While the value of the assets up for sale could not be learned, industry sources said they expected ConocoPhillips to sell between $1 billion and $2.5 billion worth of noncore assets in the United States. The sources asked not to be named because the sale process is confidential. A representative of ConocoPhillips declined to comment on this specific asset sale but said: “It is common in the energy business for companies to review, readjust and optimize their portfolio from time to time.” A Wells Fargo representative declined to comment.  ConocoPhillips’ asset sale would be the largest U.S. acreage sale by a major U.S. oil and gas company so far this year. It follows a 50 percent drop in the price of oil since last June, which halted dozens of similar asset sales. This would be the second asset sale by ConocoPhillips launched this year. Earlier, it retained boutique investment bank Scotia Waterous (BNS.TO) for an asset sale in Canada, according to Scotia Waterous’ website.  A couple of other big companies have also started to explore a sale. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) has put a few hundred million dollars worth of East Texas acreage up for sale with Citigroup Inc (C.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Anandarko and Citigroup representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

693,COP,"CERAWEEK-Evoking Iran, U.S. senator pushes for oil exports","(Adds ConocoPhillips CEO quote) By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON, April 20 (Reuters) - Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said on Monday she will introduce legislation this year to allow U.S. crude exports, saying the Obama administration should not dare lift sanctions on Iran before scrapping the U.S. crude export ban. “It’s time to lift America’s ban on crude oil exports,” Murkowski said at the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston, the world’s largest annual gathering of oil executives. “We shouldn’t lift sanctions on Iranian oil while we are keeping restrictions on American oil,” she said. “It just doesn’t make sense.” The Obama administration has been locked in deep talks for weeks designed to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions, using the easing of sanctions as a bargaining chip. While the final framework of the deal has yet to be determined, it appears it would let Iran export far more crude oil than at present. “We are one of a very few nations that would limit our own opportunity through our own policy,” said Murkowski, who became chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in January. “We’re willing to back off sanctions on Iran while keeping sanctions on us.” Murkowski, by linking a domestic policy issue to a foreign policy one, was sending a clear message to Obama that lawmakers from oil states might show more support for a deal with Iran if the U.S. crude export ban ends. Lifting the ban has been a key focus for oil and natural gas producers as well, many of whom long to export shale-derived hydrocarbons globally. “Energy should be traded internationally like any other product,” Ryan Lance, the chief executive ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest independent oil and gas company, said at CERAWeek. Lightly processed super-light oil, known as condensate, can be exported from the United States without violating the U.S crude export ban, though the full ban on shipping extracted crude oil remains intact. Lance said U.S. refiners could not handle all of the condensate produced from shale so it made sense to ship the excess to global markets. Energy economists say that if the export ban were lifted, gasoline prices would fall for all consumers while generating jobs and tax revenue. No timeline has been set to introduce the bill, a Murkowski spokesman said. Murkowski said the bill to lift the ban will be separate from an energy policy bill she is crafting with other senators.

697,COP,UPDATE 2-ConocoPhillips 1st-qtr profit falls sharply on oil price decline,"(Adds comments from CFO, share price) By Anna Driver April 30 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, the largest independent U.S. energy company, reported sharply lower quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by a steep decline in crude oil prices. Crude prices in the quarter tumbled by about half from a peak over $100 a barrel in June as global supplies grew and demand was dented by slowing economies in places like China. In recent weeks, crude has rebounded to around $60 a barrel. ConocoPhillips, like other exploration and production companies, has slashed capital spending in response to persistently lower oil prices, and is further reducing its rig count for fields in the lower 48 U.S. states. By the end of April, the Houston company’s shale rig count will be down to 15 from 32 at the end of 2014, and will be pared to 12 rigs in the second half of the year, said Chief Financial Officer Jeff Sheets. Production is expected to fall in the third and fourth quarters in the company’s shale fields, including the Permian in West Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota. But total output was still expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent for the year, Sheets said. Profit in the first quarter slid to $272 million, or 22 cents per share, from $2.1 billion, or $1.71 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items including a tax benefit, Houston-based ConocoPhillips had a loss of $222 million, or 18 cents per share, near the loss of 19 cents that analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ConocoPhillips said the average price per barrel oil equivalent it received was $36.96, down from $71.21 in the same period a year earlier. Oil and gas output from continuing operations excluding Libya was 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in the quarter, up 80,000 boed from a year ago. Production was about 1 percent higher than Wall Street  expected, according to analysts at Houston-based investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt. Shares of ConocoPhillips fell 0.4 percent to $67.79 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. So far this year, the stock is down about 2 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain in the SIG Exploration and Production Index.

A preliminary tally showed 53 percent of the largest independent oil and gas company’s shareholders supported the proposal allowing investors who own 3 percent of ConocoPhillips’ shares for three consecutive years the ability to nominate directors. “The view on proxy access was very mixed amongst our shareholders,” Ryan Lance, the company’s chief executive officer, said at a news conference after the company’s annual meeting. “We’ll take it under advisement now.” New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer put forth the proposal which is intended to give minority shareholders a voice in the boardroom. The proposal is not related to governance issues, said Stringer’s representative at the meeting. “Today’s victory is another clear demonstration that shareowners want accountability in the boardrooms of corporate America,” said Stringer. “Conoco’s board should be responsive and swiftly implement proxy access.” Proxy access resolutions have received preliminary approvals at other oil and gas companies this year, including Occidental Petroleum Corp and Marathon Oil Corp. Houston-based ConocoPhillips had recommended a vote against the proposal, saying the board carefully considered the proposal but that it is not in the best interest of stockholders and unnecessary. “While such access might be appropriate at a company with demonstrated governance concerns, no such concerns with ConocoPhillips have been identified by the proponent,” said the company’s proxy materials.

The company said that last week it began to inject steam into the oil sands reservoir at the thermal project, 63 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of the town of Fort McMurray. The steam will slowly liquefy tarry bitumen deposits so they can flow to the surface. The first oil from the expansion, which will push the project’s total capacity to 150,000 bpd, is expected in the third quarter of the year and will ramp up through next year. Surmont’s phase 2 is one of several new projects in the oil sands to begin production despite weak oil prices, including Imperial Oil Ltd’s recent 40,000 bpd expansion of its Cold Lake oil sands project, which began initial production earlier this year. Output from Canada’s oil sands region, the world’s third-largest crude reserve, is expected to rise by about 150,000 bpd this year to an average 2.3 million barrels per day, according to industry forecasts.

705,COP,"Tight oil is here to stay, Conoco CEO tells OPEC","VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.S. tight-oil boom is here to stay despite low crude prices as technological breakthroughs will allow steep reductions in costs, the head of U.S. firm ConocoPhillips told a seminar organised by oil-producing group OPEC. “Innovations have already led to a U.S. energy renaissance. Tight-oil reservoirs can remain viable today, breakeven costs are already down by 15 to 30 percent,” Ryan Lance, chairman and CEO of Conoco, said on Thursday. The North American shale oil industry “will survive at $100 and it will survive at $50 or $60 Brent pricing too,” Lance told an audience packed with OPEC officials, including Saudi Arabia’s influential oil minister Ali al-Naimi. International benchmark Brent crude was trading just below $64 a barrel at 1015 GMT. Oil prices crashed over the past year after OPEC decided against cutting production to tackle a global glut that arose from a U.S. shale oil boom. OPEC chose instead to fight for market share, betting that a price drop would depress output in higher-cost producers such as the United States. Lance said cost reductions had been partly achieved due to cuts in service costs.  “We’re in the second inning of a nine-inning game. We’re still trying to figure out how to get the optimum amount of flow through the reservoir. There are more (gains) to come.” Breakeven costs for tight oil would likely go down another 15-20 percent by 2020, he said. “So the message - unconventional production is here to stay,” Lance said.  U.S. oil production growth has slowed in recent months and the number of rigs drilling for crude shrank dramatically.  “If prices stabilise and start to improve a little bit, I think you will see rigs start to improve and come back as we go into 2016 and 2017 and create more supply into the system,” Lance said. He said he expected world demand growth for oil to recover to 1.1 or 1.2 million barrels per day, double its rate over the past few years. “It is hard to envision it (the oil price) going back down to the $40s,” he said. Lance’s comments on unconventional oil chime with the views of other CEOs who have spoken at the seminar held by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in the past two days. “If prices remain at $60, we will have to find a way to make projects profitable,” the head of French oil company Total, Patrick Pouyanne, said on Wednesday. Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Italy’s Eni, said he expected U.S. shale oil production to seesaw with oil prices, and oil prices to seesaw with increases and drops in U.S. production. “If oil prices recover, shale production will go higher again. So we need to get used to a totally different dynamic,” Descalzi said on Wednesday.

707,COP,UPDATE 1-Conoco the last global oil firm to quit Polish shale gas,"(Adds details, background) WARSAW, June 5 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, the U.S. energy company, said on Friday it has stopped its shale gas exploration in Poland due to unsatisfactory results, leaving the rest of the field to Polish state-run firms. Earlier this year another U.S. energy major Chevron Corp  gave up looking for shale gas in Poland, following the withdrawal of Exxon Mobil, Total and Marathon Oil over the past three years. ConocoPhillips said its subsidiary Lane Energy Poland has invested around $220 million in Poland since 2009. It drilled seven wells over its three Western Baltic concessions. “We understand the disappointment surrounding this difficult decision,” Tim Wallace, ConocoPhillips country manager in Poland, was quoted as saying in a statement. “Unfortunately, commercial volumes of natural gas were not encountered.” ConocoPhillips also said it expected a charge related to the Poland withdrawal of approximately $90 million pre-tax, and around $30 million after-tax. Global oil firms were attracted to Poland a few years ago, sharing a belief that eastern Europe’s biggest economy would  repeat the shale gas boom seen in the United States. In 2011 Poland’s former Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that he expected the first commercial shale gas in 2014, expressing hopes it will help Poland significantly reduce its reliance on gas imports from Russia. A drastic cut in Poland’s estimated shale gas reserves marked a first blow in 2012 and a slump in oil prices in the past year proved a second. While exploratory drilling has been done, Poland has not delivered a single commercial well. The only companies that declare further drilling are the state-run gas distributor PGNiG  and the refiner PKN Orlen.

The Houston-based company said it would cut 2015 capital spending to $11 billion from $11.5 billion, and also lowered its forecast for operating expenses. Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said Conoco was preparing for “lower, more volatile prices.” Crude prices have tumbled about 20 percent since June 23 on expectations of new supply from Iran following its recent nuclear deal with world powers, as well as on slowing Chinese demand and growing inventories.

The Calgary-based company said it now expects to prune its workforce of 4,600 by about 15 percent by the end of this year and cut more jobs in early 2016.  Cenovus also raised its cost reduction target for 2015 by 40 percent to C$280 million ($215 million) and reiterated plans to take a more disciplined approach to growth in light of low crude prices. “I’m now of the opinion that we could well experience pretty low and volatile prices through 2017,” Chief Executive Brian Ferguson told analysts on a conference call.  Ferguson added that if U.S. crude stays in the $50 to $55 per barrel range, the company would still be able to fund expansion of its Foster Creek and Christina Lake oil sand projects in northern Alberta. Oil prices LCOc1 CLc1 have plunged roughly 55 percent in the past year, forcing many Canadian producers to cut jobs and slash costs. Cenovus produces oil at Christina Lake and Foster Creek, both of which are joint ventures with ConocoPhillips (COP.N), and at other assets. It also has a 50 percent stake in two U.S. refineries. The company said its focus for 2015 is on sustaining its existing output and completing expansion projects already under way.  It will wait until 2016 to consider expansion projects deferred earlier this year, with investment decisions dependent on oil price stability, balance sheet strength and other factors. Cash flow, a measure of Cenovus’s ability to fund new projects, dropped 60 percent to C$477 million in the second quarter. Net income fell to C$126 million, or 15 Canadian cents per share, from C$615 million, or 81 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.

In a partial ruling last year, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) said that the 2007 takeover by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez of Conoco’s oil projects was unlawful. On Tuesday, Venezuela’s Attorney General’s Office said it formally requested the previous day that ICSID “reconsider its position with respect to the ruling.” The OPEC nation has requested various reviews of recent ICSID decisions, which critics see as attempts to stall the payment of fines. Venezuela is in the midst of a recession, due partly to low oil prices. Crude accounts for 96 percent of the country’s foreign income. In July the World Bank tribunal rejected Venezuela’s request to recuse two arbitrators for their “marked attitude against the Republic.” Last October, Conoco filed for arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce against Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA for compensation related to the termination of its partnership contract after the nationalization of oil projects.

The proposed divestment by ConocoPhillips follows a series relinquishments of oil and gas assets in Indonesia in recent months amid oil prices that have dropped more than 50 percent over the last year. Majors ExxonMobil and BP have both handed back exploration blocks this year to Indonesia, and Swedish independent Lundin Petroleum has said it is exiting the country. ConocoPhillips has proposed to upstream oil and gas regulator SKKMigas to open its data room for its holding in South Natuna Sea Block B, the agency’s spokesman Elan Biantoro told Reuters. Such requests were usually made by companies “that want to farm out their participating interests,” he noted. ConocoPhillips was opening the data room to offer its share to other investors, company spokesman Joang Laksanto confirmed. ConocoPhillips holds a 40 percent interest in South Natuna Sea Block B, and other companies with participating interests are Chevron, with 25 percent, and Japan’s Inpex, which holds 35 percent. Company representatives declined to comment on whether ConocoPhillips plans to sell its entire stake or a portion of its interest in the Natuna block. The representatives also would not say if the proposed sale would impact ConocoPhillips commitment to invest $2.5 billion in Indonesia over the next three to four years. Operating two oil and gas blocks in Indonesia - Natuna and the Corridor Block in South Sumatra - ConocoPhillips contributes more than 20 percent of Indonesia’s natural gas production, 24 percent of its liquefied petroleum gas output and 6-7 percent of its crude oil production, according to Indonesia’s energy minister, Sudirman Said.   ConocoPhillips’ contract to operate the Natuna Sea Block B is due to expire in 2028. According to data from SKKMigas, the South Natuna Sea Block B is expected to produced between 15,000 and 17,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in 2016, down from 21,400 bpd this year.

The proposed divestment by ConocoPhillips follows a series relinquishments of oil and gas assets in Indonesia in recent months amid oil prices that have dropped more than 50 percent over the last year. Majors ExxonMobil and BP have both handed back exploration blocks this year to Indonesia, and Swedish independent Lundin Petroleum has said it is exiting the country. ConocoPhillips has proposed to upstream oil and gas regulator SKKMigas to open its data room for its holding in South Natuna Sea Block B, the agency’s spokesman Elan Biantoro told Reuters. Such requests were usually made by companies “that want to farm out their participating interests,” he noted. ConocoPhillips was opening the data room to offer its share to other investors, company spokesman Joang Laksanto confirmed. ConocoPhillips holds a 40 percent interest in South Natuna Sea Block B, and other companies with participating interests are Chevron, with 25 percent, and Japan’s Inpex , which holds 35 percent. Company representatives declined to comment on whether ConocoPhillips plans to sell its entire stake or a portion of its interest in the Natuna block. The representatives also would not say if the proposed sale would impact ConocoPhillips commitment to invest $2.5 billion in Indonesia over the next three to four years. Operating two oil and gas blocks in Indonesia - Natuna and the Corridor Block in South Sumatra - ConocoPhillips contributes more than 20 percent of Indonesia’s natural gas production, 24 percent of its liquefied petroleum gas output and 6-7 percent of its crude oil production, according to Indonesia’s energy minister, Sudirman Said. ConocoPhillips’ contract to operate the Natuna Sea Block B is due to expire in 2028. According to data from SKKMigas, the South Natuna Sea Block B is expected to produced between 15,000 and 17,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in 2016, down from 21,400 bpd this year. The block is also expected to produce between 203 million and 300 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of gas in 2016, versus 296 mmscfd this year.

728,COP,"UPDATE 1-Penn West, ConocoPhillips cut combined 900 jobs in Canada","(Adds Penn West layoffs, quote) By Nia Williams CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 1 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips  and Penn West Petroleum are eliminating a combined 900 jobs in Canada, the two companies said on Tuesday, as low oil prices persist. Both companies said most of their cuts would come from their offices in Calgary, the corporate capital of Canada’s 3.7 million barrel-per-day oil industry. Global oil major ConocoPhillips is laying off 400 employees, 15 percent of its Canadian workforce, and 100 contractors. Spokesman Rob Evans said the cuts, which staff were told about on Monday, would take effect in mid-October. “We had previously informed staff that there would be reductions by the end of the year, so yesterday’s announcement was meant to add context and clarity to that conversation,” Evans said. ConocoPhillips, which has oil sands operations as part of its international portfolio, is reducing its global workforce by 10 percent on average because of low oil prices. News of the cuts came on the same day the company announced first oil at its new Surmont 2 thermal project in northern Alberta. Light-oil producer Penn West said it would lay off about 400 employees and contractors that make up 35 percent of its workforce. Many oil industry workers were bracing for a fresh round of layoffs in September after global crude benchmarks plunged to 6-1/2-year lows in August. U.S. crude was last trading at $45.61 a barrel, down more than 50 percent since the slide started in June 2014. The third quarter is typically the time when companies complete their spending plans and budgets for next year. Alberta alone has lost more than 35,000 oil patch jobs this year, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

732,COP,ConocoPhillips signals conditional support for U.N. climate deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips on Friday said it would support a UN climate change agreement if it met its own policy principles, including creating a “level playing among energy sources and between countries.”  The comments by the Houston-based company were a clarification of its position on the proposed UN agreement after it earlier in the week answered ‘yes’ to a question in a climate change survey that asked whether it backed a 2015 UN accord.  The company’s partial endorsement comes as pressure grows on U.S. oil  majors to follow the lead of European counterparts who backed the UN climate negotiation process and called for a global carbon pricing system to tackle carbon emissions. The survey by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) asked 2,000 companies whether their boards of directors would support a UN deal that would limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees C. [here] The CDP on Wednesday pointed to ‘yes’ responses by Conoco Phillips and Russian energy giant Gazprom [GAZPI.UL]. By Thursday the CDP dropped the mention of ConocoPhillips and changed the company’s ‘yes’ answer on the survey to a blank after the oil major complained the UK-based organization had not accurately reflected its position. “In hindsight, had we known CDP would only include one part of our answer, we would not have responded with an unqualified ‘yes,’” the company said in a statement. Among Conoco’s other conditions for supporting a global deal are that an agreement that avoids technology mandates and promotes investment in research and development.   EUROPEAN-US DIVIDE Six European majors, including Shell and Total, tried to get US peers to join them in a global sector-wide response to the climate talks and back a global carbon pricing system, but they declined. “This move by ConocoPhillips highlights the widening gap between European majors who have called for a carbon price and the North American majors,” said Shanna Cleveland, senior manager at environmental advocacy nonprofit Ceres.

Tim Smith, director of shareholder engagement at Walden Asset Management, a responsible investment portfolio management firm, said investors have been pressing ConocoPhillips to improve its climate position by challenging some of the trade groups it belongs to, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber wants to block the regulations needed for the U.S. to meet its Paris emission reduction pledge.  Smith said Conoco faces competing demands from green and investor-activist groups and from industry lobby groups worried that a UN deal will call for a total phase-out of fossil fuels. “They are looking over both shoulders to see where the pressures are coming from,” he said.

734,COP,"U.S. judge upholds Conoco as sole owner of coker at Sweeny, Texas refinery","HOUSTON (Reuters) - A federal court in New York has upheld a ruling granting U.S. oil and gas company ConocoPhillips sole ownership of a unit at the Sweeny, Texas refinery in a long-running dispute over the asset with Venezuela’s PDVSA.  In 2014, an International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration panel awarded ConocoPhillips full ownership of Merey Sweeny LP, a delayed coking unit at its 247,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Sweeny refinery. PDVSA had asked that the decision be vacated. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, in a decision signed last week, wrote that PDVSA’s request was baseless and confirmed Conoco was the sole owner of the unit, which processes heavy crude oil. Conoco and PDVSA formed a joint venture in the late 1990s to run the refining unit. But they went to arbitration before the ICC in 2010 after crude supply interruptions that triggered a contract provision dissolving the pact. Phillips 66 has owned and operated the delayed coker and related facilities at the Sweeny refinery since it was spun off from Conoco in 2012. A Phillips 66 spokesman confirmed PDVSA is entitled to appeal the decision within 30 days. PDVSA’s lawyer George Kahale of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, said in an e-mail on Tuesday: “We think the decision is incorrect and will be filing a notice of appeal shortly.” Under the terms of the contract, Conoco paid nothing for PDVSA’s stake. A breakup clause said Conoco would gain the stake free of charge if PDVSA’s dividends exceeded its capital contributions. Its dividends were $1.1 billion, while its capital contribution was about $270 million, the decision said. Conoco was also obligated to assume PDVSA’s debt, which was about $195 million. On top of PDVSA’s loss of the asset, contracts between the parties could still require PDVSA to supply crude to the Sweeny unit. “PDVSA and its affiliates would still be contractually required to supply ConocoPhillips with Venezuelan crude oil even if they lost their share of the joint venture,” the judge ruled. Houston-based Conoco is also waiting for a broader arbitration ruling over its oil assets in Venezuela that were nationalized by late President Hugo Chavez. That case was filed in 2007 before a World Bank tribunal.  In a partial ruling, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) said in 2013 the South American country failed to act in good faith when expropriating the assets.

739,COP,RPT-U.S. mutual funds that bet bigger on energy sector get burned,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - One-in-four U.S. large-cap mutual funds have increased their stakes in energy companies this year and many have suffered heavier losses than their peers as a result of ill-timed bets. The moves into shares of frackers, refiners and integrated oil conglomerates reflect a gamble that the sector will rebound after rising supply and slowing global growth triggered a nearly 60 percent slide in crude prices since the middle of 2014. But so far, the gambit has not paid off. “We are kind of holding our nose to buy them, but we see value there,” said Ernesto Ramos, who oversees about $15 billion in large-cap equity assets at BMO Asset Management. “We’ve been selling the defensive part of the portfolio exposed negatively to higher interest rates, such as consumer staples and utilities, and making room for what we see as a slow but gradual recovery in world growth.” BMO’s Large-Cap Value Fund boosted it energy exposure to 13 percent from 10 percent at the end of February after buying more shares of ExxonMobil Corp and refiner Valero Energy Corp , for example. With oil prices down, ExxonMobil is seen as a defensive play because its refineries and chemicals manufacturing can benefit from lower input costs and offset lower profits from crude production. Shares of Exxon and other oil majors, such as Chevron Corp  and ConocoPhillips are hardly doing any better than the S&P; 500 Energy Index, which is down 25 percent this year. Exxon shares are off 21 percent, while Chevron and Conoco are down 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, reflecting expectations that the global crude supply glut will persist, ultimately weighing on their returns. A Reuters analysis of 265 actively managed large-cap funds with at least $500 million in assets and combined assets of about $1.8 trillion, revealed that 25 percent of them increased their energy sector bets this year. That overall group of funds produced an average return of minus 7.17 percent so far this year, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company. And three-quarters of the funds that increased  their exposure to energy performed worse than the overall average. (Graphic: link.reuters.com/mug75w) Investors have not been pleased with the shift, pulling nearly $27 billion from funds that increased exposure to energy, according to Lipper data. Those which did not, saw about the same amount of net investor withdrawals, but over a larger number of funds with nearly five times more in assets, Lipper data shows. BMO’s Ramos said managers and investors have to remain patient with their energy picks. “We think we will eventually be rewarded with these stocks,” he said. The $2 billion Ridgeworth Large Cap Value Equity Fund  made among the biggest bets on the energy sector among its peers earlier this year, raising its exposure to 14 percent at the end of August from 6.7 percent at the end of February, according to Lipper. The fund nearly doubled its stake in ConocoPhillips and bought more shares in EOG Resources, Hess Corp and Noble Energy Inc, disclosures show. All of those stocks are down at least 19 percent over the past three months, badly underperforming broad benchmarks. The Ridgeworth fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story. Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too. Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund’s assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time. Chesapeake stock has fallen 70 percent since November, and 39 percent since June, to below $7 a share.

740,COP,UPDATE 1-Australia's Origin seeks to raise $1.8 bln to ease oil price pain,"* Origin to offer 4-for-7 shares at 34 pct discount * To cut dividend, capital spending and sell some assets * Shares have slumped to nine-year low * Australia Pacific LNG still seen profitable   (Adds CEO, analyst comments) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Australia’s Origin Energy  has asked its shareholders for $1.8 billion to help cut debt as weak oil prices have dented the outlook for its huge liquefied natural gas project. The move by Australia’s largest gas and power retailer comes after mining and trading giant Glencore Plc was forced to sell new shares, suspend its dividend and flag asset sales to cut its $30 billion debt pile amid a broad slump in commodities, and after Origin’s rival Santos put its assets on the block. Origin is turning to shareholders to raise money after its shares sank to a nine-year low, down nearly 30 percent over the past month, as investors feared it would not be able to service its A$10.3 billion ($7.2 billion) in net debt. It had banked on doing so with revenue from its A$25 billion Australia Pacific LNG project (APLNG). “The broader market has made very clear that the combination of (oil) price volatility and the levels of debt we have in our business are a deterrent to investors investing in the company, and we must fix that,” Chief Executive Grant King told reporters on Wednesday. Investors pressured Origin to beef up its balance sheet  just as APLNG is set to start producing, with its oil-linked LNG revenue hit by the slump in world oil prices to their lowest since 2009. Origin’s King had said in August there was no need to issue equity after the company sold its stake in New Zealand’s Contact Energy and cut debt. “They’ve been pushed into this position as a result of the continued weakness in the oil price. Following a significant share price fall, it’s far from an ideal situation,” said Gareth James, an analyst at Morningstar in Sydney. Origin said it wants to raise A$2.5 billion by selling new shares to existing shareholders at a 34 percent discount to the stock’s closing price of A$6.10 on Tuesday. It also plans to reap a further A$2.2 billion by cutting dividends by a fifth, paring capital spending and selling some gas pipelines, wind farm investments and exploration stakes. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s both affirmed their ratings on Origin after its announcement, saying it would now have a strong buffer for its investment grade ratings. King said APLNG, co-owned by ConocoPhillips and China’s Sinopec, would break even at $38-$42 per barrel of oil equivalent. Benchmark Brent crude last traded at $48. “On every analysis that we run it will still be a valuable investment for shareholders,” he added.

741,COP,U.S. mutual funds that bet bigger on energy sector get burned,"BOSTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - One-in-four U.S. large-cap mutual funds have increased their stakes in energy companies this year and many have suffered heavier losses than their peers as a result of ill-timed bets. The moves into shares of frackers, refiners and integrated oil conglomerates reflect a gamble that the sector will rebound after rising supply and slowing global growth triggered a nearly 60 percent slide in crude prices since the middle of 2014. But so far, the gambit has not paid off. “We are kind of holding our nose to buy them, but we see value there,” said Ernesto Ramos, who oversees about $15 billion in large-cap equity assets at BMO Asset Management. “We’ve been selling the defensive part of the portfolio exposed negatively to higher interest rates, such as consumer staples and utilities, and making room for what we see as a slow but gradual recovery in world growth.” BMO’s Large-Cap Value Fund boosted it energy exposure to 13 percent from 10 percent at the end of February after buying more shares of ExxonMobil Corp and refiner Valero Energy Corp , for example. With oil prices down, ExxonMobil is seen as a defensive play because its refineries and chemicals manufacturing can benefit from lower input costs and offset lower profits from crude production. Shares of Exxon and other oil majors, such as Chevron Corp  and ConocoPhillips are hardly doing any better than the S&P; 500 Energy Index, which is down 25 percent this year. Exxon shares are off 21 percent, while Chevron and Conoco are down 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, reflecting expectations that the global crude supply glut will persist, ultimately weighing on their returns. A Reuters analysis of 265 actively managed large-cap funds with at least $500 million in assets and combined assets of about $1.8 trillion, revealed that 25 percent of them increased their energy sector bets this year. That overall group of funds produced an average return of minus 7.17 percent so far this year, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company. And three-quarters of the funds that increased  their exposure to energy performed worse than the overall average. (Graphic: link.reuters.com/mug75w) Investors have not been pleased with the shift, pulling nearly $27 billion from funds that increased exposure to energy, according to Lipper data. Those which did not, saw about the same amount of net investor withdrawals, but over a larger number of funds with nearly five times more in assets, Lipper data shows. BMO’s Ramos said managers and investors have to remain patient with their energy picks. “We think we will eventually be rewarded with these stocks,” he said. The $2 billion Ridgeworth Large Cap Value Equity Fund  made among the biggest bets on the energy sector among its peers earlier this year, raising its exposure to 14 percent at the end of August from 6.7 percent at the end of February, according to Lipper. The fund nearly doubled its stake in ConocoPhillips and bought more shares in EOG Resources, Hess Corp and Noble Energy Inc, disclosures show. All of those stocks are down at least 19 percent over the past three months, badly underperforming broad benchmarks. The Ridgeworth fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story. Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too. Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund’s assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time. Chesapeake stock has fallen 70 percent since November, and 39 percent since June, to below $7 a share. The fund, run by Capital Group’s American Funds, declined to comment, saying as a matter of policy the company does not discuss individual holdings. The fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 8.90 percent is worse than that of 66 percent of peers, according to Lipper.

744,COP,Conoco CEO: Lifting U.S. oil export ban 'No. 1 on my wish list',"BOSTON (Reuters) - The head of U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips on Thursday renewed a call for the Obama administration to lift a ban on crude exports to help revive the struggling domestic energy industry, saying the move was “number one on my wish list.” The comments come amid intensifying debate in Washington on whether to reverse the 40-year-old ban, imposed after the Arab oil embargo. A Republican-sponsored bill to repeal it passed the House of Representatives last week, but faces an uncertain future after a veto threat by President Barack Obama. “Allowing exports would ... help save existing jobs and create new jobs,” Conoco’s CEO, Ryan Lance, told an audience at the Boston College Chief Executives Club Luncheon in Boston, adding he believed the move would also help the economy and produce increased tax revenue. “Now, if we could only get the administration to act. That’s number one on my wish list,” he said. Texas-based ConocoPhillips bills itself as the world’s biggest independent exploration and production company, with daily output of about 1.5 million barrels per day from its worldwide operations. U.S. oil producers eager to ship oil to markets in Asia and Europe argue the ban has led to a glut of U.S. sweet crude that is choking domestic drilling. Democrats have been cool to the idea, citing concerns that exports would raise prices. The rise of fracking technology, which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into a well to extract oil or gas, has helped lift U.S. production of oil by 45 percent since 2010. That helped touch off the historic slide in oil prices that has forced energy companies like ConocoPhillips to slash capital budgets and cut thousands of jobs.

746,COP,"UPDATE 3-Conoco posts quarterly loss, cuts 2015 spending target","(Adds Breakingviews link, updates share price) By Anna Driver Oct 29 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips reported a third-quarter loss on Thursday, and the largest U.S. independent oil company lowered its 2015 spending target in response to the lingering slump in crude prices. The Houston-based company said it would divest assets and lower its cost structure in response to the more than 50 percent slide in crude oil prices from last year’s high of more than $100 per barrel. Still, the company, which increased its quarterly dividend in July, remains committed to a “compelling” payout, Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said in a statement. Conoco said it would further cut its 2015 capital budget, to $10.2 billion from $11.0 billion. On a conference call with analysts, executives said Conoco planned to exit all deepwater exploration by 2017 as other projects win out in the budgeting process. Currently, it has deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Senegal, Angola and Canada. “Within our portfolio, (deepwater exploration) doesn’t look like an opportunity that competes for capital,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Sheets said in an interview. Conoco would also consider selling the deepwater prospects it is appraising, Sheets said. The company posted a loss of $1.1 billion, or 87 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $2.7 billion, or $2.17 per share. Excluding one-time items from restructuring and the cancellation of a Gulf of Mexico drillship contract, the loss was 38 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting a loss of 37 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Output from continuing operations, excluding Libya, was 1.554 million barrels oil equivalent per day, compared with 1.473 mboed a year ago. Shares of Conoco closed 0.5 percent higher at $53.62 on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock is down nearly 23 percent.

The U.S. oil company was told to pay 1.68 million yuan ($266,000) to the 21 farmers, who did not participate in a previous settlement reached in 2012 with ConocoPhillips and its partner, Chinese state-owned oil major China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the Tianjin Maritime Court said in a statement on its website. The farmers were seeking more than 141 million yuan ($22 million) from the two oil companies over leaks that were first discovered in June 2011 at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, a joint exploration project by the two. The leaked oil spread across as much as 6,200 sq km of water in Bohai Bay, according to court documents.

New regulations allow companies that signed traditional exploration contracts before 2012 to include exploitation of non-traditional sources of oil, like fracking. U.S.-based ConocoPhillips and CNE Oil and Gas, a subsidiary of Canada’s Canacol Energy, have both signed non-traditional exploration agreements with the national hydrocarbons agency following the change, the agency said in a statement. Exploration will take place in the VMM-3 block, in the northeastern provinces of Cesar and Santander, and will require at least $85 million in investment. “This is very good news for the industry and for the country to receive this request to add a contract for development of non-traditional reserves,” agency president Mauricio de la Mora said. “It’s a bet on the increase of reserves, so necessary for the country.” Colombia’s national income has been battered by a slump in prices for crude, its largest export and source of foreign exchange. The country has 2.3 billion barrels of reserves, roughly equal to 6.4 years of consumption.

The company’s shares rose as much as 3 percent on Thursday, after it said it would cut capital spending to $7.7 billion in 2016 from an estimated $10.2 billion this year. ConocoPhillips expects to spend a bulk of next year’s budget on U.S. shale fields in Texas and North Dakota, and on drilling operations in Alaska and Gulf of Mexico. The company’s budget cut announcement comes a day after larger rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said it planned to slash its budget by 24 percent in 2016. Oil producers are reining in capital budgets and cutting costs as oil prices show little sign of rising in the near future. ConocoPhillips said on Thursday it expects operating costs to fall by $500 million next year. “The company is defending the balance sheet and dividend with more aggressive opex reductions than its peers,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Roger Read wrote in a note. The next year will be the second year of reduced spending for most U.S. oil producers. A more than 60 percent fall in oil prices since June 2014 forced several rounds of spending cuts this year. Global exploration and production spending is expected to fall by 11 percent in 2016, adding to a 20 percent decline in 2015, according to analysts at Evercore ISI. ConocoPhillips, which has already raised $600 million from asset sales this year, said it expects to close a further $1.7 billion of disposals, latest by the first quarter of 2016. The company is also planning to raise an additional $1 billion to $2 billion from asset sales in 2017. ConocoPhillips does not expect additional borrowings in 2017, given the asset sales, Chief Finance Officer Jeff Sheets said on a call with analysts. “Modest borrowing” of about $2 billion can be expected next year, Sheets said. The company had nearly $25 billion in debt as of September end. Conoco said it expects 2016 production to grow 1-3 percent from an estimated 1,515-1,525 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), on an adjusted basis, this year, excluding Libya. “We had expected production at these spending levels to remain relatively flat, so the growth outlook is incrementally positive,” said RBC Capital Markets analysts.

The company is also planning to raise an additional $1 billion to $2 billion from asset sales in 2017. ConocoPhillips does not expect additional borrowings in 2017, given the asset sales, Chief Finance Officer Jeff Sheets said on a call with analysts. “Modest borrowing” of about $2 billion can be expected next year, Sheets said. The company had nearly $25 billion in debt as of September end. Conoco said it expects 2016 production to grow 1-3 percent from an estimated 1,515-1,525 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), on an adjusted basis, this year, excluding Libya. “We had expected production at these spending levels to remain relatively flat, so the growth outlook is incrementally positive,” said RBC Capital Markets analysts.

Several companies have expressed interest in buying the stakes in the South Natuna Sea Block B, Upstream Oil and Gas Director Djoko Siswanto said on Friday, without giving details. ConocoPhillips currently holds a 40 percent operating interest in the production sharing contract (PSC) for the block, while Chevron holds 25 percent and Japanese oil and gas producer Inpex Corp has 35 percent. The PSC is due to expire in 2028. A spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips’ Indonesian unit told Reuters the company was making an effort to sell its interest in the block.  “The process is ongoing,” ConocoPhillips’ Indonesia Corporate and External Communications Manager Diarmila Sutedja said in an emailed statement.  Sutedja said the government has approved a request by the company to open its data room for sharing exploration and reserves data on the block with interested parties. Under Indonesian law, all information on oil and gas is owned by the state. “We have had a presence in Indonesia for more than 45 years and it is a meaningful part of our portfolio.” According to the statement, South Natuna Sea Block B has three producing oilfields, as well as 16 natural gas fields in various phases of development. Among these, eight gas fields are currently in production, five of which have associated recoverable oil or condensate volumes. Natural gas from the block is sold to Singapore and Malaysia through two long-term contracts, while LPG is sold to Indonesia through a contract with its state energy company, Pertamina [PERTM.UL]. Average daily production in 2014 included 5,000 barrels of crude and 117 million cubic feet of gas, according to the statement. A spokesman for Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter.

767,COP,COLUMN-LNG looks poised to follow crude oil's plunge: Russell,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 18 (Reuters) - - In contrast to the carnage in crude oil markets, liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices in Asia have enjoyed relative stability for the past three months, but it’s unlikely the calm will persist much longer. Spot Asian LNG prices LNG-AS ended last week at $5.60 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), about 28 percent below the recent peak of $7.80 reached on Nov. 22. In contrast, Brent crude oil has dropped 46 percent from its recent peak in early October to trade currently around $28.55 a barrel. The relative outperformance of spot LNG holds over the longer term as well, with the price of the super-chilled fuel having dropped 68 percent since its all-time high of $20.50 per mmBtu in February 2014. Brent has declined by 75 percent since its 2014 closing peak of $115.06 a barrel, reached on June 19 of that year. While both markets would appear to suffer from excess supply and less than stellar demand growth, what appears to be happening is that LNG is currently trading with a lag to crude. The reasons for the decline in oil appear well understood by the market, even if the current drop below $30 a barrel is viewed as unsustainable for an extended period given the amount of global production that will be loss-making. Oil markets have been oversupplied since the decision by top exporter Saudi Arabia not to balance the market by cutting output, but rather to let low prices eventually drive out higher-cost producers. The return of at least 500,000 barrels per day of Iranian crude in the short term after the lifting of Western sanctions is also putting a dampener on oil prices. But the outlook for LNG in 2016 looks just as bad, if not worse, than that for crude. The oversupply in LNG, particularly in the Asian region, is set to increase dramatically in the next few months as new projects in Australia ramp up. The 9 million tonnes-a-year Australian Pacific LNG project, co-owned by ConocoPhillips and Origin Energy, shipped its first cargo on Jan. 9, becoming the third coal-seam gas to LNG plant to start operating in Australia’s Queensland state in the past year. On the other side of Australia, Chevron said it’s on track to export its first cargo early this year from the 15.6 million tonnes-a-year Gorgon venture, the world’s most expensive LNG project with an estimated cost of $54 billion. And it’s not just Australia that’s flooding the market with new LNG, shipments from the United States are coming in the next few months as well. While the first cargoes from the lower 48 states have been delayed, the point is that by late February or early March it’s likely that Cheniere Energy Partners will join the global LNG supply boom with exports from the first train of six planned at its Sabine Pass project. While Sabine Pass is the only U.S. LNG plant scheduled to start this year, four more are currently under construction. Australia also has two more conventional LNG projects under construction, which are due to start output later this year, and  Royal Dutch Shell’s Prelude floating LNG project, which is slated to start operating next year. In total, the new Australian projects started in the past 12 months and those expected to commence shipments in the next 12 to 18 months will add 61.8 million tonnes of capacity, while plants under construction in the United States could add 72 million tonnes by 2020. The demand for LNG looks certain to be unable to keep up with the additional supply coming, meaning that prices will likely have to fall to incentivise coal-to-gas switching in top Asian consumers Japan, South Korea and China, as well as in Europe. Global demand will grow by 23 million tonnes in 2016, according to consultancy Energy Aspects, but only 7.1 million tonnes of this will be in Asia. If this is the case, it’s logical to expect that the flood of Australian LNG will force spot Asian prices lower, as well as displacing Qatari LNG cargoes from the region. This means more Qatari shipments will likely head to Europe, competing with the nascent cargoes from the U.S. Gulf coast. Overall, it appears likely that LNG’s period of calm relative to oil is poised to end, and spot prices should decline to at least match the plunge in crude, or perhaps even exceed it, especially as the lower-demand shoulder season starts with the end of the northern winter around March.

769,COP,Conoco cuts dividend for first time in 25 years on crude crash,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) slashed its quarterly dividend for the first time in at least 25 years and further lowered its capital budget for 2016 as a relentless fall in crude oil prices took its toll on the largest U.S. independent oil company. Shares of ConocoPhillips, which reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, fell 4 percent to $37.08. Global crude oil prices have dropped about 70 percent from their 2014 high of over $100 barrel, eroding profitability at nearly all oil producers and limiting their ability to award shareholders cash. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, reported its smallest quarterly profit in more than a decade on Tuesday and said it would slow share buybacks. Noble Energy Inc. (NBL.N) cut its dividend last week. With oil prices now hovering at about $30 barrel, producers are cutting investments in new wells and projects, triggering another large wave of spending curbs. ConocoPhillips on Thursday lowered its 2016 capital expenditure target by 17 percent to $6.4 billion, and its operating cost forecast by 9 percent to $7 billion. The reduction is the second in two months. ConocoPhillips also trimmed its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 74 cents. That is the first reduction since at least 1991, according to the web site of the company, which split from refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) in 2012, assuring investors of faster dividend growth. “We believe it’s prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time,” Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement. The dividend cut and lowered spending will help ConocoPhillips add $4.4 billion to net cash flow in 2016, he said.     The company said it expects 2016 production to be unchanged  from 2015, excluding the impact of asset sales.  It produced 1.589 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mmboe/d) in 2015.      ConocoPhillips forecast current-quarter output of 1.54-1.58 mmboe/d, lower than the 1.599 mmboe/d it produced from continuing operations in the fourth quarter.

Excluding a $2.7 billion impairment charge and other items, it lost 90 cents per share, wider than estimates of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

773,COP,U.S. approves ConocoPhillips LNG exports from Alaska,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy approved ConocoPhillips’ application to export about 40 billion cubic feet of natural gas from its Kenai liquefied natural gas export terminal in Alaska over the next two years starting Feb. 19. The Kenai facility was the first LNG export facility in the United States. Most of the gas exports from Kenai have gone to Japan since the plant entered service in 1969. In a few weeks, the fist LNG export terminal in the lower 48 states is expected to enter service at Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana. The federal approval will allow ConocoPhillips to export gas to any country the United States has a free-trade agreement with or any other country with which trade is not prohibited by U.S. law. With growth in pipeline exports to Mexico and LNG exports to the world, the United States is expected to transition from a net importer of gas to a net exporter by 2017 as the nation’s shale gas production continues to grow, according to federal energy forecasts. The United States was last a net exporter of gas in 1957. In 2015, the U.S. exported on average 0.07 bcf per day from Alaska, according to federal data. That is expected to rise to 0.5 bcfd in 2016 and 1.33 bcfd in 2017 with the startup of the liquefaction units at Sabine Pass and other LNG facilities, according to federal forecasts. For comparison, the United States produces about 80 bcfd of gas, according to federal data. ConocoPhillips last received an export license from the federal government for the Kenai plant in April 2014. It also authorized the company to export about 40 bcf of gas over a two-year period.

775,COP,CORRECTED-RPT-COLUMN-Australia's tough miners want government help; shouldn't get it: Russell,"(Corrects to change that Western Australia royalty payments were deferred and not waived in 25th paragraph.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 10 (Reuters) - - When the going gets tough, the tough ask for tax relief. If you are looking for a sign that the end game of the commodity downturn is getting closer, witness the clamour for more support from Australia’s embattled resources sector. Asking for government help is one of the last steps a mining company can take to stay alive, assuming it’s already exhausted every conceivable cost saving, emptied the pockets of its owners and reached the limits of what its bankers will lend. The latest call came this week from the Queensland Resources Council (QRC), which said the coal mining industry needs support to keep the remaining 60,000 workers employed, following the loss of 21,000 jobs in the past two years. “We are not looking for bailouts or subsidies but our entire sector needs certainty and support in the shape of commitments to reduce red tape and unjustified government-imposed and government-sanctioned costs,” QRC Chief Executive Michael Roche said in a Feb. 8 statement. “At the top of our list are royalties, local government rates and the charges from government and private sector providers of rail, port, power and water services,” he said. The preceding two paragraphs from the statement illustrate the problem facing the resources sector, insofar as they don’t want to be seen to be asking for government handouts, although in effect that’s exactly what they want. Asking for relief from royalty payments, other government charges and for lower costs at government-owned facilities is a de facto request to receive what could broadly be termed as a handout. It may well be the case, especially for smaller and higher-cost coal mines, that more jobs will be lost and pits closed if such relief isn’t forthcoming, as Roche warns. But governments also find themselves in a bind, facing ever-rising demands for more spending on health and other services while seeing the revenue they expected from the resources boom evaporate in the face of low commodity prices. The Queensland state government wrote down the expected revenue from coal-mining royalties over the next four years by almost A$3 billion ($2.11 billion) in its budget last year. This means it’s extremely unlikely to want to lower royalty payments, or the amount state-controlled corporations charge for using railways and ports. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is willing to discuss the issues with the QRC, but won’t hand out cash to mining companies, the Brisbane-based Courier Mail reported on Wednesday. “As I said very clearly, my Government is not in the business of giving money to private enterprise,” the newspaper quoted her as saying. This is a consistent message from Palaszczuk, who earlier this year refused to provide financial guarantees to Queensland Nickel, the refining operation owned by flamboyant miner turned politician Clive Palmer that was placed in voluntary administration last month. It is sensible policy for the Queensland state government to decline to subsidise struggling resource companies, even if this will come at the cost of mine closures and job losses. For politicians in democracies it’s a brave decision to risk job losses and subsequent voter displeasure, even in pursuit of sustainable longer-term industries. For the QRC, there is nothing wrong with lobbying hard in the interests of your members, even if the wider interest of all of them would actually be better served by the collapse of the weakest. It still seems that many in the resources industry haven’t yet grasped that the inevitable consequence of massively overbuilding supply is the failure of the shakiest companies. Queensland, which produces the vast majority of Australia’s coking coal and is also home to three new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, will be better served in the longer term by the closure of unprofitable operations, rather than seeing them cling on through royalty and other government relief. Just like coal, the LNG plants are also facing the reality of huge oversupply, and have started the process of seeking relief, albeit in a somewhat different manner. APLNG, the facility owned by Origin Energy Energy  and ConocoPhillips, is asking the state Supreme Court to set aside the Queensland government’s royalty calculations, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review on Feb. 8. Even if the legal challenge fails, it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to expect the LNG industry to also seek other forms of relief, especially if prices and demand in Asia remain soft. But the problems of government support can be seen across the country in Western Australia, home to the world’s biggest iron ore mining industry. There the state government decided last year to defer 50 percent of royalty payments from smaller mines that were actively trying to restructure their operations. This provided a lifeline to minnows such as BC Iron , but at the same time kept supply in the market that should have been closed down. Iron ore is probably one of the most over-supplied commodities currently, and with the softening outlook for Chinese steel demand is likely to remain that way. The question for governments is whether assistance in any form is actually a help or a hindrance to efforts to re-balance commodity markets. The faster markets can re-balance, the faster the relief of higher prices can be felt by the survivors. Ultimately, a smaller but more sustainable resources sector is better than weak companies struggling along, propped up by the public purse.

779,COP,"Fund managers, convinced oil bottom is here, buy up energy stocks","NEW YORK (Reuters) - After several false starts over the last two years, U.S. fund managers are betting that energy stocks have finally hit bottom.  Firms including T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and American Funds have been adding shares of exploration and production companies that they say have the most to gain from oil prices stabilizing. The price of oil fell from $115 a barrel to $27.88 between June 2014 and January of this year, yet is up more than 50 percent since hitting its low.  The number of funds buying shares of ConocoPhillips jumped 144 percent over the last three months compared with the previous quarter, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar. Occidental Petroleum Corp, meanwhile, had a 110 percent increase in new owners. “The E&P; companies have taken the brunt of the pain that I think they will see in their business, so they will go into recovery faster and first,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood who has been adding to his exposure of the sector.  Some companies in the sector, such as Marathon Oil Corp and Devon Energy Corp have plugged holes in their balance sheets by selling assets and offering additional equity shares to investors, he said, allowing them to withstand a prolonged era of relatively low oil prices.  The rush of fund managers to buy exploration and production companies after several quarters of shedding them is one reason why the sector is up 9 percent for the year to date, outpacing both the 6.3 percent gain for energy stocks as a whole and the 1.8 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor’s 500.  Overall, energy stocks remain the most underweight sector among fund mangers, with the average large cap fund holding approximately 1 percent less of its portfolio in the sector than its weight in the benchmark index, according to Lipper data. Fund managers say that they are buying exploration and production companies in part because they expect the oil glut to dwindle this year as production halts begin to take effect, setting up for a rally in revenue and earnings in 2017. “If you stop being negative on energy, you don’t want to buy a safe energy play, you want to buy a levered play,” said Ernesto Ramos, a portfolio manager at BMO Asset Management Company, referring to EOG Resources, whose revenues are closely tied to oil prices. Shares of the company are up 6.7 percent for the year to date, roughly half of the 14.6 percent increase in oil over the same time.  Overall, earnings among energy companies in the S&P; 500 are expected to fall 66.5 percent in 2016, before gaining 203.1 percent in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The prospects of a revenue and earnings rebound over the next two years is attracting growth-focused fund managers who have typically shied away from the energy sector.  Mike Pytosh, portfolio manager of the Voya MidCap Opportunities fund, said that he shifted his energy exposure during the January and February sell-off from refineries to exploration and production companies that were the hardest hit.  “It certainly got to a point where it was oversold. You have to not look at where the expectations are now, but where these companies will be a year or two out,” he said.

781,COP,"ConocoPhillips swings to loss and slashes budget, again","(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. independent oil company, on Thursday reported a quarterly loss after a year-earlier profit and slashed its 2016 budget for the second time this year, its latest response to the slump in crude prices.     The company, like many of its peers, has had to grapple with shrinking margins resulting from low oil prices. It has slashed its dividend, cut staff and curbed the drilling of new wells, all while trying to preserve growth options should crude prices recover. Oil prices touched a low of $27.10 per barrel during the first quarter before recovering to close at $39.60 at end of March. Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance, trying to balance both approaches, said he would continue to curb costs while also trying to generate strong returns. “As challenging as this price downturn has been, we are a much stronger company for the long term,” Lance said in a statement. Conoco reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.5 billion, or $1.18 per share, compared with a profit of $272 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, the company lost 95 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.05 per share expected by analysts on average.    The Houston-based company cut its forecast for capital spending in 2016 to $5.7 billion from $6.4 billion, just two months after reducing it and slashing its dividend by 25 percent. Production fell to 1.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) from 1.61 million barrels. For the year, Conoco said it still expects to reach a  previously announced production target of roughly 1.53 mboe/d. Total revenue and other income fell 37 percent to $5.02 billion.

785,COP,Conoco CEO looks at hedging options but says market limited,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has looked at using derivatives to lock in oil prices in a volatile market, including so-called floors to guard against any new price drops, but Chief Executive Ryan Lance said on Tuesday the company is too big to hedge all of its output. Lance made the comments at the top independent U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company’s annual shareholder meeting, after a shareholder asked why the company was not hedging its production, on track this year to be about 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboepd). “If you wanted to protect all 1.5 million barrels per day I don’t think the market is that liquid,” he said. “We think it would be very difficult to execute something like that in the marketplace.”    Some operators have complained that tougher financial regulations from Washington have curbed the availability of hedging instruments, but small companies with aggressive hedging programs were able to keep drilling new wells profitably despite the worst price crash in years that started in mid-2014. Lance added that the company’s diverse portfolio around the globe means it sells output against a handful of different oil and gas price benchmarks,  providing it with some amount of what he called “natural” hedging. “We’re spread out along the world so there’s no one individual marker that dominates our revenue flow in the company,” he said. “To get real protection that some of the smaller players do on the hedging practice is not as practical in a company of our size.”  The company has said it plans to sell up to $1 billion in non-core assets this year as it seeks to shore up its balance sheet after slashing its dividend in February for the first time in 25 years. That cut, Lance said, came as credit rating agencies downgraded oil companies for essentially borrowing to pay dividends. Lance told reporters he would not sell at fire-sale prices but said that prices for desirable onshore assets have looked fairly good recently. Two proposals put forth by shareholders failed. One would have required the company to be more forthcoming about political lobbying, especially on issues related to climate change. The other would have curbed the role that reserves growth plays in the bonuses paid to executives.

787,COP,New York energy investor indicted for $45 million tax scheme,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York energy investor has been indicted for engaging in a multiyear scheme to evade paying over $45 million in taxes in connection with the sale of an oil company and the purchase of paintings by European artists, U.S. prosecutors said on Monday. Morris Zukerman, a former Morgan Stanley banker who serves as chairman of investment firm M.E. Zukerman & Co, pleaded not guilty at a hearing in federal court in Manhattan to charges that included tax evasion and wire fraud. The charges followed a two-year grand jury investigation, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stanley Okula said in court. Both Okula and a lawyer for Zukerman, James Bruton, said he is in plea talks. “Hopefully, we’ll be able to resolve this with the government to make things right and resolve things for Mr. Zukerman,” Bruton said following the hearing, where his client’s bail was set at $2.5 million. Zukerman, 71, worked at Morgan Stanley from 1972 to 1988 and served as joint head of the investment bank’s energy group, according to his company’s website. In 1988, he launched M.E. Zukerman & Co, which, according to its website, concentrated its investments in energy, natural resources and agriculture companies. Prosecutors said Zukerman schemed to evade paying taxes on income earned on a 2008 sale of an oil company he co-owned through an M.E. Zukerman subsidiary with a publicly traded company that resulted in his firm receiving $130 million. While the company was not named in court papers, around that same time his company sold a Texas-based firm called Penreco that was co-owned with ConocoPhillips. Prosecutors said Zukerman transferred the sale’s proceeds to a trust and various corporations, including one from which he directed $50 million be used to buy paintings by European artists from the 15th through the 19th centuries. In buying those paintings, which were used to decorate his Manhattan apartment and two family members’ apartments, Zukerman further sought to avoid over $4.5 million in New York state taxes owed on their purchases, prosecutors said. He also schemed to avoid paying New York taxes on a $645,000 pair of diamond earrings, prosecutors said. Zukerman also made $1 million in fraudulent deductions for charitable contributions related to buying property on Black Island off the coast of Maine, and orchestrated fraudulent investment interest expense deductions, prosecutors said.

791,COP,ConocoPhillips has 25 percent of Surmont wells running after wildfire,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has 25 percent of wells activated at its 60,000 barrels per day Surmont oil sands project, which had been shut down as a precaution due to a massive wildfire in northern Alberta, a company executive said on Tuesday. Conoco, the largest U.S. independent oil company, restarted production last week after a 29-day shutdown at its thermal project some 63 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of the fire-stricken town of Fort McMurray. First production started flowing on Friday. The blaze shuttered more than a million barrels per day of crude production in the oil sands region, the world’s third-largest crude reserve, though most producers are now in the process of ramping up. “We have about 25 percent of the wells done,” Perry Berkenpas, senior vice president oil sands, said in an interview at the company’s offices in Calgary. Conoco said 39 of 156 wells are back on line. “What we’ve been able to do is keep within safe operating windows and still ramp-up the production more aggressively than we originally planned,” he said. While he declined to provide a specific timeline for when the site would reach full pre-fire production levels, Berkenpas said it would “probably not” be by early July. Even so, Berkenpas said the company is “absolutely on track” to reach a capacity of 150,000 bpd gross by the end of 2017. The joint venture between Conoco and Total E&P; Canada was producing roughly 60,000 bpd before the fire, or 30,000 bpd net for Conoco alone. Earlier on Tuesday the company said there was very minor damage at Surmont and the majority of its nearly 700 employees were expected on-site by the end of this week. It said it found “very minor damage” with no impact to on-going operations. Thermal operations means that steam is injected into the oil sands reservoir, slowly liquefying the tarry bitumen deposits so they can flow to the surface. In general, the length of time operations are halted and the maturity of the reservoir are crucial for determining how difficult and costly a restart process is. Berkenpas said generally they are finding that the pressures and temperatures either match what they thought they would be, or in some cases were better. “During the startup we found that we have a couple of different wellbore designs (the wells and internal equipment) and some of those designs seem more robust than others and allow us to do the startup and ramp-up a little bit faster than some of the previous designs,” he said.

794,COP,ConocoPhillips pipe spills light oil near Alberta caribou range,"(Reuters) - A ConocoPhillips (COP.N) pipeline has leaked nearly 2,400 barrels of condensate, an ultra-light form of oil, within an endangered caribou and grizzly bear range in west-central Alberta, the company said on Tuesday. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) issued an environmental protection order to the company, which shut down and isolated the pipeline and is investigating the cause of the spill. It is the largest hydrocarbon leak from a pipeline in Alberta since Nexen Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of China’s CNOOC ltd (0883.HK), spilled 31,500 barrels of bitumen emulsion in July 2015, according to the AER website. Last month Apache Canada Ltd (APA.N) spilled 3,800 barrels of produced water near Whitecourt, Alberta.  ConocoPhillips first reported the leaking of condensate, an ultra-light hydrocarbon, from a 7.25-kilometre (4.5-mile) pipeline near its Resthaven gas plant on June 9.  The spill is around 65 km(40 miles) northeast of Grand Cache, Alberta, and is within the Little Smoky Caribou Range, according to the AER. A key wildlife and biodiversity zone is 1 km (0.6 mile) northwest of the site, while a core grizzly bear zone is 5 km (3 miles) south. The AER said there was a dead patch of vegetation near the pipeline and a visible sheen on Webb Creek 300 meters (328 yards) away, which stretched for approximately 4.5 km (2.8 miles) upstream and downstream of a beaver pond. Conoco Phillips has erected a boom, deployed soaker pads to contain the condensate spill and activated its emergency response plan. The company said 150 people were sent at the site. The Simonette River lies 2 km (1.2 miles) downstream of the beaver pond and the AER said although it had not observed any visible sheen, testing showed slightly elevated hydrocarbon levels in the water. “We will conduct a full investigation into the cause of the incident when we’ve brought it to a safe conclusion and participate fully in the AER investigation,” ConocoPhillips said in a statement.

However, oil sands output is still tight as a result of the shutdowns and maintenance work, with imports into the United States, which usually top 3 million bpd, dipping in the latest week.

799,COP,New York energy investor pleads guilty to $45 million tax scheme,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York energy investor pleaded guilty on Monday to charges that he engaged in a years-long scheme to avoid paying more than $45 million in income and other taxes stemming in part from his sale of an oil company. Morris Zukerman, a former Morgan Stanley banker who serves as chairman of investment firm M.E. Zukerman & Co, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of tax evasion and one count of obstructing the Internal Revenue Service.     The plea came just a month after Zukerman, 72, was indicted following a two-year grand jury investigation. Under a plea deal, Zukerman agreed to not appeal any prison sentence of 7-1/4 years or less. His sentencing is set for Dec. 5. “After years of finding every way to avoid his tax obligations, Zukerman has finally been forced to admit to his criminal tax evasion,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. A lawyer for Zukerman did not respond to a request for comment. Zukerman worked at Morgan Stanley from 1972 to 1988 and served as joint head of the investment bank’s energy group before launching M.E. Zukerman & Co, which focused on investing in energy, natural resources and agriculture companies. Prosecutors said Zukerman schemed to evade paying taxes on income earned on a 2008 sale of an oil company he co-owned through an M.E. Zukerman subsidiary with a publicly traded company that resulted in his firm receiving $130 million. While the company was not named in court papers, around that same time Zukerman’s company sold a Texas-based firm called Penreco that was co-owned with ConocoPhillips. Zukerman then transferred the sale’s proceeds to a trust and various corporations, including one from which he directed $50 million be used to buy paintings by European artists from the 15th to 19th centuries, prosecutors said. He also claimed $1 million in fraudulent charitable contribution deductions in connection with the purchase of property on Black Island off Maine’s coast, prosecutors said. The case is U.S. v.

The acquisition includes a 35 percent interest in the 560 million barrel SNE deep water oil discovery and the FAN oil discovery farther offshore, with Woodside gaining the option to become operator for development and production of the fields. “We are taking advantage of our balance sheet to acquire a world-class asset that fits well with our capabilities, offers significant future upside in exploration and line-of-sight to near term oil production,” Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in a statement. The move is key for Woodside which is short of near term growth prospects after giving up multibillion dollar plans to develop gas off Israel, postponing plans to develop the Browse liquefied natural gas project off Australia, and being spurned in a takeover offer for Oil Search. The fields’ operator is currently Britain’s Cairn Energy Plc , which owns 40 percent and is looking to sell down its stake.

ANS is mostly transported to the U.S. West Coast on U.S.-flagged vessels owned by BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil. Two shipments have left U.S. ports this year for destinations in Japan and Nicaragua, but ANS exports remain rare because of the high shipping costs from Alaska. BP spokeswoman Dawn Patience said in an email that the company had chartered Tianlong Spirit, a Bahamas-flagged Suezmax vessel, for commercial and operational reasons. She declined to specify the destination for the crude and said the vessel would sail after BP receives approvals from the state of Alaska and the U.S. Coast Guard. Two trade sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the cargo would sail to Asia. Reuters Vessel Tracking data showed the ship was off the coast of Baja California on Monday. ANS had been exempted from a decades-long U.S. ban on crude exports which was lifted late last year.

814,COP,ConocoPhillips hits snag in Senegal deepwater stake sale to Woodside,"MELBOURNE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips’ plan to sell its stake in an oil find off Senegal to Woodside Petroleum hit a speed-bump on Tuesday as a junior partner attempted to buy time to pre-empt the deal at the same time it announced an increase in the size of the field. ConocoPhillips agreed in July to sell its 35 percent stake in the deepwater SNE field offshore Senegal to Woodside for up to $430 million. At the time, the SNE field was estimated to hold 561 million barrels of oil. On Tuesday, Australian explorer, FAR Ltd, ConocoPhillips’ partner in the field, said Conoco failed to comply with the terms of their joint operating agreement as it relates to the proposed sale of its stake, and as a result, the clock had yet to start for it to exercise its pre-emption rights. “FAR has advised ConocoPhillips of this and both parties have been urged by the Government of Senegal to reach an amicable solution on this matter,” it said. FAR, which owns a 15 percent stake in the SNE field, declined to comment further on its intentions. ConocoPhillips was not immediately available for comment. FAR also released a statement that increased the estimate of so-called 2C contingent oil resources for SNE to 641 million barrels and estimated the field covered more than 350 sq km (135 sq miles), based on recent appraisal well drilling at the field. “SNE is a world class oil field that is truly worthy of the ‘elephant’ title,” FAR Managing Director Cath Norman said in a statement. An analyst said the announcement on the resource increase and the effort to re-set the clock on exercising its pre-emptive rights suggested that FAR, valued at A$348 million ($266 million), was still trying to line up funding to buy ConocoPhillips’ stake. The analyst declined to be named as he is unauthorised to speak to the media. Woodside declined to comment, but said last week it was just awaiting approval from the government of Senegal and did not see any obstacles to the deal, due to be completed by December. Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said Senegal would be an important addition for the company as it looks to boost oil reserves and sees the field coming into production sooner than some of its other prospects. The SNE joint venture’s operator and 40 percent stakeholder, Britain’s Cairn Energy PLC, has said the field could start producing by 2020.

825,COP,"PDVSA bonds drop on lawsuit, exchange","WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (IFR) - The fate of a debt swap from PDVSA was thrown in doubt on Friday after the Venezuelan oil company extended the deadline for the transaction and ConocoPhillips sued over the use of Citgo shares as collateral. PDVSA bonds suffered a multiple point drop as investors expressed concern that a failure to extend maturities on short-term debt would bring the state-owned company closer to a restructuring. “We could be back to square one with an intense redemption calendar that makes it hard for PDVSA to cover,” an investor attending the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington told IFR. Intensifying the focus on the troubled oil exporting nation, Venezuela’s central bank head Nelson Merentes was scheduled to attend a small gathering with investors organized by Deutsche Bank on Friday afternoon. Venezuelan bonds opened several points lower on Friday, with the 2017 notes initially down five to six points and the rest of the curve opening three to four points weaker, according to one trader. They later clawed back roughly half of their intraday losses on the expectation that PDVSA may have to improve the terms of the offer for the second time since the exchange was launched on September 16. PDVSA’s decision on Thursday to extend the early tender deadline of the swap to October 12 suggested to many that the company had received an underwhelming response to its offer, which targets US$7.1bn of bonds maturing in 2017. “As of the prior early tender deadline, substantially less than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the existing notes have been tendered,” the company said Thursday. PDVSA sweetened the transaction last month when it offered more new 2020 bonds backed by shares of its US oil unit Citgo in exchange for bonds maturing in 2017. The new terms were largely viewed as net present value (NPV) positive, but some investors preferred to hold existing bonds to benefit from the initial secondary pop on news of improved terms and the prospects of getting paid at maturity. “We are going to be free-riders,” said a second investor at the IMF meeting, who noted that his Venezuelan holdings were his second-largest contributor to performance this year. But gains were reduced by the sell-off Friday sparked by the extended deadline and a lawsuit filed by oil producer ConocoPhillips against PDVSA in a Delaware court the day before. “This could be a bargaining tactic to dissuade some of the free-riders,” said Sean Newman, a senior portfolio manager at Invesco. In the complaint, ConocoPhillips said PDVSA’s pledge of equity in Citgo as collateral for the bond swap was part of a fraudulent scheme to prevent Conoco from collecting compensation in an ongoing dispute with the Venezuelan government. The news was seen further complicating the swap and exacerbated worries about the sovereign, which already faces several arbitration claims from foreign companies. “It has become very complex legally,” the first investor said. Others think that the latest claim from ConocoPhillips won’t necessarily sabotage the exchange. “This is not the first time that this kind of suit has been made,” said Newman. “Whether or not it can stop the exchange, it is hard to say.”   (Reporting by Paul Kilby and Davide Scigliuzzo; Editing by Marc Carnegie)",10072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-bonds/pdvsa-bonds-drop-on-lawsuit-exchange-idUSL2N1CD1CV
826,COP,"ConocoPhillips sues Venezuela's PDVSA, calls bond swap 'fraudulent'","(Reuters) - Subsidiaries of U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips have sued Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA in Delaware, according to a court filing, accusing it of fraudulent operations involving its U.S. subsidiary Citgo.  ConocoPhillips said in an Oct. 6 filing PDVSA operations, including an ongoing bond swap that uses shares in Citgo Holding Inc as collateral, are part of an effort to prevent Conoco from collecting compensation in a dispute over a 2007 nationalization of its Venezuela holdings. ConocoPhillips has for nearly a decade been pursuing a case against Venezuela in a World Bank tribunal to obtain billions of dollars in compensation for the 2007 takeover of its Venezuela assets by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.  The tribunal known as ICSID in a partial ruling in 2013 said that takeover was illegal.   The U.S. company cited numerous operations involving Citgo, including an attempt to sell it in 2014, a debt offering that financed dividend payments to PDVSA, and most recently a bond swap operation that uses Citgo Holding as collateral. “The purpose behind each of these transfers is the same: to remove assets from the United States to Venezuela and/or to encumber assets in the United States, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud PDVSA’s and Venezuela’s arbitration award creditors, including ConocoPhillips,” it said in the document.  ConocoPhillips says Venezuela has also sought to protect its assets from being seized in any of some 20 arbitration cases filed by companies ranging from U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil to small Canadian mining company Crystallex.  PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] said in a statement on Friday that the bond swap was “perfectly legal” and that the lawsuit did not have any legal basis.  “These claims are one more instance of manipulation by ConocoPhillips,” the Caracas-based company said in a statement, adding that operations would continue as planned.   A court decision will likely take several weeks, said Carlos Bellorin, petroleum analyst at IHS.  “Before taking any additional steps the tribunal has to weigh the merits of the case and if Conoco’s claims are sufficiently strong,” said Bellorin.  PDVSA’s bonds dropped sharply on Friday after it postponed a deadline for offering to swap debt due to low participation, signaling that investor reluctance could scuttle the operation, and following news of Conoco’s suit.

836,COP,RPT-UPDATE 4-ConocoPhillips aims to sell up to $8 billion in gas assets,"(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text) By Ernest Scheyder Nov 10 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. independent oil producer, will sell up to $8 billion in natural gas assets and trim its capital budget by 4 percent next year to provide funds to bolster operations, executives said on Thursday. The moves highlighted not only the energy industry’s increasing push for efficiency gains that reduce the cost of drawing oil and natural gas from the earth but also low commodity prices, which have hampered Conoco and peers the past two years. Shares of the Houston-based company fell about 1 percent to $45.21 in afternoon trading as U.S. oil prices fell about 1 percent. The asset sale alone reflects a bold move by Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance to reduce the company’s $28.7 billion debt load. “We’re a very large company and those assets aren’t big for us,” Lance said in an interview. “We recognize that we need to accelerate the value proposition for some investors and accelerate the removal of debt from the balance sheet.” Conoco plans to sell $5 billion to $8 billion in North American natural gas assets, a divestiture that is massive in its size and scope. For example, Chesapeake Energy Corp, the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, has a $5 billion market valuation. The spending reduction comes after Conoco more than halved its budget last year. Indeed, its 2015 capex had eclipsed $10 billion. “You can’t count on rising commodity prices to bail out your business model,” Lance said. “You have to position your business for the commodity price cycles.” Lance, CEO since 2012, said the spending cuts, asset sales and other steps should help the company be profitable with Brent oil prices of $50 per barrel. Brent traded at $45.96 on Thursday. Most of the budget next year will be spent on shale projects in the contiguous United States, with some focus on Alaska and Europe, as well as maintenance of existing operations. The focus is smaller than earlier this decade, when ConocoPhillips operated in more than 28 locations around the globe. Today it operates in about 14, a smaller portfolio that executives said would further help focus capital. The spending should result in 2017 production of 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which would be a slight increase from estimated 2016 output, executives said. The company also announced a $3 billion share repurchase program. The buybacks will start this quarter, the company said.

The asset sale alone reflects a bold move by Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance to reduce the company’s $28.7 billion debt load. “We’re a very large company and those assets aren’t big for us,” Lance said in an interview. “We recognize that we need to accelerate the value proposition for some investors and accelerate the removal of debt from the balance sheet.”  Conoco plans to sell $5 billion to $8 billion in North American natural gas assets, a divestiture that is massive in its size and scope. For example, Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N), the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, has a $5 billion market valuation. The spending reduction comes after Conoco more than halved its budget last year. Indeed, its 2015 capex had eclipsed $10 billion. “You can’t count on rising commodity prices to bail out your business model,” Lance said. “You have to position your business for the commodity price cycles.” Lance, CEO since 2012, said the spending cuts, asset sales and other steps should help the company be profitable with Brent oil prices LCOc1 of $50 per barrel. Brent traded at $45.96 on Thursday. Most of the budget next year will be spent on shale projects in the contiguous United States, with some focus on Alaska and Europe, as well as maintenance of existing operations. The focus is smaller than earlier this decade, when ConocoPhillips operated in more than 28 locations around the globe. Today it operates in about 14, a smaller portfolio that executives said would further help focus capital. The spending should result in 2017 production of 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which would be a slight increase from estimated 2016 output, executives said.  The company also announced a $3 billion share repurchase program. The buybacks will start this quarter, the company said.

844,COP,Big Oil back on the acquisition trail as outlook brightens,"* More than $30 bln of deals signed since late November * Confidence in oil price recovery fuels growth drive * Companies to focus on east Europe, Latin America, Africa * Graphic on oil and gas M&A; in 2016 - tmsnrt.rs/2jv9If6 By Ron Bousso LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The world’s top oil companies are back in acquisition mode, targeting smaller exploration and development firms to boost oil and gas reserves rather than the mega-mergers that followed previous slumps in crude prices. Since late November, major oil companies have announced 11 deals worth more than $500 million each with a combined value of $31 billion, the clearest sign yet that oil executives are more confident a recovery is underway. When crude prices collapsed in the second half of 2014, large oil firms slashed spending on exploration and production and offloaded assets to reduce debt so they could cope with lower revenue from oil and gas sales. But with crude reservoirs declining at a rate of 10 percent a year in some cases, major oil companies are now looking to snap up assets to start growing again and there are plenty of smaller firms burdened with debt looking to sell. “You’re seeing the majors sharpening their pencils after a long while and actually flipping around from disposals to acquisitions,” said Tony Durrant, chief executive of British energy firm Premier Oil, which is looking to sell several stakes in its North Sea operations. Total acquisitions of oil and gas fields, known as upstream assets, tripled to $31 billion in December from a month earlier, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output for the first time in eight years, according to data from consultancy Energy Market Square. Deals in the last month of 2016 alone accounted for nearly a quarter of total activity during the year. (tmsnrt.rs/2jv9If6) BP announced a string of investments in the last two months of 2016, including a $1 billion partnership with Dallas-based Kosmos Energy in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa, as well as acquisitions in Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan. The British company also spent $375 million on a 10 percent stake in Eni’s giant Zohr gas field in Egypt while Russian oil giant Rosneft bought 30 percent stake of the same field for $1.575 billion. France’s Total and Norway’s Statoil  bought into Brazil’s lucrative sub-salt deepwater oil fields while ExxonMobil Corp bought assets in Papua New Guinea to meet growing Asian demand for liquefied natural gas. The trend continued in January with Total boosting its stake in Uganda’s Lake Albert oil project by snapping up most of Tullow Oil’s stake for $900 million. ExxonMobile and Noble Energy also struck deals worth nearly $10 billion combined for a larger slice of the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field. While deal making outside the United States almost ground to a halt at the start of 2016, acquisitions in North American shale basins have continued at a steady pace. In the Permian Basin, for example, the time it takes to produce oil and gas after an initial investment is far quicker and cheaper than developing conventional fields over three to five years. More deals are likely this year as the large overhang of crude oil in the world that has weighed on the market since 2014 continues to clear and oil prices rise. “When you can cut capex (capital spending), two-and-a-half to three years later you see production decline and reserves depleting and you have one choice only and that is going after high quality resource,” said Sachin Oza, co-manager with Stephen Williams of the Guinness Global Oil and Gas Exploration Trust. “If you’ve not spent any time filling your hopper with these opportunities that take five years to build up, there is only one choice: you have to buy them,” said Oza. The Guinness Trust is a fund that invests in firms in the early stages of exploration or development of energy resources which it believes will attract investment from oil majors. Investors reckon large firms will focus on underdeveloped basins in east and west Africa, Romania and Albania, as well as nascent Latin American reserves in places such as Colombia, all areas where the growth potential is seen as greater than in established regions such as North America and the North Sea. While slides in oil prices typically unleash a wave of takeovers, companies emerging from the current downturn are generally shunning outright acquisitions and instead looking at specific deals for specific fields. After a prolonged period of low oil prices in the late 1990s Exxon merged with Mobil, Total merged with Elf Aquitaine and Petrofina, Chevron bought Texaco, BP snapped up Amoco and ARCO and Conoco and Philips merged. This time round, the only stand-out acquisition has been Royal Dutch Shell’s takeover of BG, which was announced in April 2015 and completed in February a year later for $53 billion. As large oil firms are wary of increasing their debt burden at this point, investors say corporate acquisitions are likely to be limited in numbers and scope but oil field assets are very much in the crosshairs. Oil majors are opting for joint ventures to develop specific fields in complex deals, such as share swaps or deferred payments, to lower their risk and limit the amount they need to spend upfront following two years of budget cuts. “The international (ex-U.S.) asset market is a buyer’s market, as sellers continue in balance sheet preservation mode,” said Charles Whall, energy portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management. “European majors, which already have large dividend commitments, are unwilling to use equity for assets without immediate cash flow ... Most of these asset deals are structured to minimise the debt impact in the near term,” he said. Such deals also mean the sellers can retain a stake in the assets as their value rises with oil prices, said Oza and Williams at the Guinness Trust. Analysts say for much of 2015 and 2016 there was subdued activity because buyers and sellers were too far apart on price. Buyers hunting for bargain-basement deals were frustrated by sellers holding out for better terms but as oil prices have started to stabilise there has been more convergence. According to Martijn Rats, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, most of the deals announced in recent months have been based on a long-term oil price of about $60 a barrel to $65 a barrel. While that is significantly lower than before the collapse in oil prices from a 2014 peak of $115 a barrel, it is still above current long-term oil price forecasts, Rats said.

845,COP,"Woodside CEO sees no need for M&A;, plenty of growth in pipeline","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum Chief Executive Peter Coleman said there’s little need for more mergers and acquisitions by Australia’s biggest independent oil and gas producer as it works on developing a handful of new projects at home and abroad. The company, seen as short on growth, has had to rely on a few deals to build up reserves after being snubbed in late 2015 in an $8 billion bid for Oil Search Ltd and walking away from a $2.6 billion gas stake off Israel a year earlier. “We’re starting to get a pipeline of projects moving through,” Coleman told Reuters after Woodside reported fourth-quarter revenue rose a better-than-expected 2 percent to $1 billion from the previous quarter thanks to higher oil prices. The $34 billion Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project off Western Australia, which Woodside bought into in 2015, is scheduled to start this year after six months of delays, followed by a second stage in 2018, Coleman said. Wheatstone, operated by Chevron Corp, will contribute more than 13 million barrels of oil equivalent to Woodside’s annual output, when complete. Woodside expects 2017 production to fall to 84-90 mmboe from 94.9 mmboe last year, in line with two analysts’ forecasts, with Wheatstone’s ramp-up not enough to offset a long agreed drop in the company’s share of domestic gas from the North West Shelf from May. Woodside’s shares fell 1 percent on Thursday, but analysts attributed that to profit taking following a run-up over the past two months on the back of rising oil prices.  From 2019, Woodside plan to start producing from its Greater Enfield oil project in Australia. “Do we need to buy something? No,” Coleman said. “Woodside does not need to buy to grow.” Coleman also said he was anxious to get started on development “as soon as possible” on a promising oil venture off the coast of Senegal that it acquired from ConocoPhillips last October for $440 million.  The Senegal deal gave Woodside 35 percent of the SNE and FAN oil discoveries off the West African country, setting it up to start producing oil early in the next decade. Woodside last year also bought half of BHP Billiton’s stake in the undeveloped Scarborough offshore gas field assets in Western Australia. It is drilling in Myanmar, too. “With their level of activity in the past several year, Woodside certainly can’t be accused of inertia,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Wilson. “They have been positioning themselves for growth.” ",1192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-woodside-results/woodside-ceo-sees-no-need-for-ma-plenty-of-growth-in-pipeline-idUSKBN1530GL

857,COP,Exclusive: ConocoPhillips puts Canadian natgas assets on the block - sources,"TORONTO/CALGARY (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has decided to sell several of its Canadian conventional natural gas assets in a deal that could fetch as much as $2 billion as the biggest U.S. independent oil producer pulls back further from Canada, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The company expects the sale to bring down its debt load and rebalance its portfolio, the people said, declining to be identified as the process is confidential.      Several investment banks have made pitches to ConocoPhillips in recent weeks and the Houston-based company is close to hiring a financial adviser to run a formal sale process, the people said. The company is looking to identify properties, then bundle and sell them as packages, the people said.  When contacted by Reuters, ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans pointed to an announcement last November that said the company could sell up to $8 billion in natural gas assets. Evans said that disposition program “largely focused on non-strategic North American gas assets, including select assets in Canada.” The Houston-based company is expected to sell some of its  Western Canadian assets, which include Deep Basin, running from northwestern Alberta to northeastern British Columbia; Clearwater and Kaybob-Edson in west-central Alberta; and Plains, which straddles parts of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. ConocoPhillips does not plan to offload its oil sands properties and assets it owns in the Montney region, the people said. Most of the rest of its Canadian assets could soon be on the block, they added. Major Canadian energy companies such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) could be interested in the assets that will be up for sale, the sources said. Canadian Natural has shown increasing interest in natural gas properties and is one of the country’s biggest natural gas producers. Canadian Natural did not immediately offer a comment when reached by Reuters.     About two years ago, ConocoPhillips sold certain oil and gas assets in Western Canada, some of which were picked up by Canadian Natural.      Since the oil price began correcting nearly three years ago, energy companies have been under pressure to streamline their operations and strengthen their balance sheets.

858,COP,ConocoPhillips revises down over 1 bln bbls of oil sands reserves,"CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 21 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips Corp  has revised down over a billion barrels of oil sands reserves because of low global crude prices, a company filing showed on Tuesday, the latest sign that some of Canada’s vast hydrocarbon potential may be left untapped. The U.S. oil major said developed and undeveloped reserves of bitumen - the heavy viscous oil found in northern Alberta’s remote oil sands - totalled 1.2 billion barrels at the end of 2016, down from 2.4 billion barrels at the end of 2015. “Revisions, primarily in the oil sands, decreased proved undeveloped reserves due to lower prices,” the company said in the filing. The numbers in the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)filing provide a more detailed breakdown of the global reserves cut Conoco announced in its quarterly results in early February, when it debooked 1.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent of reserves globally. Al Hirshberg, Conoco’s executive vice president for production, drilling and projects, told investors on the quarterly call the company expects to rebook the reserves if current prices hold. Likewise Martin King, an analyst with GMP FirstEnergy in Calgary, said the debooking likely had more to do with SEC rules requiring companies to evaluate economic reserves at year-end. But the fact that the oil sands make up 70 percent of the reduction underlines how much of Canada’s resources are uneconomic in a weaker oil environment. The oil sands have some of the highest full-cycle breakeven costs in the world, with new thermal projects costing needing U.S. crude prices of $60 a barrel, according to estimates from consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

859,COP,ConocoPhillips revises down over one billion barrels of oil sands reserves,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has revised down over a billion barrels of oil sands reserves because of low global crude prices, a company filing showed on Tuesday, the latest sign that some of Canada’s vast hydrocarbon potential may be left untapped. The U.S. oil major said developed and undeveloped reserves of bitumen - the heavy viscous oil found in northern Alberta’s remote oil sands - totaled 1.2 billion barrels at the end of 2016, down from 2.4 billion barrels at the end of 2015. The oil sands have some of the highest full-cycle breakeven costs in the world, with new thermal projects needing U.S. crude prices around $60 a barrel. Crude futures settled at $54.33 a barrel on Tuesday. The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) document provides a detailed breakdown of the global reserves cut Conoco announced in quarterly results in early February, when it debooked 1.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent of reserves. Al Hirshberg, Conoco’s executive vice president for production, drilling and projects, told investors on the quarterly call the company expects to rebook the reserves if current prices hold. Likewise Martin King, an analyst with GMP FirstEnergy in Calgary, said the debooking likely had more to do with SEC rules requiring companies to evaluate economic reserves at year-end. But the fact that the oil sands make up 70 percent of the reduction underlines how much of Canada’s resources are uneconomic in a weaker oil environment. “They (the oil sands) are at the upper end of the cost curve,” said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist at RS Energy Group in Calgary. “It may or may not speak to future similar events from other producers.” Calgary-based Imperial Oil Ltd , which is majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , debooked 2.6 billion barrels of reserves in January. ConocoPhillips made the reserve reductions at the Surmont, Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrow Lakes projects. Surmont is operated by ConocoPhillips and a joint venture with Total E&P; Canada, a unit of Total SA, and the other three are joint ventures run by Cenovus Energy Inc . Total also debooked undeveloped reserves at Surmont, according to SEC filings. But Cenovus, which reports to Canadian securities authorities, said its total proved reserves including non-oil sands operations rose 5 percent in 2016 versus a year earlier. Cenovus spokesman Reg Curren said the company assumed different rules relating to reserves reporting in Canada and the United States were behind the difference.

861,COP,"N.Y. energy investor gets 5 years, 10 months for $45 mln tax scheme","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York energy investor was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison on Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to engaging in a years-long scheme to avoid more than $45 million in income and other taxes. Morris Zukerman, a former Morgan Stanley banker who later became chairman of investment firm M.E. Zukerman & Co, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan federal court, according to federal prosecutors. He was also ordered to pay a $10 million fine. Zukerman, 72, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and obstructing the Internal Revenue Service last June, a month after being indicted following a two-year grand jury investigation. As part of the plea deal, he agreed not to appeal any sentence less than 7-1/4 years. A lawyer for Zukerman could not immediately be reached for comment. Zukerman worked at Morgan Stanley from 1972 to 1988 and served as joint head of the investment bank’s energy group before launching M.E. Zukerman & Co, which focused on investing in energy, natural resources and agriculture companies. Prosecutors said Zukerman schemed to evade paying taxes on income earned on the 2008 sale of an oil company he co-owned through an M.E. Zukerman subsidiary with a publicly traded company that resulted in his firm receiving $130 million. While the company was not named in court papers, around that same time Zukerman’s company sold a Texas-based firm called Penreco that was co-owned with ConocoPhillips. Zukerman then transferred the sale’s proceeds to a trust and various corporations, including one from which he directed $50 million be used to buy paintings by European artists from the 15th to 19th centuries, prosecutors said. Zukerman frequently bought the paintings from galleries that were blocks away from his Manhattan home, but avoided paying New York sales taxes by having them shipped to his corporate addresses in Delaware and New Jersey and then immediately transported them back to New York, prosecutors said. Zukerman also claimed $1 million in fraudulent charitable contribution deductions in connection with the purchase of property on Black Island off Maine’s coast, prosecutors said. The case is U.S. v. Zukerman, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-cr-194.

862,COP,"REFILE-INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impact"," BOSTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil.  But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers.  In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition.  The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue.  The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump’s war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped.  According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter “material” and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.  ""Materiality is a fairly low bar,"" said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university’s research program on regulation. ""Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies’ cost of doing business.""  The oil majors’ annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy.  Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration’s policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.  “Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,” said Trump, describing regulation as a “self-inflicted wound.”  The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the “Energy Independence” executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials.  U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.  The Trump administration’s attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.  “We haven’t seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we’ve had a heavy dose of regulation,” Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month.  Continental Resources (CLR.N) CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new “American energy renaissance.”  Yet Continental’s annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a “material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors.”  Continental’s competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.  Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.  A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company’s liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.  “Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy,” the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement.  The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.  Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration.  “Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry.”  Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations.  The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices CLc1 from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.  Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues.  Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N), a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was “material” in their filings.  Two other companies, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue.  The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business.  In one typical statement, EOG Resources (EOG.N), one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: “Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG’s overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG’s operations, financial condition or results of operations.”  Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N), Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N), Apache Corp (APA.N), and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording.  Still, Obama’s exit - and Trump’s win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors.  “I believe the absence of a negative is a positive,” John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. “The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome.”  Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.  Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama’s presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama’s climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand.  Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.  Still, some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries, too, tend to be supply and demand – not regulation.  The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it.  “Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets,” said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. “Regulation is relatively trivial.”      ",3282017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-oil-regulation/refile-insight-as-trump-targets-energy-rules-oil-companies-downplay-their-impact-idUSL5N1GG5AL

867,COP,UPDATE 4-Cenovus shares slump on $13 bln deal to buy Conoco's assets,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy shares had their biggest one-day percentage fall ever on Thursday as investors balked at the company’s C$17.7 billion ($13.3 billion) cash and stock deal to buy oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips. The acquisition announced on Wednesday, the fifth-biggest Canadian energy deal on record, will more than double Cenovus production to 588,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and make it the third-biggest Canadian producer. The company will become the sole owner of its flagship Foster Creek and Christina Lake oil sands projects and is also buying the majority of ConocoPhillips’ western Canada Deep Basin conventional gas assets.  The offer was unsolicited, according to ConocoPhillips Canada spokesman Michelle McCullagh, who said her company had planned to market some Canadian assets as part of a disposition program but that this is a larger deal. The transaction, to be financed through selling shares and divestitures, is greater than Cenovus’ C$12.8 billion ($9.6 billion) market capitalization, and ratings agency DBRS placed the company under review with negative implications.   Cenovus shares closed down 13.8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$15.05, while ConocoPhillips shares were up 8.8 percent. “I’m extremely disappointed - not just the price paid on this acquisition, but also the strategy,” said Norman MacDonald, portfolio manager on the Trimark Resources Fund with Invesco, which holds Cenovus shares. The company was created to focus on unconventional crude, not hold gas assets such as Deep Basin, he said. “And up until yesterday, they had a really good balance sheet.” Through the deal Cenovus becomes one of the most levered oil companies, analysts at Raymond James said in a note. ConocoPhillips is the latest international oil major to pull back from northern Alberta’s oil sands, which is among the most costly plays in the world to develop.  Canadian players like Cenovus, Suncor Energy and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd are grabbing assets as multinationals retreat, betting improvements in thermal extraction technology will help them boost efficiency to compete against U.S. shale plays. “The Canadian companies do not have any other particularly good options,” said Doug Hollies, vice president of engineering at consultancy Codeco Oilsands Engineering and a Cenovus shareholder, who worked on the initial well design for Christina Lake. “They are confident, but I think they may be a little overconfident and they are always going to be high cost producers,” he added.

872,COP,ConocoPhillips sells oil and gas assets to Cenovus for $13.3 billion,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) on Wednesday agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) for C$17.7 billion ($13.3 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region where high costs and low crude prices have made it hard for large companies to make an acceptable return. For Calgary-based Cenovus, among Canada’s largest producers, the deal doubles its production to 588,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as it takes full ownership of its main oil sands assets in northern Alberta. ConocoPhillips will sell its 50 percent interest in the Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands partnership, which Cenovus already operates, as well as the majority of its western Canada Deep Basin conventional gas assets. The U.S. oil major will retain its 50 percent interest in the Surmont oil sands project, a joint venture with Total E&P; Canada (TOTF.PA), and its liquids-rich Blueberry-Montney shale assets. The divestment, the largest in ConocoPhillips’s history, was unexpected on Wall Street but comes as the company has come under pressure to cut its debt. Its shares jumped 6 percent in after-hours trading.  Shares of Cenovus listed on the New York Stock Exchange tumbled more than 8 percent after hours.   The deal, the fifth-biggest in the Canadian energy sector according to Thomson Reuters data, comes weeks after Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) sold off billions of dollars in oil sands assets and adds to uncertainty over future development in the patch. Canada’s oil sands hold the world’s third-largest crude reserves but also carry some of the highest operating costs globally, and are struggling to compete with cheaper U.S. shale plays in a $50-a-barrel oil price environment. “Now that you have a prolonged period of low crude prices, the companies are really looking hard on where is the place to invest,” Carlos Murillo, economist at the Conference Board of Canada. “Canadian companies ... they’re kind of getting bigger in what they know ... whereas other companies are seeing opportunities elsewhere.”  ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said his company will use the cash portion of the deal to pay down debt and increase share repurchases. The company last fall told analysts it would hive off $5 billion to $8 billion in assets this year. The Canadian divestment comes on top of that plan, boosting the planned asset sales for the year to more than $16 billion.  Calgary-based Cenovus will pay C$14.1 billion in cash and 208 million Cenovus common shares. It launched a bought-deal financing agreement to sell 187.5 million shares at C$16 each for expected gross proceeds of more than C$3 billion. CEO Brian Ferguson said the company intends to divest a significant portion of legacy conventional assets to help fund the transaction. “In a low oil-price environment, economies of scale are important. This deal about doubles the scale of the company, and this will give us a greater competitive edge,” Ferguson said on a public conference call.  JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) advised Cenovus, the Canadian company said.

873,COP,Cenovus shares slump on $13 billion deal to buy Conoco's assets,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy shares had their biggest one-day percentage fall ever on Thursday as investors balked at the company’s C$17.7 billion ($13.3 billion) cash and stock deal to buy oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips. The acquisition announced on Wednesday, the fifth-biggest Canadian energy deal on record, will more than double Cenovus production to 588,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and make it the third-biggest Canadian producer. The company will become the sole owner of its flagship Foster Creek and Christina Lake oil sands projects and is also buying the majority of ConocoPhillips’ western Canada Deep Basin conventional gas assets.  The offer was unsolicited, according to ConocoPhillips Canada spokesman Michelle McCullagh, who said her company had planned to market some Canadian assets as part of a disposition program but that this is a larger deal. The transaction, to be financed through selling shares and divestitures, is greater than Cenovus’ C$12.8 billion ($9.6 billion) market capitalization, and ratings agency DBRS placed the company under review with negative implications.   Cenovus shares closed down 13.8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$15.05, while ConocoPhillips shares were up 8.8 percent. “I’m extremely disappointed - not just the price paid on this acquisition, but also the strategy,” said Norman MacDonald, portfolio manager on the Trimark Resources Fund with Invesco, which holds Cenovus shares. The company was created to focus on unconventional crude, not hold gas assets such as Deep Basin, he said. “And up until yesterday, they had a really good balance sheet.” Through the deal Cenovus becomes one of the most levered oil companies, analysts at Raymond James said in a note. ConocoPhillips is the latest international oil major to pull back from northern Alberta’s oil sands, which is among the most costly plays in the world to develop.  Canadian players like Cenovus, Suncor Energy and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd are grabbing assets as multinationals retreat, betting improvements in thermal extraction technology will help them boost efficiency to compete against U.S. shale plays. “The Canadian companies do not have any other particularly good options,” said Doug Hollies, vice president of engineering at consultancy Codeco Oilsands Engineering and a Cenovus shareholder, who worked on the initial well design for Christina Lake. “They are confident, but I think they may be a little overconfident and they are always going to be high cost producers,” he added.

New greenfield projects will be needed,” Lance said. “To justify those investments, higher energy prices will be required,” he said.

877,COP,Nexen joins ConocoPhillips in cutting oil sands output: sources,"CALGARY, Alberta/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two oil sands producers in northern Alberta have cut production at their facilities due to a shortage of synthetic crude, market sources said on Thursday, causing Canadian and U.S. crude prices to surge to multi-year highs.  Synthetic supplies are scarce following a fire at the 350,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Syncrude plant in March that damaged the facility and forced the operator to bring forward maintenance and cut production for April to zero. As a result ConocoPhillips reduced output at its 140,000 bpd Surmont project, a joint venture with Total E&P; Canada, by 40 percent, two market sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The company mixes synthetic crude from Syncrude with tarry bitumen from its oil sands reservoir to create a heavy crude blend known as “synbit” that can flow through pipelines. CNOOC Ltd subsidiary Nexen Energy, which likewise uses synthetic crude to dilute its bitumen, cut output from its Long Lake oil sands project this month by 48 percent, said one of the two sources, as well as two separate sources.  Long Lake usually produces around 40,000 bpd of undiluted bitumen, one source said. ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Michelle McCullagh, who earlier this week confirmed that the Syncrude outage affected Surmont output, declined to comment on the size of the production cut. Nexen Energy spokeswoman Brittney Price said her company does not publish production or maintenance operations for individual assets.     Syncrude, a joint venture majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc, is expected to return to operations the first week of May but will be running at reduced rates that month, trading sources said on Wednesday. The oil sands outages have boosted Canadian heavy crude prices, with the benchmark Western Canada Select blend for May delivery last trading close to a 22-month high of $9.60 a barrel below U.S. crude, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. On Wednesday WCS settled at $9.85 per barrel below U.S. crude. Meanwhile, Mars Sour traded up to $1.20 a barrel discount to U.S. crude on Thursday, the narrowest discount since September 2015, according to Reuters data. Light Louisiana Sweet traded up to $2.35 a barrel over WTI, the widest premium since March 2016.

879,COP,UPDATE 2-Cenovus CEO seeks backing as bold bet and market jitters test his legacy,"(New throughout, adds comments from people close to chief executive) By Ethan Lou and Nia Williams TORONTO, April 11 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc will do more hedging after its acquisition of ConocoPhillips assets, the Canadian company’s Chief Executive Brian Ferguson said on Tuesday as he mounted a charm offensive on investors who balked at the deal. Ferguson is known as a low-key and conservative chief executive in the western Canadian oil patch, and his C$17.7-billion ($13.3-billion) bid last month for the assets of ConocoPhillips, the latest international player to exit the country, had confounded investors and analysts. The deal, which effectively doubles the size of Cenovus while denting its pristine balance sheet and making it more exposed to changes in oil prices, is seen as a test for Ferguson’s legacy. The 60-year-old has been with the company and its predecessor for most of his life. “When we close the transaction, we would definitely be adding more hedge volumes,” Ferguson said at an industry event in Toronto, where he was seeking to sell his ambitious plan. Investors last month sent the company’s shares crashing in their biggest single-day drop on news of the deal. Despite a previously strong balance sheet, Cenovus had stayed on the sidelines even as domestic peers eagerly bought assets from retreating foreign oil majors. Eventually, weighed by C$4 billion ($3 billion) cash, Ferguson signed what some analysts and investors said was an uncharacteristic deal. Ferguson said on Tuesday that the “strategic rationale” for the deal is well understood by investors, although he noted that some have questioned the company’s plan for financing it through selling shares, divestitures and taking on debt. The company has 75 percent of permanent financing in place and has seen strong interest in the assets it is selling, Ferguson said, adding, “We’ve had multiple inbound inquiries from various sources - private equity funds, pension plans, smaller companies.” Some who know Ferguson well say he has made the right move at the right time. “When he puts a strategy in place it will be things he sees coming down the road that are perhaps not what other people will see,” said Greg Stringham, a former executive with industry association the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers who has known Ferguson for 20 years. A person close to Cenovus who has known and worked with Ferguson for over two decades said the deal will determine how Ferguson is remembered in the oil patch. “When you double the size of the company, there will be a jury at some point, whether it is six months from now or six years from now,” the person said.

882,COP,UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips sells San Juan basin assets for $3 bln,"(Adds details, background) April 13 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. independent oil producer, said on Thursday it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion. ConocoPhillips has been selling assets to reduce its exposure to profit-sapping natural gas assets and shore up its balance sheet. The assets, which span New Mexico and Southwestern Colorado, produced 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 80 percent of which was natural gas, ConocoPhillips said. Conoco said last month it would sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for $13.3 billion. Conoco will receive $2.7 billion in cash from the San Juan basin asset sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter. The deal also includes a contingent payment of up to $300 million. Conoco, which said the assets being sold had a book value of about $5.9 billion at 2016-end, expects to record an impairment charge in the second quarter.

886,COP,"RPT-ConocoPhillips takes slow, steady route in race for oil profits","(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Gary McWilliams HOUSTON, April 20 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has beaten its 2017 asset sales target less than four months into the year, after shedding $30.8 billion worth of energy assets in six years. But instead of a chorus of cheers on Wall Street, Chief Executive Ryan Lance is facing investor skepticism that the company can deliver growth from remaining oil and gas fields. ConocoPhillips' most recent sales of Canadian oil-sands properties and U.S. natural gas wells for a combined $16 billion will part with nearly 30 percent of its proved reserves in order to deliver near-term shareholder payouts and pare debt. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pKHtZQ Lance told Reuters the sales to Cenovus Energy and Hilcorp Energy Co will fulfill promises to reduce long-term debt by 42 percent to $15 billion, fund $6 billion in share purchases and help reshape the company for an era of low and volatile energy prices. Drilling in two shale regions should help restore falling U.S. output by the fourth quarter. “I don’t worry about production and reserves in the company,” he told Reuters in an interview, citing oil and gas fields that could be upgraded to proved reserves over time. ConocoPhillips can achieve flat to 2 percent annual production growth on its properties, after adjustments for sales, and deliver shareholder payouts, he said. But interviews with portfolio managers, former employees and industry analysts point to the frequent sales as a short-term fix. They worry ConocoPhillips’ plan for modest production growth, flat capital spending and steady shareholder payouts pales in comparison to rivals that have retooled themselves to deliver sharply higher growth rates. The danger of its reliance on fewer assets was driven home in recent weeks as a fire at a supplier hurt its ability to ship crude from oil-sands properties. Mike Breard, who tracks energy stocks for Hodges Capital Management, said the strategy lacks appeal. “If I wanted yield, I’d buy something else. If I wanted growth, I buy something else. I just don’t see what customers would want to be in that in-between situation,” Breard said. The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won’t return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019. “They’ve sold a very valuable asset,” said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings. The deal will “make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line” because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said. To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties. In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies. Lance, who was the company’s technology chief, became ConocoPhillips’ chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend. Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company’s stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period. Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings. Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs. He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia. Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends. ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016’s average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend. The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn’t generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns. Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy. ConocoPhillips’ pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: “Exxon over the years has fit that bill.” Haverford’s oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron and Schlumberger NV, he said. Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields. Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales. “It’ll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver,” he said, referring to the industry’s boom and bust periods.

U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends. ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016’s average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend. The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn’t generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns. Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy. ConocoPhillips’ pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: “Exxon over the years has fit that bill.” Haverford’s oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Chevron and Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), he said.  Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields.  Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales. “It’ll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver,” he said, referring to the industry’s boom and bust periods.

888,COP,"ConocoPhillips takes slow, steady route in race for oil profits","HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has beaten its 2017 asset sales target less than four months into the year, after shedding $30.8 billion worth of energy assets in six years. But instead of a chorus of cheers on Wall Street, Chief Executive Ryan Lance is facing investor skepticism that the  company can deliver growth from remaining oil and gas fields. ConocoPhillips' most recent sales of Canadian oil-sands properties and U.S. natural gas wells for a combined $16 billion will part with nearly 30 percent of its proved reserves in order to deliver near-term shareholder payouts and pare debt. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pKHtZQ Lance told Reuters the sales to Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) and Hilcorp Energy Co will fulfill promises to reduce long-term debt by 42 percent to $15 billion, fund $6 billion in share purchases and help reshape the company for an era of low and volatile energy prices.  Drilling in two shale regions should help restore falling U.S. output by the fourth quarter. “I don’t worry about production and reserves in the company,” he told Reuters in an interview, citing oil and gas fields that could be upgraded to proved reserves over time. ConocoPhillips can achieve flat to 2 percent annual production growth on its properties, after adjustments for sales, and deliver shareholder payouts, he said.  But interviews with portfolio managers, former employees and industry analysts point to the frequent sales as a short-term fix. They worry ConocoPhillips’ plan for modest production growth, flat capital spending and steady shareholder payouts pales in comparison to rivals that have retooled themselves to deliver sharply higher growth rates. The danger of its reliance on fewer assets was driven home in recent weeks as a fire at a supplier hurt its ability to ship crude from oil-sands properties. Mike Breard, who tracks energy stocks for Hodges Capital Management, said the strategy lacks appeal.   “If I wanted yield, I’d buy something else. If I wanted growth, I buy something else. I just don’t see what customers would want to be in that in-between situation,” Breard said.  The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won’t return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019. “They’ve sold a very valuable asset,” said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings. The deal will “make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line” because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said. To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties. In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies.  Lance, who was the company’s technology chief, became ConocoPhillips’ chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend. Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company’s stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period. Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings. Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs. He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil CLc1 falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia.     Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster.

889,COP,Cenovus may sell parts of acquired natgas assets -analysts,"CALGARY, Alberta, April 23 (Reuters) - Canada’s Cenovus Energy Inc has said it may sell parts of the Deep Basin natural gas assets it recently bought from Houston-based ConocoPhillips, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) analysts wrote in a research note on Sunday. Cenovus Chief Executive Brian Ferguson held a conference call with analysts last Friday, and the oil company “signaled that it would also be open to potentially monetizing some portion of the Deep Basin midstream assets,” according to the note. “Cenovus has had seven inbound calls from CEOs of various energy companies looking to ensure the company is aware of their interest in certain Deep Basin assets,” the analysts wrote. RBC acted as an advisor for Cenovus for the ConocoPhillips deal. Cenovus did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The C$17.7-billion ($13.3-billion) acquisition last month of ConocoPhillips oil and gas assets effectively doubles the size of Cenovus. But the deal dents the company’s pristine balance sheet and saddles the pure-play crude producer with Deep Basin natural gas assets that some investors and analysts have said it has no business holding. Cenovus shares crashed last month in their biggest single-day drop on news of the deal, which is to be funded through debt and selling shares and what the company deems to be “non-core” assets. “Select assets within the Deep Basin could be tagged as non-core,” according to the RBC note. “This was new to us and opens up interesting de-leveraging possibilities for Cenovus.” While the company had wanted to raise C$3.6 billion through asset sales, it may end up raising more, according to the note.

890,COP,PREVIEW-Cenovus earnings overshadowed by unpopular ConocoPhillips deal,"CALGARY, Alberta/TORONTO (Reuters) - As Cenovus Energy Inc prepares to release first-quarter earnings this week, investors are looking for answers about a recent C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) acquisition that wiped out about a fifth of its market value. Disgruntled shareholders will grill Cenovus at an annual meeting on Wednesday following results about its purchase of most of ConocoPhillips’ Canadian oil and gas assets. The deal ramped up Cenovus debt and pushed it into the largely unknown territory of natural gas, effectively doubling the size of the Canadian oil company. Some investors have questioned whether Cenovus overpaid for the assets at a time when foreign oil majors are retreating from the high-cost and heavily regulated Canadian oil sands industry. “It’s very much going to be a show-me story,” said Mike O’Brien, managing director and head of the Core Canadian Equity team at TD Asset Management, a shareholder. While the deal’s long-term logic is sound, it is still a question of whether the company can properly execute its plan, he said. Analysts expect Cenovus to post a loss of C$0.09 per share for the January-March quarter, compared with a C$0.14 per share loss a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company had higher-than-expected production for the first quarter and benefited from higher oil prices, Royal Bank of Canada analysts said. Apart from the debt taken to fund the ConocoPhillips deal, investors are concerned about Cenovus’ move to diversify into natural gas with the purchase of Deep Basin assets and its ability to divest to pay for the assets. Benoit Gervais, portfolio manager at Mackenzie Investments, which owns Cenovus shares, said the company had no history or track record in conventional gas. “I estimate they’ve overpaid by about C$5 billion,” he said. Cenovus shares fell 13.8 percent last month on news of the deal in their biggest ever single-day drop. The stock has since fallen another 5.6 percent. Buying Deep Basin flies in the face of the very identity of Cenovus, which was spun-off from predecessor Encana Corp to focus on crude, said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Still, the deal has some backers. Canada’s oil-rich Alberta province, which holds a position in Cenovus through a government investment firm, said the company remained a good bet.  Asked about investor concerns, a Cenovus spokesman referred to Chief Executive Brian Ferguson’s comments this month that the company had a “solid plan” to finance the transaction and cut debt using increased cash flow and assets sales. Cenovus may sell parts of Deep Basin, RBC analysts said, a move that would please investors who balked at the purchase. While the transaction itself does not require a vote, some shareholders may use Wednesday’s meeting to express opposition to the deal by voting against company nominations for the board of directors.

899,COP,ConocoPhillips is wasting its oil crisis,"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - ConocoPhillips is stuck in a rut. Only asset sales kept the company’s earnings out of the red in the first three months of the year. The cash from such deals will help Conoco cut its high debt load, but Chief Executive Ryan Lance is still pushing ahead with buybacks and has started increasing the dividend rather than boosting investing. Such methods to buoy the stock have a limited lifespan. Like oil majors that reported late last week, Conoco’s earnings were in part helped by rising oil prices. The company’s realized price – the total revenue on oil sales divided by the number of barrels - was $36.18, a 58 percent increase over the same period last year. As a result, the net loss for the quarter, after stripping out one-off gains, was just $19 million compared to a loss of $1.2 billion last year. All told, Conoco sold some $16 billion of assets over the past two months, though one deal involves being partly paid with stock in the buyer, Cenovus Energy. Conoco intends to use most of the cash proceeds to pay off some of its borrowings. That was enough to prompt Moody’s and S&P; to improve Conoco’s ratings outlook. And it should take its debt load down from around three times EBITDA to a level closer to the 1.2 times multiple of its peers by the end of the year, reckon analysts at Raymond James. It also intends to return some $3 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders using buybacks. Along with a 6 percent dividend increase in February – a year after slashing it by two-thirds – that might sound like actions investors should applaud. Yet shares fell as much as 2 percent after Tuesday’s earnings. That’s because Lance’s short-term patches come at the expense of future projects. He is holding the capital-spending budget at $5 billion. And while Conoco built four new rigs in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin regions in the first four months of the year, it’s a blip compared to the 111 new platforms up over that period, according to Baker Hughes. With asset sales ahead of schedule and depleting earnings, Lance needs to put more money to work to keep the cash spigot flowing.",5022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-conocophillips-results-breakingviews/conocophillips-is-wasting-its-oil-crisis-idUSKBN17Y2D5
900,COP,UPDATE 3-ConocoPhillips posts surprise loss on higher-than-expected costs,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips reported a surprise quarterly loss on Tuesday as operating costs came in higher than expected, sending its shares lower in afternoon trading. However, the largest U.S. independent oil producer’s results reflected a slow but steady improvement across the industry bolstered by improved pricing for its oil and natural gas. Crude prices are up more than 50 percent from a year ago. Don Wallette Jr., chief financial officer, said the latest quarter included a $200 million loss from a currency hedge tied to the British pound and a benefit of about $100 million from a tax loss carry forward.  The company expects to complete the sale of some Canadian oil sands and natural gas properties this quarter, and will finish a planned $3 billion share buyback by year end, he said in a conference call. The Houston-based company said its total realized price was $36.18 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with $22.94 a year earlier.   ConocoPhillips’s production, excluding Libya, inched up 2 percent to 1.584 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the latest quarter. That was higher than Wall Street expectations of 1.571 million boepd. “Production was above guidance, but this was outweighed by higher costs,” Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said. The company’s operating expenses of $1.30 billion were higher than Raymond James’ estimate of $1.24 billion, Molchanov said. Exploration expenses of $258 million on a pre-tax basis were also much larger than the $70 million Barclays analysts had estimated. ConocoPhillips said it expects production of between 1.495 million and 1.535 million boepd for the current quarter, excluding any output from Libya. The estimate does not reflect the impact of recently announced asset sales. The oil producer said last month it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion and earlier agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for C$17.7 billion. ConocoPhillips has also marked other gas-weighted assets for sale, including some assets in the Anadarko basin, the Barnett shale field, and the Gulf of Mexico.

901,COP,ConocoPhillips is wasting its oil crisis,"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - ConocoPhillips is stuck in a rut. Only asset sales kept the company’s earnings out of the red in the first three months of the year. The cash from such deals will help Conoco cut its high debt load, but Chief Executive Ryan Lance is still pushing ahead with buybacks and has started increasing the dividend rather than boosting investing. Such methods to buoy the stock have a limited lifespan. Like oil majors that reported late last week, Conoco’s earnings were in part helped by rising oil prices. The company’s realized price – the total revenue on oil sales divided by the number of barrels - was $36.18, a 58 percent increase over the same period last year. As a result, the net loss for the quarter, after stripping out one-off gains, was just $19 million compared to a loss of $1.2 billion last year. All told, Conoco sold some $16 billion of assets over the past two months, though one deal involves being partly paid with stock in the buyer, Cenovus Energy. Conoco intends to use most of the cash proceeds to pay off some of its borrowings. That was enough to prompt Moody’s and S&P; to improve Conoco’s ratings outlook. And it should take its debt load down from around three times EBITDA to a level closer to the 1.2 times multiple of its peers by the end of the year, reckon analysts at Raymond James. It also intends to return some $3 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders using buybacks. Along with a 6 percent dividend increase in February – a year after slashing it by two-thirds – that might sound like actions investors should applaud. Yet shares fell as much as 2 percent after Tuesday’s earnings. That’s because Lance’s short-term patches come at the expense of future projects. He is holding the capital-spending budget at $5 billion. And while Conoco built four new rigs in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin regions in the first four months of the year, it’s a blip compared to the 111 new platforms up over that period, according to Baker Hughes. With asset sales ahead of schedule and depleting earnings, Lance needs to put more money to work to keep the cash spigot flowing.",5022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-conocophillips-results-breakingviews/conocophillips-is-wasting-its-oil-crisis-idUSKBN17Y255
902,COP,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips posts profit on asset sale gain,"(Corrects to “1.495 million to 1.535 million” from “1,495 million to 1,535 million” in paragraph 6) May 2 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips reported a quarterly profit on Tuesday, compared with a year-earlier loss, helped by a gain on its sale of oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc. ConocoPhillips’s results also reflected a slow but steady improvement across the industry as crude prices stabilize after a two-year rout, as an OPEC-led production cut and a rebound in demand slowly erode a global glut. The company said its total realized price was $36.18 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with $22.94, a year earlier. The Houston-based company’s production and operating costs fell by 4 percent in the quarter. ConocoPhillips’ production, excluding Libya, inched up 2 percent to 1.584 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the latest reported quarter. The company forecast production of 1.495 million to 1.535 million boepd for the second quarter. ConocoPhillips said its forecast excludes output from Libya, but does not reflect the impact of recently announced asset sales. The company’s net profit was $800 million, or 62 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $1.5 billion, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier.

905,COP,ConocoPhillips posts surprise loss on higher-than-expected costs,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips reported a surprise quarterly loss on Tuesday as operating costs came in higher than expected, sending its shares lower in afternoon trading. However, the largest U.S. independent oil producer’s results reflected a slow but steady improvement across the industry bolstered by improved pricing for its oil and natural gas. Crude prices are up more than 50 percent from a year ago. Don Wallette Jr., chief financial officer, said the latest quarter included a $200 million loss from a currency hedge tied to the British pound and a benefit of about $100 million from a tax loss carry forward.  The company expects to complete the sale of some Canadian oil sands and natural gas properties this quarter, and will finish a planned $3 billion share buyback by year end, he said in a conference call. The Houston-based company said its total realized price was $36.18 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with $22.94 a year earlier.   ConocoPhillips’s production, excluding Libya, inched up 2 percent to 1.584 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the latest quarter. That was higher than Wall Street expectations of 1.571 million boepd. “Production was above guidance, but this was outweighed by higher costs,” Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said. The company’s operating expenses of $1.30 billion were higher than Raymond James’ estimate of $1.24 billion, Molchanov said. Exploration expenses of $258 million on a pre-tax basis were also much larger than the $70 million Barclays analysts had estimated. ConocoPhillips said it expects production of between 1.495 million and 1.535 million boepd for the current quarter, excluding any output from Libya. The estimate does not reflect the impact of recently announced asset sales. The oil producer said last month it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion and earlier agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for C$17.7 billion. ConocoPhillips has also marked other gas-weighted assets for sale, including some assets in the Anadarko basin, the Barnett shale field, and the Gulf of Mexico. Net profit was $800 million, or 62 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $1.5 billion, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier.

906,COP,ConocoPhillips to lay off 300 in Canada oil sands pullback,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) will lay off 300 Canadian workers after selling most local assets to domestic crude producer Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO), the Houston-based company said on Thursday. ConocoPhillips in March agreed to sell oil sands and western natural gas assets to Cenovus for C$17 billion ($12.4 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region beset by high costs and low crude prices. Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA (STL.OL), which late last year agreed to sell Canadian oil sands assets to local producer Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO), has also shed staff, a spokesman said on Thursday, without disclosing the precise number. The resulting layoffs will pile on to the high unemployment rate facing oil-producing Alberta province after the two-year crash in commodity prices. The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years. The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the “financial and labour impact” of the exodus. “Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies,” according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws. Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does “not necessarily” anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector’s long-term stability, she said. ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada’s oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015. Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO), said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible. Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally.

911,COP,"BHP Billiton under pressure to sell shale, even as oil prices fall","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) (BLT.L) is facing pressure from two activist shareholders over its $20 billion splurge on U.S. shale oil and gas fields, but may resist calls to dump the business just as oil prices are sliding. Investors grumble that while BHP Billiton is a good operator in deepwater oil and gas, its shale business, first acquired in 2011, has been a capital drain and shareholders would be better off with a sale. But now may not be the right time. BHP says it sees petroleum as a core business, including most of the shale operations.  “The risk is doing it for the wrong reasons - because people are telling you do it - and getting out quickly. We’re at $40 oil. It’s not necessarily the greatest time to be contemplating that,” said Brenton Saunders, an analyst at BT Investment Management, which owns BHP shares.  Australian boutique manager Tribeca Partners estimated BHP could fetch $10 billion for its shale assets, based on recent deals done in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale regions that implied prices of $30,000 to $40,000 per net acre. However BHP has said it wants to hold on to its Permian acreage, where it has been consolidating its position by picking up high grade acreage and is looking to trade acreage or work with companies with adjoining acreage to boost production. It has also highlighted its success in slashing costs by 64 percent in the Black Hawk region over the past four years. “On many measures we’re one of, if not the, lowest-cost operator,” BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie told investors in April, defending its rejection of a proposal by fund manager Elliott Management for the company to spin off its U.S. oil and gas assets.  BHP can take comfort in kudos from energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, which said the company has among the lowest breakeven costs among shale operators in one of the richest parts of the Permian Basin, $30.20 a barrel. “BHP is active in the swap market, and we expect its operational success to open doors with swap and strategic partners,” Wood Mackenzie said in a report, referring to the market for trading acreage with other operators. Its less attractive Fayetteville acreage, valued at $919 million on its books at the end of 2016, is back up for sale. BT’s Saunders said one way BHP could divest shale while retaining exposure to a potential recovery in oil prices would be to vend the shale assets to a well-regarded shale operator in return for an equity stake in that company, which it could sell down the track. Other operators active in areas where BHP holds acreage include ConocoPhillips (COP.N), EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N), and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N).

918,COP,Cenovus to face investors amid rift after share decline,"CALGARY, Alberta, June 20 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc will seek on Tuesday to convince investors of the value of an unpopular acquisition this year amid continuing skepticism from shareholders. At an annual investor event in Toronto, Chief Executive Brian Ferguson is expected to unveil plans for asset sales to cut debt assumed for the C$17 billion ($12.9 billion) March purchase of some ConocoPhillips assets in Canada. The deal effectively doubled Cenovus’ assets, a move the company has said would allow it to utilize economies of scale to lower costs. Cenovus shares have since fallen about 40 percent to just above C$10, wiping out $6.7 billion in the company’s market value. Two months after the deal is too soon to realize any benefits of the acquisition, and shareholders lack faith in management’s ability to deliver, Laura Lau, senior vice president at Toronto-based Brompton Group, said in an interview. Brompton holds 183,800 Cenovus shares. “They’re not going to give them the benefit of the doubt,” Lau said. She said the same goes for asset sales. “It’s too soon to actually know,” she said. “What’s probably likely is: ‘We’ve put the package out. These are the packages, and these are the possible bids.’” When asked about investors’ skepticism, Cenovus spokesman Brett Harris said, “With respect to our conversations with individual investors, that’s not something we would discuss publicly.” Cenovus expects a “fulsome discussion” about the acquired assets and the company’s longer-term outlook on Tuesday, Harris said without providing additional details. Royal Bank of Canada analyst Greg Pardy said in a note on Monday that questions from investors had increased over the past month, with the most significant being whether Cenovus can achieve its asset-sale target. Cenovus has said it wants to raise C$3.6 billion by selling its Pelican Lake and Suffield oil assets and potentially others, including parts of its Deep Basin gas play, newly acquired from ConocoPhillips, which had been unpopular among investors who saw it as unwanted diversification. “Most people view they overpaid for the assets, and now two months later, we’re sitting with higher interest rates and oil prices that are 10 percent lower,” said Len Racioppo, managing director of Toronto-based Coerente Capital Management. “They say they want to sell assets, but how do you sell assets and what kind of a price do you get when you bought them at $50-something a barrel, and now we’re at $45 a barrel?” Racioppo said. Racioppo wrote to the Toronto Stock Exchange’s regulator seeking to halt the deal soon after it was announced. He manages more than 500,000 shares on clients’ behalf.

919,COP,ConocoPhillips to sell Barnett assets for $305 million,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said it would sell its assets in the Barnett shale field in Texas to Miller Thomson & Partners LLC for about $305 million, as part of the largest U.S. independent oil producer’s efforts to reduce exposure to natural gas. The Barnett assets produced 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2016, of which about 55 percent was natural gas and 45 percent was natural gas liquids, ConocoPhillips said in a statement on Thursday. The oil producer said last month it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion and earlier agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) for C$17.7 billion. ConocoPhillips has also marked other gas-weighted assets for sale, including some assets in the Anadarko basin and the Gulf of Mexico. The company said the Barnett shale deal, expected to close in the third quarter, may reduce its 2017 production forecast by less than 5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). ConocoPhillips said it does not expect any material impact to 2017 cash flow or its forecast as a result of the transaction. The company said it would take a non-cash impairment charge of about $400 million after taxes in the second quarter related to the sale.

923,COP,"WRAPUP 4-Qatar shows mettle, offers compromise as Gulf states prepare meeting","DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbors, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider. “What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side,” Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha. “There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement,” he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism.  The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.  “We hope others will respond in a similar spirit. Qatar says it is ready to meet any “reasonable” demands.  But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia’s 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty. Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. LNG is natural gas liquified at low temperatures to reduce its volume, thus allowing it to be transported by tanker where pipelines are not feasible. Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world’s biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar’s total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year in five to seven years, Kaabi said. The decision will have international ramifications. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects  still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere (LNG.A) exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar’s rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbors. The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end “in the coming hours” with the Qatari response to demands. “We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses,” he said. “We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures.” The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen  more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014. So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company’s operations would not be affected by the crisis. “Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don’t want to work with QP that’s their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,” he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia. “It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,” said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field. “Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don’t believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,” said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.  “Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,” he added. Qatar Petroleum’s Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co (8031.T) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N). “Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world,”  said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell. “For Qatar, LNG is everything.” ",7042017,http://www.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar/wrapup-4-qatar-shows-mettle-offers-compromise-as-gulf-states-prepare-meeting-idUSL8N1JV4H2

With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. The political dispute started on June 5, roiling LNG trade and causing at least one tanker to change course and UK gas prices to spike. Kaabi said the company’s operations would not be affected by the diplomatic crisis or sanctions. “Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don’t want to work with QP that’s their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,” he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Ausralia, the United States and Russia. “It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,” said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accus Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to cooperate with Tehran more on the gas production and exports from the shared field. “Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don’t believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,” said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East. “Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,” he added. Qatar Petroleum’s Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets every year to discuss development of the field. He added that the company will be looking for international partners, declining to say when a tender would be issued. Qatargas, the largest LNG-producing company in the world, and RasGas also operate projects on the North Field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil. “Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world,”  said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell. “For Qatar, LNG is everything.” ",7042017,http://www.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar/rpt-wrapup-1-qatar-raises-gas-capacity-amid-gulf-dispute-idUSL8N1JV3LI
928,COP,WRAPUP 1-Qatar raises gas capacity amid Gulf dispute,"July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced on Tuesday it planned to raise liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity by 30 percent in an apparent show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbours who have imposed political and economic sanctions on Doha. The unexpected move came as Qatar appears to be preparing itself for greater economic independence should the dispute with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain become protracted. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. The Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar denies the accusation. The Arab states, who have presented Doha with a list of demands, meet on Wednesday to discuss how to end the crisis; or they could impose more sanctions, which may include asking trade partners to pick a side in the rift. Qatar Petroleum’s chief executive said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world’s biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar’s total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, CEO Saad al-Kaabi told a news conference. “Once completed...this project will raise the production of the State of Qatar to about 6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day,” Kaabi said. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar’s rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in Jeddah the stand-off between Qatar and its Arab neighbours would best be solved by an agreement across the region to prevent the financing of terrorism, “We all know that (this support) is not organised by states, but often by private persons,” he added. “But we must somehow succeed in ending support in the region for extremist and terrorist organisations.” The glut has already driven down prices.

929,COP,JPMorgan tops Canadian M&A; activity in energy-driven first half,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian mergers and acquisitions rose about 13 percent to C$120.5 billion ($93.2 billion) in the first half of 2017, driven by big-ticket energy deals and robust cross-border activity, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday. Despite strong initial public offerings, overall equity capital deals fell 12 percent to C$26.9 billion in the first half from a year ago, the data showed. JPMorgan (JPM.N), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) took the top three spots in the M&A; league tables rankings, while Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), TD and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) were the top three advisers on Canadian equity issues in the first half of 2017. Canadian companies and pension funds have been seeking investment opportunities outside of Canada, and that is expected to keep M&A; bankers busy in the second half. “We see the financial buyers - the pension plans, asset managers - continually active outside of Canada,” said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada. The two biggest energy deals of the year so far were Cenovus Energy Inc’s (CVE.TO) roughly C$16.8 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) oil sands and natural gas assets and Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) sale of most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion. “The large international majors are looking to delever their balance sheet and sell non-core assets,” said Peter Buzzi, co-head of Canadian M&A; at RBC. “And for many of them, it appears Canada falls into that non-core category,” he added. Canadian IPOs, which have been rebounding after a quiet 2016, rose to C$3.4 billion, the best first half in 11 years. “The IPO pipeline looks strong,” said Benoit Lauzé, head of equity capital markets at CIBC. “There would be very significant appetite for good technology names,” he added. Kinder Morgan Canada’s (KML.TO) C$1.75 billion IPO and Canada Goose Holdings Inc’s (GOOS.TO) offering were some of the highlights in the first half. But overall, the equity capital activity in the energy sector could slow because of choppiness in oil prices, bankers said. “Investors have been generally taking a risk-off approach and we’re seeing limited conviction that oil prices are going to be high in the near term,” said Kirby Gavelin, head of equity capital markets at RBC.

930,COP,Factbox: Oil majors' investments in countries involved in Qatar row,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The West’s three biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbors. ExxonMobil(XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen not to take sides after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. Here are some facts about international oil companies which operate in the Gulf countries involved in the rift:     ** Qatar The U.S. oil major’s relationship with Qatar goes back to 1935 when it was known as Socony-Vacuum, and later Mobil.  It helped to develop the North Field, the world’s biggest gas field, and supplied Qatar with technology to make it the top competitor in the LNG market.  Qatar’s LNG production is divided between two companies, Qatargas and Rasgas. State oil company Qatar Petroleum (QP) owns a majority stake in both. RasGas is 70 percent-owned by QP and 30 percent-owned by ExxonMobil, while Qatargas is owned by a consortium including QP, ExxonMobil, Total, Mitsui (8031.T), Marubeni (8002.T), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Royal Dutch Shell. ExxonMobil is also the only foreign participant in two domestic gas projects, Al-Khaleej Gas and Barzan Gas. ** Saudi Arabia ExxonMobil is one of the largest foreign investors in Saudi Arabia, with more than 3,000 Saudi nationals working in the joint ventures in which the U.S. oil major participates. These range from petrochemicals manufacturing to petroleum refining. The company began working with Saudi Arabia in 1927 and owned a stake in the state oil giant Saudi Aramco before it was fully nationalized in the 1980s.  ExxonMobil has been a partner with Aramco in several major projects over the years including building the East-West Pipeline (Petroline) linking the Eastern Province fields with Yanbu on the Red Sea and the SAMREF refinery in Yanbu, which is equally-owned by Aramco and a subsidiary of Exxon. It is also a partner with SABIC in two petrochemical joint ventures - Saudi Yanbu Petrochemical Company (YANPET), and Al-Jubail Petrochemical Company (KEMYA). ** The UAE ExxonMobil was awarded the first oil concession in Abu Dhabi, now the capital of the UAE, in 1939.  Exxon is now developing the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield through a joint venture, Zakum Development Company (ZADCO), with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. ADNOC  has a 60 percent stake, while Exxon owns 28 percent and Japan’s Jodco 12 percent. The U.S. company also markets lubricants and petrochemicals for the Middle East and North Africa region out of its office in Dubai. ** Qatar The French oil major has been working with Qatar since 1936 through cooperation with Qatar Petroleum in developing LNG, refining and petrochemicals projects.  Total is one of the main partners of Qatargas, the world’s largest LNG producer, owning stakes in Qatargas 1 and Qatargas 2. It is a main shareholder in the Dolphin Energy pipeline which transfers natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.  It has joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum to develop the Al-Khalij and Al-Shaheen oil fields. Total Refining & Petrochemicals has stakes in both Qatar Petrochemicals Company (QAPCO), operating a petrochemical complex manufacturing ethylene and low-density polyethylene, and QATOFIN. Total is a partner in the Ras Laffan refinery and also sells lubricants. ** Saudi Arabia Total has been present in Saudi Arabia for almost 40 years and is a main player in the downstream sector. The French company has a 51 percent stake in the Saudi Total Petroleum Products joint venture, which manufactures and retails lubricants and specialty products. It owns a 37.5 percent stake in the SATORP joint venture - a 400,000 barrels per day refining and petrochemicals complex in Jubail - with Saudi Aramco owning the remaining 62.5 percent. ** The UAE Since 1939, Total has been working with the majority of Abu Dhabi’s oil and gas operating companies and other energy firms: ADCO, ADMA-OPCO, ADGAS, GASCO, FERTIL, Taweelah A1, Shams 1 and Dolphin Energy.  It has a 10 percent stake in a 40-year onshore concession to help develop Abu Dhabi’s biggest oilfields. ** Iran Total signed a 20-year contract with Iran this week to develop the giant South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar. The deal is the first major Western energy investment since sanctions against Tehran were lifted.  Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake in  South Pars. The first stage will cost around $2 billion. ** Qatar Shell said it is the biggest international investor in Qatar, surpassing Exxon. It is in partnership with Qatar Petroleum in projects covering LNG production, gas to liquids (GTL), shipping, exploration and petrochemicals. One of Shell’s main investments in Qatar is Pearl Gas-to-Liquids in Ras Laffan, the largest GTL plant in the world. The company also own a 30 percent stake in Qatargas 4, an integrated LNG production facility together with Qatar Petroleum, and is the shipping and maritime services provider for QatarGas Transport Company (Nakilat).  ** Saudi Arabia Shell has a diverse business with Saudi Arabia. It has a  stake in SASREF, a 50:50 joint venture refinery at Jubail with a crude oil refining capacity of 305,000 bpd, and a partnership with SABIC through its SADAF joint venture. It also has a joint venture that markets and sells Shell lubricants, and another that handles aviation re-fueling operations in the kingdom.  ** The UAE Shell currently does not own a direct stake in UAE’s oil or gas fields as talks with ADNOC to renew its 40-year oil concession stalled. However, the company has its regional headquarters in Dubai, through which it manages its businesses in the Middle East.  ** Other foreign companies such as Occidental (OXY.N) have operations in both Qatar and the UAE, while ConocoPhillips also owns interests in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  ** Trading houses including the world’s biggest names such as Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore also have business interests with all the countries locked in the political crisis. ** Asian countries such as China, India, South Korea and Japan are major buyers of crude, condensate and LNG from the Middle East producers. ** Sources: Companies’ websites, Reuters ",7062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-energy-factbox/factbox-oil-majors-investments-in-countries-involved-in-qatar-row-idUSKBN19Q2HH

932,COP,"Cenovus expects up to C$2.5 bln from Weyburn, Palliser sales -sources","TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) has hired investment banks to sell the Weyburn and Palliser oil assets, which it hopes would fetch as much as C$2.5 billion ($2 billion), according to people familiar with the situation.  The moves are part of a push to sell assets to pay down debt Cenovus took to help fund the C$16.8 billion purchase of oil and gas businesses from ConocoPhillips (COP.N). Cenovus is working with Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) to sell Weyburn, and with Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Scotiabank (BNS.TO) to sell the Palliser assets, two people said this week, declining to be named as the appointments are not public. The company last month identified Weyburn and Palliser as additional assets it would look to sell and raised its total divestiture target to C$4 billion to C$5 billion, from C$3.6 billion earlier.  Cenovus expects to generate as much as C$1.5 billion for Weyburn and about C$1 billion for Palliser, the people said. The deals could be announced in the fourth quarter, the company has said. If successful, these divestitures could help Cenovus reach up to half of its asset sales targets. Cenovus and Credit Suisse declined to comment, while TD and Scotiabank did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments. The Weyburn assets in southern Saskatchewan are attractive because of their light oil output and low decline, characteristics that might lead to a robust bidding process, the people said. Located in southeast Alberta, the Palliser block is a conventional tight-oil asset. Cenovus said last year it has identified 700 drilling locations in the block with what it said are high-return potentials. The company is also selling its Pelican Lake and Suffield conventional oil and gas assets.  Cenovus is under pressure because of the debt it incurred with the transformational acquisition of oil and gas assets. Its share price is down about 47 percent since the deal was announced in March, while the company said last month that Chief Executive Brian Ferguson – who had championed the transaction – would retire. Some investors have questioned whether the company can meet its asset sales targets, given that other oil firms are seeking to sell Canadian assets.

934,COP,UPDATE 1-Oando's share price drops 10 pct on news of regulatory investigation,"(Adds detail) By Chijioke Ohuocha LAGOS, July 17 (Reuters) - Shares in Nigerian oil company Oando fell close to a one-month low on Monday on news that regulators were investigating the firm’s shareholding structure following its $1.65 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips’ Nigerian business. Shares in Oando, which are also listed in Johannesburg and Toronto, fell 9.54 percent in Lagos, down for the second session in a row, to a level last seen in June. “Our attention has been drawn to a report ... stating that Oando is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following petitions filed by some foreign investors in Oando Nigeria Plc, in relation (to) shareholding structure,” it said in a statement. Oando acquired ConocoPhillips’s Nigerian business in 2014 aimed at moving the business upstream into oil exploration and production from being a petroleum products retailer. But high financing costs coupled with lower oil prices have hit profits, analysts say. The company said it was aware that the regulator was in receipt of a petition but that the claims were “unsubstantiated, misleading and defamatory” and that it had received board, shareholder and where required SEC approval on the matter. It added that the company was cooperating with the SEC.

935,COP,ConocoPhillips trims capex after posting quarterly loss,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) cut its 2017 capital spending by 4 percent on Thursday, the latest U.S. oil and natural gas producer to do so in reaction to depressed crude prices.  Conoco and its peers had mapped out ambitious capital spending programs for 2017 early in the year, expecting oil prices to be higher than where they are today, just under $50 per barrel.  But Conoco became the latest this week to cut its spending plans, after Hess Corp (HES.N), Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and others. “This is the right approach for value creation in the upstream sector, especially at a time of uncertainty in the commodity markets,” Conoco Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said in a statement. Conoco now plans to spend $4.8 billion this year, down from a prior estimate of $5 billion. The cut came after Conoco reported its quarterly loss more than tripled despite recent asset sales. Shares of the Houston-based company rose 1.2 percent to $44.21 in afternoon trading as oil prices traded slightly higher CLc1. Conoco has aggressively moved to sell assets and cull debt in the past year, steps praised by Wall Street. The company repaid $3 billion in debt during the quarter and expects to pay off $2.4 billion by the end of the year, which would bring its debt load under $20 billion. Conoco’s net loss widened to $3.4 billion, or $2.78 per share, in the quarter, from $1.1 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 14 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected a loss of 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results reflect a “solid quarter” for Conoco, Simmons & Co analysts Guy Baber said in a note to clients. Production fell 8 percent to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Still, the company is growing aggressively in its U.S. shale operations, which should see “pretty strong production” through the end of the year, executives told investors on a Thursday conference call. Conoco last month sold its Canadian oil sands and natural gas assets in March to Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $13.3 billion. The price was widely seen as high, a boon for Conoco. Conoco is the latest international oil major to pull back from northern Alberta’s oil sands, among the most costly locations in the world to develop.

945,COP,Conoco to start dismantling historical Norwegian oil platform,"OSLO (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has won permission to prepare for the removal of the first permanent oil platform built off Norway more than 40 years ago, the country’s industry regulator said on Thursday. The U.S. company applied in July to remove Ekofisk 2/4 A, which started producing oil from the North Sea in 1974 and shut permanently in 2013. Production at the Ekofisk field began in 1971 from the Gulftide jack-up rig, a temporary installation standing on removable legs. Gulftide was replaced with production platforms permanently fixed to the seabed in 1974. Discovered in 1969, Ekofisk was the first oilfield to begin production off Norway, kickstarting a period of unprecedented wealth for the nation of 5 million inhabitants.  While the field’s oldest installations are being removed, new equipment was put in place and production is ongoing, with the field expected to continue pumping oil towards 2050. The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said it had granted consent for ConocoPhillips to prepare for the removal of 2/4 A and three other installations. With the exception of some smaller parts, the actual removal will depend on a later permit, it added. ConocoPhillips plans to start preparations in the fourth quarter of this year. The removal plans also include two accommodation platforms, Ekofisk 2/4 H and Ekofisk 2/4 Q, and a riser platform called Ekofisk 2/4 FTP. Dutch company Heerema was awarded the removal contract, and all four platforms will eventually be taken to AF Decom yard at Vats on Norway’s western coast for dismantling and steel recycling, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips said. Operator ConocoPhillips has a 35 percent stake in Ekofisk, France’s Total has almost 40 percent, Italy’s Eni has 12.4 percent, Norway’s Statoil has 8 percent and Norwegian state-owned Petoro has 5 percent.

951,COP,UPDATE 2-Norway's Arctic oil ambitions suffer setback as most promising well yields none,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s hope of discovering a large oilfield in the Barents Sea has suffered a major setback after the far north Arctic’s most promising reservoir turned out to contain only small amounts of natural gas. Statoil, the country’s top oil and gas producer,   has stepped up drilling in the Barents Sea this year as the government seeks to attract more explorers to its Arctic waters to make up for declining North Sea output. But Statoil said on Tuesday that after drilling the northernmost exploration well in the highly anticipated Korpfjell prospect it had found only non-commercial quantities of gas and no oil. Korpfjell was the first exploration well drilled in the Norwegian section of a formerly disputed area between Norway and Russia, where Statoil and its partners had hoped to make a major discovery. “The results are of course disappointing, but it is too early to draw any conclusions on how this will impact the Barents Sea southeast area,” Jez Averty, Statoil’s head of exploration in Norway and UK, said. Statoil, which is majority government-owned, had ranked the Korpfjell well as “high-impact”, meaning that it could contain upwards of 250 million barrels of oil equivalents (boe) gross or 100 million boe for Statoil alone, while its partner Lundin Petroleum had said it could hold more than a billion barrels. Statoil, however, said that the discovery made at Korfpjell is estimated to contain just 40-75 million boe or 6-12 billion standard cubic metres of gas, not large enough for commercial development. Averty said Statoil needed to explore the area more, and planned a second Korpfjell well in 2018. Lundin also said it would continue to explore in the area. The failure to make significant discoveries is also disappointing for Norway’s right-wing government, which has sought to expand the petroleum industry in the Arctic region as production from the North Sea’s mature areas is set to decline from the mid-2020s. In April, Norway’s oil industry regulator doubled its forecast for potential Barents Sea discoveries.  That alarmed green groups, which oppose Arctic drilling, and Greenpeace activists tried to stop drilling of the Korpfjell well earlier this month.     Korpfjell was the fourth of Statoil’s five planned exploration wells in the Barents Sea this summer, and the third that failed to prove commercial volumes. Statoil’s fourth exploration well drilled this year, known as Kayak, made a small oil discovery, which could be potentially tied in to the larger Johan Castberg field development. News of the disappointing drilling results from Korpfjell sent Statoil shares down 1.9 percent by 0849 GMT, while shares of Lundin Petroleum tumbled 7 percent. Other partners in the Korpfjell license are Chevron, ConocoPhillips and state-owned Petoro.   “Gas is almost impossible to commercialize in these remote areas, and if the eastern Barents Sea is gas prone, it will have limited value potential,” analysts at brokers DNB said in note. They cut their target for Lundin’s share price by 4 crowns to 196 Swedish crowns ($24.76) on Tuesday. Teodor Sveen-Nilsen, an analyst at Sparebank 1 Markets, said the results so far were slightly disappointing, but not disastrous. “If more wells to be drilled in 2018 turn to be dry, then it would be really bad,” he added.

952,COP,UPDATE 2-Canadian Natural buys Cenovus Pelican Lake assets for C$975 million,"(Reuters) - Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy Cenovus Energy Inc’s (CVE.TO) Pelican Lake heavy oil operations in Alberta for C$975 million ($787 million), the company’s second acquisition this year. The company has its own crude oil producing asset adjacent to the Cenovus Pelican Lake property, and both use a similar technology to boost oil recovery. Analysts said Canadian Natural paid a price that was within estimates, and the acquisition will help it reduce costs in Pelican Lake. Reuters reported last week that Canadian Natural was in advanced talks to buy the Pelican Lake assets. Canadian Natural shares opened higher and extended gains more than 1.7 percent to C$39.37 after news of the deal. By mid day, the stock had moderated gains and stood at C$39.04, up 0.8 percent.  Cenovus shares were up as high as 4.2 percent at C$10.36 before trading at C$10.22, up 2.7 percent.  The benchmark Canada share index was down 0.8 percent. [.GSPTSE]  Canadian Natural said in March it had agreed to buy oil sands assets from Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) for $8.5 billion. The company was among Canadian producers who snapped up assets this year from foreign oil majors who departed the region.  In a separate statement on Tuesday, Cenovus said the proceeds from the Pelican Lake sale would be used to pay down debt used to fund the $13.3 billion acquisition of some assets from ConocoPhillips (COP.N) in March. Cenovus also said it was close to selling its Suffield oil and natural gas assets in Alberta, which could fetch between C$500 million and C$600 million. nL1N1KQ12S] CIBC Capital Markets and Barclays Capital Canada Inc were Cenovus’s financial advisers.

953,COP,Exclusive: Norway plans tax breaks for remotest Arctic oilfields - letters,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s government plans to make taxpayers rather than oil companies pay special U.N. fees for any offshore production from remote Arctic regions, according to letters sent to oil firms and seen by Reuters. The plan could serve as an example for other nations looking to fund exploration of the seabed ever further from land. It was criticized by opposition parties that want tighter limits on exploration in the fragile Arctic environment, days before an election in which the future of Norway’s big offshore oil and gas sector is a major issue. Opinion polls show a neck-and-neck race between Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg’s center-right block and center-left parties headed by Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere. “There is too little risk on the companies, and too much risk on the people of Norway,” said Ola Elvestuen, the head of parliament’s Energy and Environment committee and a member of the small Liberal Party. “Neither me, nor the committee were informed about this,” he said of the plans, outlined in letters provided to Reuters by the Oil and Energy Ministry, for implementing a dormant provision of the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under Article 82 of the treaty, rich nations are due to pay up to 7 percent a year of the value of any production — of oil, gas or other minerals — from their continental shelves more than 200 nautical miles (370 km) from land to a fund to help developing nations. The money would be channeled to poor nations via the United Nations’ International Seabed Authority in Jamaica. The mechanism is untested as there is no production so far offshore. The Oil and Energy Ministry included a warning about Article 82 when it offered parts of the Arctic Barents Sea, more than 200 nautical miles from land, for exploration in the latest licensing round awarded in 2016. “The licensees could be required to cover certain costs in this connection,” it wrote in the letters to oil companies.  “Any such cost will be deductible in the calculation of the petroleum tax.” The ministry viewed the deductions as matching Norwegian petroleum policy, which includes a principle that “an investment project that is profitable before tax is also profitable after tax,” an official source said. Last month, Statoil and partners Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Lundin Petroleum, and Petoro drilled the first well in the Arctic Korpfjell prospect, 410 km from the nearest land. They found only small, non-commercial quantities of natural gas, but Statoil plans more drilling in the area in 2018. The government has also offered three additional blocks behind the 200 nautical miles threshold in upcoming licensing rounds, with awards expected in 2018. Of the 166 nations that have ratified the Law of the Sea, Norway has apparently gone furthest in outlining how it would apply Article 82, legal experts said.  The United States, which has not signed up, tells bidders for oil and gas leases far offshore in the Gulf of Mexico that they might be at risk of extra charges if Washington were to join. “Norway and the United States are the only two countries that have spent any time talking about Article 82,” said Wylie Spicer, a Canadian legal expert who has written reviews of Article 82 for the United Nations. John Norton Moore, a law professor at the University of Virginia who helped draft Article 82, said Oslo was trying to balance the interests of its citizens, oil companies and developing nations. “This strikes me as a sound decision by Norway. It recognizes that it is an obligation of the state” to pay any charges under Article 82, he said. He said it was reasonable to give oil companies tax breaks for taking on the risks of operating so far from land. Article 82 makes states responsible for payments but lets them decide how to raise the cash. Rasmus Hansson, the only member of parliament for the opposition Green Party and a member of the Energy and Environment Committee, criticized the government plan. “This is yet another round of subsidizing Norway’s future contributions to global warming with taxpayers’ money,” he said. Environmental group Greenpeace also criticized the plan, saying that oil and gas in the high north was simply too risky. “There is no anchor in the democratic process,” said Truls Gulowsen, leader of Greenpeace Norway. Legal scholars say Article 82 is based on the idea that the high seas, owned by no nation, usually start 200 nautical miles offshore, the limit of each country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Article 82 lets rich nations exploit resources beyond their EEZs in offshore areas where, such as in Arctic Norway, a shallow continental shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles. Under Article 82, countries will have to start paying 1 percent of the value or volume of any production after five years, with the annual rate rising to a plateau of 7 percent after 12 years. Norway’s parliament debated and ratified the Law of the Sea in 1996, and included an assessment that any application of Article 82 was unlikely to have a big economic impact.

954,COP,"For ConocoPhillips, Harvey a test of remote operations","HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips is still shut out of its global headquarters nearly two weeks after Tropical Storm Harvey slammed into Houston, so Chief Executive Ryan Lance and thousands of employees are running the world’s largest independent oil and natural gas producer remotely.     Lance, whose own Houston home was flooded by Harvey, has 2,800 employees in the region working at home or at smaller offices in Dallas or Bartlesville, Oklahoma, overseeing natural gas trading along with operations in the Texas Eagle Ford shale region and the Gulf of Mexico. Many were moved out of Harvey’s path before the storm. “You can run virtually for a long time if you’ve got the right systems and personnel,” Lance told Reuters on Wednesday. Conoco’s headquarters in west Houston sustained minor flooding damage, but roads to the campus are still submerged under several feet of water. Another nearby ConocoPhillips office was flooded.  “Like everyone else, we didn’t anticipate all this rain. The damage quickly passed for our Eagle Ford operations, but then our attention turned to our headquarters,” he said. The flooding stems from a decision by regional officials to release water from a nearby reservoir to prevent collapse after nearly 52 inches (132 cm) of rainfall during Harvey. Conoco initially expected to reopen by Sept. 5, but flooding pushed that back until at least Sept. 11. The company is not expected to need temporary office space, he said.  Lance, CEO since 2012, said he speaks daily with emergency staff and board members, most of whom do not live in the Houston area. About 8 percent of Conoco employees in the region, roughly 200 people, have long-term home damage from the storm. Conoco said it donated $5 million to the United Way and American Red Cross, the largest sum from any oil company in Harvey’s wake. BP Plc’s U.S. offices, less than 2 miles (3 km) west of Conoco headquarters, suffered extensive flooding and are  closed indefinitely. Some of the day-to-day functions were absorbed by BP’s London headquarters. Companies that need temporary office space will find a Houston real estate market with spare capacity, though the extent of damage is unclear. There were about 10 million square feet of office space available ahead of Harvey, according to real estate firm CBRE. “As oil and gas companies continue to downsize in response to the low oil price environment, Houston remains flush with sublease space with existing furniture already in place,” said CBRE’s Graham Horton.

956,COP,The graphite fix: Inside China's newest commodity addiction,"MANILA/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s aggressive environmental protection campaign has tightened supplies of graphite electrodes used in steelmaking, boosting the fortunes of big producers like Fangda Carbon as mills search far and wide for a material now in short supply. Beijing’s campaign for clearer skies has closed thousands of mills and mines producing low-quality steel and coal, and makers of electrodes, particularly those near big cities, have not been spared. Graphite electrodes are used to melt scrap in electric arc furnaces to produce new steel. Their main ingredient is high-value needle coke - named because of its shape - which is made from either petroleum or coal tar. As China tightened the screws on polluting industrial plants, about 30 percent of its graphite electrode production capacity has been shut and some provinces have restricted output, said Dawn Brooks, a consultant at CRU. “It’s just a fairly polluting industry, so factories near large urban areas were the ones to get hit by the environmental restrictions,” Brooks told Reuters. But it’s boom time for major players who have survived, including Fangda Carbon New Material, China’s biggest producer of graphite electrodes.  The company is the best performing stock on the Shanghai Stock Exchange with a 263 percent year-to-date gain, while its first-half net profit surged to 412 million yuan ($63 million) from just 15 million yuan a year ago. Analysts expect its July earnings alone to trump that figure as graphite electrode prices explode. Prices have soared nearly ninefold to 107,250 yuan ($16,330) a tonne in China this year amid a shortage of needle coke that has tightened availability elsewhere. Globally, spot prices for graphite electrodes have jumped by even more to about $35,000 per tonne as Chinese shipments dried up.  “We cannot handle all enquiries due to the supply shortage,” said a major Asian producer of graphite electrode that sells to South Korea, Japan, the United States and Europe. “There are huge inquiries but we cannot even set a price because we don’t have the electrode to sell.” As the main heating element in an electric arc furnace (EAF), it takes 2-3 kg of graphite electrodes to produce one tonne of steel. Producers say it takes up to six months to make these electrodes.     Steelmakers typically buy graphite electrodes on yearly contracts, but now suppliers are only quoting prices for six months, the Asian producer said. “With prices rising, nobody wants to commit to today’s prices for a year,” he said.  In China, nearly 300,000 tonnes of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity has been shuttered since the second half of 2016 due to environmental concerns, CRU’s Brooks said in a report. That’s almost 30 percent of China’s total capacity, she said, adding that Henan and Shandong provinces have restricted graphite electrode production by 20 percent. The closure of cheaper but more polluting induction furnaces in June had pushed many Chinese to move toward EAFs, but the limited supply of graphite electrode has stalled those plans.  Apart from graphite electrodes, needle coke is used to make lithium-ion batteries, used in phones and electric cars, further tightening availability for the steel sector. Petroleum coke, of which needle coke is a variety, is also widely used in the aluminum industry to manufacture the cathodes that are key to the smelting process. Needle coke production is limited to a few suppliers, the biggest being U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips and Japan’s C-Chem Co Ltd. Most refineries don’t produce needle coke because it takes longer to make than more traditional forms of petroleum coke, analysts say. In China, where most needle coke is made from metallurgical coke, stricter environmental rules have closed a lot of factories, said an official from CNPC Jinzhou Petrochemical, a major Chinese needle coke producer.  CNPC Jinzhou has no plans to expand production, he added. Fangda, which has its own needle coke plant with an annual capacity of 60,000 tonnes, did not respond to requests for comment. The supply-side crackdown is “affecting the whole supply chain – with raw materials suppliers unable to meet demand from electrode manufacturers, and with steel mills around the world concerned that they will run out of replacement electrodes by the end of the year,” said Brooks. “We hear that there is currently a year-long waiting period for electrodes from manufacturers.” Top Philippine steelmaker Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp, which runs a 500,000-tonne EAF and buys high-grade graphite electrodes from Japan is finding it tougher to secure material. The company was looking at purchasing from China.  “Price are rising so it’s difficult to source,” said Steel Asia vice president Roberto Cola, adding that the company normally has three to four months inventory of the electrodes.  The shortage is also being felt in Europe, where around 226,000 tonnes of graphite electrodes are consumed annually by the European Union. More than 60 percent of smaller electrodes come from China. “With Chinese supplies of needle coke and graphite out of the market, there is a clear shortage of both materials,” Axel Eggert, director general of the European Steel Association, said in a statement on Monday.

963,COP,REUTERS SUMMIT-Indonesia's drive to reduce oil imports a boon for producers - GSS Energy,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The appeal of Indonesia’s oil and gas sector is improving for some independent producers as the resource-rich nation scrambles to reduce its dependence on imports and fill a gap left by the exit of some producers, the head of GSS Energy told Reuters. “There could be some assets that will be available that three or five years ago would have been very difficult to gain access to for a relatively small and new player like us,” said Sydney Yeung, group chief executive at Singapore-listed GSS Energy at the Reuters Global Commodity Summit. Amid depressed oil prices, international oil companies such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron have reduced their holdings in Indonesia, a former member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As a result, the country has struggled to attract fresh investment and to develop new fields. The risks that energy investors face in Indonesia are highlighted by recent change to the development plans of the Masela gas field developed by Japan’s Inpex. There has also been a long-standing dispute between France’s Total and Indonesia’s government over the Mahakam block, the country’s largest gas-producing field. The recent departure of the producers, as well as its drive to reduce its dependence on imports, “can only force the government to move faster” in implementing more favourable policies and incentives for operators, said Yeung at the Summit held at the Reuters office in Singapore.  Indonesia’s crude oil output peaked at around 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the mid-1990s. But with few significant oil discoveries in the past 10 years, production has fallen to roughly half that as old fields have matured and died. “Indonesia is a net importer of oil not because there’s a lack of resources,” said Yeung, but because “previous policies that did not encourage or anticipate the demand they needed and did not push as aggressively as they should have.” With oil demand at about 1.2 million bpd and production at about 800,000 bpd, investors in Indonesia’s oil and gas sector will have a big supply gap to fill, said Yeung.      The energy industry is a vital part of the Indonesian economy, but its contribution to state revenue has dropped from around 25 percent in 2006 to an expected 3.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. “It’s very clear to me that Indonesia’s number one agenda is to push its economy forward as fast as they can but that would be difficult without greater energy supply,” said Sydney.

964,COP,"ConocoPhillips' profit beats estimates, but budget cut 10 percent","HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips , the largest U.S. independent oil producer, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by rising crude prices, although it slashed its capital budget by 10 percent to further cut costs. Shares of the Houston-based company rose 2.9 percent to $51.43 in afternoon trading. The stock has gained about 2 percent this year.   Other North American oil producers, like MEG Energy Corp and Husky Energy Inc, have also moved to control spending and focus on shareholder returns, with crude prices not expected to rise markedly before the end of the decade.  On a conference call with investors, Conoco’s executives stressed their approach to maximizing shareholder returns, regardless of whether commodity prices improve. “We don’t require a pathway, or market help, to get to cash flow neutrality,” Don Wallette, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call.      Analysts said the results reflected Conoco’s increasing focus on controlling costs and focusing on improving operations, though the company’s unexpected $600 million contribution to its U.S. pension program zapped cash flow.  Pension funding is often based on future assessments of reserve levels, taking into account interest rates and other factors. Companies occasionally do have to inject cash into pensions to meet minimum funding requirements if investments do not keep pace. Conoco reported third-quarter earnings of $420 million, or 34 cents a share, compared to a loss of $1.04 billion, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items such as asset sales and costs to exit Nova Scotia operations, Conoco earned 16 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 8 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also lowered its 2017 capital budget by 10 percent to $4.5 billion.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which battered Houston region in August, Conoco was unable to reach its global headquarters, forcing the company to run all of its operations remotely. Conoco said it still expects to end the year pumping about 1.4 million boepd, despite the budget cuts, largely due to efficiency and new technology.

969,COP,UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX) has agreed to buy stakes in a huge oil find in Alaska for $400 million, in a surprise push to diversify from its sweet spot of gas in Papua New Guinea. Oil Search will pick up stakes in three oil blocks from privately owned U.S. firms Armstrong Energy and GMT Exploration giving it a roughly 26 percent holding in the Nanushuk play, co-owned by Spain’s Repsol SA (REP.MC). The play includes the Horseshoe block, which hit oil in March in what Repsol called the biggest U.S. onshore find in 30 years. It estimated the field could hold 1.2 billion barrels.  Oil Search bought in assuming the field holds 500 million barrels, expecting production to begin in 2023, with output to plateau at 80,000 to 120,000 barrels per day. “With the quality of the assets, the fact that they’re tier 1, and the fact that we’ve gone in very conservatively against what Repsol are saying, I think we can demonstrate to the market that this will be a super deal for Oil Search in the medium term,” Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten told Reuters. Investors were nervous about the $8 billion company’s move into a region where it has no experience and which is dominated by giants like BP (BP.L) and ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), sending its shares down 3 percent, especially after it gave up on a push into Kurdistan.  Other Australian oil and gas producers rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday. “Questions will inevitably be asked about Oil Search’s competitive advantage to play in Alaska until it proves its operational capability there,” said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. RBC analyst Ben Wilson said the move was well-timed near the bottom of the oil price cycle and with some of the appraisal work on the field already done. He said it had “good prospects” as the oil was high-grade. Botten began working on the deal eight months ago when oil prices were about 20 percent lower than now and said Oil Search managed to get the asset despite higher-priced interest from others in nearby fields, whom he declined to name. The owners of the neighboring fields are ConocoPhillips (COP.N), ExxonMobil and Italy’s ENI (ENI.MI). Oil Search has the option of doubling its stake in the Alaskan assets for a further $450 million. It plans to fund the deal from its cash reserves.  Oil Search will work with oilfield services giant Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Armstrong before taking over as operator of the assets in June 2018.

972,COP,Oil at $70/barrel already a reality for some as Asian premium bites,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The rising demand for crude oil that can more easily produce transportation fuels when refined has some Australian and Malaysian producers boasting cargoes valued at close to $70 a barrel, a hefty premium to global benchmarks.   Malaysia’s state oil company Petronas [PETR.UL] sold last week a December-loading Miri Light cargo at a premium of about $4.50 a barrel to dated Brent, equivalent to about $69 at the latest prices, according to multiple traders that participate in the Asian regional crude market. Australian Barrow Island and Cooper Basin crudes are now close to $70 a barrel currently, based on premiums for grades of about $1.50 a barrel to Malaysian benchmark grade Kimanis, said the traders. Kimanis itself is priced at a premium of about $4.40 a barrel to dated Brent, which was assessed at $64.07 a barrel on Monday by price reporting agency S&P; Global Platts.  “Prices of domestic Australian grades are even higher than MCO (Malaysian Crude Oil),” an Asian trader said. “That would make them the most expensive crudes in the world.” Demand for these grades is rising because of the short distances to Asian refineries, which prize the crude for their low sulfur content and higher yields of more valuable oil products such as diesel, the traders said.  Demand for short-haul grades has increased after the Brent oil market structure flipped into backwardation, when prompt prices are more than later prices. That means the value of the crude drops over the course of the voyage.  The refiners are willing to pay up for the Australian and Malaysian crudes rather than incur the additional time and cost of shipping Brent supplies from the North Sea, the traders said.      Typically, Asia-Pacific grades are sold to refineries in Southeast Asia and Australia or New Zealand that have a preference for low-sulfur oil. Values for these grades have risen because of their scarcity.     Petronas and its partners Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Murphy Oil Corp, Pertamina [PERTM.UL] sell about 6 million barrels of Kimanis each month. But volumes for other Malaysian grades such as Kikeh and Labuan have fallen as output declines at the mature fields.     Australia’s crude and condensate production has been below 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) since September 2016, data from the country’s Department of the Environment and Energy showed. In August it was 279,000 bpd.     Santos Ltd produces about 30,000 bpd of Cooper Basin crude in southern Australia, according to its website.     Santos and its partners, Chevron Corp and Mobil Australia Resources Co, a unit of Exxon Mobil Corp, produces 5,000 bpd of Barrow Island in western Australia, according to Santos.

973,COP,ConocoPhillips vows financial discipline as it aims to boost output,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said on Wednesday it will boost oil and natural gas output for the rest of the decade but vowed it would do so only when it was financially prudent and that it would strictly adhere to shareholder returns.     The largest U.S. independent oil and natural gas producer plans to spend an average of $5.5 billion annually for the next three years as long as oil prices CLc1 stay above $50 per barrel. “Our value proposition is not built around production growth. It is built around returns,” Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in an interview on the sidelines of the company’s investor day in New York. The spending forecast, an increase from 2017 and higher than many Wall Street analysts expected, comes as Conoco, like some peers, focuses more on generating profits rather than boosting production at any cost. Much of that discipline is helped by better technology and more efficient processes. The company expects production to grow 5 percent each year for the rest of the decade, helped by output spikes in the Eagle Ford and Permian shales of Texas, two of the largest U.S. oilfields. That growth will come, Lance said, regardless of what members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decide this month when they meet in Vienna to debate extending an agreement to curb oil production. “I don’t care what they do,” Lance said of OPEC’s 14 members. “They’re not going to change our plans.” OPEC and partners, including Russia, are largely expected to extend the agreement, which ends in March. U.S. oil prices CLc1 have risen more than 5 percent in the past month due in part to the success of OPEC’s supply cuts. That raises the specter of cost hikes for oilfield services, a situation that would erode margins. But Lance said that Conoco would pull back operations rather than burn cash if that scenario occurred. “If the returns start to be diluted due to inflationary pressures, we’ll pull back and think about fighting another day,” he said. Lance and his deputies said at an investor presentation on Wednesday morning that they should be able to send more than 30 percent of cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks by 2020.    Shareholder returns are the “ultimate measure of value creation in our business,” Lance said.

974,COP,UPDATE 4-ConocoPhillips vows financial discipline as it aims to boost output,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said on Wednesday it will boost oil and natural gas output for the rest of the decade but vowed it would do so only when it was financially prudent and that it would strictly adhere to shareholder returns.     The largest U.S. independent oil and natural gas producer plans to spend an average of $5.5 billion annually for the next three years as long as oil prices CLc1 stay above $50 per barrel. “Our value proposition is not built around production growth. It is built around returns,” Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in an interview on the sidelines of the company’s investor day in New York. The spending forecast, an increase from 2017 and higher than many Wall Street analysts expected, comes as Conoco, like some peers, focuses more on generating profits rather than boosting production at any cost. Much of that discipline is helped by better technology and more efficient processes. The company expects production to grow 5 percent each year for the rest of the decade, helped by output spikes in the Eagle Ford and Permian shales of Texas, two of the largest U.S. oilfields. That growth will come, Lance said, regardless of what members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decide this month when they meet in Vienna to debate extending an agreement to curb oil production. “I don’t care what they do,” Lance said of OPEC’s 14 members. “They’re not going to change our plans.” OPEC and partners, including Russia, are largely expected to extend the agreement, which ends in March. U.S. oil prices CLc1 have risen more than 5 percent in the past month due in part to the success of OPEC’s supply cuts. That raises the specter of cost hikes for oilfield services, a situation that would erode margins. But Lance said that Conoco would pull back operations rather than burn cash if that scenario occurred. “If the returns start to be diluted due to inflationary pressures, we’ll pull back and think about fighting another day,” he said. Lance and his deputies said at an investor presentation on Wednesday morning that they should be able to send more than 30 percent of cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks by 2020.    Shareholder returns are the “ultimate measure of value creation in our business,” Lance said.

980,COP,UPDATE 2-BP seeks stake in Cairn Energy Senegal assets - sources,"SYDNEY/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil exploration company Cairn Energy (CNE.L) is in talks with BP  to sell a 30 percent stake in its deepwater SNE field offshore Senegal, which could be valued at around $600 million, banking sources and a Senegal oil ministry source said.  “We are aware that BP wants to acquire a stake in Cairn Energy, but they are awaiting validation by the state (of Senegal),” an adviser to Senegal’s oil minister, who declined to be named, told Reuters by telephone.  He had no further details. However, Mamadou Faye, director of Senegal’s state oil firm Petrosen, said no formal request had yet been made by the companies. “There is no substance to reports concerning Cairn’s assets in Senegal,” a Cairn spokesperson said. BP (BP.L) declined to comment.  Cairn’s share price rose around 5 percent on Tuesday, BP’s was up around 1 percent. Oil majors have been increasingly homing in on the waters off Senegal, as well as neighbors Mauritania and Gambia, where they suspect hundreds of millions of barrels lie. A deal would further boost BP’s position in Senegal following a joint venture with Kosmos Energy in December last year, which revealed a major gas discovery in May. BP also has investments in two other offshore fields there. Senegal and Mauritania are two areas BP is targeting over the next decade and it plans to spend billions in the Tortue LNG project which is expected to produce its first gas in 2021.  The deepwater SNE project is the first oil development in the West African nation. Cairn shares the project with Australia’s Woodside (WPL.AX) and FAR Ltd (FAR.AX). The companies expect to start producing by 2021.     Woodside, Australia’s biggest independent oil and gas producer, bought a 35 percent stake from ConocoPhillips last year for up to $430 million, or $2.20 a barrel based on reserves of 561 million barrels at the time, before these were upgraded to nearly 650 million barrels. FAR Ltd has said the project could start producing before 2021, and at a higher rate than flagged before. Oil majors including Total SA and China’s CNOOC Ltd have also been investing in the waters off this part of the West African coast.

984,COP,Alaska oil companies settle dispute over Trans-Alaska Pipeline tariff charges,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The state of Alaska will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement with oil companies over the value of North Slope crude oil shipped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP), officials announced. The settlement between Alaska and the companies that own the 800-mile oil artery concerns transportation tariffs charged by the pipeline owners between 2009 and 2015.  Alaska claimed that the Alyeska owner companies, including  BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and Unocal, overstated the tariffs and improperly devalued the oil delivered by the pipeline, thus reducing state income. “This settlement is a great result for the State,” Alaska Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth said in statement. “It creates certainty going forward, avoids future litigation, and will provide additional taxes and royalties — bringing needed money to the state treasury.” The settlement was filed Friday with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), said Chief Alaska Attorney General John Ptacin. It is subject to FERC and RCA approval, which state officials hope will happen by next spring, he said. The settlement resolves multiple disputes over the time period. “There’s about 40 rate cases. We’re settling all of those cases in this settlement agreement,” Ptacin said. The terms allow the state to retain $224 million in already collected revenues and grant the state an additional $165 million in oil revenues.  Other terms require the companies to exclude from any tariff calculations approximately $625 million that the owner companies spent on “strategic reconfiguration” for TAPS operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Terms also include a methodology for calculating transportation tariffs through 2021. The settlement resolves complaints the oil companies filed in Washington, D.C. and Alaska courts that challenged past FERC and RCA rulings, Ptacin said. Much of the disagreement stemmed from Alyeska’s strategic reconfiguration project, which was aimed at streamlining operations, increasing automation and reducing costs in a time when the pipeline is carrying reduced oil volumes.  The state argued that the owner companies botched the project and added costs that should not be used to reduce the value of North Slope crude or the revenues derived from that crude. The state prevailed on that point, Ptacin said. Disputes also concerned property taxes and how they would be treated in the tariff calculations, he said. Also parties to the settlement are Anadarko, Tesoro, Flint Hills and Petro Star Inc., which shipped oil through the pipeline but held no ownership shares. Those companies generally sided with the state in the tariff disputes, Ptacin said.

985,COP,Investors sense opportunities in Big Oil - but mind the gap,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are gaining confidence - up to a point - that 2018 will be the year of oil stocks. While shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. Big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes. Uncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector. But a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies’ profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks.  “2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,” said Olivia Markham, portfolio manager at BlackRock Commodities Income Investment Trust. She expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years. UBS, RBC and JP Morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while Barclays analysts predicted on Thursday that earnings for the European integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter. Optimists point to developments like Shell’s (RDSa.L) raising in November of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel. “Annus Mirabilis. Highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,” Bernstein said in its outlook for European oil majors. Figures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. The MSCI world energy index .dMIWO0EN00PUS, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though Brent crude hit 2-1/2 year highs. Europe’s oil and gas sector.SXEP, which includes Shell, Total (TOTF.PA), BP (BP.L) and Eni (ENI.MI), was the worst-performing in the region.  Oil majors’ shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. Since June, the MSCI index has gained 20 percent but Brent LCOc1 shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after OPEC and other major producers agreed to cut output. The majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump. With production from U.S. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels. “There’s little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. Everyone is waiting to understand what’s going on,” said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Italian fund manager Banor SIM. As well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. Such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters. Whether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again. “From here it’s a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn’t help you out,” said Peter Hackworth, oil equity analyst at Goldman Sachs.  As well as the strong cash flow generation at the European majors, early signs of capital discipline among U.S. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year. Goldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the Brent price.  One crucial component in winning back investors’ confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. Offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share. Shell and BP have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. Goldman Sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months. Average dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, Hackworth said. But not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue. “The market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. So I think the market is overreacting,” said Eric Moore, European income fund manager at Miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year. Moore’s fund holds BP, Shell, Statoil (STL.OL), Eni and Premier Oil. (PMO.L) Analysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since October after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. Any uptick in mergers and acquisitions - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump – could also boost the sector.  Investors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets. “Electric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,” Blackrock’s Markham said.  Some are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays.     But the shift to cleaner energy doesn’t necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. Many are sticking with them but favoring companies which put more emphasis on renewables.  Nick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital, said he prefers Total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power.     But in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said. Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focusing on returns more than growth. For him, BP, Shell, Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note. “The historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. It failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.”  GRAPHIC - Oil prices and energy shares: here ",1052018,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-oilmajors-2018/investors-sense-opportunities-in-big-oil-but-mind-the-gap-idUSL8N1OZ0RK

The lawsuit, against BP Plc, Chevron Corp, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, follows similar lawsuits filed last year by San Francisco and other California cities seeking billions of dollars in damages from rising sea levels due to climate impacts.  “Safeguarding the retirement of our city’s police officers, teachers, firefighters and city workers is our top priority, and we believe that their financial future is linked to the sustainability of the planet,” Comptroller Scott Stringer said in the statement. The lawsuits are the latest legal challenges against oil companies over climate change and come as the firms are searching for new business models amid pressure by governments and consumers for cleaner energy. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,” Exxon said in a statement. “Lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life – simply do not do that.”     Chevron also said the lawsuits only serve special interests. ConocoPhillips declined to comment, and neither BP nor Shell could immediately be reached.      Exxon this week hit back against the California lawsuits in a filing with a Texas state court pointing out none of the cities disclosed such risks to bond buyers and arguing the lawsuits were politically motivated and linked to cases brought by the states of New York and Massachusetts. In afternoon trading, stock prices for the companies were mixed. Shares of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips were down slightly, while Chevron and BP shares were up slightly.    New York’s goal of eliminating about $5 billion in securities of nearly 200 oil companies, would be among the biggest public pension divestments from fossil fuels to date, the city said in a statement. Norway’s trillion-dollar wealth fund, the largest of its kind, in November proposed cutting billions of dollars in oil and gas stocks.

988,COP,"ConocoPhillips boosts dividend, buyback after swinging to fourth-quarter profit","HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said on Thursday it swung to a quarterly profit due in part to rising crude prices CLc1 and cost cuts, helping the U.S. oil and gas producer boost its dividend and expand a share buyback program. The moves are likely to appease shareholders who have been clamoring for oil producers to focus more on margins and other shareholder-friendly metrics rather than production increases.  As oil prices CLc1 have gained more than 33 percent since last fall, Conoco has vowed to boost output only when it was financially prudent and said that it would strictly adhere to shareholder returns. The company sold off $16 billion worth of assets in the past year, helping to cut its debt load, and also has been aggressively cutting costs to boost returns.     “Our value proposition is focused on creating long-term value and winning back both energy and generalist investors to a sector that has underperformed for far too long,” Chief Executive Ryan Lance told investors on a Wednesday conference call. Shares of Houston-based Conoco rose 1 percent to $59.42 in afternoon trading as oil prices rose.[O/R] The company posted fourth-quarter net income of $1.58 billion, or $1.32 per share, compared to a net loss of $35 million, or 3 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, Conoco earned 45 cents per share, matching analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly production fell 23 percent to 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, due in part to asset sales. The divestment shrunk Conoco’s reserves by nearly 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, denting future growth potential. The company’s Canadian operations lost money during the quarter, offset by profit in U.S. assets, as well as projects in Europe, Africa and Asia.  The bulk of the company’s quarterly profit came from Alaska, where Conoco is the largest oil producer. Conoco said on Thursday it paid $400 million to Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) for a 22 percent stake in the Western North Slope operations and a pipeline. “We still see a lot of opportunity” in Alaska, said Lance. Conoco pumps about 170,000 bpd in the state, about 28 percent of its total production. ConocoPhillips raised its quarterly dividend to 28.5 cents and increased its 2018 buyback plan by 33 percent to $2 billion.

998,COP,"UPDATE 2-East Timor, Australia agree on maritime border, 'pathway' to develop gas field","DILI (Reuters) - East Timor and Australia have reached an agreement for a treaty on their disputed maritime border and on a “pathway” to develop the giant Greater Sunrise offshore gas fields, the Permanent Court of Arbitration said on Monday.  Under the agreement, the share of revenue from the offshore gas field will differ depending on downstream benefits that arise from “different development concepts”, the statement said following talks in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement would establish a maritime boundary in the Timor Sea for the first time. Australia had sought a boundary aligned with its continental shelf, but East Timor argued the border should lie half way between it and Australia - placing much of the Greater Sunrise fields under its control. The long-running dispute had led the owners of Greater Sunrise - Woodside Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan’s Osaka Gas - to shelve the project. The fields are estimated to hold 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and 226 million barrels of condensates, which analysts have  previously estimated could be worth $40 billion. However, development could be at least a decade away, with Woodside looking at the latter half of the next decade. Ending years of opposition, Australia agreed in 2017 to accept Dili’s formal notice to terminate an agreement to split petroleum revenue equally from Greater Sunrise and set a 50-year timetable for negotiating a permanent sea boundary. Dili had taken the long-running maritime border dispute to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an intergovernmental organization based at The Hague, which ordered compulsory arbitration between the two parties. The court announced last year that the countries had reached an agreement “on the central elements of a maritime boundary delimitation between them in the Timor Sea” – but that details would remain confidential until the deal was finalised. The two governments will meet in New York at the United Nations headquarters on March 6 to sign the new maritime boundary treaty, the statement said. East Timor had been pushing for the building of an onshore processing plant to boost its economy rather than a floating plant.  According to media reports, East Timor could receive up to 80 percent of revenue, but could agree to less if gas is piped to a terminal in the tiny country. The Sunrise joint venture, led by Woodside, said it was aware that the two governments have agreed a new maritime boundaries treaty. “We hope that the Commission’s conclusions and the signing of the treaty will help to provide the fiscal and regulatory certainty required to develop Greater Sunrise for the benefit of all parties,” a Sunrise joint venture spokeswoman said in emailed comments. Australia’s foreign ministry said the countries had “agreed a draft treaty establishing our maritime boundaries and the sharing of revenue from the development of the Greater Sunrise resource”. In the emailed statement, the ministry said the countries would “continue to work towards a decision on the development concept for Greater Sunrise”. East Timor’s oil minister, Hernani Filomena Coelho da Silva, said that his country’s preference was for the gas to come to his country to help development.   “Timor’s preference is that the pipeline will be brought to Timor,” he told Reuters by telephone.

999,COP,"UPDATE 3-Oil major Total expands in Libya, buys Marathon's Waha stake for $450 mln","LONDON/TUNIS (Reuters) - French energy company Total (TOTF.PA) substantially raised its presence in Libya with the purchase of a 16.33 percent stake in Libya’s Waha concessions from U.S. Marathon Oil (MRO.N) for $450 million on Friday. The deal will give Total access to reserves and resources in excess of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with immediate production of around 50,000 boe/d (per day) and “significant exploration potential” in concessions in the Sirte Basin, the company said in a statement.  “This acquisition is in line with Total’s strategy to reinforce its portfolio with high quality and low-technical cost assets whilst bolstering our historic strength in the Middle East and North Africa region,” said Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne.  Total has been in Libya for decades and holds a production share of 31,500 boe/d in 2017 from concessions in the offshore Al Jurf field and the onshore Sharara field. It also has a share in Mabruk field, which has been closed for several years because of poor security. The Waha Oil Company, a subsidiary of Libya’s state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC), currently produces 300,000 boe/d, which is expected to rise to 400,000 boe/d by the end of the decade, Total said. Other Waha stakeholders are NOC with 59.18 percent, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) with 16.33 percent and Hess (HES.N) with 8.16 percent. The oil industry in OPEC member Libya has staged a partial recovery after being hit by blockades and armed conflict following an uprising seven years ago.  National production dropped to lows of about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), before rebounding to 1 million bpd last summer. It is still well under the 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing before 2011, and the industry has suffered continuing stoppages including the current closure of the southwestern El Feel field due to a protest by guards.  Waha is one of Libya’s main export grades. It is shipped from the eastern port of Es Sider, which was blockaded by an armed faction between 2014 and 2016. Es Sider and other ports in Libya’s Oil Crescent are now controlled by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which allowed the NOC to reopen them in late 2016. Waha’s chairman said in November that the company was aiming to increase output to 375,000 bpd by the end of 2018, but faced major funding shortfalls and challenges in maintaining damaged infrastructure.   “Production and reserves growth is a key deal driver,” Woodmac VP for Corporate Analysis Luke Parker said. “There’s certainly upside from where we are today ... Realising this upside would see Total create significant value through the deal.” Marathon's sale marks a full exit from Libya, a move it has been considering since at least mid-2013 but has been prevented from doing so by the NOC. [here] “Our relentless focus on portfolio management has driven seven country exits since 2013 and generated proceeds of over $4 billion just in the last two years,” said Lee Tillman, Marathon president and CEO. In a regulatory filing in 2011, Marathon valued the Waha asset at $761 million. At the time, oil prices LCOc1 were roughly double where they stand today. Brent was trading above $63 a barrel on Friday. [here]  “They received what we consider a pretty good price for the asset given that it was considered non-core,” said Jason Gammel, equity analyst at U.S. investment bank Jefferies. He said Total were “probably better able to manage the geopolitical risk of a wide-base of operations across the Middle East.”  The Marathon sale marks the second exit for a U.S. company from Libya in recent years.  Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) sold a 7 percent stake in the Nafoura oilfield to Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) in late 2016.

1003,COP,UPDATE 1-Cenovus seeks partner for C$1.3 bln Narrows Lake project -sources,"TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) is seeking a partner to fund C$1.3 billion ($993.1 million) in costs to build the supporting infrastructure at its Narrows Lake oil sands project in Alberta, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The Canadian energy firm has been seeking to raise billions to reduce its debt burden after it spent C$17 billion on acquiring oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips (COP.N) last year. To counter shareholder concern about that deal, which doubled the company’s size but strained its financial position, Cenovus has been cutting jobs and costs and selling assets. It  raised nearly C$4 billion from divestments in 2017 and is eyeing further sales from its Deep Basin position this year. To avoid placing further stress on its balance sheet, Cenovus hopes to secure the funds to build infrastructure supporting the first phase of Narrows Lake from an outside partner, which would finance construction in exchange for a long-term agreement with Cenovus to utilize the assets. The first phase of Narrows Lake is expected to produce up to 65,000 barrels of oil per day, according to Cenovus’ website. The company has already spent around C$700 million to advance the project, and expects it will cost a further C$1.6 billion to C$1.9 billion to get the site ready for production, according to the sources, who declined to be named as the information is private.  Cenovus declined to comment for this story. Cenovus earlier this month hired Credit Suisse and RBC Capital Markets as advisers on the Narrows Lake infrastructure fundraising, and a teaser document outlining the proposal has been sent to potentially interested parties, the people said.  Credit Suisse declined to comment. RBC Capital Markets did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Both strategic names and private equity firms could be interested in funding the Narrows Lake infrastructure. Such assets have attracted significant investor interest in recent years, drawn by the stable cash flows they generate. The Narrows Lake fundraising is happening at the same time as Cenovus is preparing to market a number of assets in its Deep Basin position. The company has hired BMO Capital Markets and TD Securities to each sell a separate upstream asset in the Deep Basin, the two sources said. TD declined to comment. BMO did not immediately provide a comment. This is in addition to a move late last year to appoint CIBC Capital Markets to divest gas assets in the area deemed non-core by Cenovus.

1009,COP,UPDATE 3-Cenovus ropes in oil industry veteran from Husky Energy as CFO,"(Updates share move, adds analyst comments) By Ahmed Farhatha April 5 (Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Cenovus Energy Inc said on Thursday it named Jon McKenzie chief financial officer, bringing in an industry veteran who most recently helped rival Husky Energy Inc rein in costs and strengthen its finances. Cenovus shares rose as much as 7 percent to hit a two-month high of C$12.45 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. McKenzie joined Husky as CFO in 2015 and was tasked with bringing down costs as oil prices hit record lows. The company restored its cash dividend as cost-cutting measures started to pay off amid a recovery in crude prices. Cenovus, which is in the middle of its own cost-cutting drive, will benefit from McKenzie’s expertise, analysts said. “For Cenovus, (hiring McKenzie) removes uncertainty and probably fills the role with somebody who investors are familiar with,” analyst Michael Dunn at GMP Securities said. Chief Executive Officer Alex Pourbaix, who took charge in October last year, has been cutting jobs and lowering operating expenses, following a purchase last year of ConocoPhillips’ Canadian assets that was criticized by shareholders. McKenzie will replace Ivor Ruste, who will retire later this month. Before Husky, McKenzie worked at Irving Oil Ltd and Suncor Energy Inc. “His broad experience in the energy industry will be an asset to the company as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and lowering our cost structure,” Cenovus Chief Executive Officer Alex Pourbaix said in a statement. Husky Energy named Controller Jeff Hart as interim CFO and said it would update on its five-year plan and 2022 targets at its 2018 Investor Day to be held next month. The company is facing provincial and federal charges related to a July 2016 pipeline leak that spilled oil into a river in Western Canada.

1010,COP,"UPDATE 3-Exxon, Qatar in talks for potential U.S. shale gas deal - report","(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is in talks with Qatar over a possible deal that could see the country investing in the company’s U.S. shale gas resources, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal could take the shape of a joint venture in which Qatar, through state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], could partner or invest in future wells with Exxon's XTO Energy subsidiary, the newspaper said on.wsj.com/2HoPiyj. The newspaper said no deal had been finalized yet and talks could collapse. The newspaper did not say how much Qatar was planning to invest in XTO Energy. If the deal takes shape as described, it would be the first time a Middle Eastern country invested significantly in a U.S. shale-related project. Exxon, which is targeting Qatar for additional investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects reut.rs/2qn9FUr, already partners with Qatar Petroleum in Cyprus and Brazil. Exxon spokeswoman Rebecca Arnold declined to comment on the newspaper’s report. A representative for Qatar Petroleum was not immediately available to comment. Mohammed Saleh Al Sada, Qatar’s minister of energy and economy, declined to comment on the newspaper’s report when asked by Reuters at an industry event in India. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday. The shale revolution in the United States has not only seen a huge rise in crude production, but also in gas output. Exxon, already the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, said earlier this year it is aiming to triple production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025. For Qatar, which is locked in a dispute with Saudi Arabia,  the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, the move could help broaden its investments outside the Middle East.  Qatar is one of the smallest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and also one of the most influential players in the global LNG market due to its annual production of 77 million tonnes, cementing its position as the world’s largest LNG supplier. Qatar Petroleum is majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) holding smaller stakes.

1015,COP,"UPDATE 1-Libya examines Total-Marathon purchase, casting doubt on deal -sources","TUNIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Libya is considering whether to intervene in a $450 million deal that French major Total (TOTF.PA) announced last month to buy a Marathon Oil (MRO.N) stake in the country’s Waha concessions, several sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Officials were considering a range of options ranging from pushing for better terms - after some in the oil industry and the media said the price was too low - to a counter-offer from the state National Oil Corporation (NOC), the sources said.  “The NOC wants to buy the Total part,” one source from the leadership of Libya’s internationally recognized government, the Presidency Council (PC), said. He added that officials were examining the value of the 16.33 percent Waha share with a view to possibly raising funds for a counter offer with money from Libya’s $67 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA). “They think of the LIA as a potential financier ... LIA is exploring it, the process is just starting,” the source said Libya had not given the required formal approval to the Total-Marathon deal, meaning it could be blocked, the source added.     NOC confirmed in a statement on Monday that it was “discussing arrangements” over Marathon’s “planned sale” with the PC. “Any transaction of this nature must have the approval of NOC and the Libyan authorities,” it said in a statement. The Libyan Investment Authority did not immediately provide a response. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters at an industry event in Paris on Thursday that the deal was all but settled. “The transaction is closed,” Pouyanne said. “There are some discussions on some fiscal issues with the government, but it will be done.”   A spokeswoman for Marathon Oil said the company had already received payment for the sale of its share. A Libyan oil source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that at least some within the NOC found the price Total was paying too low. The deal was “still under consideration and negotiations between many parties here in Tripoli”, a second oil Libyan oil source said. NOC holds a 59.18 percent stake in Waha Oil Co. Other stakeholders are ConocoPhillips (COP.N) with 16.33 percent and Hess (HES.N) with 8.16 percent. Waha’s output of 300,000 boe/d is expected to rise to 400,000 boe/d by the end of the decade, according to production figures given by Total when it announced the deal in early March. Total said the deal would give it access to reserves and resources in excess of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with immediate production of around 50,000 boe/d (per day) and “significant exploration potential” in concessions in the Sirte Basin. The stake carries production risks - a Waha pipeline has been hit twice in the past four months by suspected attacks, most recently on Saturday. But it also gives Total a presence at fields in eastern Libya, where most of the country’s oil resources lie. Total already had stakes in the giant southwestern Sharara field, and the offshore Al Jurf field along the Tunisian border. Libya has been split between rival military factions and governments based in the west and east of the country since 2014. The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) has allowed the NOC in Tripoli to operate facilities on LNA territory, while opposing the internationally recognized government in the capital.  The Waha concessions, granted decades ago, are governed by a law that stipulates that Libya’s oil ministry must approve the deal, the Presidency Council source said. Since the oil ministry is not currently operational, that power falls to the Presidency Council, he said, though the NOC has previously disputed the Council’s attempts to take over oil ministry powers. Any acquisition should deliver the “best possible outcome for all the Libyan people, taking into account Libya’s security situation, fiscal position and external investment requirements”, the NOC said.

1017,COP,UPDATE 2-PDVSA ordered to pay Conoco $2 bln after Venezuela oil nationalization -arbitration,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - An international arbitration court has ordered Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA to pay ConocoPhillips  $2.04 billion for early dissolution of two joint ventures for producing oil in the OPEC-member country, the U.S. firm said on Wednesday. Conoco’s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007 following a nationalization of the country’s oil industry led by late President Hugo Chavez. The firm left the nation after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. The arbitration decision, released by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which has no means of enforcing its decisions, is considered by the U.S. company a first step in a series of legal actions to receive compensation for the expropriation of its assets in Venezuela.  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.  Venezuela’s cash-constrained economy, almost completely dependent on oil exports, is in the grip of deep recession with hyperinflation and severe shortages of medicine and food. Its ability to pay has also been hurt by U.S. sanctions imposed on the country and PDVSA.  Conoco said it would pursue enforcement and seek financial recovery of its award but did not elaborate. Other companies seeking compensation from Venezuela have tried to enforce awards through various foreign courts. “The ruling upholds the contractual protections to which ConocoPhillips is entitled,” said Janet Langford Carrig, the Houston-based company’s general counsel who called the expropriation “unlawful.” Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for the broken contracts and loss of future profits from the Hamaca and Petrozuata oil projects. The agreements with PDVSA had price formulas that limited the compensation Conoco could claim.     A separate arbitration case by Conoco against Venezuela before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) introduced in 2007 could issue a final decision later this year, a lawyer close to the case said. A partial decision by ICSID in 2013, which declared the takeover unlawful, is considered by Conoco a “positive step” toward receiving more compensation for its Venezuela assets. ExxonMobil Corp, also brought two separate arbitration claims before ICSID and the ICC following the 2007 nationalization of its projects in Venezuela. The company last year sought to enforce a $1.6 billion ICSID award after an annulment committee threw out nearly all of the arbitration decision that concerned one of two projects, reducing the payout to $188.3 million.

1020,COP,Railways ready to ease oil transport headaches: Canada's Cenovus,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) expects Canada’s railways to be able to carry more oil in the second half of this year, easing transport bottlenecks and allowing it to stick to previous annual forecasts.  Cenovus, one of the biggest of Canada’s oil sands producers, said in March that it was operating at lower capacity due to the maxing out of pipelines and other routes through which it sends heavy oil south to U.S. markets. Analysts had wondered if that would threaten its previous targets for the full year, but Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix played down any danger and shares rose 6 percent in response. “Despite the temporary pullback in production in the first quarter, we still expect our oil sands volumes for the year to be within our original guidance of 364,000 to 382,000 barrels per day,” he told a conference call with analysts. “I’m really confident that as we move into the second half this year and into the first half of 2019, we’re going to be seeing very material volumes of oil moving by rail,” he added. Railways are producers’ second best option for hauling crude to the United States after pipelines but have so far been reluctant to sign the short-term contracts the oil industry favors.  Pourbaix said that railway operators have hired and are training crew to handle crude shipments and have “indicated that  they’re reactivating a fair amount of locomotives.” The transport bottlenecks have increased the discount buyers take for Canadian oil over U.S. light crude CLc1 and Cenovus said its differentials averaged $24.28 per barrel in the first quarter, a 67 percent jump when compared with last year. That in turn hurt profit per barrel. Netbacks, profit after subtracting transport and other expenses, averaged C$16.80 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with C$21.25 a year earlier. Cenovus’ total oil sands production, however, jumped to 359,666 barrels per day in the quarter, from 181,501 barrels per day, a year earlier. “Investor attention increasingly appears to be migrating toward a much more constructive 2019 outlook,” said Raymond James analyst Chris Cox. The company posted a loss of C$914 million ($711 million), or 74 Canadian cents per share. Adjusting for some operations the company shut, the quarterly loss was 40 Canadian cents per share, while analysts on average expected a loss of 16 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were trading at C$12.89 Wednesday afternoon, up 5.74 percent.

1022,COP,"ConocoPhillips profit tops estimates on rising oil prices, cost cuts","HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the world’s largest independent oil and gas exploration and production company, posted a bigger-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by rising crude prices CLc1 and cost cuts. Results at Conoco, like many of its peers, have steadily improved in recent quarters alongside commodity prices and as better technology makes operations more efficient.  Conoco’s stock has risen as the company has prioritized cost cuts and asset sales over production increases. The Houston-based company generated more cash in the first quarter than its capital budget and shareholder payouts, an accomplishment feted by analysts. Shares are up about 21 percent so far this year, outpacing the S&P; 500 Energy Index .SPNY, which has gained about 3 percent since January. The stock’s biggest increase came after the company boosted its share buyback and dividend in February.  Conoco’s stock closed 2.9 percent higher at $66.97. “We’re maintaining our discipline and following our game plan,” Chief Financial Officer Don Wallette told investors on a conference call.        Earnings rose to $888 million, or 75 cents per share, compared to $586 million, or 47 cents, in the year-ago quarter.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 96 cents per share, exceeding the 73 cents expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Doug Terreson, an oil industry analyst with Evercore ISI, said the results reflected a “positive surprise” and were an indication that energy companies can generate healthy profits even when prioritizing shareholder returns.     Production fell 23 percent to 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) as a result of recent asset sales. Conoco’s U.S. shale operations, which made money after losing cash for more than a year, are now profitable at oil prices CLc1 under $45 per barrel, more than $20 below current levels. “We’re seeing the earnings power of our unconventional operations driving our overall portfolio,” Wallette said.     Conoco kept its 2018 capital budget at $5.5 billion, but raised its production outlook slightly and now expects to pump 1.2 million to 1.24 million boe/d this year.     Conoco said on Wednesday an international arbitration court ordered Venezuela’s state-run oil company, PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], to pay it $2.04 billion for early dissolution of two joint ventures. “We intend to be aggressive and persistent” in recovering the award, Wallette said. “It’s something that’s going to take time to recover, the value that we lost.”  Rivals Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) report results on Friday.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government called the award a “tough lesson” given it was less than 10 percent of what Conoco originally sought. It also said it may appeal Wednesday’s ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA.  Conoco filed suit on Thursday in the U.S. District court in Manhattan seeking to enforce the award, saying the court had jurisdiction because the ICC arbitration was held in New York and PDVSA had not responded to a demand for payment.   Conoco’s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007 following nationalization of the country’s oil industry led by then-President Hugo Chavez.

1028,COP,UPDATE 3-Conoco sues to enforce $2 bln award that Venezuela scorns,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Thursday scorned a $2.04 billion award to ConocoPhillips (COP.N) over a decade-old nationalization as the U.S. oil producer filed suit in a federal court to enforce the decision. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government called the award a “tough lesson” given it was less than 10 percent of what Conoco originally sought. It also said it may appeal Wednesday’s ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA.  Conoco filed suit on Thursday in the U.S. District court in Manhattan seeking to enforce the award, saying the court had jurisdiction because the ICC arbitration was held in New York and PDVSA had not responded to a demand for payment.   Conoco’s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007 following nationalization of the country’s oil industry led by then-President Hugo Chavez. The firm left the OPEC nation after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. The ICC has no means of enforcing its decisions. “We intend to be aggressive and persistent” in recovering the award, Conoco Chief Financial Officer Don Wallette told investors on a Thursday conference call. “It’s something that’s going to take time to recover, the value that we lost.”  Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for broken contracts and loss of future profits from the Hamaca and Petrozuata oil projects. The agreements with PDVSA contained price formulas that limited the compensation Conoco could claim. A separate arbitration case by Conoco against Venezuela before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) introduced in 2007 could result in a final decision later this year, a lawyer close to the case said. Conoco’s Wallette said the company hopes the ICSID award, which is not subject to price formula limitations, “will represent a full compensation for our value lost.” The case is Phillips Petroleum Co v Petroleos de Venezuela, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-cv-3716 ",4272018,http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-conocophillips/update-3-conoco-sues-to-enforce-2-bln-award-that-venezuela-scorns-idUSL1N1S31DM
1029,COP,"UPDATE 1-Indonesia's president aims new broadside at Pertamina, 'convoluted' energy rules","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday slammed state-owned oil firm Pertamina, saying it hadn’t invested enough in exploration, while blasting red tape hobbling the industry and urging investors to report problematic rules to him directly. Widodo’s comments come after the government in April sacked Pertamina’s chief executive after repeated clashes with the government over fuel price controls estimated to have cost the firm some $1.4 billion from January to September last year. “What often makes me shake my head in the oil and gas sector, for example, is Pertamina,” said Widodo, speaking at the opening of the annual Indonesia Petroleum Association (IPA) conference. “Since the 1970s there has never been major exploration. What is going on?” In response, Denny Tampubolon, Pertamina’s senior vice president for upstream business development, said the company would increase exploration, noting that the state company now  does most of the exploration drilling in Indonesia. GRAPHIC - Indonesia's shrinking oil output: reut.rs/2KefCMT Tampubolon referred to extensive geological surveys and high-risk wells costing hundreds of millions of dollars.  Pertamina plans to drill 20 exploration wells this year, up from 15 last year, but its discoveries are often limited because it is largely operating in mature fields, Tampubolon said.  Pertamin’s oil and gas production increased to 7 percent to 693,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) in 2017, partly as a result of overseas investments.  Indonesia was once a major crude oil producer and exporter, and a member of the producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with output reaching more than 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 1995.  But at that time Indonesia’s exploration and development was dominated by international oil majors. Since then an uncertain  regulatory environment and a lack of investment to find new reserves have turned Indonesia into a net oil importer.   International firms such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron have reduced holdings, and the nation’s overall crude output now stands well below 1 million bpd.  Private investment in the oil and gas sector slumped to a multi-year low of $9.3 billion in 2017, compared to a target of $13.8 billion, according to BMI Research.  Widodo said on Monday he had directed the country’s Energy and Mineral Resources Minister to “axe as many regulations as possible” in an effort to improve investment. “I need to remind our ministries that our regulations are not conducive (to investment). They are still convoluted, there’s still a lot of procedures and they’re still complicated,” he said.  “I want to know which regulations are still creating headaches,” he added. “Please report to me or the minister.” Hoping to attract more investment, Jakarta recently eliminated a raft of regulations and introduced tax breaks and a gross split mechanism for production sharing contracts. In Indonesia, investors expect contracts that support operating performance, competitive financial value and revenue, Chevron said in a statement on Wednesday.  “It’s very clear the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry has received industry input and strengthened provisions to improve the competitiveness of this scheme,” Chevron IndoAsia business unit director Chuck Taylor said, referring to gross split contracts.  Indonesia announced four winners from five blocks in a direct offer tender on Wednesday, including Lion Energy and units of ENI and Repsol. Interest in Indonesia’s tenders has been tepid, though, and the industry has pointed to more attractive opportunities in other countries.  Investors have also criticized Jakarta’s decision to hand exploration and development rights on expiring oil blocks to Pertamina in compensation for its losses on government-set retail fuel prices.

1031,COP,Conoco moves to take over Venezuelan PDVSA's Caribbean assets -sources,"HOUSTON, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips has moved to take  Caribbean assets of Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award over a decade-oil nationalization of its projects in the South American country, according to two sources familiar with its actions. The U.S. firm targeted Caribbean facilities on the islands of Bonaire and St. Eustatius that play critical roles in PDVSA’s oil exports, the country’s main source of revenue. PDVSA relies on the terminals to process, store and blend its oil. “We will work with the community and local authorities to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions,” ConocoPhillips said in a statement to Reuters.

1032,COP,New attachment order by Conoco expected in Curacao in coming days -sources,"HOUSTON, May 7 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips is expected to renew an effort to temporarily take control of Venezuela’s PDVSA oil inventories at the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery in Curacao in the coming days, according to sources close to the state-run firm’s operations in the Caribbean. The U.S. oil company last week took PDVSA oil inventories and assets in Bonaire and St. Eustatius to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award by the International Chamber of Commerce. It tried to do the same using an ICC April ruling in Curacao, but the orders were rejected on that island because of improper wording, sources said. Conoco’s legal maneuvering temporarily retains assets - from oil inventories, to cargoes and facilities - and could give Conoco the ability to sell them.

1033,COP,Conoco says to maintain legal actions until PDVSA pays $2 billion award,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said on Thursday it would continue enforcing legal actions against Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] until it receives a payment to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award recently issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The U.S. oil firm’s actions so far have included the seizure of oil inventories and assets in the Caribbean islands where PDVSA operates. The measures have forced the state-run company to halt storage and shipping from at least four terminals, creating a bottleneck of tankers around its Venezuelan ports. “We look forward to hearing PDVSA’s proposals to resolve this matter. But absent any agreement and payment of the ICC award, we will continue our enforcement actions,” said Janet Langford Carrig, Conoco’s general counsel.
