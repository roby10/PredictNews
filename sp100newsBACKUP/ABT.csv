1,ABT,"Doctors overuse heart treatment, despite guidelines","NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The controversial use of stents days after a heart attack has continued unabated in the United States, even after a landmark study and new guidelines said the pricey therapy does not help patients.  Just over half of patients who have survived at least 24 hours after a heart attack will have a stent — a small metal mesh tube — placed to open a blocked coronary artery, and that rate has not changed from 2005 through 2008.  The findings add to concerns about overuse of the heart devices, made by companies such as Boston Scientific, Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic Inc and Johnson & Johnson.  Stenting procedures cost the United States about $12 billion every year, and researchers say it is time doctors take responsibility for the nation’s spiraling health costs.  “I think physicians have to rise to the challenge,” said Dr. Judith Hochman, a cardiologist at New York University, who led the new work.  In 2006, Hochman published a study known as the Occluded Artery Trial showing that stents did not prevent any deaths or new heart attacks compared with drugs alone when inserted more than 24 hours after a heart attack into a totally blocked artery.  While the people who got stents did not experience any more side effects, the devices did rack up an extra $7,000 in net cost per person after two years, Hochman later found.  “After a day or so, whatever damage is going to be done was done already,” she told Reuters Health. “The message is to seek medical care soon after a heart attack, and that is when stenting really helps.”  Hochman’s results became part of revised guidelines from the American Heart Association and other groups in 2007, which recommend against using stents more than 24 hours after a heart attack in stable patients.  Her new study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine (bit.ly/7qXyI), is based on nearly 29,000 patients seen at 896 U.S. hospitals.  It shows that neither the 2006 trial nor the revised guidelines had a noticeable effect on stent use.  “Overall there was no change in practice,” Hochman said. “I expected to see a change, so it was a big surprise and a disappointment.”  Hochman’s findings apply to about 100,000 Americans a year, suggesting that about 50,000 people are having the $20,000 procedure done unnecessarily every year.  That is in addition to thousands of stents inserted outside the context of emergencies such as a heart attack, according to a study from last week showing at least one in 12 of those procedures probably leads to more harm than benefit.  Each year in the United States, about 600,000 stents are inserted into ailing hearts where they prop open blocked arteries.  The stenting procedure, called percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, carries risks of complications like major bleeding or tears in the heart. After leaving the hospital, people also need to take clot-busting medications, which further increase the chance of bleeds.  Studies have found that many doctors rush to do PCI before using medications that might help stable patients just as well.  In an editorial, Dr. Mauro Moscucci of the University of Miami said Hochman’s study had inadequate information about the severity of heart attacks, which might have justified the use of stenting in some cases.  Still, he said, it would have been reasonable to expect a reduction in the frequency of late stenting.  “While the debate on health care reform is ongoing, health care expenditures in the United States are continuing to escalate,” Moscucci said.  “Thus we must heed the call to professional responsibility aimed at the elimination of tests and treatments that do not result in any benefit for our patients, and for which the net effect will be added costs, waste, and possible harm.”  Another study in the same journal, published Monday along with Hochman’s report, shows it is not uncommon to see new and better research challenge established conventions and treatments.  In that study, as many as 16 of the reports that appeared in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, a leading medical publication, contradicted current practice.  But according to Hochman, getting doctors to drop a new treatment may be harder than getting them to take it up — whether that’s due to strongly held beliefs about its effectiveness, worries about medical liability or losing money, or patient expectations.  “We need a lot of changes in the system to control cost and this is just one example,” she said.

3,ABT,FDA proposes targeted drug testing guidelines,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Targeted drugs or therapies up for U.S. regulatory approval would have to be reviewed simultaneously with the diagnostic devices they rely on, according to a proposed policy issued on Tuesday.  So-called targeted treatments or personalized medicines are tailored to a person’s genetic makeup and are being increasingly developed by drug companies.  The Food and Drug Administration proposed rules saying these personalized treatments would gain approval only after their accompanying diagnostic devices also receive approval — unless the treatment is for a serious or life-threatening condition.  Diagnostic tests, known as companion diagnostics, improve the effectiveness of targeted treatments by determining if a patient is a genetic fit with a therapy. They can help doctors identify which patients are most likely to benefit from a new drug, or experience debilitating side effects, and help save enormous cost by eliminating people who would not be helped.  Pfizer’s experimental drug crizotinib, for example, is designed to target a specific genetic mutation prevalent in nonsmokers with non-small cell lung cancer. Crizotinib, which is being reviewed on a priority basis by U.S. regulators, has a companion test developed by Abbott Laboratories, which partnered with Pfizer about two years ago.  The FDA’s proposed rules outlined only two exceptions when a new targeted drug or therapy could receive approval without FDA also approving its companion diagnostic.  One is for new treatments of serious or life-threatening conditions that have no other satisfactory treatments and only if the new treatment shows “pronounced” benefits that outweigh the risks. The second is for labeling changes to already-approved therapies to address safety concerns.  The FDA is now seeking public comment on the proposal.

5,ABT,Gilead kickstarts patent pool for AIDS drugs,"LONDON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences, the leading maker of HIV drugs, is to share intellectual property rights on its medicines in a patent pool designed to make treatments more widely available to the poor.  The California-based group is the first drugmaker to sign up to the new Medicines Patent Pool, whose organizers now expect other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to join the initiative.  Ellen ‘t Hoen, the pool’s executive director, told Reuters she was negotiating terms for similar deals with ViiV Healthcare — a GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer joint venture — as well as with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim and Sequoia Pharmaceuticals.  “This is not just a one-off. The whole field is changing ... there will be more to follow,” she said.  Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Most live in Africa and Asia, where medicines have to be very cheap to allow those who need them to be able to afford them.  The Medicines Patent Pool, launched by the UNITAID health financing system that is funded by a tax on airline tickets, aims to address this problem by creating a system for patent holders to license technology to makers of cheap generics in exchange for modest royalties.  In the case of Gilead, the agreement allows for the production of generic copies of tenofovir, emtricitabine, cobicistat and elvitegravir, as well as a combination of these products in a single HIV pill known as the “Quad.”  Significantly, cobicistat, elvitegravir and the Quad are still in clinical development, and their inclusion in the deal should speed the flow of new treatments in poor countries.  “Through systematic licensing of intellectual property related to HIV products, people in developing countries will have access to low-cost versions of those products almost at the same time that people in rich countries do,” ‘t Hoen said.  Traditionally, patients in developing countries have to wait for years before they can get access to new drugs.  Gilead will receive a 3 percent royalty on generic sales of tenofovir, which is also approved for use in hepatitis B, and 5 percent on the other products.  The licenses will allow for the supply of tenofovir and emtricitabine in 111 countries, for cobicistat in 102 countries, and for elvitegravir and the Quad in 99 countries.  Assuming other companies come on board, the patent pool could save poor countries more than $1 billion a year in drug costs.  But the revenue stream to Gilead and other patent holders is likely to be small, since generic drug prices in Africa could be just 1 or 2 percent of those in high-income countries.  The decision by Gilead and others to work with UNITAID on the new patent pool marks an evolution in thinking by Big Pharma toward the thorny problem of drug access in the developing world.  Ten years ago, the world’s pharmaceutical industry took a very different stance when it sued South Africa over legislation that was passed by former President Nelson Mandela and which favored generics.  That battle proved a public relations disaster, and since then individual companies have struck a series of voluntary licensing deals, allowing generic copies of HIV products on a case-by-case basis.  The patent pool system, however, goes beyond this by providing an effective “one-stop shop” for generic firms to secure rights to manufacture patent-protected drugs.  The U.S. National Institutes of Health became the first organization to sign up to the pool last September. The concept has been harder for some drugmakers to swallow.  ViiV, for example, was initially unwilling to consider pooling its patents — and Abbott Laboratories, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson have yet to enter formal negotiations, although ‘t Hoen said her team was now discussing the idea with all three companies.

6,ABT,UPDATE 3-Rebounding J&J; drugs seen as new growth driver," * Q2 EPS $1.28/share tops $1.24/share forecast   * Q2 sales rise 8.3 pct to $16.6 bln, above forecast   * Weak dollar, lower taxes bolster results   * Company sticks to 2012 view, despite Q2 profit beat   * Shares fall about 1 pct in afternoon trading  (Adds CEO, analyst comments, details on results)   By Ransdell Pierson   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - An emerging turnaround for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) prescription drugs will likely accelerate company sales growth for the rest of the year and bolster earnings over the long term, company officials said after J&J reported better-than-expected quarterly results.   “Their pharmaceuticals business is really starting to take off after the launch a whole host of new drugs that are getting a lot of traction,” Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas said. “The business is now in a very much better position than any of its peers.”   The drug division has been the company’s Achilles heel in recent years, dragging down results due to generic competition for schizophrenia treatment Risperdal and the anticonvulsant Topamax. But it is on the rebound thanks to strong sales growth of other medicines, including arthritis treatment Remicade, and demand for newer treatments for arthritis, psoriasis, prostate cancer and blood clots.   Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG NOVN.VX also released forecast-beating second-quarter sales on Tuesday, helped by its own new products. Its shares rose 3 percent.   J&J, whose earnings beat was largely due to lower taxes and the weak dollar, fell 1 percent in afternoon trading.   Company results also reflected stabilizing sales of over-the-counter medicines that have been repeatedly recalled in the past two years.   It was the first time the consumer medicines have scored sales gains since early 2010. Many of J&J’s best-known brands, including Tylenol and Motrin painkillers and Rolaids antacid, have been frequently recalled since late 2009 due to quality-control lapses at three plants in the United States and Puerto Rico.   Global sales of J&J prescription drugs jumped 12.2 percent to $6.23 billion in the quarter. Sales of consumer products, including over-the-counter drugs, rose 4 percent to $3.79 billion.   Although prescription drugs dominated the earnings report and will drive future company growth, analysts said the company’s medical device business will likely limp along due to the still-weak global economy.   J&J earned $2.78 billion, or $1.00 per share, compared with $3.45 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the year-earlier period.   Excluding special items, it earned $1.28 per share — topping the average forecast of $1.24 per share among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Company sales jumped 8.3 percent to $16.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations of $16.23 billion. They would have risen only 2.6 percent if not for the weaker dollar.   Despite the profit and sales beats in the quarter, J&J stuck to its full-year profit view of $4.90 to $5 per share. That would reflect growth of up to 5 percent from last year’s results.   Company Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said the company was taking a cautious forecasting approach, despite hopes for accelerating sales growth.   “There’s still a sort of uncertainty that overhangs market growth,” he told analysts in a conference call, noting many patients have held back on purchases and elective surgical procedures because of economic conditions.   J&J’s other major business, medical devices and diagnostics, saw sales rise 7.2 percent to $6.57 billion, mostly because of the weaker dollar. Higher demand for surgical-care products, diabetes-care brands and contact lenses offset lower sales of J&J’s stents used to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of plaque.   J&J said last month it will stop selling drug-coated heart stents, a former profit driver for the company that has stumbled due to safety concerns and fierce competition.   It said it would end development of its Nevo heart stent and stop making its Cypher stent, ceding the field to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N). J&J will continue, however, to sell its far less-lucrative bare metal stents.   J&J shares were down 55 cents at $66.54 in afternoon trading.

8,ABT,"Abbott profit buoyed by Humira, emerging markets","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) reported higher second-quarter profit, fueled by strong sales growth in emerging markets and demand for its Humira arthritis drug.  Net earnings rose 50 percent to $1.94 billion, or $1.23 per share, thanks to a $519 million gain from the resolution of U.S. and international tax issues, the company said on Wednesday.  Excluding special items, profit was $1.12 per share, a penny above the average forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “It was a solid quarter, but not a blowout quarter. They didn’t blow the numbers away,” said Michael Liss, senior portfolio manager of the American Century Value Fund.  Humira, as usual, was the standout product. Its global sales rose 25 percent to $2 billion despite stiff competition from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Remicade and Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) Enbrel. The drugs treat rheumatoid arthritis by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.  “Humira continues to be a huge factor for Abbott and we expect it to keep growing strongly over the next few years,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.  The injectable drug, already one of the world’s top-selling medicines, should eventually capture annual revenue of $11 billion due to its potency and relatively infrequent dosing, Conover said.  Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned, however, that Abbott may have become too dependent on Humira, and that a novel new treatment being developed by Pfizer could pose a big threat to Abbott’s cash cow.  Abbott shares fell 0.9 percent to $52.42 in midday trading, amid a moderate decline for other U.S. drugmakers.  Abbott raised its full-year profit forecast slightly, to between $4.58 and $4.68 per share, based on favorable results so far this year. That would reflect growth of up to 12.2 percent from last year. The suburban Chicago drugmaker previously forecast $4.54 to $4.64 per share.  Global second-quarter sales rose 9 percent to $9.62 billion, a bit higher than Wall Street expectations for $9.57 billion. Sales would have risen only 4.4 percent if not for the weaker dollar, which boosts the value of sales in overseas markets.

10,ABT,PREVIEW-Report could sway U.S. FDA device review process," * Institute of Medicine report due out Friday   * FDA requested medical device unit review   * Changes to accelerated approval process a top issue   By Andrew Seaman   WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The Institute of Medicine is poised to advise the U.S. drug regulator how it can refine its medical device approval process to get products to market quickly while protecting patients.   The Food and Drug Administration requested the IOM report as part of Commissioner Margaret Hamburg’s vow to improve the FDA’s device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover and funding woes.   Friday’s report by the influential nonprofit organization is expected to address some of the more contentious changes proposed by FDA to the accelerated device approval process, known as the 510(k) program.   Critics say the accelerated 510(k) process is too widely used and leads to inadequate testing for some risky devices, but it is defended by industry as necessary to speed technologies to patients.   Nearly a year ago the FDA proposed changes to the program, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.

11,ABT,UPDATE 1-US FTC conditions Perrigo's buy of Paddock Labs," * Deal is worth $540 million   * Approval conditioned on no ‘pay for delay’ for AndroGel   * FTC has been battling ‘pay for delay’ deals for years   WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust regulators approved generic drug maker Perrigo Co’s PRGO.O proposed buy of privately held Paddock Labs with conditions, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday.   To win approval for the deal, Perrigo agreed to sell six generic drugs to Watson Pharmaceuticals WPI.N, the FTC said.   These drugs include a lotion and a cream for dry, scaly skin, a shampoo to treat seborrheic dermatitis, a suppository to treat allergic reactions and nausea, a steroid to treat moderate psoriasis and a non-steroidal medicine for arthritis in the knee.   In January, Perrigo said it would buy substantially all of the assets of privately held Paddock Labs for $540 million in cash to expand its generic prescription drug portfolio. [ID:nSGE70J0AA]   Also as part of the deal, the FTC said that Perrigo agreed to decline payments from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), which sells the testosterone gel AndroGel, that would give Perrigo an incentive to delay bringing a generic version of AndroGel to market.   The FTC has been battling “pay for delay” settlements for years with mixed success.

12,ABT,RPT-PREVIEW-Report could sway U.S. FDA device review process," (Repeats July 25 item to additional subscribers)   * Institute of Medicine report due out Friday   * FDA requested medical device unit review   * Changes to accelerated approval process a top issue   By Andrew Seaman   WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The Institute of Medicine is poised to advise the U.S. drug regulator how it can refine its medical device approval process to get products to market quickly while protecting patients.   The Food and Drug Administration requested the IOM report as part of Commissioner Margaret Hamburg’s vow to improve the FDA’s device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover and funding woes.   Friday’s report by the influential nonprofit organization is expected to address some of the more contentious changes proposed by FDA to the accelerated device approval process, known as the 510(k) program.   Critics say the accelerated 510(k) process is too widely used and leads to inadequate testing for some risky devices, but it is defended by industry as necessary to speed technologies to patients.   Nearly a year ago the FDA proposed changes to the program, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.   This new category is among the issues the IOM report is expected to address.   “Potentially it could have a big impact on how things will be changed,” said Dr. Gregory Curfman, executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, of the IOM’s report.

13,ABT,U.S. advisers call for new medical device regime,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An advisory group said the U.S. fast-track approval process for medical devices is fatally flawed and should be replaced, but the Food and Drug Administration said the recommendation was a non-starter.  The FDA had asked for the Institute of Medicine report as part of a broad agency review of its device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover, funding woes and major recalls in recent year of devices ranging from artificial hips to heart defibrillators.  The IOM found the fast-track approval process, called 510(k), does not adequately protect patients and recommended a more thorough approval process likely to raise the costs for device makers with pre-market and post-market device reviews.  “What we are recommending is that the 510(k) is fatally flawed in terms of it not evaluating safety and effectiveness of a device,” said Dr. David Challoner, chairman of the IOM’s committee.  But the finding was swiftly rejected by the FDA’s top device official.  “FDA believes that the 510(k) process should not be eliminated, but we are open to additional proposals and approaches for continued improvement of our device review programs,” Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.  The 510(k) program allows medical devices to get to market faster if they are “substantially equivalent” to an existing product.  Critics say the accelerated 510(k) process is too widely used and leads to inadequate testing for some risky devices, but it is defended by the industry as necessary to speed technologies to patients.  The medical device industry has argued for either leaving the 510(k) process as it is or further streamlining the approval process. Most new medical devices — about 4,000 in 2009 — are cleared through the accelerated program.  The FDA has proposed changes, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.  But the IOM committee said the FDA should not waste its limited resources on changing the current program. Instead, the committee said the FDA should focus on developing a new framework.  High-profile incidents include a massive recall last year of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. Some 93,000 patients worldwide had that line of hip implant.  Automated external defibrillators, used in public places such as airports to revive cardiac arrest victims, have also made up a significant portion of 510(k) recalls in recent years.

Medical devices range from simple bandages to complex implants such as pacemakers, stents and artificial knees. Other than Johnson & Johnson, the largest medical-device makers include Medtronic Inc, Boston Scientific Corp and Abbott Laboratories Inc.  The IOM suggested the FDA start collecting information to build the new process, including post-market data for devices. Congress should then enact legislation to design the regulatory framework, according to the report.  “A new system needs to be put in place that will be more effective especially in post-market surveillance,” said Challoner.

SeraCare’s move follows news of its CEO’s departure last week, when it also said third-quarter revenue fell on reduced purchases from a single large customer and expiration of certain government-funded contracts and projects. 	   “I think they were related,” Ladenburg Thalmann & Co’s analyst Kevin Degeeter said.	   “It wasn’t just this quarter. It has been the last two or three quarters where the results have been disappointing from my perspective and that of most investors.”	   SeraCare, which supplies diagnostic control products for HIV, plasma-derived reagents and contract research services, had named CFO Greg Gould as interim CEO in place of Susan Vogt, who held the position for five years.	   Dawson James Securities analyst Robert Wasserman, however, disagrees that the two announcements were related.	   “There are two factors affecting their business that are kind of long-term factors,” Wasserman said.	   “Federal spending is down. The other part is that a lot of people are holding out and not visiting the doctor for small tests that need to be done.”	   Both analysts agree that the company will get other bids, and possibly one from MSMB Capital, higher than the $4.25 per share offered on June 23. 	   SeraCare shares, which have slipped 6 percent since MSMB’s offer, were up 5 percent at $3.99 Monday afternoon on Nasdaq. They touched a high of $4.07 earlier.	   Wasserman sees Abbott Laboratories , Bio Rad Laboratories Inc and Merck KGaA’s unit Millipore Corp as possible suitors for the company, while Ladenburg’s Degeeter sees possible bids from private equity firms too.

18,ABT,Ex-Orioles player settles insider-trading charges,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Baltimore Orioles third baseman Doug DeCinces agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle insider trading charges filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday.  DeCinces, who played mostly third base with the Orioles and the California Angels from 1973 to 1987, was accused along with three associates of reaping more than $1.7 million in illegal profit after receiving confidential information about Abbott Laboratories Inc’s plans to buy Advanced Medical Optics in January 2009.  According to the SEC, which filed its complaint in a Southern California federal court, DeCinces immediately began to buy Advanced Medical Optics shares after learning about the planned acquisition from an employee at the company.  In the weeks leading up to the $1.4 billion takeover, DeCinces allegedly bought 83,700 shares of Advanced Medical Optics through several brokerage accounts, including some in his grandchildren’s names.  When the takeover was announced on January 12, 2009, Advanced Medical Optics stock soared 143 percent, and DeCinces then sold his shares for a $1.3 million profit, the SEC said.  Lawyers for DeCinces did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Also settling SEC charges were DeCinces’ physical therapist Joseph Donohue, who will pay about $113,000 in fines and disgorgement of illegal profit; real estate lawyer Fred Scott Jackson, who will pay roughly $293,000; and businessman Roger Wittenbach, who will pay approximately $422,000.  According to the complaint, Donohue made just over $75,500 after being tipped about the merger, while Jackson made about $140,000 and Wittenbach a little less than $202,000.  Jackson bought some of his shares on a mobile device while eating breakfast with DeCinces, the SEC said.  Lawyers for Donohue, Jackson and Wittenbach also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  None of the defendants admitted wrongdoing.  The SEC did not charge the source of the tip about the takeover. It said the probe is continuing.  “Time and again, we see reputable people engaging in insider trading and risking their good names in order to enrich themselves and those around them,” said Daniel Hawke, the head of the market abuse unit in the SEC’s enforcement division.  “People need to understand that we are watching for suspicious trading activity, and they will pay a heavy price when we catch them insider trading,” he added.  Now 60 and a Laguna Beach, California resident, DeCinces also played briefly in the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals.  In Baltimore, DeCinces succeeded Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson as the starting third baseman.  He was traded to California in 1982, clearing room at third base for Cal Ripken, who would also enter the Hall of Fame. DeCinces ended his career with 237 home runs, 1,505 hits and a .259 batting average.  The case is SEC v. DeCinces et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 11-01168.

20,ABT,Analysis: Battered healthcare stocks ready for rebound,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sharp falls in U.S. healthcare stocks this week — where industry bellwethers dropped as much as 8 percent in one day — were a premature sell-off, analysts say, as the sector’s underlying fundamentals remain strong.  Companies from hospital operator HCA Holdings Inc to drugmaker Pfizer Inc came under pressure before the broader market sell-off on Thursday on concern about possible government cuts to the Medicare health program for the elderly under a new U.S. debt deal.  Analysts say there is potential for some sector stocks to see a rebound of up to 15 percent.  “The reaction by and large is probably overdone,” said Bob Phillips, co-founder of Spectrum Management Group in Indianapolis. “A number of these stocks are still paying great dividends and valuations are incredibly great.”  Healthcare had been the best performing sector during the first half of the year, with healthcare exchange-traded funds and products garnering $859.3 million in net new assets, according to the latest BlackRock ETF industry report.  “Demographically, no matter how you shake it, the population is aging, people will require more healthcare as they age,” Phillips said. “We’re comfortable with the overall sector and think it will do well over the next 10 years, whether the government is the direct payer or not.”  Healthcare providers face the most pressure, given that Medicare costs — which are expected to nearly double in 10 years — are likely to be first on the chopping block as Washington works to trim down its deficit.  “Cutting benefits to Medicare is cutting benefits to providers,” said ETF Digest Editor Dave Fry.  Insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc are two stocks that have been heavily battered, both down about 13 percent from the start of last week. They fell below their key 100-day moving averages for the first time this year, which could set up a healthy rebound in the near term.  “That tends to be a pretty strong level of support,” said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Management in San Francisco. “We’ll probably see a few more days of normal trading here, but the stocks could easily rebound 10 to 15 percent.”  Both companies raised their full-year earnings forecasts. UnitedHealth raised its range by 20 cents to a range of $4.15 to $4.25 per share. Humana raised its range by 60 cents to a range of $7.50 to $7.60 per share.  Analysts at Credit Suisse gave Humana an “outperform” rating this week and said the stock’s dip presents a good buying opportunity, noting it is well-positioned to pass cuts through to providers and members.  The analysts said Humana is trading at nine times their 2012 EPS estimate, UnitedHealth is trading around 11 times their EPS estimate.  “We believe HUM is undervalued considering our estimate for 9 percent organic enrollment growth in the core Medicare Advantage product next year,” the analysts wrote in a note.  Some healthcare product and pharmaceutical companies, which took a hit with the broader sector, have upside potential.  Lip noted that this year’s healthcare rebound followed a substantial dip in the wake of the U.S. healthcare law, which passed early in 2010, and expects a similar pattern now.  “A lot of these stocks sold off because of overall fear. The fact of the matter is they rebounded after that and started hitting new highs,” he said. “We see similar issues here with people selling the news. But after things calm down and are not as bad, we’ll see institutional buyers come back.”  Drug and device makers Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson, both down around 6 percent since mid-July, are attractive stocks to Phillips.  Johnson & Johnson is a potential buy now for 13 times its earnings. The stock had been trading in a range of $65 to $67 since late April. This week it fell as low as $61.05.  The stock is also trending below its 100-day moving average for the first time since mid-April this week. The last time Johnson & Johnson opened below its 100-day moving average, it rose about 6.5 percent within two days.  Phillips said Abbott, with a 14.9 price to earnings ratio, is a “compelling valuation.” A price-to-earnings ratio below 15 is considered attractive for the health sector as it translates to about a 7 percent earnings yield, Phillips said.  Abbott shares were down 6 percent since the start of last week, after gaining 10 percent from the start of the year.  HEALTHCARE ETFs  Since each company will be affected differently by any cuts to healthcare spending, ETFs tracking the broader sector may begin to look more attractive to investors hoping to mitigate company-specific risk by diversifying opportunities.  The iShares Dow Jones Health Care Providers Index Fund had been up about 20 percent since the start of 2011, but dropped about 11 percent over the past week.  The ETF is likely to be under the most pressure because it is solely built upon providers. It tracks 52 stocks and has a 14.1 percent weight in UnitedHealth, its biggest holding, and a 4.6 percent weight in Humana.  The SPDR Health Care Select Sector Fund is a more diversified healthcare ETF, consisting of 54 holdings with 48.7 percent in pharmaceuticals, 19.4 percent in healthcare providers and services, 16.5 percent in healthcare equipment and supplies, among its biggest holdings.  The ETF is down about 8 percent since the start of last week, dipping below its 200-day moving average for the first time this year on Tuesday. The ETF had previously been trading in a high range of $34 to $36, about a 12-percent gain from the start of the year.  “These stocks have been unfairly punished on something that might not even occur,” Baker Avenue’s Lip said. “Nothing is written in stone yet. I think we’ll definitely see a rebound in the short term, or at least more of a technical bounce.”  ",8052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-stocks/analysis-battered-healthcare-stocks-ready-for-rebound-idUSTRE77457K20110805
21,ABT,Scientists find new ovarian cancer gene," LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Women who carry a faulty copy of a gene called RAD51D have an almost one in 11 chance of developing ovarian cancer, scientists said on Sunday in a finding they called the most significant ovarian cancer gene discovery for more than 10 years.	   Tests to identify those at highest risk are expected to be available within a few years, according to Cancer Research UK, and may lead some women to decide to have their ovaries removed in order to beat the disease.	   The finding should also speed the search for new drugs.	   Laboratory experiments already suggest that cells with faulty RAD51D are sensitive to PARP inhibitors - a new class of drugs designed to target cancers caused by faults in two known breast and ovarian cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2.	   Several large drugmakers, including Abbott , Merck  , Pfizer , Sanofi-Aventis and AstraZeneca , are developing PARP inhibitors, which work by blocking DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells, stalling the cell cycle and leading to cell death. 	   Data released in May showed that one of these, AstraZeneca’s olaparib, was able to slow the progression of ovarian cancer in a mid-stage clinical trial. 	   For the latest study, researchers from Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research compared the DNA of women from 911 families with ovarian and breast cancer to DNA from a control group of more than 10,000 people from the general population.	   They found eight faults in the RAD51D gene in women with cancer, compared with only one in the control group.	   “Women with a fault in the RAD51D gene have a one in 11 chance of developing ovarian cancer,” said Nazneen Rahman of the Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden in London, who led the study and published its findings in the journal Nature Genetics.	   Ovarian cancer can remain hidden for a long time and thus is often not discovered until it is advanced.	   An estimated 230,000 women worldwide are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year. Most are not diagnosed before the cancer has spread, and up to 70 percent of them die within five years.	   Because of this, Rahman said, women with the faulty gene may decide their best option is to have their ovaries removed after they have children — particularly if they have already seen other family members die of the disease.	   Speaking to Reuters in a telephone interview she said the identification of RAD51D pointed to PARP inhibitors as a new class of drugs that might offer fresh hope. Initial tests in the laboratory found that cells with faulty RAD51D were highly sensitive to this class of drugs. 	   “PARP inhibitors work because they were designed to target DNA repair pathways,” she said. “They haven’t been used in patients in that context yet but we would predict they would behave in the same way.”	 	  (Editing by Sophie Walker)	  ",8072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/cancer-ovarian/scientists-find-new-ovarian-cancer-gene-idUSL6E7J515R20110807
22,ABT,"UPDATE 2-Biogen, Abbott MS drug hits mid-stage study goals"," * Relapse rates in line with newer treatments   * Side effects a concern, analysts say   * Biogen shares up 2.8 percent, Abbott little changed   (Adds details from study, analyst comments, shares)   By Lewis Krauskopf   NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) and Abbott Laboratories Inc’s (ABT.N) experimental once-monthly injected drug for multiple sclerosis achieved the main goals in a mid-stage trial, the companies said on Tuesday.   Analysts said the drug, daclizumab, showed effectiveness on a par with some of the new medicines for the often disabling neurological disease, but that some of the side effects, such as infections, were worrisome.   A wave of new drugs, including several oral treatments, has brought some optimism for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, which has no cure, while generating fierce competition in the pharmaceutical industry.   Daclizumab was injected once every four weeks in the Phase IIb study of 600 patients.   According to initial results, daclizumab significantly reduced annualized relapse rates by 54 percent for patients on the 150 milligram dose and 50 percent for those on the 300 mg dose compared with those taking a placebo.   That performance puts daclizumab’s effectiveness in line with Novartis AG’s NOVN.VX newly approved Gilenya and Biogen’s experimental drug BG-12, both of which are pills, but below the roughly 67 percent relapse rate for Tysabri, sold by Biogen and Elan Corp ELN.I, analysts said.   Serious infections occurred in 2 percent of patients on daclizumab compared to none taking the placebo, while more patients in the treatment group had high liver function abnormality tests — 4 percent versus less than 1 percent in the placebo group. Two deaths occurred with patients in treatment arms of the study.   JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham said the safety data were a concern and that he wanted to see more results from the study.   While the data were better than his expectations on the efficacy side, Meacham said in a research note, “it is not yet clear where in the treatment paradigm the agent would fit, particularly with an influx of oral agents entering the MS market.”   Leerink Swann analyst Joshua Schimmer estimated that the drug could garner peak annual sales of $400 million to $500 million.   Patients are currently being enrolled in a late-stage Phase III study of the drug. The companies expect to seek approval for the medicine in 2014, an Abbott spokeswoman said.   Abbott gained the rights to daclizumab when it bought Facet Biotech for more than $700 million last year. Biogen had been developing the drug with Facet, and had earlier failed in a hostile bid for the smaller biotech company.   Biogen shares were up 2.8 percent at $90.47 in morning trading on Nasdaq. Abbott shares were unchanged at $48.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.  (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Gerald E.

23,ABT,Scientists unravel genetic clues to multiple sclerosis,"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have found 29 new genetic variants linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) and say the findings should help drugmakers focus treatment research on precise areas of the immune system.  In a study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, researchers said the newly-found links point to the idea that T-cells — a type of white blood cell responsible for mounting an immune response — and chemicals called interleukins play a key role in the development of the debilitating disease.  Drugs in development that target the immune system include rituximab, sold under the brand name Rituxan by Roche and Biogen to fight leukemia, Tysabri from Biogen and Elan, Lemtrada, sold as Campath by Sanofi’s unit Genzyme for cancer, and Abbott and Biogen’s Zenapax or daclizumab.  “We have implicated genes that are highly relevant to the actions of those drugs,” said Alastair Compston of Cambridge University, who co-led the study. “It is now clear that multiple sclerosis is primarily an immunological disease. This is the way to nail this disease and get on top of it.”  Mid-stage trial data for daclizumab released on Tuesday showed the drug on a par with other new medicines for MS, but some of he side-effects were worrisome.  Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common neurological conditions among young adults, affecting around 2.5 million people worldwide.  It occurs when the protective coating, known as the myelin sheath, around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord begins to break down, slowing the brain’s communication with the rest of the body.  The affected pathways — responsible for everyday activities such as seeing, walking, feeling, thinking and controlling the bowel and bladder — lose the ability to function properly and are eventually destroyed.  In a second study in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Genetics on Wednesday, researchers found that many of the genes linked to MS are also linked to other autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s disease and Type 1 diabetes. This also points to potential new uses for existing drugs in development, they said.  “We have known for some time that many devastating diseases of the immune system must have common genetic causes,” said Chris Cotsapas of Yale University in the United States, who led the PLoS study. “Now we have the outline of a map that tells us where we can look for common treatments.”  Most people who develop MS experience their first symptoms in their 20s and 30s, but Compston and colleagues told a briefing in London the trigger for the disease could happen in early childhood when genetic risk factors coincide with some as yet unknown environmental factor.  For their study, Compston and Peter Donnelly of Oxford University worked with some 250 other researchers and studied the DNA from 9,772 people with multiple sclerosis and compared it with a control group of more than 17,300 healthy people.  Their analysis confirmed 23 previously known genetic links and identified another 29 new genetic variants.  Experts think both genetic and environmental factors are equally important in determining who is likely to develop MS, and taken together, the known genetic variants probably explain about 20 percent of the genetic links, they said.  Previous research has suggested a link between Vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of MS. Compston’s team said that along with the many genes which play a role in the immune system, they had also found two involved in the metabolism of Vitamin D — which mostly comes from sunlight — lending weight to a possible link between genes and the environment.

24,ABT,Analysis: Mead Johnson -- more than just a takeover target,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After more than a few baby steps, infant formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN.N is finally being valued in the market as more than just a takeover target.  The maker of Enfamil products has even been named by analysts as a possible suitor for the nutrition business of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which the pharmaceutical company expects to sell in the next two years.  Other logical buyers for Pfizer’s $1.9 billion business, which sells formula and other nutritional products for babies and young children, include Similac maker Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) and giant food firms Nestle NESN.VX and Danone (DANO.PA), which also have infant nutrition businesses.  Mead Johnson, which had $3.14 billion in revenue last year, had largely been seen as a takeover candidate following its 2009 spin-off from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). Yet the company’s strong balance sheet and profit margins, leading market share and emerging market exposure have investors in the stock even without any takeover premium.  Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow raised his target price on the shares to $80 from $74 after Mead reported better-than-expected quarterly profit in late July and raised its full-year outlook, helped by market share gains in China, its second-largest market after the United States.  “Given the company’s accelerating fundamentals, we believe the company’s valuation stands on its own even without a take-out from a strategic acquirer,” Moskow wrote at the time.  And analysts say any acquisition the company itself might do would only make it more attractive to potential acquirers and investors.  “It would likely, I believe, make it a more attractive ... target or opportunity, just in terms of a company that would have more options,” said Frank Maher, managing director of KeyBanc Capital Markets’ food and beverage investment banking team.  Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark LLC, a food and beverage advisory firm, said bigger players like Nestle or Danone might welcome an acquisition by Mead Johnson of Pfizer’s business, as a step toward their own consolidation.  “The bigger you get in the world of global consolidation, the more attractive you become for the fish above you in the school,” Pirko said. “You welcome deals below you because then you get an appetizer and an entree when it’s your time.”  Company spokesman Chris Perille said Mead Johnson’s focus is on organic growth and geographic expansion, but management “has expressed willingness to consider an incremental ‘tuck-in’ acquisition, if it were a good fit for our business and footprint.” Beyond that, he said the company does not comment on speculation regarding acquisitions.  Mead Johnson shares were down 2.5 percent at $66.55 on Wednesday, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX was down 2.0 percent.  Mead Johnson has a market capitalization of $13.9 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding on July 22 and Tuesday’s closing price of $68.26 per share.  That price was down 6 percent from the all-time high of $72.83 the shares touched on July 28. The stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at $26 in February 2009.  Deutsche Bank analyst Eric Katzman raised his rating on the shares to “buy” from “hold” on Monday, saying Mead should be able to support a stock price in the low-to-mid $70 range, based on a typical packaged food multiple of about 14 to 15 times earnings for its North America/Europe business and a multiple of 25 to 30 times earnings for the Asia/Latin America unit.  When compared with a peer group that includes names such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) and Colgate Palmolive Co (CL.N), Mead Johnson’s valuation is in line or slightly higher, Katzman said in a client note, adding that it compares favorably with the group on metrics such as revenue growth, profitability and balance sheet quality. He also included Mead in a “sub-group of companies that enjoy particularly strong, long-term investment characteristics.”  D.A. Davidson analyst Tim Ramey said Mead Johnson’s rich valuation was likely propped up by both the strength of its fundamentals and the possibility of a takeout, which he thinks is unlikely given the strong market positions of its larger competitors.  “It would take a pretty special company to buy it,” Ramey said, calling its business “terrific.” “I’m not particularly in the camp that says it gets taken out.”  Mead Johnson, based in Glenview, Illinois, was founded in 1905 by one of the brothers who co-founded Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N). Its first infant formula was launched in 1911 and became the first doctor-recommended infant feeding product in the United States. Bristol-Myers acquired Mead Johnson in 1967.

25,ABT,Piramal Health sees 17-20 pct returns from Vodafone India stake," (Adds details, quotes, background, shares)	   * Expects Vodafone’s India unit IPO in 12-24 months   * Deal part of strategy to deliver superior returns from surplus funds   * Plans to invest about $1.55 bln over 5 years to drive drugs business    MUMBAI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Indian drugmaker Piramal Healthcare expects its minority investment in Vodafone’s India unit to yield 17-20 percent returns, its Chairman said, adding he expected the telecom firm’s initial public offer (IPO) to hit Indian markets in 12-24 months.	   The drugmaker agreed to buy 5.5 percent stake in Vodafone’s  India mobile operations for $640 million on Wednesday.  .	   Vodafone said Piramal would buy the stake from Essar, its joint venture partner in the country. 	   Vodafone had earlier said it will consider an IPO of the Indian unit after it closes the Essar deal.	   The London-listed company, in July, sealed a long awaited deal to buy out Essar. But the sale would have pushed Vodafone just above the 74 percent limit set for foreign companies in India’s telecom sector.	   The stake sale to Piramal will put Vodafone nearer the 70 percent mark.	   “Vodafone has delivered a strong performance in India and has strong credentials,” Piramal said explaining his decision for the stake buy. 	   This is the cash flush company’s second unrelated investment after it bought private equity firms IndiaReit Fund Advisors and IndiaReit Investment Managers.	   Ajay Piramal said the company is sitting on a cash pile of 100 billion rupees. 	   “The investment is part of our strategy to deliver superior returns to our shareholders from the surplus funds we have,”  Piramal told a news conference and said, the company was looking to park its funds on short-term basis with global companies. 	   The transaction contemplates various exit options for Piramal, including both participation in a potential IPO of Vodafone Essar Ltd and a sale of its stake back to Vodafone, the Indian firm said in a statement.	   Piramal expects to complete the deal “shortly” he said adding, “We can sell the stake to a third party as well if the IPO doesn’t happen in 24 months.”	 	   Piramal Healthcare, mopped up a kitty of $3.72 billion by selling its India formulations business to U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories in 2010.	   The Mumbai-based firm also sold its diagnostic services unit to India’s Super Religare Labs - controlled by billionaire brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh who run Fortis Healthcare (India) and Religare Enterprises - for about $132.6 million.	   Post the two major divestments, Piramal has been looking for investments outside pharmaceutical sector and recently announced a foray in financial services segment.	   “Such a huge amount cannot be absorbed only in pharmaceuticals sector... therefore, we have to find avenues to invest these funds,” he said.	   The company, however, would continue to focus on pharmaceuticals sector and plans to invest about 70 billion rupees ($1.55 billion) over the next five years to drive its drugs business, he said.	   The drugmaker provides contract research and manufacturing services and also sells critical care and over-the-counter products.	   Shares of Piramal Healthcare, valued at $1.37 billion, ended at 375.05 rupees, up 1.16 percent.	  ",8112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4E7JB00820110811
26,ABT,"J&J;, Lilly drugs found among best for manic episodes"," * Study finds generic haloperidol ranks top for acute treatment   * Researchers say findings should inform clinical guidelines    By Kate Kelland	   LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Antipsychotics are far more effective than mood stabilisers in tackling acute manic episodes, researchers found, and Eli Lilly’s Zyprexa, Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal and generic haloperidol outperform the rest. 	   In a study published in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, researchers from Britain and Italy ranked antipsychotic drugs according to their effectiveness and said that since current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between the drugs, their findings could offer useful guidance for doctors.	   “Strikingly, some antipsychotic drugs were overall significantly more effective than mood stabilisers,” the researchers, led by Andrea Cipriani of Verona University and John Geddes of Oxford University, wrote in their study.	   “These results have potential clinical implications that should be considered in the development of clinical practice guidelines.”	   Mania, defined as an “excessively raised mood”, affects around 1 percent of the population worldwide, and experts say it tends to alternate with periods of depression. These swings define the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.	   Cipriani’s team analysed the results from 68 randomised controlled trials involving more than 16,000 participants from January 1980 to November 2010 to compare the most common drugs used to treat acute mania in adults. 	   They found that haloperidol, Zyprexa and Risperdal were the most effective antimanic drugs and said they “should be considered as among the best of the available options for the treatment of manic episodes”.	   Zyprexa has been one of Elli Lilly’s top-selling drugs, but is set to lose its valuable marketing exclusivity in the United States in October. 	   Haloperidol also had the highest number of significant differences in head-to-head comparisons, coming out better than Otsuka Pharmaceutical’s Abilify, known generically as aripiprazole;` carbamazepine, sold as Carbatrol by Shire  and Tegretol by Novartis ; valproate, sold by Abbott Laboratories as Depakine and Sanofi-Aventis as Epilim; Lundbeck’s and Merck’s asenapine.	   It also ranked higher than Pfizer’s Neurontin or gabapentin; lamotrigine, sold by GlaxoSmithKline as Lamictal; AstraZeneca’s Seroquel or quetiapine; J&J’s Topamax or topiramate and several other generic treatments, including lithium, the researchers said.	   Risperdal, Zyprexa and Seroquel were least likely to result in patients deciding to stop their treatment and were better than many mood stabilisers, the study found.	   In a commentary on the study also published in the Lancet, Michael Berk of Deakin University, Australia, and Gin Malhi at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney said its findings were likely “to attract much interest and have a substantial effect both on clinical practice guidelines and real-world treatment”.	   But they added that while haloperidol “seems to have won the race for pole position in the treatment of acute mania”, management of these episodes is not always the primary treatment aim.	   “Instead, the main goals of treatment are attention to long-term mood stability and prophylaxis,” they said, suggesting that haloperidol may not always be best in these circumstances.

27,ABT,UPDATE 2-Abbott to build China nutrition plant for $230 mln," * Plant in Jiaxing expected to open in 2013   * Sees more than $1 bln in China nutritional sales by 2014   (Adds details on Abbott’s nutrition business, context)   NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) said Tuesday it will spend $230 million to build a facility in China to make powdered milk products for infants and children, the latest move by global medical product companies to increase sales in the country.   Abbott expects the Jiaxing plant to open in 2013 and employ about 300 people. The company forecast sales of its nutritional products in China would surpass $1 billion by the end of 2014, up from more than $350 million last year.   “China represents the largest single-market growth opportunity in global nutrition,” Abbott said in a statement.   Drugmakers and other medical product makers have been seeking growth in China and other emerging economies to counter patent expirations and price pressure in their traditional markets in the United States and Europe.   Abbott, whose nutritional products include the Similac, PediaSure and Ensure brands, reported $5.5 billion in global nutritional sales last year — about 16 percent of the diversified medical product maker’s overall sales.   About 42 percent of Abbott’s nutritional sales came from emerging markets in the first half of this year.   The company expects to start selling a number of new pediatric nutrition products in the China over the next three years.   With the Jiaxing plant, Abbott said it will have opened six manufacturing and research facilities in its nutrition and pharmaceuticals businesses in the Asia-Pacific region in the past three years, including three in China.   More than 17 million infants are born each year in China and rising incomes have created increased demand for high-quality nutrition products, Abbott said.   Analysts have speculated that Abbott might be interested in acquiring the nutritionals unit of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which is exploring strategic options for the business. An Abbott spokesman declined to comment on the speculation.   Abbott shares were off 0.3 percent at $49.77 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

28,ABT,Dealtalk: Alere to pay more for UK medical kits rival?,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - U.S. medical devices maker Alere Inc ALR.N may need to raise its bid for Axis-Shield ASD.L to win over dissenting shareholders at its smaller British rival.  Two of Axis-Shield’s top-10 shareholders — Artemis Investment Management and Aviva Investors, the asset management arm of insurer Aviva (AV.L) — say Alere’s 460 pence per share offer undervalues the maker of testing devices for conditions including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.  “Certainly, I think 460 pence undervalues the prospects for Axis-Shield, so I’m not going to be accepting the (proposal),” said Mark Niznik, fund manager at Artemis, which holds around 6 percent of Axis-Shield’s stock.  Alere last month approached Axis-Shield with an indicative offer valuing the company at 230 million pounds. This was turned down. On August 5, it pitched the same offer directly to Axis-Shield shareholders.  Axis-Shield has rejected the bid, saying it “fundamentally undervalued” the company.  On the open market, Alere has since snapped up 9 percent of the stock from investors including Axa Framlington, J.O. Hambro, Blackrock and Invesco, said one source familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified.  Alere has set a target of 90 percent acceptance as a condition for its bid.  “In order to get to the 90 percent threshold, I think in all probability Alere will have to come back with an improved offer,” said Chris Glasper, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin.  “I think something north of 550 pence would be appropriate.”  Robin West, fund manager at Aviva, which holds nearly 4 percent of Axis-Shield, said the U.S. firm would have to “sharpen their pencil” to win the deal.  “We’ve not sold any shares in Axis Shield and are supportive of the board’s rejection of the approach,” West wrote in an email to Reuters.  Shares of Dundee, Scotland-based Axis-Shield have gained 42 percent since Alere’s first approach on July 6. They last traded at nearly 473 pence — above the offer price, suggesting investors expect Alere to offer more, or other bidders to join the fray.  “What’s best for my investors is to try to get the best price, whether it comes from Alere or someone else,” said Niznik at Artemis, citing Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Abbott (ABT.N), or Roche ROG.VX as potential latecomers to the bidding.  Germany’s Siemens is already in the diagnostics market with its Vantage testing franchise, while Abbott has an existing partnership with Axis-Shield, Niznik noted.  Waltham, Massachusetts-based Alere is trying to take advantage of volatile markets to buy Axis-Shield on the cheap, some analysts said.  “They pretty much are already (going hostile) in the sense that they are already acquiring stock in the market,” said Daniel Stewart analyst Vadim Alexandre.  Alere wants to buy Axis-Shield primarily for its point of care technology — which provides immediate, portable and convenient diagnostics near the site of patient care.

Niznik at Artemis said Alere was worried its business could also be impacted by new products Axis-Shield is due to launch later this year.  Other analysts pointed to the benefits for Axis-Shield of joining forces with Alere, which operates in more than two dozen markets.  “Alere is such a big player and has such a widespread, very powerful distribution that the potential benefit to the Axis-Shield product line would be huge,” said Greg Simpson, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities.  Axis-Shield is due to report half-year results on August 24.

29,ABT,DEALTALK-Alere to pay more for UK medical kits rival?," * Alere may have to sweeten bid by as much as a fifth - analysts   * Two top-10 Axis-Shield shareholders oppose 460p/shr offer   * Axis-Shield shares trading above offer price    By Anirban Sen and Tresa Sherin Morera	   BANGALORE, Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. medical devices maker Alere Inc may need to raise its bid for Axis-Shield  to win over dissenting shareholders at its smaller British rival.	   Two of Axis-Shield’s top-10 shareholders — Artemis Investment Management and Aviva Investors, the asset management arm of insurer Aviva — say Alere’s 460 pence per share offer undervalues the maker of testing devices for conditions including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.	   “Certainly, I think 460 pence undervalues the prospects for Axis-Shield, so I’m not going to be accepting the (proposal),” said Mark Niznik, fund manager at Artemis, which holds around 6 percent of Axis-Shield’s stock.	   Alere last month approached Axis-Shield with an indicative offer valuing the company at 230 million pounds. This was turned down. On Aug. 5, it pitched the same offer directly to Axis-Shield shareholders.	   Axis-Shield has rejected the bid, saying it “fundamentally undervalued” the company. 	   On the open market, Alere has since snapped up 9 percent of the stock from investors including Axa Framlington, J.O. Hambro, Blackrock and Invesco, said one source familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified.	   Alere has set a target of 90 percent acceptance as a condition for its bid.	   “In order to get to the 90 percent threshold, I think in all probability Alere will have to come back with an improved offer,” said Chris Glasper, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin.	   “I think something north of 550 pence would be appropriate.”	   Robin West, fund manager at Aviva, which holds nearly 4 percent of Axis-Shield, said the U.S. firm would have to “sharpen their pencil” to win the deal.	   “We’ve not sold any shares in Axis Shield and are supportive of the board’s rejection of the approach,” West wrote in an email to Reuters.	   Shares of Dundee, Scotland-based Axis-Shield have gained 42 percent since Alere’s first approach on July 6. They last traded at nearly 473 pence — above the offer price, suggesting investors expect Alere to offer more, or other bidders to join the fray.	   “What’s best for my investors is to try to get the best price, whether it comes from Alere or someone else,” said Niznik at Artemis, citing Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Abbott , or Roche  as potential latecomers to the bidding.	   Germany’s Siemens is already in the diagnostics market with its Vantage testing franchise, while Abbott has an existing partnership with Axis-Shield, Niznik noted.	   Waltham, Massachusetts-based Alere is trying to take advantage of volatile markets to buy Axis-Shield on the cheap, some analysts said.	   “They pretty much are already (going hostile) in the sense that they are already acquiring stock in the market,” said Daniel Stewart analyst Vadim Alexandre.

30,ABT,"Exclusive: Nestle, Danone early leaders to land $10 billion Wyeth","LONDON (Reuters) - European food groups Nestle NESN.VX and Danone (DANO.PA) are the early frontrunners working on bids for Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Wyeth baby formula business, worth up to $10 billion, a banking source close to the situation said.  U.S. rival Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN.N, second only to Nestle in the baby formula business, is focused on internal growth, the banker said.  Both Nestle and Danone — third in the market — see Wyeth, which makes milk formula for infants and toddlers, as high growth, with nearly 80 percent of sales in emerging markets, while Western Europe and the United States markets are sluggish at best, the source said.  The European groups consider the smaller Wyeth, with 60 percent of its sales in Asia, as particularly attractive, but are looking carefully at any antitrust issues a deal might throw up.  “Nestle and Danone see Wyeth as a strategic deal in an area in which they both want to grow and are clearly seen as the early frontrunners in this auction,” said the banker.  Both see Wyeth’s business in Asia as key since the region accounts for 45 percent of the world milk formula market — China alone accounts for a fifth of global sales — and because more than half the world’s births occur in the region.  Nestle and Danone have established infant milk businesses growing at nearly 10 percent a year and have identified nutrition as a key strategic growth area. So Wyeth, with its SMA milk formula brand, would press the fast-forward button in markets like Asia and Latin America.  “Nestle could easily afford the deal but will face a number of antitrust problems. For Danone, it would be more of a stretch financially, but the group should encounter fewer competition issues,” said an investor with shares in both the European food groups.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, with relatively low debt, is well positioned to finance a deal but could face antitrust issues in Mexico, South America and Asia, while Danone could have to deal with concerns about market dominance in Britain and Australia.  The world’s biggest drugmaker Pfizer put the Wyeth business up for sale in July, and analysts would have expected interest from the globe’s top four players — Nestle, Mead Johnson, Danone and Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N).  Currently, Nestle has a 19.3 percent share of the global baby milk formula market followed by Mead Johnson on 16.4, Danone 13.5, Abbott 12.1 and Wyeth on 5.6.  Credit Suisse analysts value Wyeth at $8-10 billion using past industry deal multiples and the valuation of Mead Johnson. They assume the $1.9 billion annual turnover business has similar 23 percent operating margins to Danone’s baby nutritional unit and Mead Johnson.  A price of $10 billion would equate to the same 22 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple that Danone paid in its 12.3 billion euros acquisition of Numico in 2007 and ahead of the 15.7 times Nestle paid for the baby food group Gerber in a $5.5 billion deal earlier that year.  Swiss-based Nestle, with baby and infant brands like Gerber and Nido, dropped a big hint over future deals at its half-year results this month, saying it saw “unprecedented opportunities” for acquisitions and internal investment. In the circumstances, it decided it had better uses for its cash that renewing its share buyback program. [ID:nL6E7JA11J]  Chief Financial Officer James Singh said the group was looking for deals around the world in strategic areas after spending 4.5 billion Swiss francs on recent deals like Chinese confectionery group Huse Fo Chi and Kraft’s U.S. frozen pizza business.  “We have also stepped up our M&A activity, though we remain focused on bolt-ons,” Singh said at the results.  Nestle’s debt fell to 14.5 billion Swiss francs at end-June compared with 29.6 billion a year ago, largely as a result of the sale of its Alcon eyecare business in August 2010, so with low debt and an AAA credit rating it has plenty of scope.  For Danone, with its Milupa, Bledina and Cow & Gate brands, Wyeth looks right up its strategic street, having already told investors it is not interested in entering the U.S. market. That appears to rule out a bid for Mead Johnson, a group with $3.14 billion of annual sales and a market value of $14.1 billion, spun off from Bristol-Myers-Squibb in 2009.  A Wyeth deal for Danone, being a smaller group than Nestle and with net debt of 7.5 billion euros at June 2011, might be stretching, but analysts say it could find the financing, but may be careful on price after some said it overpaid for Numico.  “Wyeth is more strategic for Danone than for Nestle. We say this in part because Nestle could always buy Mead Johnson if it wants to; Nestle can fund it and pay a premium, and is also interested in the U.S. market. On the other hand Danone cannot fund the purchase of Mead Johnson and we understand it is not interested in Mead Johnson’s U.S. business,” said analyst Pablo Zuanic at brokers Liberum Capital.  Nestle and Danone declined to comment on Wyeth, while Pfizer, which has appointed Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners to advise on the sell-off, has said it does not expect to make any announcements until next year.

31,ABT,No major heart risk seen in new psoriasis drugs,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A new, highly effective class of psoriasis drugs did not appear to raise the risk of heart problems in a review of published studies, but the analysis may not have been big enough to detect rare cases, U.S. researchers said.  Abbott Laboratories pulled its U.S. and European marketing applications for one of the drugs in January, known as briakinumab [ID:nN14150334], due to concerns raised by U.S. regulators.  The drug is part of a new class of treatments known as anti-IL-12/23 agents that have been shown to be highly effective at treating psoriasis, an autoimmune disease marked by well-defined patches of red raised skin.  Patients with severe psoriasis are already at increased risk of heart attacks, and doctors are worried the new treatments may increase this risk.  Abbott’s decision also raised concerns about Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara or ustekinumb, the first drug in the class to win marketing approval.  “We’re concerned about the apparent excess in cardiovascular events,” said Caitriona Ryan of the Baylor Research Institute in Dallas, whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.  Ryan and colleagues analyzed data from 22 randomized clinical trials of anti-IL-12/23 and anti-TNF drugs to treat chronic plaque psoriasis, the most common form of psoriasis.  The older drugs block tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNF-alpha, a protein involved in inflammation. The newer drugs targets two different inflammatory proteins — interleukin 12 and interleukin 23.  Anti-TNF drugs in the study included Abbott’s Humira or adalimumab, Pfizer’s Enbrel or etanercept and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade or infliximab.  Ryan’s team found that during the active portion of the clinical trials they reviewed, 10 out of the more than 3,179 patients who were treated with anti-IL-12/23 had a major cardiac event, such as a heart attack, stroke or death related to heart disease, compared with no heart problems in the 1,474 patients treated with a placebo.  Among patients treated with the older anti-TNF drugs, only 1 of the 3,858 patients had a major cardiac problem compared with 1 of the 1,812 patients treated with placebo.  Ryan told Reuters that although the study did not show a statistically significant increase in heart problems, it was likely not large enough to detect these rare events.  Dr. Christopher Ritchlin, a rheumatologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, who has seen the findings but was not involved with the study, said the analysis does not ease his concerns about drugs in this class.  “There are some safety signals you are seeing in the treatment groups that are not in the placebo groups. I’m not saying there is a definite association, but there is smoke here,” he said.  Ryan said the work exposes flaws in the design of clinical trials, which are powered to show differences in the effectiveness of drugs, but not to identify rare safety problems.  What is needed, she said, is some form of regulatory oversight of drugs after they win marketing approval, beyond the current system in which individual companies submit reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  “We have to find a way of being able to systematically gather safety data for these agents after they are on the market,” Ryan said.

32,ABT,No major heart risk seen in new psoriasis drugs," * Team not convinced drugs such as J&J’s Stelara are safe   * Researcher says patients should be monitored   By Julie Steenhuysen   CHICAGO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A new, highly effective class of psoriasis drugs did not appear to raise the risk of heart problems in a review of published studies, but the analysis may not have been big enough to detect rare cases, U.S. researchers said.

33,ABT,UPDATE 2-US FDA approves targeted Pfizer lung cancer drug," * FDA also approves Abbott companion diagnostic test   * Drug treats subset of non-small cell lung cancers   * Annual peak sales could reach $2.5 bln - analyst  (Adds drug details, sales, price, company comment)   WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators approved a genetically targeted lung cancer drug from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which is pushing into oncology medicines as its top-selling cholesterol fighter faces looming generic competition.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it had approved Xalkori, along with a companion diagnostic test by a unit of Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) that identifies which patients will benefit from the treatment.   Xalkori targets a small subset of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a specific genetic mutation, which translates to about 6,500 to 11,000 patients in the United States each year.   Pfizer has also applied for approval with the European Medicines Agency.   Xalkori could eventually reach annual peak sales of $2.5 billion, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said in May. [ID:nN18299647]   Pfizer needs new products with its cholesterol fighting drug Lipitor, the world’s top selling prescription medicine, set to lose U.S. patent protection late this year.   Xalkori will cost $9,600 a month, although the drugmaker said it has developed a program where eligible patients who have private insurance can get the drug for a $100 monthly co-pay.   “Overall, lung cancer is responsible for more deaths each year worldwide than any other type of cancer,” said Pfizer CEO Ian Read in a statement.   “Xalkori is an advance in the treatment of this devastating illness, providing a new therapeutic option for a subset of patients with the disease.”   The drug, known by the chemical name crizotinib, treats patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who express an abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, which is more common in nonsmokers.   The oral drug is from a new class of cancer medicines that block certain proteins produced by this type of gene, believed to be a driver of tumor development in certain cancers.   In one clinical trial for the drug, half of patients had their tumors shrink or disappear for an average of 42 weeks. In a second study, 61 percent of patients had that effect for an average of 48 weeks.   About four percent of lung cancer patients tend to be ALK positive, but about 10 percent to 15 percent of lung cancer patients who were never smokers fall into the category.   “Targeted therapies such as Xalkori are important options for treating patients with this disease and may ultimately result in fewer side effects,” said Dr. Richard Pazdur, head of the FDA’s Office of Oncology Drug Products.   The drug’s most common side effects were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, swelling, constipation and vision disorders such as flashes of light or blurred vision.   The FDA granted the drug priority review, which means it is considered a potentially significant advance over existing therapies. It is the second targeted therapy the FDA approved this year, after Roche Holding’s ROG.VX skin cancer drug Zelboraf.

34,ABT,Heart valves and toasters: call for new EU rules," * Cardiologists seek overhaul of EU devices system   * Light-touch framework raises safety concerns   * Gap between European and U.S. medtech regulation    By Ben Hirschler	   PARIS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Pacemakers and electric toasters have little in common, yet in Europe the same regulatory framework covers both and a growing number of doctors think the system is no longer up to the job.	   The issue has come to the fore at this year’s annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), which is calling for an overhaul of Europe’s “CE mark” scheme as far as it affects evaluating and approving new medical technology.	   The push for change in Europe highlights a heated debate on both sides of the Atlantic over how to encourage innovation in often life-saving devices while at the same time controlling risks.	   In the United States, disgruntled medical technology firms look enviously at the relaxed regulatory regime in Europe and some Republicans have used the European example to scold the Food and Drug Administration over its slower approval process.	   High-tech devices — from coronary stents and artificial heart valves to replacement hips and knees — can certainly get a green light faster in Europe than in the United States.	   But that is not always a good thing, according to Dr Alan Fraser, a cardiologist at Cardiff University, who has led a review of the European Union regulations for the ESC.	   “It tends to be that clinical trials are done after approval in Europe but before approval in the United States,” he said in an interview.	   “Where there have been isolated instances of devices that were associated with complications, those have disproportionately occurred in countries that have earlier approval — and that tends to be Europe.”	   Over the years there have been problems with a range of implanted devices, in heart medicine and other areas. 	   These have not been exclusively in Europe, as shown by last year’s massive worldwide recall of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. 	   Under a package of measures adopted more than 20 years ago, manufacturers selling devices in Europe must satisfy the “essential requirements” of safety and performance, but they do not necessarily need to show that a device benefits patients.	   Europe also has no centralised process for approving medical devices, unlike the United States, so manufacturers are free to seek approval from any EU country. The suspicion is that this leads to “forum shopping”, with companies choosing agencies offering the least burdensome and fastest reviews.	   The ESC would instead like to see a single coordinated European system, with more pre-market testing and post-marketing surveillance, as part of a move to close the gap between systems in different parts of the world.	   The hope among doctors is that new proposals set to go before EU ministers in 2012 will address these issues.	   “At least we want to agree on similar processes,” said the ESC’s president, Dr Michel Komajda of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in Paris. “I don’t know if it will end up with really global standards but I think it is useful to have transatlantic discussions.”	   Similar issues are occupying his opposite number at the American College of Cardiology, Dr David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic, following calls for a shake-up to the 510(k) system under which most U.S. devices are approved. 	   Holmes said a middle way needed to be found between the flood of new devices that often hit the market in Europe and the much lower number seen in the United States.	   Nearly 80 coronary stents have been approved in Europe, for example, against only a handful in the United States.	   “There must be some happy medium. Some of the devices that have had CE approval were then shown to be neither any better and they could have been worse. That was too lax. On the other hand, there are devices that are just being approved in the United States that aren’t ever going to be used in Europe because they are too old,” Holmes said.	   Other than Johnson & Johnson, major makers of medical devices include Medtronic , Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories .

35,ABT,UPDATE 4-Pfizer arthritis drug shows mixed results," * Study shows oral Pfizer drug matches Humira efficacy   * Greater number of serious side effects with Pfizer drug   * Other studies confirm drug effective, well tolerated   * Deaths across trials deemed similar to standard drugs   * Pfizer shares slip 1 pct to $18.82  (Adds analyst comment, updates shares)   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - New data from a trial of Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) experimental pill to treat rheumatoid arthritis showed the medicine was as effective as Abbott Inc’s (ABT.N) blockbuster injectable Humira drug, but more patients taking it had serious side effects.   Summaries of several other late-stage trials to be presented at a major rheumatology meeting in November were released on Thursday and confirmed earlier findings that the Pfizer drug, tofacitinib, was effective and in general well tolerated.   The incidence of overall adverse events was similar for both drugs, but the proportion of patients who developed serious side effects, though small, was numerically higher in the tofacitinib groups.   Serious adverse effects are those deemed to have caused death, life-threatening events, need for hospitalization, or disability or permanent damage.   “Impressive efficacy was demonstrated, with focus now expected to be on safety leading into its regulatory review,” Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies & Co, said in a research note. “While the market was expecting a similar efficacy between the higher dose of tofacitinib and Humira, the strong performance of the lower dose is impressive.”   Pfizer plans to seek approval of the medicine by the end of the year. The world’s biggest drugmaker is hoping tofacitinib, which some analysts believe can reach $2 billion in annual sales, and other new medicines can help offset plunging revenue from its Lipitor cholesterol fighter when it faces competition from cheaper generics as early as November.   Pfizer shares fell 1 percent to $18.82 early Thursday afternoon.   Data from a 12-month trial comparing tofacitinib and Humira, called ORAL Standard, involved 717 patients with moderate to severe disease who continued to take a widely used treatment called methotrexate.   One group of the patients took 5 milligram doses of the Pfizer drug twice a day, a second group took 10 mg doses twice a day, while a third group received Humira injections every two weeks. A fourth group of patients received a placebo.   The effectiveness of tofacitinib and Humira was numerically similar by all measures, according to the data, although the study was not designed to definitively assess superiority of one drug over the other.   Full details of the tofacitinib Phase III studies are expected to be unveiled in November at the annual American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scientific meeting in Chicago.   “Based on the totality of the tofacitinib RA clinical development program, Pfizer believes the risk/benefit profile supports regulatory submission for both the 5 and 10 mg dose,” Pfizer spokeswoman Victoria Davis said.   Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen predicted both doses of tofacitinib will be approved next year. But he said the drug should not greatly hamper sales of Humira its first few years on the market because doctors will prescribe tofacitinib mainly for patients who have failed to benefit from standard treatments.   “However, we expect tofacitinib to have a larger impact on Humira over time as Pfizer tries to move its use to an earlier stage” of treatment, Biegelsen said in a research note.   He said Humira is on track for sales this year of $7.8 billion, and that they will grow to $10.5 billion in 2015.   Data also became available for the first time on Thursday on the incidence of overall mortality and infections across numerous late-stage trials of the Pfizer medicine, and from longer-term follow-up of patients.   That pooled analysis, involving more than 6,200 patients, showed a mortality rate with tofacitinib of 0.572 deaths per 100 patient years in the Phase III trials, and 0.641 deaths per 100 patient years in the long-term evaluations.   In all, 12 patients died out of more than 3,000 who received tofacitinib in the Phase III trials, with deaths of another 20 patients seen among more than 3,200 who were followed in longer-term studies.   Pfizer said the death rates were consistent with those typically seen with standard treatments meant to slow the progress of arthritis symptoms.   Tofacitinib belongs to a new class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors that block a protein associated with inflammation.   It would compete against a lucrative family of biotech treatments that block a different protein called tumor necrosis factor. These treatments include Humira, one of the world’s biggest selling medicines, as well as Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Remicade and Enbrel, which is sold by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) and Pfizer.

38,ABT,"J&J; may buy or develop new heart devices, CFO says"," * J&J interested in heart valve, heart pump technologies   * May acquire heart device products or develop internally   * Sees healthcare utilization stabilizing, but no rebound   By Susan Kelly   Sept 13 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is interested in adding heart valves and heart pumps to its product lineup as it reshapes its medical device portfolio but won’t overpay to acquire the technology, its chief financial officer said.   Three months after J&J announced it would stop selling drug-coated heart stents, once a key product line, CFO Dominic Caruso said the company sees other attractive technologies in the cardiac device market and could enter those markets either by acquiring another company or by developing the products organically.   He pointed to heart valves and left ventricular assist devices, which are pumps implanted in patients with advanced heart failure who are awaiting a transplant, as two promising opportunities in medical technology.   “Both are interesting. We are interested in looking at them,” said Caruso, speaking Tuesday on a webcast from an investor conference in New York.   J&J in June said it would stop selling drug-coated heart stents, a technology it pioneered but whose sales slumped in recent years due to safety concerns and fierce competition, ceding the market to Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N).   Caruso said J&J exited the market because stents, which are implanted in clogged arteries to prop them open, had become a “commodity business” subject to pricing wars. Patients are well served with products already available, and the market is not rewarding companies for innovations in this area, he said.   J&J would consider acquiring a maker of heart valves or heart pumps at the right price, Caruso said. “Unfortunately,” he added, “they are overvalued today.” He did not name specific companies J&J might be interested in.   Heart valve innovator Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW.N), an often-rumored takeover target, and heart pump makers Thoratec Corp THOR.O and Heartware International Inc HTWR.O have seen their stocks benefit from anticipation of new products in development.   Caruso said the downturn in healthcare utilization that has hurt medical device sales over the past six quarters is stabilizing, but the industry remains under pressure. Patients continue to delay treatment due to high unemployment and steeper insurance deductibles as employers shift more of the cost of care to their workers.  “We have not seen any rebound in utilization,” he said.   Industry procedure volumes will improve as the healthcare reform law brings more patients into the marketplace beginning in 2014, Caruso said.   The industry is unlikely to see a repeal of a planned 2.3 percent tax on device sales, as some have called for, Caruso said.   Caruso also said J&J’s planned $21.67 billion purchase of Swiss orthopedic device maker Synthes SYST.VX is likely to close in the first half of 2012.

39,ABT,Mouse virus link to chronic fatigue crumbling,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Scientists have retracted part of a 2009 study from the journal Science linking chronic fatigue syndrome with a mouse virus as evidence continues to mount against the virus as a cause of the mysterious disease.  In addition to the partial retraction, Science published on Thursday new research that cast doubt on the theory. A U.S.-backed study found no trace of the XMRV virus, and a related mouse virus, in blood samples taken from healthy people and those with chronic fatigue syndrome.  The disease causes muscle pain, memory loss and overwhelming fatigue. While the XMRV research had offered some hope of identifying its cause, and therefore a treatment, scientists say the link was likely the result of contaminated lab samples.  Initial research from 2009 claimed to have found XMRV in the blood of two-thirds of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.  But last May, Science ran two reports refuting the 2009 study along with an “editorial expression of concern” and said that the validity of the original chronic fatigue study by research teams in Nevada and Maryland “is now in question.  One of those studies by the National Cancer Institute suggested the finding was the cause of contaminated lab samples. That followed a study done by a team at University College London, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Oxford University that said cell samples from patients in earlier studies were likely contaminated.  Those concerns appear to have borne out with at least one method of looking for the virus.  Dr. Robert Silverman and Jaydip Das Gupta of the Cleveland Clinic, who were co-authors on the original 2009 paper in Science, double-checked their experiments and found some of the samples from chronic fatigue patients were contaminated with a laboratory form of XMRV genetic material that could not have been present in people.  The team has retracted tables and figures from the study that were based on the contaminated data.  Silverman was not available for comment, but an e-mailed statement from the Cleveland Clinic said the authors no longer believe XMRV plays a role in chronic fatigue syndrome.  According to Science, the study’s main authors still believe other data in the paper support their original conclusions. The journal said it stands by its May “editorial expression of concern,” and plans to discuss the next steps in light of the new findings.  Reports that XMRV and a related mouse virus known as P-MLVs were circulating in the blood of humans had raised worries over the safety of the blood supply.  That prompted scientists at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct tests to see if they could detect XMRV or P-MLVs in blood samples taken from healthy people and 14 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who had previously tested positive for XMRV or P-MLV. They also included a sample from a person who had XMRV but did not have chronic fatigue syndrome.  The samples were blinded and sent to nine different labs including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as those from Abbott Laboratories Inc, GenProbe Inc, and the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Reno, Nevada, the lab run by one of the original authors of the 2009 XMRV study.  Two labs, which previously had reported the link between XMRV and chronic fatigue syndrome, found XMRV in some samples. But these labs reported them in samples from healthy donors and from chronic fatigue patients not infected with XMRV.  Dr. Simone Glynn of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, which led the effort, said these were likely false positive results.  “I think these data are very reassuring,” Glynn said in a telephone interview.  In June 2010 the nonprofit U.S. blood banking association known as AABB recommended that collection centers discourage people with chronic fatigue syndrome from donating blood.  “We do not think blood donor screening is warranted at this time for these viruses,” Glynn said.  Chronic fatigue syndrome strikes an estimated 1 million to 4 million Americans. There is no cure. Patients are treated with drugs to address their symptoms including antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications.

41,ABT,Medtech's new normal: pushback on procedures," * Ernst & Young report details pressures on device makers   * Finds companies will need to prove value to compete   By Susan Kelly   CHICAGO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Medical technology companies are under intensifying pressure to demonstrate that their products improve patients’ lives and make the healthcare system more efficient, a report from Ernst & Young concludes.   Government and private insurers’ efforts to rein in healthcare costs are straining hospital budgets, prompting a harder look at the value of comparable treatments. Hospitals are also standardizing purchasing decisions and relying less on physicians’ preferences for one brand of device over another in their efforts to cut costs.   At the same time, regulators are stepping up their scrutiny of new product applications, and patients are taking a more active role in choosing among treatment options.   “It is now becoming increasingly clear that medtech faces its own new normal,” the report said. The findings were scheduled to be presented on Tuesday at an industry meeting in Washington.   To compete, device makers will need to quantify successful patient outcomes as well as the cost effectiveness of the treatment, said John Babitt, head of Ernst & Young’s medtech practice for the Americas.   “The days of selling devices through sales reps who have a good relationship with a physician are numbered, if not over,” Babitt said in a telephone interview.   “Where we really see the battle lines being drawn, especially as physicians migrate more toward being hospital employees, is in negotiations with hospital payers, hospital administrators and the office of procurement,” he said.   More hospitals are relying on technology assessment committees and group purchasing organizations to consolidate purchasing decisions. Physicians who once had free reign to pick the device they preferred may find their options limited.   “In many cases, hospitals are imposing price caps or reducing the number of vendors from which they will purchase,” according to the report.   Ernst & Young found a disconnect between the medical technology industry’s rebound in growth as it has emerged from the depths of the recession and investors’ perceptions of the sector’s prospects.   Revenue for public medical technology companies totaled $315.9 billion in 2010, up 4 percent from the year before. Income for non-conglomerates in the United States and Europe, excluding one-time charges, increased 9 percent, last year.   Yet device company stocks, which have historically traded at a premium to the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, now trade at a discount, Babitt noted. “That is attributable to a perception that there is a lack of innovation to fuel growth,” he said.   Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) Vice Chairman Alex Gorsky said the medical device industry can take lessons from the pharmaceutical sector, which began struggling with similar challenges a decade ago.   It’s likely that changes brought by the current economic crisis, including tighter regulation, lower prices and stricter utilization standards, are here to stay, Gorsky said in comments contained in the report.   The industry needs to pay attention to how it is perceived as it addresses the safety, efficacy and affordability of medical devices, Gorsky said.   “Will we be seen as a faceless, uncaring industry that places profits ahead of people? Or will we be seen as an industry that “gets it,” that is helping to improve the lives of tens of millions of people every day and understands the need to do our fair share in order to bring our products and services to even more people in the years ahead?” he wrote.

42,ABT,"US FDA, device makers tone down rhetoric over fees"," * FDA says agency has problems, needs fees to improve   * FDA, device makers meet this week for user fee talks   * Some in industry say user fees are long-term investment   By Anna Yukhananov   WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The top U.S. medical device regulator warned industry executives that it would take more money and time to fix delays in Food and Drug Administration reviews of devices.   “Since 2004, we’ve seen worsening times for (device reviews), and much of the cause resides with the FDA,” said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, the head of the agency’s device division in a speech that disarmed some industry critics with its frankness.   Shuren, who became head of the division in 2010, told device makers at a conference sponsored by AdvaMed, an industry trade group, that a lack of resources had meant high staff turnover and low training in new technology and science, problems that would take years to fix.   The industry and the FDA have clashed over higher fees for device applications and are holding negotiations this week on a fee agreement to be submitted to Congress by January.   Industry groups contend higher fees in the past have not led to speedier review times for medical devices.   But Shuren, who became head of the division in 2010, told the device makers that it took 10 years for higher user fees to speed up review times in the FDA’s drugs division, which began its user fee program in 1992.   Device makers at the conference said they were encouraged by Shuren’s speech, and the FDA’s willingness to address their concerns.   “Shuren was brought in to raise the bar ... around getting the devices center to work more effectively,” said Stephen MacMillan, president and chief executive of Stryker Corp (SYK.N).   “I view (higher fees) like an R&D investment, where you have a few years before you see results,” he said, although the wait could be frustrating.   Stephen Ubl, president and CEO of AdvaMed, said on Wednesday both sides were “making progress” on reaching an agreement on user fees, under the leadership of Janet Trunzo, AdvaMed’s executive vice president for technology and regulatory affairs.   Earlier this week, James Mazzo, chairman of AdvaMed’s board and senior vice president at Abbott’s (ABT.N) medical optics unit, said higher fees were not enough — the agency also needed to address more fundamental problems of inconsistent reviewer questions and unpredictable regulations.   “I’m not a big believer of throwing money or people at a problem,” he told reporters. “You first need to identify the problem and then you address it correctly. That’s how successful businessmen run their companies.”   User fees from devices and drugs provide about a third of the FDA’s funding, and Congress must reauthorize them by October, 2012.

43,ABT,Court upholds blood vessel stent ruling,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court said Boston Scientific Corp did not infringe a patent by Johnson & Johnson’s Cordis unit related to a stent used to treat coronary artery disease, but could not block the enforcement of two patents.  Wednesday’s ruling in the 14-year-old case by the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest in a long line of litigation over stents between the companies.

The approval, which came earlier than expected, marks a milestone for Boston Scientific because the product will replace the Promus stent that it now co-markets with Abbott Laboratories . The original Promus is Abbott’s market-leading Xience stent sold under the Promus name, with Abbott receiving about 40 percent of the profit. Boston Scientific said it plans to begin marketing the U.S. stent immediately and expects to receive regulatory approval for Promus Element by mid-2012 in Japan. The U.S. and Japanese launches should contribute an additional $200 million to Boston Scientific’s gross margin after 2012, the company said. The Promus Element stent is coated with the drug everolimus to prevent clots from reforming in the artery after the tiny wire-mesh tube is inserted. Boston Scientific said it will record a pre-tax charge of $40 million in the fourth quarter related to inventory reserves for the earlier U.S. launch of the product. Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it was investigating a rare but serious problem reported in stents including Boston Scientific’s Promus and Ion products. But the agency said it considered Ion, which it approved this spring, to be safe. Boston Scientific declined to comment on the problem, in which the stents shrink or lengthen after implantation. The company said it expects to launch Promus Element by mid-2012 in Japan. Natick, Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific competes against Abbott and Medtronic Inc in the $4 billion worldwide stent market.

47,ABT,Twitter alum Michael Abbott joins Kleiner Perkins,"* Abbott to focus on cloud, social, mobile fields * Amazon’s Bradford also joins Kleiner SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Former Twitter engineering Vice President Michael Abbott is joining Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers next week as a partner, the firm said, signaling its commitment to social networks, mobile and the cloud. Abbott, who also previously led the software team at handheld-device maker Palm, is “mapped so perfectly to the trends taking place in Silicon Valley today,” Kleiner partner Ted Schlein told Reuters. The move comes on the heels of the recent hire of Ray Bradford, a product management principal at Amazon Web Services who handled cloud databases. Bradford joined Kleiner from Amazon.com Inc last week at a level below partner. Abbott got to know partners at Kleiner when the firm led a $200 million investment in Twitter late last year, he said. John Doerr approached him when he left Twitter in October to join Benchmark Capital as an entrepreneur in residence. Besides finding good companies to invest in and lending them his product-building expertise, Abbott said a large part of his role will include tapping his network of engineering contacts to help Kleiner portfolio companies find good talent. A severe shortage of engineers has dogged Silicon Valley for the last few years. Abbott joined Twitter early last year and is credited with helping it solve the challenge of overcapacity stemming from the fast growth that often led to “fail whale” messages when the system could not handle new Tweets.

48,ABT,Abbott dismisses talk of pharma unit sale,"LONDON (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) has no intention of selling its soon-to-be-separated pharmaceuticals business to another drugmaker and any potential bidder would struggle to persuade management otherwise, its chief executive said on Monday. Miles White told an industry conference in London speculation that Abbott’s drugs unit might be touted for sale was “incorrect.” Abbott announced plans in October to split itself in two, in a move designed to increase Wall Street’s focus on the remaining diversified medical product business, which has tended to be overshadowed by pharmaceuticals. The move prompted immediate talk the drugs arm could prove an attractive acquisition target. Analysts at Jefferies, for example, suggested it might be snapped up by the likes of Merck (MRK.N), Roche ROG.VX, AstraZeneca (AZN.L) or Bayer (BAYGn.DE) in a couple of years. White — who will run the diversified products company while his colleague Richard Gonzalez becomes CEO of pharmaceuticals — said this idea was wide of the mark. “Is one or other (of the two companies) an acquisition candidate? The answer is ‘no’,” he told the FT Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology conference. “You’re probably going to end up with two companies that are in the $40-45 billion range on day one. We’re not offering them for sale ... somebody would have to have an awful lot of cash and they’d have to have a ‘yes’ from a CEO and that would be a tough ‘yes’ to get.” Abbott shares have been held back for years on concerns the company is too dependent on its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, one of the world’s top-selling medicines at more than $8 billion a year. Humira, an injected drug, is facing growing competitive threats, including possible cheaper generic versions and a pill being developed by Pfizer (PFE.N).

50,ABT,UPDATE 1-US says Boston Scientific owes $581 mln back taxes,"* Assessment based on audit of 2004-2006 * Involves Guidant transactions, sale of unit to Abbott * Boston Scientific to contest the assessment Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. tax authorities have hit Boston Scientific Corp with a bill for $581 million in back taxes plus interest and penalties based on an audit of Guidant Corp from 2004 through 2006, the medical device maker said in a regulatory filing. Boston Scientific, which has been saddled with debt since its 2006 acquisition of Guidant, said it intends to contest the assessment of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) via a petition to the U.S. Tax Court. “We believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations, and that the previously reported income tax for the years in question is appropriate,” the company said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Boston Scientific said it would make no payments on the tax assessment until the dispute is resolved, which could take years. The new tax liability relates to transfer pricing in connection with technology license agreements between U.S. and foreign Guidant units, and to the 2006 sale of Guidant’s vascular intervention business to Abbott Laboratories  in April 2006. In that divestiture transaction Abbott acquired the Xience stent technology, which has become the market leader, eclipsing sales of the Taxus stent retained by Boston Scientific. “We believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third-party agreement with Abbott,” Boston Scientific said.",12072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bostonscientific-taxes/update-1-us-says-boston-scientific-owes-581-mln-back-taxes-idUSN1E7B610H20111207

52,ABT,UPDATE 1-India's Piramal Healthcare to borrow for future buys,"* Sees 17-20 pct/yr returns from Vodafone India stake * Will finish available cash post Vodafone India stake buy * Borrows 18 bln rupees to part finance deal * To get 20 bln rupees from Abbott Labs in Sept   (Adds details, background, quotes, shares) By Kaustubh Kulkarni and Archana Narayanan MUMBAI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - India’s Piramal Healthcare Ltd. will rely on borrowings for future buys and investments as it will finish its cash pile after raising stake in mobile operator Vodafone’s India unit, senior company officials said. Piramal Healthcare will buy 5.5 percent more stake in Vodafone India for about 30 billion rupees ($616 million), taking its total stake in the mobile phone company to about 11 percent, it said over the weekend. “We continue to evaluate acquisitions... and various options to maximise value for our shareholders and this (Vodafone) is one of these,” Ajay Piramal, chairman, Piramal Healthcare, said on Monday. Piramal Healthcare raised 18 billion rupees through commercial papers with 30-day and 75-day maturities, to partly fund the Vodafone stake buy, its Chief Financial Officer Rajesh Laddha said. The drugmaker will use 12 billion rupees of cash-on-hand to fund the remaining cost of acquisition. The firm paid a yield of 10.65 percent and 10.15 percent for the April and March maturity commercial paper transactions respectively, which was arranged by Kotak Mahindra Bank. Piramal, which sold its India formulations business to Abbott Laboratories in 2010, received an up-front payment of $2.2 billion from Abbott, besides additional payments of $400 million annually for the next four years beginning 2011. Piramal expects to receive the current year’s payment of $400 million is September. “We may raise more funds provided there is an opportunity,” Laddha said. The firm is in discussions with merchant bankers to monetise the $400 million tranches from Abbott maturing in Sept. 2012 and Sept. 2013. The commercial paper borrowings have been made by the company towards bridge financing till it is able to borrow against its receivables which involves lengthy legal and regulatory processes, he said. “It (assigning of receivables) was taking a little longer than expected and we could not tie the inflow and the outflows. So we had to a CP,” Laddha said. However, analysts are not enthused at the company’s investment strategy. Investment in Vodafone India is intended to park money for short term-gains, Hiten Gala, senior manager, advisory at brokerage Sharekhan said. “Therefore, it is not strategic and the company will prefer to exit within 12-18 months (post Vodafone India IPO).” The Mumbai-based drugmaker expects annual returns of 17-20 percent from the investment in Vodafone, Piramal said. Shares in Piramal Healthcare, which surged more than 7 percent in early trades, ended 1.1 percent lower at 432.80 rupees in a firm Mumbai market. Vodafone, which holds 64 percent in its India unit, has the first right to buy Piramal’s stake in the cellphone operator if an initial public offerring does not happen within 18 months, Piramal said.

55,ABT,Abbott to pay Galapagos up to $1.35 for arthritis drug,"BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Belgium’s Galapagos GLPG.BR has signed a deal for its flagship arthritis drug with U.S. group Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) worth up to $1.35 billion, which it said was the biggest ever for a medicine in mid-stage clinical trials. The long-awaited deal, announced on Wednesday, underscores the attraction to healthcare companies like Abbott of the $14 billion a year market for treating rheumatoid arthritis as life expectancy rises in the world’s richest countries. “It is much more than we were expecting,” KBC Securities analyst Jan De Kerpel said of the deal, which will eventually give Abbott a leading role in manufacturing and distribution of the drug. “The $200 million they (Galapagos) would get at the end of Phase II (clinical trials) is also unprecedented ... for me it is really putting a new landmark in the dealmaking of drugs which are at this stage of development.” Galapagos shares rose 20 percent to slightly more than 13 euros, giving it a market value of about 340 million euros. It has 820 employees in six countries in Europe. Galapagos said the drug, known as GLPG0634 and which it hopes will come to market in 2017, has several advantages over treatments sold by companies such as Pfizer (PFE.N), Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY.N) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX.O). It will not be injected by doctors at hospitals, as existing treatments are, but will be taken in pill form. The company said tests have not uncovered any negative side effects, such as cholesterol and amnesia, associated with some drugs now available. “What patients are really looking for is a very simple, once daily tablet. That is exactly what we are aiming for,” Andre Hoekema, a company executive said. “We think we will be the best in the class. A daily tablet is really a huge advance.” Galapagos will receive a $150 million upfront payment from Abbott and a further $200 million if the drug passes Phase II studies in arthritis. It could also get milestone payments of $1.0 billion, as well as double digit royalties on sales. Upon completion of the Phase II studies, Abbott will assume sole responsibility for final Phase III clinical development and manufacturing. Galagapos will retain the rights to distribute in the Benelux, where it will keep half of profits on sales. Van de Stolpe said the initial $150 million payment from Abbott should make Galapagos profitable over the next three years and enable it to acquire technology or expertise to develop other drugs. “The market expected a deal, but nothing of this size. This is far bigger than anything we had hoped for and it enables us to strike more deals as we go forward,” van de Stolpe told a news conference in Amsterdam. Galapagos will initially focus on developing three other inflammatory disease drugs in the areas of oncology, cachexia and IBD, or inflammatory bowel syndrome. Earlier this month, Galapagos said it would miss guidance for 2011 as it had not yet finalized the terms of an agreement for GLPG0634.

56,ABT,Abbott drugs business to be called AbbVie on split,"March 21 (Reuters) - When Abbott Laboratories splits into two companies later this year the branded drugs business will go by the name AbbVie, the company said on Wednesday. AbbVie was derived by combining the original Abbott name with the Latin root vi, meaning life, the company said. AbbVie, which will be run by Richard Gonzalez, currently Abbott’s head of global pharmaceuticals, will have nearly $18 billion in annual revenue, about half of that coming from its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. Abbott said it expects the split to take place by the end of the year, but has not yet disclosed a proposed symbol under which the new company’s stock will trade. The diversified healthcare company announced its intention to split the pharmaceuticals business into a separate publicly traded entity in October. Chief Executive Miles White will continue to lead Abbott, which will retain the medical devices, diagnostics and nutritionals businesses. The AbbVie logo will be unveiled when the new company is launched, Abbott said.

58,ABT,Abbott hepatitis C combo impressive in small study,"(Reuters) - A combination of experimental oral hepatitis C treatments being developed by Abbott Laboratories led to cure rates higher than 90 percent in previously untreated patients, according to data from a small mid-stage study. The data, to be presented at a major European liver meeting later this month, puts Abbott firmly in the crowded race to produce a short duration, interferon-free treatment regimen for the serious liver disease. Abbott shares rose nearly 2 percent on a down day for the broader market. Shares of some companies developing rival drugs, such as Gilead Sciences Inc and Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc fell. “This demonstrates unprecedented cure rates for the most common form of hepatitis C infection. And we were able to achieve those rates with only a 12-week duration of therapy,” said Scott Brun, Abbott’s divisional vice president for infectious disease development. Abstracts, or brief summaries, of studies to be presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) meeting in Barcelona were made available on Wednesday. “At EASL it’s going to be very clear that we’ve reached a really transformational moment for patients with HCV (hepatitis C virus),” Brun said. The Phase II trial of previously untreated patients, known as Co-Pilot, combined Abbot’s protease inhibitor ABT-450 boosted by the antiviral drug ritonavir with its polymerase inhibitor ABT-333 and ribavirin, a drug that is part of all current hepatitis C regimens. Patients received the combination therapy for 12 weeks and were checked 24 weeks later for signs of the virus in the blood to determine if there was a sustained virologic response, or SVR. Any patients that achieved an SVR 24 weeks after completing treatment are deemed to be cured. Eighteen of the 19 patients who received a 250 milligram dose of ABT-450 as part of their combination achieved SVR, or 95 percent, while 13 of 14 patients who got a 150 mg dose of ABT-450 were deemed to be cured, or 93 percent. “We would acknowledge that the 4-drug combination from Abbott sets a high bar for competitors,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a research note. He noted that Gilead shares were down in response to the Abbott data, but expressed confidence that a Gilead combination therapy will ultimately be able to match Abbott’s efficacy. In a third arm of the study that involved patients who had failed to be helped by the former standard treatment of interferon and ribavirin, eight of 17 patients achieved SVR for a cure rate of 47 percent. “In our view, the response rate in previous non-responders may not be competitive,” said Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen, who called the treatment naive data “very strong.” Abbott is also testing a drug from a promising class known as NS5A inhibitors in various all-oral combinations that it believes may improve cure rates for prior non-responders. “For a first step it’s very encouraging,” Brun said of the new data in non-responders. “If you’re able to add the potent NS5A inhibitor into the mix we think there’s the potential to do even better and that’s currently under study.” There were no serious side effects seen in the study, with the most common side effects fatigue, nausea and headache. The treatment of hepatitis C took a major leap forward last year with the approval of new drugs from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc and Merck & Co that led to far-higher cure rates with the potential for shorter treatment durations than interferon and ribavirin, which had to be taken for 48 weeks and cured about 40 percent of patients. Vertex’s Incivek led to cure rates as high as 80 percent in previously untreated patients. But both new drugs must be taken with interferon and ribavirin, and the shortest treatment regimen is currently 24 weeks, with many patients still requiring 48 weeks. Interferon, an injected drug, causes miserable flu-like symptoms that lead many patients to discontinue treatment and many more to put off treatment altogether. If left untreated, hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. It is also the most common reason for liver transplants. Analysts believe an interferon-free therapy with a high cure rate and shorter treatment duration is likely to be a multibillion-dollar seller. That has led to fierce competition among drugmakers. Gilead and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co recently spent billions to buy companies developing such drugs. Vertex, Merck and several other smaller companies are also working on various interferon-free combinations. Gilead shares were down 2.5 percent at $46.88, while shares of Idenix were off more than 11 percent at $9.09. Abbott shares were up 0.4 percent at $61.40 after climbing to a multi-year high of $62.55 earlier on Wednesday. Far larger trials will be needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of the Abbott drugs, and the company said it is on track to begin pivotal Phase III testing in early 2013. But the data Abbott will present at EASL this month clearly signals that it intends to be a major player in the field.

65,ABT,Ex-Orioles player Eddie Murray is part of insider trading inquiry,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hall of Fame baseball player Eddie Murray is one of several former professional athletes under investigation by federal authorities in a U.S. insider trading case stemming from the buyout of a medical device company, people familiar with the three-year-old probe said. Federal prosecutors and securities regulators are trying to determine whether Murray, a star slugger for the Baltimore Orioles, traded on inside information that Abbott Laboratories was about to announce a deal in January 2009 to acquire Advanced Medical Optics for $2.8 billion, the sources said. Reuters previously reported on the investigation by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not identify any of the players under scrutiny. Murray, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. Michael Proctor, a lawyer who is representing Murray in the matter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Diane Hock, a lawyer who represents Murray in his post-baseball marketing deals, said she had heard about an investigation, but declined to comment further. The investigation involving Murray is related to the probe that led to the filing of a civil insider trading case against former Orioles player Doug DeCinces. In August 2011, DeCinces settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay $2.5 million in fines, while neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing in the trading of Advanced Medical Optics shares. DeCinces and Murray played together on the Orioles from 1977 to 1982. DeCinces’ lawyer did not respond to calls seeking comment. Securities regulators always take note of trading activity in shares of companies involved in mergers and try to identify buyers or sellers in the stock who may have acted based on nonpublic information. Reuters could not ascertain how many, if any, shares of Advanced Medical Optics Murray bought. The probe into the possible insider trading by professional baseball players is a California offshoot of the sprawling investigation in New York that led to the conviction of Galleon Management hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and charges against dozens of traders and corporate consultants. Some legal experts say the California phase of the investigation is an indication of just how commonplace the sharing of corporate secrets has become. Investigators have found that leaks about the Advanced Medical Optics deal may have come from a number of places, including people who worked for the medical device company; its law firm, Skadden Arps; and its merger adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, according to court records and people familiar with that matter. Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said: “We have been aware of these allegations for more than two years, investigated them (and) fully cooperated with federal authorities in the matter.” A spokeswoman for Skadden declined to comment. A top partner at the firm is also representing one of the suspected leakers, James V. Mazzo, who was the chief executive officer of Advanced Medical at the time of the takeover. Mazzo, now a senior vice president at Abbott’s subsidiary, Abbott Medical Optics, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He did not respond to email or phone calls seeking comment. His lawyer, Richard Marmaro, a partner at Skadden Arps in Los Angeles, declined to comment. An Abbott spokesman said the company was not under investigation and declined to comment about Mazzo. Mazzo, 55, graduated from California State University, Long Beach, with a degree in zoology, and lives in Laguna Beach, a coastal town south of Los Angeles. He is known for his philanthropy and volunteerism. In 2009, for a charitable auction, he donated tickets worth $3,000 for a group of seats in an Anaheim Angels dugout suite, according to a program for the event. “My first love is baseball,” Mazzo told a medical trade publication in a 2011 interview. “I am a die-hard (Chicago) Cubs fan, and I played minor league baseball before my days as a sales representative.” Mazzo is a trustee of the University of California, Irvine Foundation and sits on the Dean’s Advisory Board of its Paul Merage School of Business. He is also on the board of OCTANe, an organization that tries to connect local engineers and technology startups in Orange County with investors and potential workers. The SEC’s complaint against DeCinces, filed last August, claimed the former third baseman had gotten information about the impending takeover from a source who was “directly involved in the impending (Advanced Medical Optics)/Abbott transaction from its inception in October 2008.” DeCinces bought shares of Advanced Medical Optics on December 1, 2008, the same day Abbott sent the company a preliminary takeover proposal. After more than 10 years with the Orioles, Murray, a first baseman, headed west to California, where he spent three seasons playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Next, he went to the New York Mets, then to the Cleveland Indians and briefly to the Angels, which were renamed the Anaheim Angels the year Murray played for them and are now called the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Murray, who hit 504 home runs in his career, is widely regarded as one of the best switch hitters, who can hit from either side of the plate. After he retired, Murray was the first base coach for the Dodgers. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2003. The baseball players are not the only group under scrutiny for allegedly trafficking in nonpublic information about the Advanced Medical Optics buyout, according to sources familiar with the investigation and court filings. There appear to have been leaks at many points along the way to the takeover, according to the sources and the court papers. Goldman Sachs provided investment banking services in the buyout of the medical device company. Reuters has reported that the SEC and federal investigators are looking at whether Goldman’s senior healthcare banker, Matthew Korenberg, passed on information about the deal to his friend Paul Yook, a healthcare analyst at Galleon Management. Korenberg’s lawyer, John Hueston, a partner at Irell & Manella, did not respond to a request for comment. He has previously told Reuters the investigation was “going nowhere.” DuVally, the Goldman spokesman, said: “Matt Korenberg remains actively employed by the firm.” Yook could not be reached for comment. In June 2011, Dean Goetz, a lawyer in Carlsbad, California, agreed to pay about $23,000 to settle SEC charges that he traded on secret information after learning about the Advanced Medical Optics deal by going through his daughter Amy’s papers without her knowledge, according the SEC’s complaint. Amy Goetz, also a lawyer, worked on the deal as an associate at Skadden. She is no longer with the big law firm and could not be reached for comment.

66,ABT,INSIGHT-Ex-Orioles player Eddie Murray is part of insider trading inquiry,"* Feds probe whether Murray traded on secret merger news * CEO of target, Advanced Medical Optics, also scrutinized * Multiple leaks, including from law firm, bank, are possible By Emily Flitter NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Hall of Fame baseball player Eddie Murray is one of several former professional athletes under investigation by federal authorities in a U.S. insider trading case stemming from the buyout of a medical device company, people familiar with the three-year-old probe said. Federal prosecutors and securities regulators are trying to determine whether Murray, a star slugger for the Baltimore Orioles, traded on inside information that Abbott Laboratories  was about to announce a deal in January 2009 to acquire Advanced Medical Optics for $2.8 billion, the sources said. Reuters previously reported on the investigation by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not identify any of the players under scrutiny. Murray, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. Michael Proctor, a lawyer who is representing Murray in the matter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Diane Hock, a lawyer who represents Murray in his post-baseball marketing deals, said she had heard about an investigation, but declined to comment further. The investigation involving Murray is related to the probe that led to the filing of a civil insider trading case against former Orioles player Doug DeCinces. In August 2011, DeCinces settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay $2.5 million in fines, while neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing in the trading of Advanced Medical Optics shares. DeCinces and Murray played together on the Orioles from 1977 to 1982. DeCinces’ lawyer did not respond to calls seeking comment.

71,ABT,Ablynx says top drug shows benefit over rival,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian drug developer Ablynx said on Monday its top drug, arthritis treatment ozoralizumab, had shown a benefit over its biggest rival in the $24 billion market for this class of treatment. The company, which makes ultra-small antibodies derived from llamas, said data showed few patients developed immunity to the drug, a problem which can affect its biggest rival Humira, produced by U.S. based Abbott Laboratories. “We believe that we now have the components of a much stronger and differentiating licensing package than we had previously,” Ablynx Chief Executive Edwin Moses said in a statement. It said the study, an expansion to a previous phase II trial, showed that less than 1 percent of patients had antibodies at the end of the treatment period. Abbott Laboratories has said antibodies developed in about 5 percent of adult rheumatoid arthritis patients who take Humira. Ablynx is in partnership discussions for ozoralizumab, which it said it hopes to conclude at the end of this year. “If your question is ‘does this have impact on partnering discussions’, yes, because they come with a stronger data package and there is some potential for differentiation,” says KBC Securities analyst Jan De Kerpel. It’s previous partner, U.S. based Pfizer, handed back rights to the drug last year, sending Ablynx’s shares down as much as 21 percent.

72,ABT,London Metal Exchange CEO expects bid vote approval,"* LME aims for shareholder vote in July * ICE chief says other opportunities for exchanges in OTC * Asia is next growth story for exchanges - Abbott By Maytaal Angel and Harpreet Bhal LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange’s (LME) chief executive is confident that its shareholders, with some persuasion, will approve a $2.2 billion offer by the Hong Kong stock exchange for the world’s biggest marketplace for industrial metals. “I think we will (get shareholder approval),” Martin Abbott said on the sidelines of the IDX International Derivatives Expo in London. “It’s a board recommendation and we wouldn’t have recommended something we weren’t confident about. But it doesn’t mean it’s a done deal. We have to get out there and talk to shareholders.” Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) said on June 15 it had agreed to pay 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) to buy the 135-year-old LME. The LME board unanimously backed the bid but the deal is still subject to approval by LME shareholders. Many shareholder members who own and use the exchange had feared a sale might alter its low fees and unique, complex structure of futures trading in copper, aluminium, lead, zinc, tin, nickel and other metals. But the mood appears to be shifting in favour of the HKEx deal, shareholders have said over the past week. Due to the lopsided spread of shareholdings between large and small members, the deal could fail if many small shareholders oppose the bid, which has to be approved by 75 percent of shares and 50 percent of shareholders. Abbott said the LME was aiming for a shareholder vote to take place next month. Sources close to the process have told Reuters the vote will take place in mid-July. HKEx beat U.S. commodities bourse InterContinental Exchange  in the final stages of a contest that began in September with around 15 expressions of interest. CME Group, which had been on the short list, dropped out of the process in May. ICE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Sprecher, also attending the IDX Expo in London, did not comment directly on losing the bid, but said there were plenty of other potential targets. Sprecher said in a panel discussion that regulatory changes meant “there’s a whole array of potential acquisitions for exchanges which exist around the over-the-counter markets.” The CME’s CEO Phupinder Gill, also attending the event, declined to comment on the LME. Abbott told the panel discussion the Hong Kong bid had been compelling because it took the LME closer to China, the world’s biggest metals buyer. “Asia is the next great growth story and also the biggest threat. When asked what was keeping me awake at night the answer was always the threat to us in Asia; that’s where our business was tilted,” he said. “If the constraints come off the Chinese domestic exchanges they will be a very, very serious force globally and we needed to step up our game to be ready to compete with them.” China accounts for 40 percent of copper consumption. Abbott downplayed worries about possible Chinese government meddling. “We are confident the Hong Kong exchange operates as an independent exchange,” he said. The Hong Kong government has a 5.8 percent holding in HKEx. Beijing has no stake in the company.",6262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/lme-approval/london-metal-exchange-ceo-expects-bid-vote-approval-idUSL6E8HQ6C120120626
73,ABT,Some companies pay more to CEOs than to Uncle Sam: study,"(Reuters) - Citigroup, Abbott Laboratories, and AT&T; are among the 26 companies that paid more to their CEOs in 2011 than they did in federal taxes, according to a study released on Thursday. Tax breaks on research and development, past losses, and foreign-held earnings were among those lightening the tax load for many companies on the list, said the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. Citi, Abbott and AT&T; all took issue with the institute’s methodology. All three said they paid all taxes owed in 2011. During a presidential election cycle in which wealth and taxes are often debated, the study’s authors said the U.S. tax code has become an enabler of large CEO pay, while also offering companies ways to reduce their tax bills. Four pay-related tax breaks combined to cost taxpayers $14 billion in uncollected federal taxes, the report said. The four included breaks dealing with performance-based chief executive pay and stock options, as well as the preferential 15 percent tax rate on carried interest enjoyed by private equity partners and other financiers, it said. Compensation for the 26 CEOs whose pay surpassed their companies’ corporate tax bills averaged $20.4 million, according to the study. That average was up 23 percent over last year. The average was also significantly higher than pay tracked by separate studies of broader groups. For instance, $10.3 million was the average 2011 direct compensation for 300 large-company CEOs tracked by pay consultants Hay Group. To get its list, the institute compared CEO pay to current U.S. taxes paid, excluding foreign and state and local taxes that may also have been paid, as well as deferred taxes that can often be far larger than current taxes paid. The group’s rationale was that U.S. taxes paid are the closest approximation available in public documents to what companies may have actually written in their checks for last year to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Among companies topping the institute’s list: * Citigroup, the financial services giant, with a tax refund of $144 million based on prior losses, paid CEO Vikram Pandit $14.9 million in 2011, despite an advisory vote against it by 55 percent of shareholders. * Telecoms group AT&T; paid CEO Randall Stephenson $18.7 million, but was entitled to a $420 million tax refund thanks to billions in tax savings from recent rules accelerating depreciation of assets. * Drugmaker Abbott Laboratories paid CEO Miles White $19 million, while garnering a $586 million refund. Abbott has 64 subsidiaries in 16 countries considered by authorities to be tax havens, the institute said. “This is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts,” Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel said. He said Abbott did not get a rebate, but paid the U.S. government $700 million in federal income taxes in 2011, and that the report’s numbers reflect a non-cash accounting adjustment caused by the resolution of various tax matters. A Citigroup spokeswoman said that, while the company did not pay federal income tax in 2011, that was due to substantial losses it recorded in 2008 and 2009, a break available to all businesses in similar straits. She also noted that Citi paid on average $3.7 billion a year in federal income taxes from 2000 to 2006, and paid other taxes last year, including more than $3 billion in payroll taxes, and that Pandit voluntarily took a salary of just $1 in 2010. AT&T; said in a statement its CEO’s pay was closely tied to performance and was fair, and that the accelerated deductions that lowered its federal taxes stemmed in part from $20 billion spent in support of the U.S. economy and jobs. The company reported paying $3.8 billion in other taxes last year, and hundreds of millions in federal income taxes in 2010. All the tax breaks identified in the study are legal and shareholders generally expect companies to take advantage of any reasonable tax breaks they can, said David Wise, a senior principal with Hay Group. If the tax code changed to eliminate pay-related deductions, like the stock option deduction, he said, “individual companies could navigate that fairly easily. But collectively, those dollars would add up and increase the tax base.” ",8162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tax-ceo/some-companies-pay-more-to-ceos-than-to-uncle-sam-study-idUSBRE87F04O20120816

The company confirmed that Gonzalez did not complete his college education or receive a college degree. Abbott has since changed the educational credits in Gonzalez’s biography on its website, which now says he was a research biochemist at the University of Miami School of Medicine and attended the University of Houston, majoring in biochemistry. “It was an administrative error when the bio was written many years ago. It wasn’t identified right away,” Abbott spokeswoman Melisa Brotz said in a telephone interview. “The information on the website is correct. When we became aware of it we corrected it promptly,” Brotz said, adding that the changes were made “quite a while ago.” The company is firmly standing behind Gonzalez, and said there was no deliberate attempt to overstate his educational credentials. “There is no issue with respect to Mr. Gonzalez’s educational background or his ability to lead AbbVie as evidenced by his distinguished 30-year career in which he has reached the highest levels of the company,” Brotz said. Abbott Chief Executive Miles White selected the 58-year-old Gonzalez to head up the new company after the spinoff, which is set for January 1. White will remain in charge of Abbott, which will retain the medical devices, diagnostics, nutritionals and branded generics businesses.

Crain’s Chicago Healthcare first reported the discrepancy on Thursday, saying Abbott regulatory filings from 2002 through 2007 said Gonzalez had a bachelor’s degree from Houston and a Masters from Miami, both in biochemistry. The company has since changed the educational credits in Gonzalez’s biography on its website, which now says he was a research biochemist at the University of Miami School of Medicine and attended the University of Houston, majoring in biochemistry. “It was an administrative error when the bio was written many years ago. It wasn’t identified right away,” Abbott spokeswoman Melisa Brotz said in a telephone interview. “The information on the website is correct. When we became aware of it we corrected it promptly,” Brotz said, adding that the changes were made “quite a while ago.” The company is firmly standing behind Gonzalez, and said there was no deliberate attempt to overstate his educational credentials. “There is no issue with respect to Mr. Gonzalez’s educational background or his ability to lead AbbVie as evidenced by his distinguished 30-year career in which he has reached the highest levels of the company,” Brotz said.

79,ABT,UPDATE 1-Investors may overlook Abbott executive's false degrees,"* Analysts see Gonzalez surviving resume errors * Precedent seen in case of former Bausch & Lomb CEO * Abbott shares off slightly after disclosure By Debra Sherman and Ransdell Pierson CHICAGO/NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories  veteran Richard Gonzalez may get a pass on his overstated educational credentials as investors focus instead on his 30-year-plus track record at the healthcare giant, analysts said on Friday. Gonzalez, 58, is the latest in a long line of executives who have been ensnared in controversies over inaccurate resumes. But while such disclosures have hastened the exit of some, including Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in May, analysts say Gonzalez’s successes over a long career at Abbott should spare him. “I really think it’s a non-event, given his long history and successful leadership at the firm. They’re making it sound like an administrative error by someone else, not him,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager for Gabelli Health and Wellness Trust Mutual Funds, which holds Abbott shares. Gonzalez was chosen to head the company’s new pharmaceutical spinoff AbbVie as of Jan. 1. On Thursday, the company said he did not complete his college education or receive a masters’ degree, as listed on his official biography in Abbott’s regulatory filings for several years. Abbott said the falsely reported degrees were due to “an administrative error,” and did not give further details on how it escaped notice by Gonzalez, other executives or company auditors. The company said it corrected the references some time back. “It’s a very insular, well-run company, and he’s proven himself over decades. It’s not like the new Yahoo CEO with an angry, activist shareholder,” said Jonas. “I think they just ride it out, let this die down in a month or two.” Abbott shares were off nearly 1 percent at $68.63 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Gonzalez, a former chief operating officer at Abbott, heads the company’s pharmaceuticals operations. Investors view him as a major contributor to Abbott’s steady profit and sales growth, which regularly outpaces its rivals. He is best known for building the company’s medical device business and has helped oversee development of rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira into an $8 billion-a-year product that is still growing at a breakneck pace. “I’ve known Rick for 15-plus years. He’s extremely capable and has proven himself over a long, distinguished career,” said JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein. “If he were an unknown, an outsider the board had just brought in to run AbbVie, it would be one thing, but this is a long-time leader at Abbott. Rick should have, and I fully expect does have, the board’s full support.” The healthcare industry has its own precedent for judging an executive by his more recent past, rather than an unearned degree from decades ago. Ronald Zarella, when he was chairman and CEO of Bausch & Lomb, cited an MBA from New York University’s Stern School of Business, which he attended between 1972 and 1976 but from which he never received the degree. The overstated claim was exposed in 2002, yet Zarella remained CEO of the contact lens maker until 2008. Fred Burke, head of investments at Sandy Spring Bank, said he was surprised by Abbott’s misstep. “In many ways, they are very thorough,” he said. “They will probably just let this pass” because of Gonzalez’s strong record there. “Whatever (Gonzalez) is doing, he’s doing it right.” Damien Conover, an analyst with Morningstar, said Gonzalez may face some backlash, but even then he doesn’t expect it to impact the company’s plans or the reputation of Abbott CEO Miles White. “I don’t think there is any difference in how people view the company or Abbott’s stock,” he said.",9282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/hold-for-la-abbott-executive-resume/update-1-investors-may-overlook-abbott-executives-false-degrees-idUSL1E8KSC6220120928

83,ABT,Abbott oral hepatitis C regimen cure rate high: study,"(Reuters) - An all oral regimen of experimental hepatitis C medicines developed by Abbott Laboratories led to high cure rates in both new patients and those for whom prior treatment failed, according to initial results from a midstage study. Shares of Abbott rose more than 3 percent after the unveiling of the data, which will be presented next month at a major liver disease meeting. The findings should help cement Abbott as a major player in the race to develop an interferon-free treatment regimen for the serious liver disease. After 12 weeks of treatment with three Abbott direct-acting antiviral medicines plus the older drug ribavirin, 99 percent of previously untreated patients and 93 percent of those who did not respond to older drugs achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured, according to available data from a brief summary, or abstract, of the study. Abbott will present much more detail on the Phase II study involving data from more patients at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Boston. “The data looks very good on efficacy and I didn’t see anything that really caught my eye as far as side effects,” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. Based on the results, Abbott said it would test its three drugs, each of which attacks the virus using a different approach, both with and without ribavirin in a large Phase III program aimed at gaining approval for the treatment. “The ability to show a sustained virological response in these patient populations without the use of interferon is extremely encouraging,” Scott Brun, Abbott’s head of infectious disease development, said in a statement. A pair of new hepatitis C drugs approved last year significantly boosted cure rates and cut treatment duration to as low as 24 weeks for some patients. But those must still be taken with interferon, an injected drug that often causes severe flu-like symptoms that lead many hepatitis patients to delay or discontinue treatment. Several companies, including Gilead Sciences Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, are racing to develop interferon-free treatment regimens expected to bring in billions of dollars in revenue once approved. Most analysts view Gilead as current leader both on timing and perceived advantages of its experimental hepatitis C program. “One of the questions lingering here is whether these (Abbott) drugs can be used without ribavirin,” Conover said. “Gilead’s drug works pretty well without it, so it’s going to be a pretty big competitive hurdle if they have to use ribavirin.” While not as onerous as interferon, ribavirin also has side effects that doctors and patients would like to avoid if possible. The Abbott drugs, a protease inhibitor called ABT-450, a polymerase inhibitor ABT-333 and ABT-267 from a class known as NS5A inhibitors, were given along with ribavirin for just 12 weeks. Patients in whom the virus was undetectable 12 weeks after stopping treatment were considered cured. Based on available data at the time the abstract was submitted for the liver meeting, 76 of 77 previously untreated patients and 38 of 41 prior null responders had achieved SVR. Null responders, while a much smaller market than new patients, have been notoriously difficult to treat. “The data presented so far appear to be very favorable in these early trials and we’ll look for more extensive data at AASLD,” JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein said in a research note, adding that he expects Abbott’s hepatitis C program to reach the market by 2015. One subject in the new patient group had a disease relapse after treatment and three of the prior null responders experienced viral breakthrough, meaning the virus levels rose during treatment after an initial response. The most common side effects were fatigue and headache in both groups. Of five reported serious adverse events, one - joint pain - was deemed to be possibly caused by study drugs, the company said. Abbott shares were up $2.29, or 3.3 percent, at $71.57 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange after rising to a new high of $71.99 earlier.

85,ABT,Texas acts to defend cheerleaders' use of religious messages,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The state of Texas is seeking to intervene in a lawsuit on behalf of a high school cheerleading team fighting to continue featuring religious messages on banners at football games, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said on Wednesday. The cheerleaders and their parents filed a lawsuit against the school district of the East Texas town of Kountze after the district banned religious messages on the banners. Abbott and Texas Governor Rick Perry told reporters at a state Capitol press conference that they will work to ensure the cheerleaders’ freedom of expression. They sat in front of photos of football players taking the field by tearing through a banner held by cheerleaders that said: “If God is for us, who can be against us?” A petition filed with Texas District Court of Hardin County by Abbott said the state was seeking to intervene in order to defend the constitutionality of Texas statutes. The petition said, “The State also has an interest in defending laws that were specifically enacted to preserve religious liberty, because a challenge to those laws could potentially erode the religious liberties of all Texans.” The school district banned the religious messages after a Wisconsin group that seeks to enforce the separation of church and state sent a letter to the school superintendent, saying the banners represented an illegal endorsement of religion by a public entity. “We will not allow atheist groups from outside of the state of Texas to come into the state to use menacing and misleading intimidation tactics to try to bully schools to bow down at the altar of secular beliefs,” Abbott said on Wednesday. The cheerleaders produce the banners on their own time with private supplies, he said. Last month, the cheerleaders won a temporary order allowing the continued use of religious messages on the banners. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Thursday. Kountze, which is about 90 miles northeast of Houston near the Louisiana state line, has about 2,100 residents. “As government leaders, we owe it to people of all religions to protect expressions of faith, to ensure everyone has the right to voice their opinions and worship as they see fit,” said Perry, who, like Abbott, is a Republican. The Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation has said it was acting on the complaint of a concerned Kountze resident.

89,ABT,CORRECTED-Abbott $7.70bn tender to be funded by AbbVie,"(Corrects tender size to $7.70bn vs $10.55bn) By Andrea Johnson Oct 26 (IFR) - Healthcare products-maker Abbott said on Friday it has commenced cash tender offers for $7.70 billion of outstanding notes as part of its plan to split the company in two. The Illinois-based company is tendering for nine series of notes as it gears up for the spin-off of its proprietary  pharmaceuticals business into a company to be called AbbVie. At the same time, it is creating a company that will retain the Abbott name and focus on medical devices, diagnostics and nutritional products. It appears as though a big deal could be looming for AbbVie. The tender, which expires at 5pm New York Central time on Nov 8 unless extended by Abbott, will be funded with a portion of an $8.5 billion dividend the ‘new’ Abbot expects to receive from AbbVie. Management has indicated that AbbVie is expected to raise just under $16 billion in debt.  As a big chunk of that will have to be done quickly because of the tender, it seems likely a sizeable AbbVie deal is on the way. AbbVie expects to launch an offering of debt securities in order to finance the dividend to Abbott, according to the tender offer. Abbott expects the AbbVie notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A, and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Reg S. Dealer managers for the tender offer — who are likely to be involved as leads on the new AbbVie deal —  are Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. Moody’s on Thursday assigned a Baa1 first-time issuer rating to AbbVie and rated Abbot Labs A1 with a stable outlook, revised from negative. Standard & Poor’s on Friday rated the new AbbVie at A, and lowered the rating on Abbott Labs to A+ from AA. AbbVie will trade under the ticker symbol ABBV.

92,ABT,Abbott pharma spinoff completes record $14.7 billion debt sale,"(Adds detail, comment) By Andrea Johnson and Christopher Reich NEW YORK, Nov 5 (IFR) - Abbott’s new pharmaceuticals business AbbVie Inc completed the biggest ever dollar-denominated debt issue in the US high-grade market on Monday, raising $14.7 billion in a six-part deal. AbbVie, which will house Abbott’s (ABT.N) proprietary pharmaceuticals business as part of the company’s plan to split into two, sold notes with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years. The “old” Abbott will focus on the company’s medical devices, diagnostics and nutritional product businesses. The deal came on a record day for dollar volume, with issuers selling a staggering $22.1 billion of debt on the eve of one of the tightest presidential elections in memory. “With a deal of this size they could not afford to wait until after the election to get it done,” said an investment-grade corporate credit strategist who has covered the Abbott spinoff. “Whichever way the election goes it will have an effect on spreads, and Abbott couldn’t afford to take a punt on the market changing.” Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale were active bookrunners on the Baa1/A rated deal. Demand from investors was exceptionally strong, with book size heard as high as $47 billion. “We’re not too surprised to read that demand is high,” said Carol Levenson, credit strategist at Gimme Credit. “This deal was expected and provides a relatively rare opportunity to purchase a triple ‘B’ big pharma name.” Proceeds of the sale will be used to make a cash distribution to Abbott, as provided by the terms of the separation agreement, pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. Abbott last week said it had commenced a cash tender offering for $7.7 billion in outstanding notes. The previous record for a pure US dollar-denominated deal was held by two other pharmaceuticals companies, according to Thomson Reuters/IFR data: Roche ROG.VX, which sold a $13.5 billion five-part deal in February 2009, and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which issued a $13.5 billion four-part deal in March 2009. The Roche deal included a $3 billion one-year floater, which is too short a maturity to be counted toward the total. GE Capital is in second position with an $11 billion three-part deal from March 2002, followed by WorldCom’s $10.1 billion three-part deal from May 2001. The AbbVie deal also eclipses the $9.8 billion four-part deal brought by United Technologies in May 2012, which until Monday had been the biggest deal of the year. AbbVie sold $3.5 billion of three-year fixed-rated notes at Treasuries plus 85 basis points (bp), tighter than its launch price guidance of Treasuries plus 90 basis points area. It sold $500 million of three-year floating-rate notes at Libor plus 76bp, in line with guidance. The company also sold $4 billion of five-year notes at Treasuries plus 110bp, $1 billion of six-year notes at Treasuries plus 140bp, $3.1 billion of 10-year notes at Treasuries plus 130bp and $2.6 billion of 30-year notes at Treasuries plus 160bp.

Demand from investors was exceptionally strong, with book size heard as high as $47 billion. “We’re not too surprised to read that demand is high,” said Carol Levenson, credit strategist at Gimme Credit. “This deal was expected and provides a relatively rare opportunity to purchase a triple ‘B’ big pharma name.” Proceeds of the sale will be used to make a cash distribution to Abbott, as provided by the terms of the separation agreement, pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. Abbott last week said it had commenced a cash tender offering for $7.7 billion in outstanding notes. The previous record for a pure US dollar-denominated deal was held by two other pharmaceuticals companies, according to Thomson Reuters/IFR data: Roche, which sold a $13.5 billion five-part deal in February 2009, and Pfizer Inc, which issued a $13.5 billion four-part deal in March 2009. The Roche deal included a $3 billion one-year floater, which is too short a maturity to be counted toward the total. GE Capital is in second position with an $11 billion three-part deal from March 2002, followed by WorldCom’s $10.1 billion three-part deal from May 2001. The AbbVie deal also eclipses the $9.8 billion four-part deal brought by United Technologies in May 2012, which until Monday had been the biggest deal of the year. AbbVie sold $3.5 billion of three-year fixed-rated notes at Treasuries plus 85 basis points (bp), tighter than its launch price guidance of Treasuries plus 90 basis points area. It sold $500 million of three-year floating-rate notes at Libor plus 76bp, in line with guidance. The company also sold $4 billion of five-year notes at Treasuries plus 110bp, $1 billion of six-year notes at Treasuries plus 140bp, $3.1 billion of 10-year notes at Treasuries plus 130bp and $2.6 billion of 30-year notes at Treasuries plus 160bp.",11052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1E8M5EHN20121105

97,ABT,UPDATE 3-LME says proposal will help metals warehousing problem,"* New warehouse rule expected to take effect on April 1 * LME proposal seen as a modest concession By Silvia Antonioli and Maytaal Angel LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) expects proposed changes to its warehousing rules to go some way to solve problems in the network of warehouses it monitors, Chief Executive Martin Abbott said at a news conference on Friday. The LME proposed on Thursday a rule that warehousing companies that have 30,000 tonnes or more of a single metal in a queue should deliver out as much as an additional 500 tonnes per day of other metals stuck behind it in the queue. This should alleviate the effect that queues, particularly of aluminium, are having on other metals, the LME said. The London-based exchange currently allows warehouse operators, including banks and trade houses, to release only a small fraction, up to 3,000 tonnes, of their overall inventories each day. These rules - along with financing deals that tie up stocks for years and concentrate them in warehouses where rent is cheap - have caused long queues for delivery of metal to consumers and an artificial tightness in immediate supply that pushes up costs. In some warehouses, outward deliveries of a number of metals are being delayed by an inventory glut in aluminium, which would be described as the dominant metal. “If 500 tonnes doesn’t work, we will review it, but we expect it to work,” Abbott said. If adopted, the proposal would come into effect from April 1 next year. Analysts and traders said the move would not solve the problem of long queues but is nevertheless welcome. “What it does do is that for a modest amount of metal ... you can get it faster than you might ordinarily have expected given the various queues of metal,” Standard Bank analyst Leon Westgate said. “It’s a modest concession but we will see how it goes.” The LME, the world’s biggest base metals marketplace, has been reviewing warehouse load-out rates as it tries to deal with backlogs appearing across its global warehouse network. Stocks of metal, particularly aluminium, have built up sharply in recent years in storage hubs around the world. The best known is Detroit, which is dominated by Goldman Sachs’  warehouse subsidiary Metro, where the wait time to get metals stretches out for months. “Unfortunately when it was an isolated incident in Detroit, the LME could have looked at the situation and forced a rule change at that point,” said one metals trader. “But when they said there was nothing wrong and it was really the financiers who are causing the issue, it gave a green light to the other warehouses owned by powerhouses to go out there and create a similar situation,” the trader said. There are now also long wait times in the Dutch port of Vlissingen, where Glencore subsidiary Pacorini is the main operator, and Antwerp, where commodity trader Trafigura’s North European Marine Services warehousing unit operates. Abbott has long maintained that the queues in aluminium are a feature of the low-interest rate economic environment. Aluminum inventories in LME-registered warehouses are hovering around a record 5 million tonnes, and much of that is held as collateral for financing deals. Traders or banks buy the metal from producers and then sell it for future delivery to speculators at a profit, taking advantage of the ‘contango’ structure, in which futures prices are higher than spot prices for immediate delivery. The current low interest rates are important in striking a profitable deal. “We regard the presence of the aluminium queues as being a feature of the macroeconomic environment and not something that we can change,” Abbott said. “However, there is a danger that those aluminium factors may have an effect on other markets, which are not actually subject to the same macroeconomic factors.” The problem has caught the attention of the European Commission, which is gathering information on the issue, industry sources have told Reuters. Abbott said the commission had not approached the LME with any questions but added, “the door is open”. One way to pacify customers stung by the steep surcharges to get physical supply, which have resulted from the backlogs, would be to hedge those premiums, and banks are in talks on offering such a derivative. Abbott said the LME had chatted with consumers about premium contracts but did not believe that it would be a liquid enough market, while plans by banks to offer over-the-counter solutions  could work well as they can offer bespoke products.",11162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/lme-warehousing/update-3-lme-says-proposal-will-help-metals-warehousing-problem-idUSL5E8MG8DG20121116

The new entity, AbbVie, which will be an independent company with Abbott retaining no ownership stake, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, under the ticker symbol ABBV, the company said. Abbott will keep its medical devices, diagnostics and nutritionals businesses, as well as drugs that have lost patent protection. Most of AbbVie’s profit is expected to come from Humira, a nearly $9 billion-a-year rheumatoid arthritis drug whose sales continue to grow by leaps and bounds Many industry analysts have expressed concern the new company will be too reliant on Humira and that the drug’s sales growth could be crimped by new treatments - including Pfizer’s recently approved pill Xeljanz. AbbVie will also take ownership of Abbott’s array of experimental drugs, including promising new hepatitis C treatments. Richard Gonzalez, a long-time Abbott senior executive, will become CEO of the new company. One of his biggest challenges will be to successfully develop AbbVie’s experimental drugs and acquire promising medicines that can lessen AbbVie’s dependence on Humira. Abbott shares rose slightly in after-hours trading, from their closing price of $64.57 Wednesday on the NYSE.

103,ABT,UPDATE 1-S.Africa awards $667 mln HIV drugs supply contract,"* Aspen warded 20 percent of contract * Adcock Ingram gets 14 percent JOHANNESBURG, Nov 29 (Reuters) - South Africa on Thursday awarded a $667 million contract to supply life-prolonging HIV medicine to 12 international and domestic firms, to deal with its biggest health problem. Companies that include Aspen Pharmacare, Abbott Laboratories and Adcock Ingram would share the contract, the health department said. The 5.9 billion rand ($667 million) contract, effective from April next year, aims to increase the number of people on treatment by nearly 50 percent, to 2.5 million next year. South Africa has nearly 6 million people infected with HIV — one of the heaviest caseloads in the world. It also has one of largest treatment programmes. But drug makers are unlikely to rake in big profits from the government award, analysts have ssaid, given the stiff  competition in the bidding. The health department said it saved 2.2 billion rand on the new contract, which it initially expected it would cost 8.1 billion rand. Aspen Pharmacare, the country’s biggest generic drugs maker, was awarded 20 percent of the contract while its closest domestic rival, Adcock Ingram was given 14 percent, the health department said.

109,ABT,UPDATE 4-AbbVie forecasts slower Humira growth,"* 2013 EPS forecast, excluding items, $3.03 to $3.13 per share * Street’s earnings-per-share forecast: $3.08 * AbbVie shares fall 0.8 pct By Ransdell Pierson Jan 30 (Reuters) - AbbVie, the pharmaceuticals business spun off earlier this month by Abbott Laboratories , forecast 2013 earnings in line with Wall Street forecasts but slowing sales growth for Humira, its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug. The company on Wednesday said it expects low double-digit sales growth for Humira this year. Sales of the drug, by far the company’s biggest product, jumped 17 percent last year to $9.27 billion. “Their Humira growth forecast is a little less than people expected, but our view is that it’s a conservative estimate,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Conover said he expects Humira’s sales to climb 17 percent in 2013, matching the growth seen in 2012. He noted that Abbott had been known for issuing its own conservative Humira forecasts, with actual growth typically outpacing projections. Industry analysts, during a conference call with AbbVie executives, expressed concern that Humira’s track record of strong growth could become a “curse” once it slows down. AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez replied that Humira should have “robust” growth for the foreseeable future. One of the biggest concerns among investors is that a new oral treatment for rheumatoid arthritis from Pfizer Inc  called Xeljanz could slow the growth of Humira, which is given by injection. Gonzalez said AbbVie has been tracking sales of Xeljanz since it was approved in November, and is not overly concerned about its potential threat. “We don’t see any trends there that are troublesome,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie said it expects full-year 2013 earnings of $3.03 to $3.13 per share, excluding special items. Analysts, on average expected $3.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AbbVie said it expects net earnings this year of $2.66 to $2.76 per share. It forecast 2013 sales somewhat above $18 billion, similar to sales for its products last year, as generic competition hits demand for its drugs to control cholesterol. The company said it is counting on approvals of new medicines that could drive company growth by the second half of 2015. Abbott last week said global fourth-quarter sales of branded drugs that now belong to AbbVie rose 7.4 percent to $5.14 billion. That topped estimates of some industry analysts, including Wells Fargo’s Larry Biegelsen, who had expected $4.8 billion. The rise would have been 8.5 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Quarterly sales of Humira jumped 23 percent to $2.68 billion, about $200 million above some analyst forecasts. The growth was a marked acceleration from the prior two quarters and underscores how reliant AbbVie is on Humira, which is expected this year to become the world’s top-selling medicine. The company’s second-biggest product is AndroGel, a testosterone gel to treat conditions that result from a lack of the male hormone. It had fourth-quarter sales of $373 million. AbbVie said it plans to steadily increase dividends, but expects no major share-repurchase initiatives in the short or long term. Company executives also said they are not on the hunt for big acquisitions, but are interested in smaller “tuck in” deals. Abbott, nicknamed “new Abbott,” continues to sell medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and generic drugs. It and AbbVie are both located in suburban Chicago.

113,ABT,Heart stent with new polymer matches Abbott top seller in study,"(Reuters) - A drug-coated heart stent from Japan’s Terumo Corp with a dissolving polymer proved just as effective as Abbott Laboratories’ top-selling Xience stent at preventing a second procedure to clear the artery, a large study found. Stents are small wire-mesh structures inserted into narrowed coronary arteries to restore proper blood flow. Many models are coated with a polymer that slowly releases a drug designed to prevent another blockage and repeat procedure. New drug-coated stents with dissolving polymers are being developed in response to data showing the older so-called durable polymers may trigger an inflammatory reaction that raises a patient’s stroke risk. In the study of more than 3,200 patients, Terumo’s Nobori stent met its primary goal of non-inferiority to the Xience stent one year after implantation, with 4.2 percent of patients in both groups requiring a repeat procedure. Patients also had low similar rates of stent thrombosis, or device-related blood clot formation, with both the Nobori and Xience stents. The study, sponsored by Terumo and conducted by researchers at Kyoto University, was presented Sunday at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in San Francisco.

115,ABT,FDA staff does not recommend approval of Abbott's heart device,"(Reuters) - Staff reviewers for the Food and Drug Administration did not recommend the approval of Abbott Laboratories’ implantable heart device MitraClip, citing a lack of “valid scientific evidence” of safety and effectiveness. FDA reviewers said in briefing documents, posted on the regulator’s website on Monday, that approval of the device would not be appropriate at the time as major questions of safety, efficacy and overall benefit-risk profile remained unanswered. The device is being tested to treat mitral valve insufficiency - a disorder where a heart valve does not close properly when the heart pumps blood, causing blood to flow back into the heart - in patients considered high risk for open surgery. The device is inserted into the blood stream using a catheter. “The FDA staff is asking for more information. Abbott is conducting multiple trials on MitraClip, including the COAPT study, and the staff would want to look at that data,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said. The COAPT trial is testing the device in high-risk inoperable and high-risk mitral valve patients. Abbott has also recently developed a European trial for the patient population. Abbott had changed the proposed use for the device after the FDA expressed concerns that there was a lack of evidence to support its approval for a broader use in patients with significant mitral valve insufficiency, the reviewers said in the documents. (link.reuters.com/kyf76t) “FDA firmly believes that the currently enrolling COAPT and European trials are well-designed trials that will help to answer the many important questions posed by the very limited data analyses presented in this (approval application),” the reviewers said. However, the reviewers recommended that MitraClip continue to remain available to high-risk patients as an investigational device so that Abbott can conduct its trials in an optimal manner. “The MitraClip device represents a true advance for (high-risk) patients and we look forward to discussing the totality of the clinical evidence with the advisory committee members and hearing their recommendations on Wednesday,” Abbott said in an emailed statement to Reuters. An advisory panel of independent experts will discuss the data submitted by Abbott on the device and will vote on its safety, efficacy and risk profile. BMO’s Wuensch said her earnings estimate on Abbott did not include any expected revenue from MitraClip, adding that she believed the Street consensus also excluded any potential sales from the device.

FDA reviewers said in briefing documents, posted on the regulator’s website on Monday, that approval of the device would not be appropriate at the time as major questions of safety, efficacy and overall benefit-risk profile remained unanswered. The device is being tested to treat mitral valve insufficiency - a disorder where a heart valve does not close properly when the heart pumps blood, causing blood to flow back into the heart - in patients considered high risk for open surgery. The device is inserted into the blood stream using a catheter. “The FDA staff is asking for more information. Abbott is conducting multiple trials on MitraClip, including the COAPT study, and the staff would want to look at that data,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said. The COAPT trial is testing the device in high-risk inoperable and high-risk mitral valve patients. Abbott has also recently developed a European trial for the patient population. Abbott had changed the proposed use for the device after the FDA expressed concerns that there was a lack of evidence to support its approval for a broader use in patients with significant mitral valve insufficiency, the reviewers said in the documents. () “FDA firmly believes that the currently enrolling COAPT and European trials are well-designed trials that will help to answer the many important questions posed by the very limited data analyses presented in this (approval application),” the reviewers said. However, the reviewers recommended that MitraClip continue to remain available to high-risk patients as an investigational device so that Abbott can conduct its trials in an optimal manner. “The MitraClip device represents a true advance for (high-risk) patients and we look forward to discussing the totality of the clinical evidence with the advisory committee members and hearing their recommendations on Wednesday,” Abbott said in an emailed statement to Reuters. An advisory panel of independent experts will discuss the data submitted by Abbott on the device and will vote on its safety, efficacy and risk profile. BMO’s Wuensch said her earnings estimate on Abbott did not include any expected revenue from MitraClip, adding that she believed the Street consensus also excluded any potential sales from the device. Abbott shares were down 1.2 percent at $33.72 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.",3182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/abbott-fda-mitralvalvedevice/update-1-fda-staff-does-not-recommend-approval-of-abbotts-heart-device-idUSL3N0CA2SA20130318

118,ABT,FDA advisers vote for approval of Abbott's implantable heart device,"(Reuters) - A slim majority of advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted on Wednesday for approval of Abbott Laboratories’ implantable heart device MitraClip, saying it had more benefits than risks. The eight members of the advisory panel voted unanimously to recommend the device’s safety. However, in a tie-breaker vote it voted 5-4 against the question of whether there was a reasonable assurance MitraClip would be effective for its intended use. Overall, the members voted 5-3 to agree that the device’s benefits outweighed its risks. The recommendation comes as a surprise after FDA staff reviewers made negative comments about MitraClip on Monday, seeking more data to show the device’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA usually takes its advisers’ votes into consideration when it decides on whether to approve a device for sale. In a statement, Abbott said it expects the FDA’s final decision later this year. “We look forward to continuing discussions with the agency regarding the panel’s comments,” Charles Simonton, chief medical officer at Abbott Vascular, said in a statement. MitraClip, which is currently selling in 30 countries, treats mitral regurgitation, a condition in which the mitral valve of the heart does not close properly, causing blood leakage that can lead to stroke, heart attack or even death. MitraClip works by clipping the leaflets of the leaky mitral valve and is designed for use only in those patients with the condition who are considered high-risk for open-heart surgery.

120,ABT,"Abbott hits mark, but devices, generics struggle","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) on Wednesday reported higher quarterly earnings after splitting off its branded drug business, and the company said demand was strong for its infant formulas and diagnostic products. But first-quarter sales slumped for medical devices and generic prescription drugs, which together represent half of the company’s revenue. Abbott, whose shares rose nearly 3 percent, reported a quarterly profit of $544 million, or 34 cents per share, from continuing operations, compared with $351 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit and other special items, the suburban Chicago company earned 42 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 41 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This looks like a solid start to 2013,” said Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Rick Wise, who described results as “in-line” with expectations. Sales rose 1.8 percent to $5.38 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations of $5.41 billion. Abbott at the beginning of the year spun off its array of branded drugs, those that still have patent protection, into a new company called AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N). In doing so, it gave up Humira, a $9 billion-a-year treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that for years had been its cash cow. Sales of Abbott’s nutritional products, including its Similac infant formula, rose 8.7 percent to $1.7 billion, with about 45 percent of revenue coming from China and other emerging markets. Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White said emerging markets, which have growing numbers of middle-class customers, were a linchpin of demand for its products. “Even a bad day in an emerging market looks better than a good day in a developed market,” White said in a conference call with analysts. Sales of diagnostic products rose 4.4 percent to $1.09 billion, but would have been up 6.4 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Abbott cited strong demand in China, Russia, Brazil and other emerging markets. But sales of medical devices fell 4.6 percent to $1.33 billion, with revenue from stents and related vascular products down almost 8 percent to $742 million due largely to price pressures in the United States. Medical optics and diabetes products showed modest declines. Abbott said sales of generic drugs, which it calls established pharmaceuticals, declined 1.9 percent to $1.23 billion. The company said it still expected full-year earnings of $1.98 to $2.04 per share, excluding special items. Shares of Abbott were up 2.7 percent at $37.40 in morning trading.

The companies said they were cooperating with China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in its investigation into possible price-fixing and anti-competitive practices. Mead Johnson, whose shares were down about 6 percent in New York, said it was “fully cooperating” with the antitrust review and would provide information in response to inquiries received from government officials. Officials at Danone, Abbott, Nestle and Wyeth Nutrition also said they were cooperating. Officials at the NDRC were not available to comment. Abbott shares were down 0.8 percent in afternoon trade in New York, while Danone shares closed down 1.5 percent in Paris. Nestle shares fell 0.8 percent. Foreign infant formula is highly coveted in China, since public trust was damaged by a 2008 tainted infant formula scandal that left at least six children dead. Foreign brands now account for about half of total sales. The Beijing Times, which first reported the probe, said the investigations came to light after a Hong Kong-listed infant nutrition manufacturer Biostime International Holdings  said last Thursday that its Guangzhou unit was under investigation by the NDRC for an alleged violation of China anti-monopoly law. “The main purpose of the investigation is in relation to an alleged violation of Article 14 of Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China by Biostime Guangzhou in managing the market sales prices at which the distributors and retail sales organizations sell our products,” the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

129,ABT,"Abbott profit beats forecast, nutritional products strong","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Wednesday as strong demand for nutritional products offset lower sales of medical devices and generic prescription drugs. Despite the earnings beat, Abbott left its full-year profit forecast unchanged at $1.98 to $2.04 per share. Results beat expectations because of improved profit margins and cost controls, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note. Sales of nutritional products, including Similac infant formula and Ensure beverages for adults, rose 7.9 percent to $1.7 billion, representing almost a third of Abbott’s total revenue. Abbott and rival infant formula makers, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN.N, Danone SA (DANO.PA) and Nestle SA NESN.VX, have cut prices of their products in recent weeks following an investigation by China into possible price-fixing and anti-competitive behavior. Abbott formulas have annual sales of about $400 million in China, representing about 2 percent of overall company sales. Abbott Chief Executive Miles White on Wednesday said the investigations are unlikely to derail growing demand in China for the products. “I think the market dynamics remain robust,” White said. “And fortunately for us, China doesn’t represent a disproportionately large portion of the nutrition business.” Glenn Novarro, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said Abbott shares had dipped as much as five percent in the past month on concerns about the China investigation and price cuts, and are a buying opportunity. Abbott’s profit margins improved during the quarter in part because the company is building its nutritionals factories closer to customers in emerging markets, said Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Rick Wise. “So they’re reducing transportation costs.” Abbott, which in January spun off its branded prescription drugs business into a new company called AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N), earned $476 million, or 30 cents per share, from continuing operations in the quarter, up from $411 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, profit was 46 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

134,ABT,Australia's Greens poised to frustrate new government,"* Greens poised to block conservative agenda after election * Conservative Tony Abbott on track to win power on Sept. 7 * Greens leader, Abbott haven’t spoken to each other By James Grubel CANBERRA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Australia is poised to elect a conservative government on Saturday, but the minor Greens party is aiming to use its deciding votes in the upper house to block the new government’s bid to throw out a carbon tax and a tax on mining profits. Greens leader Christine Milne’s campaign for the Sept. 7 election has been based wholly upon a likely conservative win, promising to “Abbott-proof” the upper house Senate and reject his central policies. That means Abbott’s main promises, to scrap the carbon tax and a tax on iron ore and coal mine profits, may be blocked in parliament, particularly in the first 12 months, unless the current Labor government abandons its position. Adding to the cloudy political outlook is the fact Abbott, who has led his party since December 2009, has made no secret of his disdain for the Greens and their policies against mining and in favour of higher taxes on the wealthy and big business. Milne is facing her first election as leader after she replaced long-standing Greens leader Bob Brown early in 2012. Brown’s deal with Labor’s then prime minister, Julia Gillard, to put a price on carbon was a landmark achievement for the party, and Milne is in no mood to see it scrapped. “There is no way I will be repealing any of the clean energy package,” Milne told Reuters. “You’ll see billions taken out of or stalled investment if Abbott gets in. I’m not going to stand there and allow that to happen.” Milne said she had never had a conversation with Abbott although she had met him once at a charity ball in mid-2012. Opinion polls show Abbott’s Liberal-National Party coalition will romp to a solid victory on Saturday, with the latest Newspoll giving the opposition 54 percent of the two-party vote compared with 46 percent for the ruling Labor Party. The Greens are polling about 10 percent of the primary vote, slightly down on the 2010 election. But only three of the Greens’ nine Senators are facing re-election, meaning even a wipe out on Saturday would leave six Greens in the Senate. The Senate voting system also means any Senators who lose will not leave parliament until July 1, 2014, meaning the Greens will control swing votes between the major parties for much of the next year, and possibly until July 2017. Milne also said the Greens would stand firm on the repeal of the 30 percent tax on iron ore and coal mine profits, adding she would seek to increase the tax to 40 percent and expand it to other minerals, including gold. “If he brings in a mining tax bill, we will oppose its repeal,” she said. For his part, Abbott is banking on the Labor Party to give him a clear run to abolish the carbon and mining taxes if he wins, even though he has rejected all of Labor’s legislation since he became opposition leader in late 2009. Abbott on Monday repeated that the election would be a referendum on the carbon tax, and Labor should respect the decision of voters. Labor is refusing to say what it will do should it lose power. “It’s unimaginable that a defeated Labor Party would persist with a carbon tax,” Abbott told the National Press Club on Monday. “Within a year, the carbon tax will be gone.” Milne said her party would also push for stronger scrutiny of foreign investment and for a new government to reject the Archer Daniels Midland $3.1 billion bid to buy grain handler GrainCorp <GNC. AX>. The rural-based National Party also opposes the plan.

135,ABT,"Australia's new PM Abbott unveils cabinet, to be sworn in Wednesday","CANBERRA, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Australia’s new conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott unveiled his first cabinet on Monday, using the appointment of experienced lawmakers to promise a stable government after three years of minority rule. Abbott, who won power on a promise to focus on economic management, made only minor changes to his opposition line-up, with Joe Hockey appointed Treasurer, as expected, while Mathias Cormann becomes Finance Minister, shifting from his assistant treasury portfolio. Abbott’s Deputy Liberal Party leader Julie Bishop will become Foreign Minister, and will be the only woman in Abbott’s 20-member cabinet, although several women were promoted to junior ministries. “It is, I believe, one of the most experienced incoming ministries in our history, and I think it’s important to have experience as you move from opposition to government,” Abbott said, in his first news conference since Sept. 7 elections. Abbott will become Australia’s third prime minister in three months when he is sworn into power by the country’s governor-general on Wednesday. He won a commanding majority in parliament on Sept. 7 on a platform to scrap taxes on carbon pollution and iron ore and coal mine profits. After the previous Labor government switched prime ministers twice in three years, Abbott has promised a methodical government with no surprises. Abbott’s first cabinet also shifted trade responsibility from the minority National Party in his ruling coalition, which has pushed for tighter rules on foreign investment in farms, handing the job to veteran Liberal Party colleague Andrew Robb.",9162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/australia-politics/australias-new-pm-abbott-unveils-cabinet-to-be-sworn-in-wednesday-idUSL3N0HC03820130916
136,ABT,"Abbott surprises with huge dividend boost, shares jump","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, helped by strong demand for its diagnostics, and surprised investors with a dividend increase of more than 50 percent. Lower taxes and cost-cutting also helped Abbott beat earnings forecasts, analysts said. The company’s shares jumped 5 percent in afternoon trading to $35.42. “The 57 percent dividend hike is the big news,” Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a research note. Abbott said it would boost its dividend to 22 cents per share from 14 cents, starting with the February 15 payment. RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said the dividend’s annual yield will grow to 2.7 percent and will likely attract investors following recent declines in Abbott shares related to worries about weakness in its nutritional products business. “The dividend was a double surprise because of its size and because the company had not signaled they would raise it in the near term,” Novarro said. Abbott, which spun off its branded prescription drugs business in January into a separate publicly traded company called AbbVie Inc, reported third-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $773 million, or 49 cents per share. That compared with $339 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier, when Abbott incurred big expenses for cost-reduction programs and other initiatives. Excluding special items, Abbott earned 55 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected 51 cents. Overall revenue rose 2 percent to $5.37 billion, a bit shy of Wall Street forecasts for $5.39 billion. Sales would have risen 4.3 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Despite beating earnings forecasts, Abbott left its full-year profit view unchanged at $1.98 to $2.04 per share, excluding special items. “They’re guiding conservatively given the current general macroeconomic situation,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau, who has a “buy” rating on Abbott shares. “The quarter highlights overall strength of the company, including its strong medical device business and its international presence, including growth in emerging markets.” Sales of nutritional products, including Similac infant formula and Ensure beverages for adults, rose 1.9 percent to $1.64 billion in the third quarter. That represents a slowdown from growth of 7.9 percent in the second quarter. In August Abbott recalled batches of its milk formula brands in China and Vietnam due to fears that protein concentrate, an ingredient provided by an outside supplier, was contaminated. Although no contamination was ever found, Abbott on Wednesday said the disruption reduced sales of its nutritional products for infants and children by $90 million in the third quarter. It said sales of the products will continue to be hurt through the first half of 2014. “But Abbott signaled that the nutritional issues will be short-term and that they are investing there (in Asia) to mitigate them,” said Tim Nelson, a healthcare analyst with Nuveen Asset Management. Sales of Abbott diagnostics rose 8 percent to $1.13 billion, while sales of its medical devices climbed 1.9 percent to $1.34 billion. But sales of its generic prescription drugs, which it calls established pharmaceuticals, fell 2.9 percent to $1.24 billion.

139,ABT,FDA approves Abbott device for leaking heart valve,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Abbott Laboratories’ MitraClip medical device, used to stop heart valve leakage in patients deemed unable to endure valve repair through open heart surgery, the company said on Friday. The MitraClip treats mitral regurgitation, a condition in which the mitral valve of the heart does not close properly, causing blood leakage that can lead to stroke, heart attack or even death. It has estimated the disorder affects about one in 10 people aged 75 and older. Those with the condition who are too frail for open heart surgery are typically treated with medicines and have high rates of heart failure and rehospitalizations. “We think longer term in the U.S., (MitraClip) could be a $500 million product,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro. “This approval is sooner than we thought. It’s a pleasant surprise.” Novarro said the timing of the FDA green light was excellent as it came just ahead of a major U.S. medical meeting for interventional cardiologists where Abbott will be able to showcase the device. A panel of advisers to the FDA in March voted 5-3 to recommend approval of the implantable heart device. Some panel members questioned whether MitraClip would be effective. The MitraClip was approved in Europe in 2008 under a system in which medical devices often reach the market several years ahead of the United States. International sales are running at about $30 million a quarter, with sales growth at about 50 percent over 2012, Abbott said. U.S. sales are likely to grow slowly at first as the company seeks reimbursement for the device, primarily from the Medicare healthcare program, and as more physicians are trained in its use. The MitraClip is implanted using a minimally invasive procedure in which it is threaded by catheter through a vein into place in the heart to stop the leak. There are currently 50 centers in the United States that have experience with the device through clinical trials. That number is expected to double over the next year, John Capek, Abbott’s head of medical devices, said in an interview. There are 20,000 to 30,000 patients in the United States who would likely qualify for MitraClip implantation, Capek said.

141,ABT,Abbott Labs settles with U.S. over kickback claims,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) has agreed to pay the United States $5.48 million to resolve allegations that it paid improper kickbacks to induce doctors to use some of its products, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday. The settlement resolves allegations that Abbott paid well-known doctors for teaching assignments, speaking engagements and conferences, expecting that they would arrange for the hospitals with which they were affiliated to buy Abbott’s carotid, biliary and peripheral vascular products. This activity violated the federal Anti-Kickback Act and led to the submission of false Medicare claims, the government said, in a case brought under the federal False Claims Act. Carotid and peripheral vascular products are implanted to treat circulatory disorders by increasing blood flow, while biliary products are implanted to treat obstructions in the bile ducts, the government said. “Patients have a right to treatment decisions that are based on their own medical needs, not the personal financial interests of their health care providers,” Assistant Attorney General Stuart Delery of the Justice Department’s civil division said in a statement.

143,ABT,Gay juror's ouster forces new U.S. pharma trial,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A gay man was improperly excluded from jury service because of his sexual orientation, a federal appeals court has ruled, illustrating the widening influence of a key U.S. Supreme Court decision on gay rights. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Tuesday ordered a new trial for GlaxoSmithKline Plc against an Abbott Laboratories spinoff because Abbott excluded the potential juror. The case involved Abbott’s pricing of HIV medications, a controversial issue in the gay community. Glaxo accused Abbott of improperly hiking the price of one drug, Norvir, to help it preserve sales growth of one of its other HIV blockbusters, Kaletra. The jury returned a mixed verdict in 2011, and Glaxo was awarded far less money than it had originally sought. However, Glaxo appealed the lower court’s decision to allow Abbott to exclude the juror, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the constitution prohibits jury strikes because of sexual orientation. “Strikes exercised on the basis of sexual orientation continue this deplorable tradition of treating gays and lesbians as undeserving of participation in our nation’s most cherished rites and rituals,” 9th Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne said the company is pleased with the ruling. Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel said Abbott passed its HIV portfolio to a new company, AbbVie Inc, last year. AbbVie representative Adelle Infante said the company is evaluating its options. The 9th Circuit on Tuesday cited United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). In that case, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the law defining marriage as between one man and one woman violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. However, Kennedy’s ruling was ambiguous on just how far gay rights protections should extend, Northwestern University law professor Andrew Koppelman said. Since the ruling was issued, judges around the country have grappled with how to apply it in a variety of gay rights cases, including rulings that permitted same-sex marriage in Oklahoma and Utah. Those cases are currently under appeal. “The big difference between now and Windsor is a shift in the culture,” Koppelman said. “Discrimination that made intuitive sense to people before doesn’t make a whole lot of sense anymore.” Norvir plays a key role in AIDS-fighting cocktails because it can boost the effectiveness of other drugs. Glaxo accused Abbott of raising Norvir’s price by 400 percent in 2003, as part of an effort to harm competitors whose drugs were dependent on being used in combination with Norvir. During jury selection in an Oakland, California federal court, a potential juror discussed his partner by using the masculine pronoun “he” several times. The juror also said he did not know whether any of his friends were taking the medications at issue in the case. Abbott’s attorney sought to exclude the juror, and Glaxo objected, saying that Abbott was attempting to use a peremptory challenge in a discriminatory way. However, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken allowed Abbott to exclude the juror. Glaxo had sought $571 million, but after a four-week trial the jury awarded Glaxo $3.5 million. Given the legal reasoning in Windsor, the 9th Circuit held that gays and lesbians deserve the same constitutional protections during jury selection as those enjoyed by African-Americans and women. Juror strikes based on sexual orientation “deprive individuals of the opportunity to participate in perfecting democracy and guarding our ideals of justice on account of a characteristic that has nothing to do with their fitness to serve,” Reinhardt wrote.

146,ABT,"Big Pharma still betting on ""messed up"" Indian drugs market","* Sector dogged by patent rows, price cuts, quality issues * Market leader Abbott, others still investing in India * GlaxoSmithKline spends $1 bln to raise India unit stake * Huge long-term demand seen underpinning double-digit growth By Ben Hirschler and Zeba Siddiqui MUMBAI, March 12 (Reuters) - Global drugmakers have had a nauseous time in India’s $14 billion market. Prices have dropped and valuable patents have been overruled as the authorities strive to make medicines affordable for the 70 percent of people living on less than $2 a day. From a regulatory perspective, the government has “messed up”, as one top industry consultant put it. But with 1.2 billion people increasingly seeking both on- and off-prescription drugs, the market is too big for firms to simply throw in the towel. The two top foreign players, Abbott Laboratories and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, are actually stepping up investment, and others such as AstraZeneca Plc are considering doing so. GSK has just spent $1 billion on raising its stake in locally listed GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd and plans to double Indian drug production by building a second factory for about $140 million. “There is a real excitement about India in GSK, in both consumer products and pharmaceuticals,” said Roger Connor, GSK’s global head of manufacturing on a visit to Mumbai. India harbours an army of companies driving prices down with copies of off-patent drugs. It also has a government imposing wide-ranging price reductions and a legal system with a history of disallowing patent protection. Perturbed, global drugmakers are soldiering on. Abbott, local No. 1 since buying Piramal Healthcare for $3.7 billion in 2010, has launched 40 drugs in India in the last two years and will open a new factory for nutritional products later this year, said head of Indian operations Bhasker Iyer. Other drugmakers may raise stakes in local units made cheaper by a rupee that has fallen 12 percent in value over the past year compared with the U.S. dollar, said Aditya Khemka of brokerage Ambit Capital. AstraZeneca has said it hopes to take full control of AstraZeneca Pharma India Ltd, at a cost of more than $100 million, to give it greater flexibility in India. Khemka believes Sanofi SA, which has said emerging markets are important for growth, could well be the next to raise its stake in Sanofi India Ltd. A Sanofi spokesman declined to comment. Even Novartis AG, whose cancer drug Glivec was refused a patent by the Supreme Court last April, is launching new drugs. India stunned the pharmaceutical industry in 2012 by overriding a valid patent on cancer drug Nexavar from Bayer AG  and issuing a so-called compulsory licence to Natco Pharma Ltd, allowing the local firm to sell a copy for a fraction of the price. The threat of more such licences has since been hanging over the sector like a Sword of Damocles, said Ranjit Shahani, head of Novartis’ India unit. Yet the long-term prospects of the Indian market have not deterred Shahani from launching new patented drugs. “Based on activities on the ground, multinational companies are actually taking larger bets on India,” said Sujay Shetty, pharmaceuticals leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers in India. “Of course, there is dissatisfaction - but if you really analyse the problems, many of them are working their way out of the system. From a regulatory shock point of view, pretty much everything the government could do to mess up, it has messed up. So this is the worst you’re going to see.” The probable handover of government following an upcoming election to the pro-business Bharatiya Janata Party means the threat of compulsory licences may be receding, Shetty said. Market growth fell below 10 percent last year, largely due to government-imposed price cuts on many basic drugs, while even high-end biotech specialist Roche Holding AG agreed to voluntary price cuts for some cancer drugs to improve market access. Pricing pressure was a factor in researcher IMS Health projecting India will be the world’s 11th biggest pharmaceutical market by 2017, from 13th in 2012, rather than eighth by 2016 as forecast less than two years ago. Nevertheless, growth should return to double digits in 2014 and stay there for years to come, said Hasit Joshipura, the head of GSK’s local subsidiary. GSK is working within the low-price environment by chasing volume. In some cases, the company charges just 10 percent of international prices. “On a volume basis, 20 percent of what I make globally is sold in India, so it is a massive business,” said GSK’s Connor. Yet that makes up only around 3 percent of revenue. The strategy’s success depends on an efficient supply chain, in a country where local companies such as Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd have been banned from exporting drugs or drug ingredients to the United States because of quality concerns. “You can be absolutely successful in India from a quality and safety perspective,” said Connor. GSK not only makes medicines in the country but also buys ingredients from local suppliers which are audited by GSK staff. The U.S. regulator last month called on its Indian counterpart for more collaboration on drug safety. In the meantime, Indian officials have tightened rules surrounding clinical trials to the extent that local firms Biocon Ltd  and Lupin Ltd have moved studies offshore. Uncertainty over patent security and obstacles to clinical trials are discouraging Western companies from conducting drug research in India, though that was not enough to deter Novartis from recently launching patented drugs such as Tasigna and Jakavi for cancer and Galvus for diabetes. “While we certainly would be cautious in our investments in innovation, we do consider India to be an important market,” said Novartis’ Shahani. “You have to bet on demographics.”",3122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-bigpharma/big-pharma-still-betting-on-messed-up-indian-drugs-market-idUSL6N0M60JO20140312

Abbott’s portfolio of mature drugs being reviewed for sale has around $2 billion in annual revenue and could fetch more than $5 billion, the people said. The U.S. drugmaker is working with Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to find a buyer for the off-patent, or established products, the people added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Abbott and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Abbott has a big lineup of established pharmaceuticals, whose sales fell 3 percent last year to $4.97 billion. Analysts have been grumbling for the past year about the performance of the business, which has dragged down overall company results. But Abbott Chief Executive Miles White previously expressed faith in the business, and appreciation for the cash flow it provides that can be used to fund research and other company operations. Abbott’s divestiture plans for part of its established products come at a time when its larger competitors are also looking to sell their own line-up of legacy drugs. U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N) is considering selling a big portfolio of mature drugs that could fetch more than $15 billion, Reuters reported on Wednesday. French pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) has also been talking to buyers about selling $7 billion to $8 billion worth of mature products in the past few months, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week. Those drug portfolios would provide good acquisition opportunities for generic drugmakers and specialty pharmaceutical companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Actavis Plc ACT.N and Mylan Inc (MYL.O), people familiar with the matter and analysts said. Faced with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a major restructuring, with companies playing to their strengths by building up certain businesses and divesting others. Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which spun off its animal health and infant formula businesses in recent years, is also considering whether to divest the hundreds of off-patent drugs that are mostly sold in emerging markets. But Pfizer has said it would be unable to do so until 2017, after the company has better examined the unit’s financial performance. Merck’s plan to sell its established products is “highly consistent” with the company’s refocusing strategy and could allow for more meaningful earnings growth, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note on Thursday.

149,ABT,UPDATE 3-Abbott to buy Latin American drugmaker CFR in $2.9 bln deal,"(Adds Latin America background) By Caroline Humer May 16 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said on Friday it would acquire Chile’s CFR Pharmaceuticals SA  in a $2.9 billion deal that will more than double its branded generic drugs business in the fast-growing Latin American market. This is the first deal for Abbott since it split into two businesses and spun off its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug in a new company, AbbVie Inc, last year and comes at a time when health mergers have surged. Abbott plans to focus the branded generics business on about 14 or 15 fast-growing countries in emerging markets. “Not all geographies are alike, and some are not particular focuses for us,” Chief Executive Officer Miles White said during a conference call with investors. White said the company was still looking at other transactions. While the Latin American pharmaceuticals market has been attractive to big drugmakers, there are few other big opportunities like CFR because most companies are small, family-owned businesses. The pharmaceutical retail and distribution industry does have some larger companies, such as Mexico’s Grupo Casa Saba  and Brazil’s Hypermarcas. Earlier this month, Casa Saba sold its Chilean health retail arm, Farmacias Ahumada, to Britain’s Alliance Boots for $638 million. Abbott will buy about 73 percent of publicly traded CFR from a holding company controlled by the Weinstein family, which founded the company in the 1920s. It will conduct a tender offer for the remaining shares. The move was a surprise to Latin American analysts, who were unaware the company was in the midst of a sale. A few months ago its $1.2 billion bid for South Africa’s Adcock Ingram AIPJ.J failed. [ID: nL5N0LC255] “This is very surprising,” said Claudia Cavada, senior analyst with Banchile Inversiones in Santiago. “It’s a very good price compared to yesterday’s closing price.” Abbott will pay 34.65 cents per share, or about 190.54 Chilean pesos. CFR shares closed Thursday at 124.51 pesos and were trading at around 181.5 Chilean pesos on Friday. Abbott stock dipped 0.6 percent to $39.00 in New York. JPMorgan analyst Michael Weinstein said in a research note that the move filled a hole while Abbott continues to weigh the sale of its established products business in developed markets.

Abbott sells healthcare devices and branded generics in 150 countries and has 69,000 employees. The purchase would add $900 million in sales in 2015.

154,ABT,Fitch Revises Abbott Laboratories' Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings and revised  Abbott Laboratories' (ABT/Abbott) Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable. The  rating action follows ABT's announced agreement to acquire CFR Pharmaceuticals  (CFRP) for approximately $2.9 billion in cash and the assumption of roughly $500  million of CFRP gross debt. Fitch has affirmed the company's ratings, including the long-term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR), at 'A+'.  A full list of ABT's ratings follows at the end of this  release, and the ratings apply to approximately $7.8 billion of debt outstanding  as of March 31, 2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS While Fitch believes the acquisition of CFRP makes strategic sense, it limits  the company's willingness and ability to reduce leverage (total debt/EBITDA) to  below 1.5x. The rating action also incorporates the following: --That ABT will, in part, focus on shareholders when deploying cash, balancing  the return opportunities of share repurchases, acquisitions and dividends  (regular dividend recently increased by 57%); --That Abbott generates strong free cash flow (FCF) of $1.3 billion-$1.4  billion, which incorporates the recent dividend increase; --That ABT's diversified product portfolio continues to produce mid-single-digit  organic growth with incrementally improving margins in the intermediate term;  --That sales of Nutritionals, Diagnostics, and Established Pharmaceuticals, in  particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle class in emerging  markets; and --Fitch expects a continued weak employment environment in the U.S. and  government austerity measures in Europe to weigh on Abbott's growth and margins  in the developed markets;  --Fitch anticipates that ABT's efforts to improve gross and operating margins  will continue to yield results, more than offsetting the aforementioned  headwinds . Acquisition May Limit Deleveraging Fitch believes that the CFRP acquisition may limit ABT's ability and willingness  to reduce total debt leverage to below 1.5x. While Fitch forecasts the  acquisition to increase Abbott's pro forma total debt leverage only modestly,  the company is currently operating with leverage of 1.76x, higher than the  1.3x-1.5x range expected for this issuer's 'A+' credit rating. With available  cash and short-term investments of approximately $7 billion at March 31, 2014  and forecasted 2014 FCF of $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion, the company may choose to  build cash balances rather than pay down short-term debt. In Fitch's view, the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals makes strategic sense,  as it would increase Abbott's already strong position in the fast-growing Latin  American branded-generic pharmaceutical market. ABT expects CFRP will contribute  $900 million to annual sales in 2015. Developing markets such as Latin America  are expected to provide the bulk for growth of this product segment. The  acquisition does pose some integration risk, but Abbott has stated that the  financial success of this acquisition does not rely on anticipated significant  cost synergies. In addition, the company has successfully integrated  significantly larger acquisitions in the past. The transaction is expected to  close by the end of the third quarter of 2014. Shareholder-Focused Cash Deployment Fitch believes ABT will be opportunistic with cash deployment as it weighs  potential returns for shareholders. As such, the company will likely remain  acquisitive, focusing on companies or device platforms that offer innovation and  growth, as technological advancement in the device sector remains relatively  fragmented.  ABT may also consider targets that offer further expansion opportunities into  favorable geographies, as evidenced by the announced CFRP acquisition. Fitch  expects share repurchases will likely continue, especially in the absence of  viable acquisition targets. The company has demonstrated commitment to its  dividend, as evidenced by the recently announced 57% dividend increase beginning  February 2014.  Solid FCF Fitch estimates that ABT will generate solid FCF of $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion in  2014, below the 2013 level due to the $500 million increase in the company's  dividend. Nevertheless, positive FCF is expected to be supported by dependable  revenue growth and incrementally improving margins. FCF should be sufficient to  fund moderate share repurchases and targeted acquisitions.  Stable Operations Expected Fitch forecasts that ABT's diversified product portfolio will continue to  produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate term, given the  strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix. Emerging markets will  represent a larger portion of ABT's revenue. Increasing revenues and margin  support should provide for solid FCF generation. Emerging Markets Support Growth Fitch expects the majority of ABT's growth will come from emerging markets  during the next two years. Abbott expects that in the coming years, a greater  portion of its revenues will be generated in faster growing geographic markets,  including the developing markets versus the developed markets of the U.S.,  Western Europe and Japan.  Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals should benefit from the rapidly  growing middle class in these markets.  The vast majority of purchases in these  markets are paid for by consumers.  The Diagnostics and Medical Devices business  should benefit from the growing importance of accessible healthcare as  healthcare expenditures become a greater part of these countries' economies.  This is in contrast to the developed markets, where the vast majority of  purchases involve third-party payers. As such, rising disposable income is an  important driver of demand in these markets. Developed Markets to Remain Soft Fitch expects demand trends in developed markets (U.S., Europe and Japan) to  remain relatively soft during the next 12 months. A weak employment environment  in the U.S. and government austerity measures in Europe will likely persist in  the near term. These trends will affect ABT's Established Pharmaceuticals and  Medical Devices segments the most.  Efforts to Support Margins Fitch anticipates that ABT will continue efforts to drive efficiencies across  business segments, resulting in improving margins. Most recently, the company is  focused on improving the cost structure in its Nutrition, Established  Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic segments. In addition, it has taken out some  general and administrative corporate costs.  Adequate Liquidity  Fitch expects ABT to maintain adequate liquidity, as the company had  approximately $7 billion in cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2014  and its unused $5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in July 18,  2017. However, the company had roughly $4.4 billion in short-term debt. In  addition, the company will likely continue to have ample access to public debt  markets. Manageable Debt Maturities  At March 31, 2014, ABT had approximately $7.8 billion in debt outstanding,  including $4.4 billion in short-term debt. Fitch believes the company's debt  maturities are manageable with roughly $947 million maturing in 2019 and $597  million in 2020. Fitch's forecasts assume that ABT will refinance most of these  maturities with the proceeds from new debt issuances. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near- to  intermediate-term, revision of the Outlook to Stable could result from ABT  committing to and operating with leverage stronger than 1.5x, which would likely  require some paydown of short-term debt in the next 12-18 months. In addition,  Fitch would expect the company to achieve and maintain relatively stable  operations and solid FCF. Negative Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a one-notch  downgrade to 'A/F1' include debt remaining above 1.5x EBITDA without the  prospect for timely deleveraging (i.e. within the next 12-18 months), which  could be the result of operational stress and weakening FCF and capital  deployment that does not consider possible debt reduction, if needed.  Fitch has revised ABT's Rating Outlook to Negative and affirmed its ratings as  follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';  --Senior unsecured bank loan at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

155,ABT,U.S. firm Abbott to buy Russian drugmaker for up to $495 million,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare firm Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is to buy Russian drugmaker Veropharm VRPH.MM for up to $495 million, giving it a manufacturing presence in a country where it has been operating for nearly 40 years, Abbott said on Tuesday. The deal bucks a drought in Russian M&A; activity this year due to the country’s faltering economy and the Ukraine crisis. U.S. companies have been particularly stymied from investing here with Washington advising top executives to steer clear of a major Russian investment forum in May.  Abbott’s purchase is the largest acquisition by a U.S. company in Russia since Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) and Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in December announced plans to buy stakes in cigarette distributor Megapolis for $750 million each, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Shares in Veropharm, one of Russia’s biggest drugmakers with a market capitalization of $300 million, shot up 34 percent to a three-year high by early afternoon trading in Moscow. “Russia’s middle class is growing and when the middle class grows the sector that grows is healthcare,” said one trader. “There is an aging population and it is a country that really needs good pharma. If you want to get a part of that market you’ve got to be a local producer and this is a way for Abbott to be locally producing.”  It is the latest foray by Abbott into emerging markets, following a $2.9 billion deal earlier in the year to buy Chile’s CFR Pharmaceuticals SA CFR.SN.  Abbott, which sells healthcare devices and branded generics in 150 countries, last year split into two businesses and spun off its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug in a new company, AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N). It has said it plans to focus the branded generics business on about 14 or 15 fast-growing emerging markets. Under the deal, Abbott will buy Garden Hills, a holding company which owns a controlling interest in Veropharm, for a range of $395 million to $495 million, depending on Garden Hills’ ownership of Veropharm at the time of closure, Abbott said.  Garden Hills currently owns more than 80 percent of Veropharm but is expected to own more than 95 percent when the deal closes, Abbott said.  Abbott will assume net debt of $136 million and plans to fund the transaction with cash on the balance sheet, it said. It expects the deal, to close in the fourth quarter, to add $150 million in sales in 2015.  The Illinois-based company, which has been operating in Russia since 1978, said the deal would allow it to establish a manufacturing presence in the country. Veropharm has three pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in Pokrov, Belgorod and Voronezh.

157,ABT,"Fonterra, Abbott to build dairy farms in China","WELLINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand dairy co-operative Fonterra and U.S. healthcare company Abbott are planning to build up to five dairy farms in China to secure domestic supply to meet rising demand for milk in the world’s second-largest economy. In a statement issued on Friday, the world’s largest dairy exporter and Abbott, a major infant formula seller in China, said they had signed a $300 million agreement to build up the  farms in one of the world’s fastest growing dairy markets, which would produce up to 160 million litres of milk each year. The planned hub, whose location is yet to be decided, would be Fonterra’s third, following similar dairying centres in China’s Shanxi and Hebei provinces. If the plan is approved by Chinese authorities, the companies said the first farm would begin producing in early 2017. “Farming hubs are a key part of our strategy to be a more integrated dairy business in Greater China, contribute to the growth and development of the local Chinese dairy industry and help meet local consumers’ needs for safe, nutritious dairy products,” Fonterra Chief Executive Officer Theo Spierings said in a statement. The deal would build on the existing relationship between the two companies, as Fonterra counts Abbott as a wholesale client of its milk powder products, which include Similac infant formula brand. Abbott is expanding its production capabilities in China, opening an infant formula plant near Shanghai in June. “This strategic partnership gives us flexibility for the future on however we use milk,” an Abbott spokesman said. Abbott recalled some of its milk formula brands in China and Vietnam in August after a contamination scare involving  products containing Fonterra-produced ingredients, which proved to be false. Abbott in April said the recall crimped sales of milk formula products by $75 million in the first quarter.

158,ABT,Exclusive: Mylan near multibillion-dollar deal for Abbott drug assets - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan Inc is in advanced talks to acquire a multibillion-dollar portfolio of established products from Abbott Laboratories, people familiar with the matter said. The proposed transaction, which is in late-stage discussions, would see Mylan acquire a big chunk of Abbott’s Europe-based mature drugs for several billion dollars, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. The acquisition of the foreign assets, according to some of the people, could also allow the U.S. company to change its tax address to overseas, a practice known as inversion that has become popular among healthcare companies seeking to cut their tax bills and gain access to cash held offshore. The exact value of Mylan’s bid could not be learned, but people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that Abbott was looking to sell a portfolio of mature drugs that could fetch more than $5 billion.    A deal could come as soon as next week, but the discussions are continuing and could still fall apart, the people cautioned. Abbott’s established pharmaceuticals division is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland and had 2013 sales of roughly $5 billion. About half of the sales come from emerging markets, and the remainder from other international markets.    Representatives for Mylan declined to comment, while Abbott did not respond to requests for comment. A potential deal with Abbott would come after Mylan’s failed attempt to buy Swedish drugmaker Meda AB earlier this year. Meda in April rejected Mylan’s revised $6.7 billion takeover bid, saying its biggest shareholder did not back a deal. Mylan was looking to do an inversion deal partly because it was at a disadvantage compared with foreign rivals as well as other U.S. generic drugmakers that have redomiciled to a low-tax country. Major competitors include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which is based in Israel, and Actavis Plc, which re-domiciled to Ireland through a 2013 acquisition of Warner Chilcott. Both face lower tax rates. Tax inversions allow U.S. companies, which face one of the highest tax rates in the world - a federal tax rate of 35 percent, and an overall rate that can be close to 40 percent, including state and local taxes - to move to a lower-tax country by buying or creating a new holding company. The deal would add to a flurry of dealmaking in the healthcare sector, which more than tripled to $317.4 billion in the first half of 2014 from the same period last year. Reuters first reported in May that Abbott has tapped Morgan Stanley to find a buyer for the off-patent drugs so that it can free up resources to invest in high-growth areas. Other large pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Sanofi SA and Merck & Co Inc are also looking to shed older drugs, many of which have lost patent protection and face shrinking sales. Faced with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a major restructuring, with companies playing to their strengths by building up certain businesses and divesting others.

159,ABT,"Mylan to buy Abbott generics, cut taxes, in $5.3 billion deal","(Reuters) - Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc said on Monday it would buy Abbott Laboratories’ branded specialty and generics business in developed markets outside the United States in a $5.3 billion deal that will bolster its product line and also cut its tax bill. The deal gives Mylan a wide array of Abbott brands that have annual sales of almost $2 billion in those markets, including gastroenterology drug Creon, pain drug Brufen and influenza vaccine Influvac. It has been structured to help Mylan reduce its tax bill, by moving its tax address outside the United States, a practice known as tax inversion that has become popular among healthcare companies.  “We see Mylan creating a platform for potential future acquisitions with this deal,” thanks to revenue from the Abbott products and a lowered tax rate of 20 to 21 percent in the first full year and high-teens later on, said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott. Mylan shares were up 2.7 percent at $51.55 on the Nasdaq in early afternoon, while Abbott shares were up almost 1 percent at $41.66 on the New York Stock Exchange. Abbott will transfer assets - now sold in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to a new publicly traded company in the Netherlands that will also include Mylan’s existing businesses. Abbott will receive 105 million shares of the combined company, giving it an ownership stake of about 21 percent that is worth $5.3 billion based on Mylan’s closing stock price on Friday.  Abbott will continue to sell its branded generics, however, in emerging markets, where strong sales growth is expected because of rising numbers of middle-class patients. By contrast, its sales of generics in developed markets have been steadily declining in recent years due to price pressures in Europe. Although the deal would hurt Abbott’s 2015 earnings, the suburban Chicago company said it plans relatively quickly to sell its stake in the new company and use the proceeds to boost Abbott’s earnings, such as by acquiring more medical devices or buying back its shares. “While we have a very positive view toward Mylan stock, we do not expect to be a long-term shareholder in Mylan,” Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told investors in a conference call on Monday. Reuters had reported on Friday that Mylan was in advanced talks to buy a multibillion-dollar portfolio of established products from Abbott.  The deal gives Mylan a portfolio of more than 100 specialty and branded generic pharmaceutical products in five major therapeutic areas including cardio/metabolic and gastrointestinal.

163,ABT,UPDATE 1-India caps price of 108 more medicines; drugmakers to take hit,"* Move aimed towards making drugs more affordable in India * New price caps effective July 11 - govt official * Sanofi India MD says “shocked and disappointed” by price cap decision * Sanofi India closes down 10 pct in Mumbai   (Adds comments from analysts, drugmakers, share price, context) By Zeba Siddiqui MUMBAI, July 14 (Reuters) - India has capped the prices of more than 100 drugs used to treat diseases ranging from diabetes to HIV, a move likely to hit the profit margins of drug firms such as Sanofi SA, Abbott Laboratories and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. The drug pricing regulator’s decision, aimed at improving affordability, was slammed by the drugmakers in India, where  prices of generic drugs sold are already low compared with international markets. India, an emerging market for drugmakers, last year raised the number of drugs that are subject to price control to cover up to 30 percent of the total medicines sold in the country, according to industry officials. “While we appreciate the government’s intent to improve affordability ... the manner and method in which this unilateral decision has been taken, is untenable,” Sanofi India’s  Managing Director Shailesh Ayyangar said on Monday. “We are evaluating the impact of this order on our ability to continue offering our products with the same value proposition,” he said, adding the decision has “shocked and disappointed” the pharmaceutical industry. The notice by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), published on its website on Friday, coincides with moves by the health ministry to widen the list of essential medicines that will be subject to a price cap, people familiar with the matter said last month. The move is aimed at making medicines more affordable in a country where 70 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day. More than four-fifths of India’s 1.2 billion also have no health insurance. The new price caps took effect on July 11, an NPPA official said. Injeti Srinivas, who took charge as NPPA’s chairman in June, was not immediately available for comment. “This is very unexpected and unfortunate. One would expect them to proceed with revising the list of essential medicines, but this has caught people by surprise,” said Sujay Shetty, PwC’s India leader of pharmaceuticals and life sciences. “They should have done a little more thinking and consultations. This way, they’re going to drive out the better players from the market, and the quality of drugs could be compromised.” Shares in Sanofi India closed down 10 percent at 2,923.05 rupees on Monday and Ranbaxy fell 0.4 percent to 553.70 rupees, while the main Mumbai market index ended little changed from its previous close. Analysts at Nomura on Sunday named Sanofi India, the Indian unit of French drugmaker Sanofi, Abbott Healthcare Private Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories, and local firm Ranbaxy as among companies that will be most impacted by the price cap. Abbott and Ranbaxy did not respond to requests for comment. “Though the impact is limited, the move by the NPPA has increased the risk of additional controls in the future,” Nomura analysts Saion Mukherjee and Lalit Kumar wrote in the report. The drug pricing regulator invoked a rarely-used provision that gives the agency the right to fix the prices of any drug “in extraordinary circumstances, if it considers necessary so to do in public interest”. A spokesman for Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, India’s second-largest drugmaker by sales, said the company was assessing its next step, but does not expect the price caps to have a material impact on its financial results. “At an industry level, there may be some discussion to see whether one can challenge this,” he said, but added that the regulator’s decision to invoke the “public interest” provision would make the options limited. Drugs included in the price cap list are “fairly meaningful molecules,” so companies would not exit the market, said Arvind Bothra, an analyst at brokerage Religare Capital. “They will take the price cut, increase their volumes, and move on. The bigger problem for the industry is the uncertainty this ad-hoc expansion brings.”   (Editing by Louise Heavens)",7142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-drugs-prices/update-1-india-caps-price-of-108-more-medicines-drugmakers-to-take-hit-idUSL4N0PP20M20140714

166,ABT,"Abbott beats profit estimate, infant formulas rebound","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as demand for its recently-recalled infant formulas began to recover and profit margins improved for other business segments. Sales of nutritional products, the company’s biggest product line which includes Similac infant formula and Ensure beverages for adults, rose 1.6 percent to $1.73 billion, following declines in previous quarters. “The business seems to be stabilizing,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. “Customers are getting more comfortable now with the quality of Abbott’s formulas, so we expect better growth in the second half of the year.”    A recall of pediatric milk formula brands in China and Vietnam last August, due to fears an ingredient provided by an outside supplier might be contaminated, crimped sales of the products by $40 million in the second quarter.     But that was less than the $75 million hit seen in the prior quarter. Abbott said it is quickly recapturing share in the affected markets, having just introduced several new products and by opening a new Similac manufacturing plant in China. “We’re recovering as well as we could in that one-year time frame,” Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told analysts on a conference call. “We’re getting back to the track we want to be on.” Abbott said it earned $466 million, or 30 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $476 million, or 30 cents, in the year-earlier period, when Abbott took charges for cost-saving initiatives and other expenses.     Excluding special items, Abbott earned 54 cents per share, topping Wall Street expectations of 51 cents. The company said the outperformance was due to improved profit margins for its diagnostics and vascular products. Global company sales rose 1.9 percent to $5.55 billion, a bit above Wall Street estimates of $5.52 billion. Diagnostics posted the best showing in the quarter, growing 4.8 percent to $1.19 billion, with double digit sales growth in the United States. Sales of medical devices rose 1.2 percent to $1.37 billion. Abbott early last year spun off its branded patent-protected prescription drugs into a new publicly traded company, Abbvie Inc (ABBV.N), but continued to sell generic medicines. Abbott generics have suffered declining sales over the past year and hurt overall company results. But the flat sales in the second quarter, of $1.22 billion, were a welcome contrast to the 6.6 percent slump seen in the prior quarter. In a move cheered by investors, Abbott on Monday said it would sell its generics business in developed markets outside the United States to Mylan Inc MYL.N in a deal valued at $5.3 billion. But Abbott will continue to sell its generic brands in fast-growing emerging markets.  The suburban Chicago-based company raised its full-year profit forecast to between $2.19 and $2.29 per share, from  $2.16 to $2.26 per share. Company shares slipped 0.3 percent at $41.04 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid modest declines for the drug sector.

The 25-page document, a copy of which was circulated by the CGT union on Wednesday, details a plan presented to the company’s investment committee on May 6 dubbed the “Phoenix project”. It shows Sanofi is considering whether to sell, carve out or create a joint venture for a portfolio of some 200 mature drugs that includes blood thinner Plavix, anti-epileptic Depakine and antibiotic Pyostacine. The portfolio currently accounts for annual sales of about 2.1 billion euros but these are projected to drop by two-fifths in the next decade as European countries tighten healthcare budgets and impose lower drug prices. No decision has yet been made on the portfolio, a Sanofi spokesman said.  “Materials and studies on different topics are regularly presented to the investment committee, and it doesn’t always take action or render decisions based on presented materials,” he said in an emailed statement.     Reuters had reported in April that Sanofi was looking to sell a multi-billion portfolio of mature products, as drugmakers worldwide seek to shed non-core assets and focus on high-growth areas.  The Phoenix project aims to minimize exposure to price cuts, reduce Sanofi’s manufacturing in Europe and free up cash, according to the document. It would concern six manufacturing and distribution sites and some 2,600 staff in Europe, mainly in France, Spain, Italy and Germany.     The document shows that as of May, Sanofi had begun talks with Abbott, Mylan and private equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus as potential buyers or venture partners.

171,ABT,Mylan presses on with tax-inversion Abbott deal,"(Reuters) - Political opposition to tax-inversion deals will not stop Mylan Inc’s (MYL.O) purchase of some non-U.S. businesses from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Chief Executive Heather Bresch said, even as some companies have backed away from such tax arrangements. Mylan is looking at further “strategic” deals in the near future, Bresch added on Thursday, as the company trimmed the top end of its revenue outlook for the year - sending its shares down as much as 5.3 percent. Mylan’s deal to buy Abbott’s specialty and generics business in developed markets outside the United States will move its tax address to the Netherlands, cutting costs because of lower corporate tax rates there. President Barack Obama and a string of lawmakers have opposed such tax inversions and pledged action to discourage them but Bresch played down the risk. She said it would be challenging to change the U.S. tax code to stop inversion without punishing other foreign companies, which would hit the health sector as nearly half of the drugs and medical devices sold in America come from elsewhere. “Being punitive and not allowing us to be competitive, I do not believe, is in our country’s best interest, and I hope that prevails at the end of the day,” Bresch told analysts on a  post-earnings conference call. “We’re obviously continuing to pay U.S. taxes, as well as a lot of these foreign companies are paying U.S. taxes and creating U.S. jobs.” The Abbott deal, announced in July, gives Mylan access to Abbott’s specialty and generics business as well as moving its tax address. Nine tax-inversion deals have been agreed by U.S. companies this year although drugs retailer Walgreen Co WAG.N decided not to move offshore in its full takeover of Europe’s Alliance Boots [ABN.UL], following fierce criticism of the practice.  Meanwhile, Mylan is still out shopping. Bresch raised the prospect of other deals even before the completion of the Abbott deal, due early next year. “There’s a lot of opportunities out there, and we are looking at everything,” she told analysts. Operationally, Mylan was more downbeat as it shaved the top end of its revenue and earnings forecasts for this year, citing delays in approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for key generic drugs that it plans to launch this year. A generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s (TEVA.TA) (TEVA.N) multiple sclerosis treatment, Copaxone, and Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) blockbuster Celebrex, an anti-inflammatory treatment for arthritis, have both been delayed by the FDA. Mylan said it still expected to launch them in the fourth quarter, adding that a delayed launch of Copaxone to next year would not affect its updated revenue and profit forecast for this year.  The drugmaker forecast full-year 2014 revenue in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.0 billion and earnings of $3.25-$3.45 per share, a forecast that includes a fourth-quarter launch of generic Copaxone and Celebrex. It had earlier forecast full-year revenue of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion and earnings of $3.25-$3.60 per share. Analysts on average expect full-year 2014 earnings of $3.37 per share on sales of $7.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mylan posted a second-quarter adjusted net profit attributable to shareholders of $273.3 million, or 69 cents per share - a penny shy of the average analyst estimate. Mylan shares fell as low as $45.36 before recovering much of their lost ground to trade on the Nasdaq at $47.63 by early afternoon.

Mylan’s deal to buy Abbott’s specialty and generics business in developed markets outside the United States will move its tax address to the Netherlands, cutting costs because of lower corporate tax rates there. President Barack Obama and a string of lawmakers have opposed such tax inversions and pledged action to discourage them but Bresch played down the risk. She said it would be challenging to change the U.S. tax code to stop inversion without punishing other foreign companies, which would hit the health sector as nearly half of the drugs and medical devices sold in America come from elsewhere. “Being punitive and not allowing us to be competitive, I do not believe, is in our country’s best interest, and I hope that prevails at the end of the day,” Bresch told analysts on a  post-earnings conference call. “We’re obviously continuing to pay U.S. taxes, as well as a lot of these foreign companies are paying U.S. taxes and creating U.S. jobs.” The Abbott deal, announced in July, gives Mylan access to Abbott’s specialty and generics business as well as moving its tax address. Nine tax-inversion deals have been agreed by U.S. companies this year although drugs retailer Walgreen Co decided not to move offshore in its full takeover of Europe’s Alliance Boots, following fierce criticism of the practice. Meanwhile, Mylan is still out shopping. Bresch raised the prospect of other deals even before the completion of the Abbott deal, due early next year. “There’s a lot of opportunities out there, and we are looking at everything,” she told analysts. Operationally, Mylan was more downbeat as it shaved the top end of its revenue and earnings forecasts for this year, citing delays in approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for key generic drugs that it plans to launch this year. A generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s   multiple sclerosis treatment, Copaxone, and Pfizer Inc’s blockbuster Celebrex, an anti-inflammatory treatment for arthritis, have both been delayed by the FDA. Mylan said it still expected to launch them in the fourth quarter, adding that a delayed launch of Copaxone to next year would not affect its updated revenue and profit forecast for this year. The drugmaker forecast full-year 2014 revenue in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.0 billion and earnings of $3.25-$3.45 per share, a forecast that includes a fourth-quarter launch of generic Copaxone and Celebrex. It had earlier forecast full-year revenue of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion and earnings of $3.25-$3.60 per share. Analysts on average expect full-year 2014 earnings of $3.37 per share on sales of $7.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mylan posted a second-quarter adjusted net profit attributable to shareholders of $273.3 million, or 69 cents per share - a penny shy of the average analyst estimate. Mylan shares fell as low as $45.36 before recovering much of their lost ground to trade on the Nasdaq at $47.63 by early afternoon.

174,ABT,Abbott dissolving stent has lower angina rate vs metal stent: study,"(Reuters) - Abbott’s Absorb dissolving heart stent proved as safe and effective one year after being placed in a diseased artery as the company’s market-leading Xience drug coated metal stent with a significantly lower rate of chest pain, according to data presented at a medical meeting on Sunday. Absorb works in the same way as traditional heart stents, propping open arteries that have been cleared of blockages to restore normal blood flow. But unlike metal stents that remain permanently in place, Absorb softens over several months and  dissolves in two to three years, allowing the treated artery to regain more normal flexibility to expand and contract. In the 501-patient study called Absorb II - the first randomized head-to-head trial using Absorb - the stent technology was found to be as good as, or non-inferior to, Xience, researchers said. The most notable difference observed after one year in the European study was the rate of angina, a type of chest pain associated with diminished blood flow to the heart. Angina can add to healthcare costs, requiring repeat doctor or hospital visits and the use of more diagnostic testing. It can also hamper patient activity. Over the course of the year, the rate of angina in patients who received Absorb was 16.4 percent versus 25.6 percent for Xience patients, which was viewed as statistically significant.   “The lower rate of chest pain observed in people treated with Absorb is a promising finding that shows that Absorb may offer people unique quality of life benefits beyond the excellent clinical outcomes already offered with drug eluting stents,” Dr. Patrick Serruys, the study’s lead investigator who presented the data at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) meeting in Washington, said in a statement. The combined rate of death for any cause, all heart attacks and the need for repeat procedures was 7.3 percent for Absorb and 9.1 percent for Xience. The target lesion failure rate - a composite of cardiac death, heart attack caused by a reblockage of the vessel and need for another procedure - was 4.8 percent for Absorb and 3.0 percent for Xience.  The rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis - a blood clot forming at the site of the stent - was 0.9 percent for the dissolving device, researchers reported. Absorb is approved in Europe, but Abbott said it believes many doctors were waiting for data from a randomized trial to ensure confidence in the device, which had been previously tested in single arm studies. “We wanted to put it head-to-head against what is considered best in class technology,” John Capek, Abbott’s head of medical devices said, referring to the company’s Xience stent.  A similar U.S. trial involving more than 2,200 patients  will be the basis of the company’s application seeking approval with the Food and Drug Administration expected to be filed in the second half of 2015, Abbott said.

In a decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Robert Dow said the New England Carpenters Health and Welfare Fund failed to show that the defendants “joined together” illegally with pharmacies and intermediaries to maximize sales, by offering savings cards or coupons to help patients reduce co-payments. The plaintiff also accused the companies of insurance fraud, saying they instructed pharmacies to conceal the “subsidies” by processing them as secondary insurance rather than as discounts. “While the amended complaint includes some allegations of cooperation between pharmacies and the co-pay subsidy administrators, it falls short of indicating that pharmacies processed savings cards in a fraudulent manner in order to further the distinct goals of an enterprise, separate and apart from the pharmacies’ business,” Dow wrote. In dismissing claims seeking unspecified triple damages under the federal racketeering law known as RICO, Dow said he may also lack jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims in the lawsuit, alleging interference with contracts. He scheduled an Oct. 7 hearing on that issue. Humira treats rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis, while AndroGel is a treatment for men with low testosterone.

178,ABT,"Abbott, Mylan silent on why changing tax-inversion terms","(Reuters) - Drugmakers Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Mylan Inc (MYL.O) on Wednesday declined to explain in detail why they changed the terms of a $5.3 billion deal in which Mylan will buy part of Abbott’s overseas generics business and reincorporate for tax purposes in the Netherlands. Analysts and banking experts said the changes were almost certainly aimed at protecting tax gains from the so-called “inversion” deal, one of several to surface in recent months in which U.S. companies seek to shift their tax domiciles abroad. The altered contract for the deal came a month after the Treasury Department made changes to U.S. tax rules aimed at discouraging inversion deals, which the Obama administration sees as a threat to the U.S. corporate tax base. “The (tax law) changes from Treasury are making people re-look at deal terms, and deals are not as favorable now,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. “That’s what happened here, there had to be some tweaks” in the Abbott/Mylan contract. Windau said many investors had feared the new Treasury rules might derail the deal, and they took comfort in statements by both Abbott and Pittsburgh-based Mylan on Wednesday that the transaction would go through in the first quarter of 2015. “People assume this has to do with proposed regulatory  actions by Treasury,” said Josh Jennings, an analyst with Cowen and Co. “I don’t know what their advisors told them to do. I would have appreciated more information.” Concern about the Treasury rule changes prompted AbbVie (ABBV.N), an Abbott spinoff, earlier this week to walk away from its planned $55 billion purchase of Ireland-based drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP.L). Provisions of the Abbott/Mylan deal have been changed, Mylan said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. One change is that Mylan will get better pricing terms at Abbott facilities that will make and supply products for Mylan. Another change, Mylan said, is that it will issue 110 million shares in the newly formed company to Abbott, 5 million more than the original terms dictated. Abbott plans to transfer generic drugs that it sells in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to a new company in the Netherlands that would also include Mylan’s existing businesses. Mylan shareholders will now own 78 percent of the company and Abbott will own 22 percent. The original terms called for a 79 percent/21 percent split. Under long-standing Treasury rules, a company that wants to take up tax citizenship in a new country must be less than 80-percent owned by its original U.S. investors. That rule was tightened last month to make it harder for companies to evade the 80-20 rule by slimming down on the U.S. side, or bulking up on the non-U.S. side, through financial maneuvers. Christopher Geier, partner in charge of the investment banking practice at Sikich, a professional services firm in Naperville, Illinois, said the contract changes apparently were made to help ensure that old Mylan shareholders own less than 80 percent of the new company. As for why the companies have not more fully explained the tweaks to their deal, Geier said, “To the extent they can do these things and not violate any sort of disclosure things they will, and you almost can’t blame them for that.” Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel and Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said they could not comment about the contract changes, beyond the limited details included in their separate regulatory filings and on an Abbott conference call. Abbott earlier on Wednesday said its third-quarter sales, including generics to be sold to Mylan which are now considered discontinued products, rose 4.7 percent to $5.6 billion, which was in line with Wall Street expectations.

The move comes after the U.S. Treasury on Sept. 22 made changes to the corporate tax rules that govern such “inversion” merger deals, in which companies move their operations to countries with lower taxes than in the United States. The new rules raise the bar for this tax treatment and also make it harder to reap other tax benefits of an inversion. About ten U.S. companies had deals in the works when the Treasury changed the rules. Some, including Salix Pharmaceuticals and former Abbott business Abbvie, pulled out of their own inversion-based deals, while others decided to go forward with their deals. Investors and analysts were not certain where Abbott and Mylan would fall. “The positive takeaway is that Abbott still plans to close its deal with Mylan in the first quarter of 2015, despite the pressure on inversions from the U.S. Treasury, and some walking away by other companies from inversions,” said Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones. “The (tax law) changes from Treasury are making people re-look at deal terms, and deals are not as favorable now.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit accusing Juan Cruz Bilbao Hormaeche of reaping more than $10.1 million in profits by trading on non-public information he learned from CFR board meetings ahead of the deal, which was announced in May and finalized in September. The lawsuit also charged a business associate of Bilbao, Tomas Andres Hurtado Rourke, with processing securities transactions for Bilbao and himself through an offshore entity. Hurtado earned nearly $500,000 in profits, according to the SEC. Bilbao, 55, and Hurtado, 40, are Chilean citizens who live in Santiago, according to the lawsuit. Lawyers for the two men could not immediately be identified. Bilbao is the president of banking and insurance company Consorcio Financiero SA, and Hurtado is a director of the company’s banking unit, according to Consorcio’s website. Representatives at Consorcio were not immediately available to comment. According to the SEC, Bilbao first learned of Abbott’s confidential offer to acquire CFR at a March 10 board meeting. Between March 12 and May 7, Bilbao used Hurtado to purchase more than 700,000 American depositary shares of CFR for a total of $14.35 million in the name of a British Virgin Islands entity, Somerton Resources Limited, the lawsuit said. Hurtado also bought $700,000 of CFR shares, it said. Bilbao and Hurtado tendered their shares after CFR’s stock price rose following Abbott’s announcement of the acquisition, the SEC said. “Bilbao abused his position on a company’s board as he stockpiled ADS on the basis of inside information that a major payday was coming soon on those shares,” Karen Martinez, director of the SEC’s office in Salt Lake City, Utah, said in a statement. The SEC is seeking an order freezing Bilbao, Hurtado and Somerton’s assets and requiring them to be repatriated.

187,ABT,UPDATE 1-U.S. regulator charges two Chileans with insider trading,"(Adds comment from Abbott, SEC) By Joseph Ax and Anthony Esposito NEW YORK/SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A former board member of Chile’s CFR Pharmaceuticals SA was charged on Monday by U.S. regulators with insider trading on information regarding Abbott Laboratories’ $2.9 billion acquisition of CFR earlier this year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit accusing Juan Cruz Bilbao Hormaeche of reaping more than $10.1 million in profits by trading on non-public information he learned from CFR board meetings ahead of the deal, which was announced in May and finalized in September. The lawsuit also charged a business associate of Bilbao, Tomas Andres Hurtado Rourke, with processing securities transactions for Bilbao and himself through an offshore entity. Hurtado earned nearly $500,000 in profits, according to the SEC. Bilbao, 55, and Hurtado, 40, are Chilean citizens who live in Santiago, according to the lawsuit.

194,ABT,Abbott CEO losing no sleep over stronger dollar,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories’ chief executive officer is not worried about the stronger dollar, telling analysts on Thursday his company will better withstand its painful effects than rivals due to its European factories and growing sales of nutritional products, medical diagnostics and medical optics. “We are just not vulnerable to the euro and a lot of companies are,” Miles White told analysts on a conference call. White said the stronger dollar will crimp company sales by 6 percent this year, far worse than the 2.5 percent drag on Abbott sales seen in 2014. But the potential foreign exchange hit is limited, Abbott said, because many of Abbott’s factories are located in Europe, where they incur costs in euros. Moreover, the European factories ship diagnostics and other medical devices, generic drugs, infant and adult nutritional products and other products around the world, limiting exposure to the dollar. Abbott, which captures 70 percent of its revenue from outside the United States, on Thursday said its global sales rose 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter. But it said sales would have risen 10.2 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowered the value of sales in many other countries whose currencies have weakened versus the dollar. Abbott has annual sales of more than $20 billion. Half of its sales are in emerging markets, like China and India, while 30 percent are from the United States and another 20 percent is from other developed countries, including Europe and Canada.  Rival U.S. healthcare companies Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co in the past week issued 2015 earnings forecasts below Wall Street expectations, citing the stronger dollar. But Abbott’s 2015 earnings outlook of $2.10 to $2.20 per share from continuing operations was in line with expectations, and would reflect growth of 8.5 percent from last year. While other companies lowered their 2015 forecasts due to currency factors, White said Abbott refused “to reset the bar lower,” and might well end up topping its 2015 profit forecast. “We are entering 2015 with good momentum,” White told analysts. “The fundamentals of our business are strong and ongoing trends across our markets remain positive.” The suburban Chicago company, whose profit margins rose by two percentage points last year, said they are expected to expand by another percentage point in 2015, on cost cuts and stronger sales of its array of products. Abbott shares rose 3.3 percent on Thursday to $44.84, outpacing a 0.7 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.

199,ABT,UPDATE 3-Bidvest makes $515 million bid for rest of Adcock Ingram,"* Bidvest seeks role in pharmaceutical market * Shares in Adcock jump more than four percent   (Adds analyst comment) By Tiisetso Motsoeneng JOHANNESBURG, Feb 23 (Reuters) - South African conglomerate Bidvest has offered about $515 million for the shares it does not already own in drugmaker Adcock Ingram in a new attempt to build a big presence in the pharmaceutical market. The deal would give Bidvest a substantial presence in the generic market, which is set to grow as the government prepares a national health insurance plan that would rely on the use of cut-price versions of branded drugs. Bidvest already owns a 34.5 percent stake in the drugmaker, which it acquired a year ago, scuppering a rival bid from Chile’s CFR Pharmaceuticals. Adcock is trailing rivals as it struggles with slowing sales, over-reliance on a heavily regulated home market and factories that are running below capacity. Under the latest offer, Bidvest would pay about 6 billion rand ($515 million), or 52 rand per share, which represents a 3.6 percent premium to Adcock’s closing price on Friday. Shares in Adcock jumped as much as 6.6 percent during the session. By 1410 GMT, the stock had given up some its gains to trade 4.3 percent higher at 52.34 rand. Adcock reported a 38 percent rise to 83.8 cents in half-year headline earnings per share on Monday, a sign that a turnaround plan that include cost cuts and adopting a centralised business model is gaining traction. It has not commented on the Bidvest approach. “Considering the potential turnaround of the company, I think it is definitely an opportunistic bid,” said Simon Mather, analyst at Barclays, who has a “neutral” rating on the stock. “In a more optimistic scenario about the prospects of Adcock, we got to a fair value of 69.5 rand per share provided management is able to orchestrate a meaningful turnaround of the business.” Bidvest’s offer values Adcock at around 9.1 billion rand — below its enterprise value of about 10 billion rand, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bidvest has been trying to take control of Adcock since 2013, seeing an opportunity to turn around an underperforming company and add painkillers and cough syrups to its stable of products. Last year, it sank a 12.8 billion rand, or 74.5 rand per share, takeover offer for Adcock from CFR by building a blocking stake that gave it the current holding. In March 2013, Bidvest offered a 10 percent premium for a 60 percent stake in Adcock, a bid spurned by Adcock’s board at the time as opportunistic.

200,ABT,"UPDATE 1-Mylan still on the prowl for deals, perhaps one by end 2015","(Adds detail, background, CEO comment, shares) March 2 (Reuters) - U.S. generic drug maker Mylan Inc  is still on the prowl for more deals, after completing the multibillion-dollar acquisition of some of Abbott Laboratories’ non-U.S. businesses just last week. Chief Executive Heather Bresch, on a call after the company posted fourth-quarter results on Monday, raised the prospect of another “material transaction” by the end of 2015. She did not offer details. The company forecast 2015 revenue of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion and adjusted earnings of $4 to $4.30 per share. Analysts on average expect revenue of $9.8 billion and a profit of $4.16 per share for the year. In February, Mylan, which also sells specialty products, said it would buy privately held Indian drugmaker Famy Care Ltd’s female health businesses. The company said it still expects to launch a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s  top-selling multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, in the second half of the year, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Teva in January. Net profit attributable to the company’s common shareholders rose to $189.2 million, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $180.2 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned $1.05 per share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 15 percent to $2.08 billion, edging past the Wall Street estimate of about $2.06 billion. The Abbott deal, unveiled in July, allowed Mylan to purchase Abbott’s specialty and generics business in developed markets outside the United States, as well as move its tax address to the Netherlands. Mylan’s stock was marginally down at $56.80 on the Nasdaq in extended trade.

201,ABT,Abbott says its payoff from Mylan deal surged,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) on Wednesday said its initial proceeds of $5.3 billion from the recent sale to Mylan (MYL.O) of part of its generic drug business were now worth more than $7 billion because of appreciation of the stock it obtained in the deal. Under the deal, Abbott transferred generic and specialty drugs it had sold in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to a new publicly traded company in the Netherlands that also included Mylan’s existing businesses. Abbott received 105 million shares of the combined company, renamed Mylan NV. It has since sold a third of the stock, reducing its stake in Mylan to about 15 percent from 21 percent. “What was a $5 billion value is now worth north of $7 billion,” Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told analysts on Wednesday during a conference call to discuss first-quarter results.  “It has been prudent to hold” the stock, he said, adding that Abbott retained most of the shares and was in “no hurry” to sell them.

Under the deal, Abbott transferred generic and specialty drugs it had sold in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to a new publicly traded company in the Netherlands that also included Mylan’s existing businesses. Abbott received 105 million shares of the combined company, renamed Mylan NV. It has since sold a third of the stock, reducing its stake in Mylan to about 15 percent from 21 percent. “What was a $5 billion value is now worth north of $7 billion,” Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told analysts on Wednesday during a conference call to discuss first-quarter results. “It has been prudent to hold” the stock, he said, adding that Abbott retained most of the shares and was in “no hurry” to sell them.

209,ABT,Fitch Downgrades Abbotts's L-T IDR to 'A'; Outlook Revised to Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Abbott Laboratories'  (Abbott) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) by one notch to 'A' and revised  the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. In addition, the company's  short-term IDR has been affirmed at 'F1'. Abbott had $8.9 billion in outstanding debt at March 31, 2015. A full list of  Fitch's ratings actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS -- Fitch expects Abbott will operate with debt leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of  1.7x to 1.9x, consistent with an 'A' credit rating for this issuer.    -- Abbott's diversified product portfolio is positioned to deliver  mid-single-digit organic growth with incrementally improving margins in the  intermediate term. -- The company's Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established  Pharmaceuticals segments are expected to benefit from the growth in emerging  markets.   -- Abbott's ongoing focus on new product introductions across virtually all of  its business segments bodes well for growth and margins. -- The company faces challenges regarding reimbursement for some of its  products, as well as near-term adverse foreign exchange movements. -- Fitch anticipates that Abbott's efforts to improve gross and operating  margins will continue to yield results, more than offsetting the aforementioned  headwinds.  -- Fitch forecasts Abbott generating relatively strong free cash flow (FCF) of  $1.4 billion - $1.6 billion during 2015. -- Fitch believes that Abbott will focus primarily on shareholders when  deploying cash, balancing the return opportunities of share repurchases with  acquisitions, while steadily increasing its dividend.  --Fitch expects that Abbott will maintain adequate liquidity through cash  generation, bank credit and access to the capital markets. Leverage Consistent with 'A' Rating: Abbott's current leverage (total  debt/EBITDA) of 1.9x and above 1.5x for the most recent five quarters is more  consistent with an 'A' credit rating for its operating profile. Fitch now  expects that Abbott will balance its investment needs with shareholder-focused  activities, so that it operates with leverage of 1.7x-1.9x. Adequate growth,  margin support and solid FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital  expenditures and dividends) should mitigate the need for significant increases  in the company's total debt. Stable Operations: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's diversified product portfolio  will continue to produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate  term, given the strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix.  However, adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper reported growth  in the near term, although margins should remain fairly insulated from the  trend. Revenue growth and margin support should provide for solid FCF  generation. Emerging Markets Supporting Growth: Fitch expects the majority of Abbott's  growth will continue to come from emerging markets. Abbott expects to generate  roughly 50% of its revenues from emerging markets in 2015, fueled by the strong  growth in those markets, as well as the divestiture of its developed-market  Established Pharmaceuticals business. Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle  class.  Nearly all purchases in these markets are paid for by consumers. This is in  contrast to developed markets, where the vast majority of purchases involve  third-party payers. As such, rising disposable income is an important driver of  demand in these markets. As evidence of the company's commitment to emerging  markets, it opened two nutritional manufacturing plants last year in China and  India, plus a pilot plant in Singapore. New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. Many of  the company's launches are tailored to specific geographies. For example Abbott  recently launched new infant nutritional formulas (Similac QINTI and Eleva) in  China.  In the self-testing diabetic market, the company launched FreeStyle Libre, an  improved blood glucose monitor. Abbott is developing and launching its  next-generation diagnostic platforms, including the IRIDICA (molecular  diagnostic platform to quickly detect and identify the causative organisms  causing infections in patients) launch in Europe.  MitraClip, a medical device for mitral regurgitation, is relatively new and is  gaining traction in the market. XIENCE Alpine, a drug-eluting stent for treating  de novo chronic total coronary occlusions, was recently launched in the U.S.   TECNIS Multifocal Low Add is an intraocular lens with an improved ability to  reduce color distortion at near focus and at a distance. Select Market Headwinds: Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic  markets, including restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies in the  U.S. Restrained budgets in Europe pose headwinds, although they appear to be  moderating. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements are expected to hamper  reported top-line growth. However, the negative effect on margins is muted,  given that the company has significant operations (costs) in the same  geographies that are experiencing currency devaluation. Durable Margin Improvement Fitch anticipates that Abbott will continue to focus on driving efficiencies  across its business segments, in an effort to support/improve margins. During  2014, the company made progress in improving the cost structure in its  Nutrition, Established Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic segments, while also taking  out some general and administrative corporate costs. Fitch believes the margin  improvements are largely sustainable over the intermediate term and bode well  for cash generation and debt leverage.  Solid FCF: Fitch estimates that Abbott will generate solid cash flow of roughly  $1.6 billion - $1.7 billion in 2015, driven by incremental revenue growth and  moderately improving margins. Capital expenditures and dividends are expected to  steadily increase during the forecast period, as the company invests for growth  and aims to satisfy shareholders' return requirements. FCF should be sufficient  to fund moderate share repurchases and targeted acquisitions.  Growth/Shareholder-Focused Cash Deployment: Fitch believes Abbott will be  opportunistic with cash deployment as it weighs potential returns for  shareholders. As such the company will likely remain acquisitive, focusing on  companies or device platforms that offer innovation and growth, as technological  advancement in the device sector remains relatively fragmented. Abbott may also  consider targets that offer further expansion opportunities into favorable  geographies. Share repurchases will likely continue, especially in the absence  of viable acquisition targets, and the company will likely pursue a policy of  consistently increasing its dividend. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbott include: -- Low-single-digit reported revenue growth with organic growth in nutrional  products and pharmaceuticals being offset by negative foreign exchange rate  effects.  -- Gradually improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion during 2015. --Targeted acquisitions with no strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued share repurchases, especially in the absence of viable acquisition  targets. --Leverage to range between 1.7x-1.9x during the next few years driven by a  growth/shareholder-return capital deployment posture offsetting a steadily  improving operating profile.  LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Abbott to maintain adequate liquidity, as the company had  approximately $9.9 billion in cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2015  and its unused $5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in July 2019.  However, the company had roughly $2.9 billion in short-term borrowings backed by  the credit facility. Abbott generated approximately $920 million in FCF during  the latest 12-month (LTM) period ended March31, 2015. In addition, the company  should continue to have ample access to public debt markets. At March 31, 2015, Abbott had approximately $8.9 billion in debt outstanding  (including the $2.9 billion in short-term borrowings). Fitch believes the  company's debt maturities are manageable, with no significant maturities until  2019. Fitch's forecasts assume that Abbott will refinance most of these  maturities with the proceeds from new debt issuances. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade in the near to intermediate  term, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: -- Abbott committing to and operating with leverage stronger than 1.5x;  --Maintaining relatively stable operations and solid FCF that would support a  lower-leveraged capital structure. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: -- Debt above 2.0x EBITDA without the prospect for timely deleveraging, which  could result from a scenario in which revenue and margins are significantly  stressed (more than Fitch anticipates); -- Resulting FCF weakens and capital deployment is not adjusted to reduce the  company's need for debt financing; -- Significant debt-financed share repurchases or acquisitions in the near term  could prompt a negative rating action, as Abbott has limited flexibility  associated with the company's current leverage. RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded Abbott's ratings as follows:   --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A+';  --Senior unsecured debt rating to 'A' from 'A+'; --Bank loan rating to 'A' from 'A+'. Fitch has affirmed Abbott's short-term ratings as follows: --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook on the long-term ratings is Stable.

210,ABT,Abbott to vote for Mylan's acquisition of Perrigo,"(Reuters) - Mylan NV’s (MYL.O) largest stakeholder, Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), said it would back Mylan’s proposed acquisition of Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N), potentially helping Mylan fend off interest from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). Abbott, which has a 14.5 percent stake in Mylan, said on Tuesday that it supported Mylan’s “standalone strategy” and believed acquiring Perrigo would add value for shareholders. Mylan’s latest offer for Perrigo, worth $34.1 billion, is widely seen as an attempt to fend off Teva, the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs. Perrigo rejected Mylan’s sweetened offer in late April, around the same time Mylan rejected an offer of $40 billion from Teva, saying it grossly undervalued the company. Last year, Mylan said it would buy Abbott’s branded specialty and generics business in developed markets outside the United States in a $5.3 billion deal that would bolster its product line and cut its tax bill.

212,ABT,UPDATE 1-India expands medicine price control list to include 39 more drugs,"* New drugs join price control list of more than 500 drugs * Abbott, GSK, Lupin and Ipca among firms affected   (Adds details on government’s position, results of new study ) By Zeba Siddiqui MUMBAI, July 16 (Reuters) - India has extended price caps to an additional 39 drugs ranging from commonly used diabetes treatments to antibiotics, in the government’s latest effort to improve the affordability of medicines. Wide-ranging price cuts over the past year have hit several drugmakers in India and have been opposed by many in the industry, who say drug prices in the country are already among the lowest in the world. The new drugs join a price control list that covers more than 500 drugs. The latest move will include medicines made by foreign drugmakers such as Abbott Laboratories and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, as well as domestic firms such as Lupin Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd and Ipca Ltd. The move comes after a parliamentary committee said in April that the scope of price control needed to be enlarged even further. In India, the majority of people live on less than $2 a day and health insurance is scarce. But a study conducted by healthcare research firm IMS and sponsored by the main business association of multinational drugmakers operating in India argues that price controls are not an effective strategy to improve healthcare access for Indian patients. Price caps benefit high-income patients rather than the low-income patients and put pressure on profit margins for small and mid-sized companies, said the study, which was released on Tuesday.

213,ABT,Abbott strikes deals with heart valve replacement companies,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) on Thursday said it would buy a small private company and has invested in another, with an option to buy, as it places bets on the future growth potential of minimally invasive systems to replace diseased heart valves. Abbott said it has agreed to acquire the equity in Minnesota-based Tendyne Holdings Inc that it does not already own for $225 million plus future payments tied to regulatory milestones. Abbott already had a 10 percent stake in the company worth about $25 million. In a separate transaction in which financial details were not disclosed, Abbott said it has provided capital to and secured an option to purchase California-based Cephea Valve Technologies. Both private companies are developing systems to replace diseased mitral valves in the heart while sparing patients traditional chest-cracking open-heart surgery. Neither deal is expected to alter Abbott’s 2015 earnings forecast, the company said. Abbott currently sells MitraClip, a minimally invasive device used to repair a leaking mitral valve. The incidence of mitral valve disease is about three times that of aortic valve disease, with multibillion-dollar sales potential, Abbott said. “Given the market opportunity and clinical need, we see this as a significant driver for growth several years from now,” John Capek, head of Ventures for Abbott said in an interview. Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement systems are considered among the most important growth drivers for both Edwards Lifesciences (EW.N) and Medtronic (MDT.N). The dual flap mitral valve sits on the left side of the heart between upper and lower chambers and helps facilitate proper blood flow in the heart. U.S. regulators have given the green light to a study to test the safety and effectiveness of Tendyne’s mitral valve system, which has begun enrolling patients, Abbott said. It plans to begin enrolling patients next year for a trial aimed at gaining European approval. The Tendyne valve has been implanted in 10 people so far, Capek said.  “We’re very impressed with results,” he said. “Those 10 patients have done remarkably well.” The Cephea valve system is at a much earlier stage of development, he said.

The three major indexes were up more than 2 percent in early afternoon trading and were poised for their biggest two-day gain since 2009. Data showed that the U.S. economy grew 3.7 percent in the second quarter - better than expected and much faster than the previous estimate of 2.3 percent. Signs that the market was stabilizing rekindled expectations of an interest rate increase this year but interest rate swap rates indicated only a 25 percent chance of a hike next month. The market snapped a 6-day losing streak on Wednesday after New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for a September hike was “less compelling” after recent market turmoil sparked by fears of slowing growth in China. “I think in terms of sharp drops, the worst is probably behind us but it’s going to take a while before we get back to normal and we might still see some downward risk,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Underscoring signs of stability in the market, the CBOE Volatility index - popularly known as the “fear index” - fell 18 percent to 24.86. The index had soared to a more than 6-year-high earlier in the week. “Today’s GDP data shows that the U.S. economy’s fundamentals are strong and are growing despite all the global headwinds,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. The U.S. Federal Reserve, which meets on Sept. 16-17, has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. The Fed has kept interest rates at near zero, which has helped fuel the stock market to historic levels since the financial crisis. Investors will be keeping an eye on an annual conference of some of the world’s top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming over the next few days for further clues on interest rates. The market also got a rare dose of good news from China, where stocks snapped a brutal five-day losing streak. At 13:01 ET (1701 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 367.65 points, or 2.26 percent, at 16,653.16, the S&P; 500 was up 47.12 points, or 2.43 percent, at 1,987.63 and the Nasdaq composite was up 116.35 points, or 2.48 percent, at 4,813.89. All 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the energy index’s 4.7 percent rise leading the advancers as oil prices soared more than 9 percent in one of the biggest one-day rallies in years. Chevron’s 5.3 percent rise gave the biggest boost to the Dow. Shares of Apple, which helped lead the market higher on Wednesday, were up 2.9 percent at $112.94. The company invited journalists to a Sept. 9 event, where it is expected to unveil new iPhones and possibly a new version of its Apple TV set-top box. The stock provided the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. St Jude Medical rose as much as 15 percent in premarket trade after the Financial Times reported that Abbott Laboratories was preparing a $25 billion bid for the company. But the stock pared much of those gains after an Abbott spokesman told Reuters it was not pursuing an offer. St Jude was up 4.5 percent at $72.47.

An interest rate hike makes debt more expensive, affecting companies’ profit margins.

220,ABT,REFILE-UPDATE 3-Drugmaker Abbott says not pursuing an offer for St Jude Medical,"(Refiles to correct syntax in paragraph 5) By Vidya L Nathan Aug 27 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Abbott Laboratories, knocking down a report in the Financial Times, denied on Thursday that it was preparing a bid for medical device maker St Jude Medical Inc. The FT, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Abbott has been working with advisers for several weeks to line up financing for a $25 billion cash and stock bid for St. Paul, Minnesota-based St Jude. (on.ft.com/1JxHqTe) St Jude’s shares, which jumped 15 percent premarket trading following the report, were up 3.4 percent at $71.72 in early trading. The company had a market value of about $19.5 billion as of Wednesday’s close. “I can tell you that we are not pursuing an offer for St Jude,” Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel told Reuters. St Jude did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A source familiar with Abbott’s thinking said he did not believe a deal was seriously contemplated, while Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said Abbott was more likely to do medium-sized deals than a big transaction. Abbott Chief Executive Miles White said last month that he was interested in acquisitions, including in the device sector,  but would be cautious because a flurry of deals in the healthcare industry had pushed up valuations. Abbott had cash on hand of almost $4 billion as of June 30. RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said last month that a deal in the region of $5 billion for a device maker was more likely than something larger. Kumar and Wells Fargo Securities’ Larry Biegelsen said on Thursday they expected Abbott to strike a deal in either the medical device or generic drug industries. Abbott shares, which had fallen about 2 percent this year up to Wednesday’s close, were up 1.8 percent at $44.75.

225,ABT,Exclusive: Abbott tangles with regulators over Indian cough syrup complaint,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Drugmaker Abbott Healthcare is challenging an Indian state’s accusation that a sample of the company’s cough syrup contained excessive levels of codeine, the second multinational to question India’s regulatory testing regime in recent months. Whether the sample of Abbott’s popular “Phensedyl” was a genuine product or a fake has not been established, but the suspect batch of 80,000 bottles has not been recalled. The state laboratory in West Bengal first raised the alarm last November. The previously unreported case underlines the weakness of India’s unwieldy and poorly resourced drug and food regulatory system, the uncertainty it creates for foreign and domestic companies operating there and the potential risk to consumers. Abbott Healthcare is a unit of U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories. Abbott Laboratories also has a listed subsidiary in India, Abbott India Ltd. Three months ago, Nestle was forced to withdraw its Maggi instant noodles from Indian shelves because the food safety authority banned the snack after its tests showed excess lead. A court later overturned the ban in a partial victory for the Swiss food giant, but the allegations hurt the company’s reputation and that of the country’s regulators, who operate with few staff and poorly equipped facilities. In the latest dispute, the laboratory found that a sample of Phensedyl contained more than twice the labeled amount of codeine, according to several state drug officials and correspondence between regulators and Abbott seen by Reuters. Phensedyl sales are estimated to be more than 3 percent of Abbott’s $1 billion India revenue. The sales are dwarfed by Abbott’s global annual sales of over $20 billion, but, as the Nestle case shows, fallout from safety scandals is unpredictable. The excessive codeine, an opium derivative, would violate Indian drugs law. It triggered a “show cause” notice against Abbott, which was sent in March by the drug regulator in Himachal Pradesh state, where Phensedyl is manufactured. In its response in late April, Abbott denied the allegations and urged regulators to not take any action. Abbott said it had found nothing unusual in its own and third party testing of a retained sample from the same batch of Phensedyl. The company also asked regulators to give it more information about the source of the suspect sample and the manner in which it was collected, so that it could establish whether it was genuine and proper process was followed. “We are awaiting response from the authorities,” the company said in answer to Reuters questions. The original test was carried out by West Bengal after Phensedyl bottles were seized near the border with Bangladesh, said Samit Saha, a state drug inspector involved in the case. Codeine-based cough syrups are banned in Bangladesh, and smuggling is rife as people profit from higher prices there compared to India. According to a copy of the inspector’s report, the sample contained 21.37 mg of codeine per 5 ml dosage, instead of 10 mg specified on the label. Saha said two other samples from different batches, however, showed normal codeine levels. Excessive consumption of cough syrup with high levels of codeine can lead to health implications such as sedation, behavioral changes and drug dependence, said Amitabh Parti, a doctor at Fortis Memorial Research Institute. In February, West Bengal listed the potentially tainted batch as “not of standard quality” in a monthly publication.  The bulletin, which is posted on the regulator’s website, is supposed to alert consumers and pharmacies in the state to suspect drugs. But the West Bengal drug controller, C. M. Ghosh, said he does not have the resources to follow it up. Navneet Marwaha, the drug controller in Himachal Pradesh, said in an interview that Phensedyl, which accounts for about a third of the Indian cough syrup market, is often copied by counterfeiters. He said Abbott’s stocks of codeine were accounted for. “They (Abbott) are saying ‘show us the sample so we can see whether it is genuine.’ They have not been provided with the sample,” Marwaha said. He added that it was up to West Bengal to provide the information to Abbott. West Bengal’s Ghosh said it was Himachal Pradesh’s prerogative and the company can only challenge the test’s findings at a federal drug lab with a court’s permission.  Safety breaches and scares are common in India. According to a 2012 parliamentary report, nearly one in 22 locally produced drug samples is of sub-standard quality in India. India has just 1,500 drug inspectors responsible for more than 10,000 factories, supplying medicines for a population of 1.2 billion and exporting to nearly 200 countries.  Ghosh said he has 140 drug inspectors to monitor more than 50,000 pharmacies in the state. The federal government wants to improve regulation of the key sector, and plans to spend $263 million in the next three years to strengthen the national and state regulatory system with additional equipment and staff and new laboratories.

The bulletin, which is posted on the regulator’s website, is supposed to alert consumers and pharmacies in the state to suspect drugs. But the West Bengal drug controller, C. M.

He added that it was up to West Bengal to provide the information to Abbott. West Bengal’s Ghosh said it was Himachal Pradesh’s prerogative and the company can only challenge the test’s findings at a federal drug lab with a court’s permission. Safety breaches and scares are common in India. According to a 2012 parliamentary report, nearly one in 22 locally produced drug samples is of sub-standard quality in India.

Abbott Healthcare is a unit of U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories. Abbott Laboratories also has a listed subsidiary in India, Abbott India Ltd. Three months ago, Nestle was forced to withdraw its Maggi instant noodles from Indian shelves because the food safety authority banned the snack after its tests showed excess lead. A court later overturned the ban in a partial victory for the Swiss food giant, but the allegations hurt the company’s reputation and that of the country’s regulators, who operate with few staff and poorly equipped facilities. In the latest dispute, the laboratory found that a sample of Phensedyl contained more than twice the labelled amount of codeine, according to several state drug officials and correspondence between regulators and Abbott seen by Reuters. Phensedyl sales are estimated to be more than 3 percent of Abbott’s $1 billion India revenue. The sales are dwarfed by Abbott’s global annual sales of over $20 billion, but, as the Nestle case shows, fallout from safety scandals is unpredictable. The excessive codeine, an opium derivative, would violate Indian drugs law. It triggered a “show cause” notice against Abbott, which was sent in March by the drug regulator in Himachal Pradesh, where Phensedyl is manufactured. In its response in late April, Abbott denied the allegations and urged regulators to not take any action. Abbott said it had found nothing unusual in its own and third party testing of a retained sample from the same batch of Phensedyl. The company also asked regulators to give it more information about the source of the suspect sample and the manner in which it was collected, so that it could establish whether it was genuine and proper process was followed.     “We are awaiting response from the authorities,” the company said in answer to Reuters questions. The original test was carried out by West Bengal after Phensedyl bottles were seized near the border with Bangladesh, said Samit Saha, a state drug inspector involved in the case. Codeine-based cough syrups are banned in Bangladesh, and smuggling is rife as people profit from higher prices there compared to India. According to a copy of the inspector’s report, the sample contained 21.37 mg of codeine per 5 ml dosage, instead of 10 mg specified on the label.

230,ABT,Abbott sales beat as demand for generic drugs rises,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly sales as demand rose for its generic drugs in emerging markets, including Latin America and China.  Abbott said on Wednesday sales of its generic drugs grew in double digits in emerging markets, helped by the acquisition of Chilean drugmaker CFR Pharmaceuticals SA last year. Sales of generic drugs rose to $961 million in the third quarter, contributing about 19 percent to Abbott’s total sales.  Revenue from its nutritional products business, its largest, rose 6.5 percent. The business accounts for more than a third of the company’s total sales.  Abbott also raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast range and cut the upper end, to $2.14-$2.16 per share from $2.10-$2.20. The developer of anesthetic Pentothal said total revenue rose 2 percent to $5.15 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, while net profit rose 8 percent to $580 million, or 38 cents per share.  Excluding items, Abbott earned 54 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 53 cents per share and revenue of $5.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Abbott’s shares closed at $41.74 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

231,ABT,Chilean in $13.2 mln insider trading accord with U.S. regulators,"NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - A former board member of Chile’s CFR Pharmaceuticals SA has reached a $13.2 million settlement to resolve charges by a U.S. regulator that he engaged in insider trading ahead of Abbott Laboratories’  $2.9 billion acquisition of the drug company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in papers filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court, said the sum would be paid by a British Virgin Islands entity through which Juan Cruz Bilbao Hormaeche of Chile conducted the alleged insider trading. The SEC also agreed to drop charges against a business associate of Bilbao, Tomas Andres Hurtado Rourke, who it said placed the trades in an account of the entity, Somerton Resources Limited, and made trades in his own brokerage account. The trading took place after Bilbao participated in a March 2014 meeting via telephone in which CFR’s board considered a confidential proposal by Abbott to buy the company. The announcement by Abbott days later of an agreement to buy CFR in a $2.9 billion deal enabled Bilbao and Hurtado to reap about $10.6 million in illicit profits, the SEC said. The SEC filed its lawsuit in December against Bilbao, the president of banking and insurance company Consorcio Financiero SA, and Hurtado, who was a director of the company’s banking unit. Both men were Chilean citizens living in Santiago, the lawsuit said. The SEC subsequently obtained a court order freezing $42.8 million of Bilbao’s and Somerton’s assets. Lawyers for Bilbao and Hurtado did not respond to requests for comment. The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

234,ABT,Market for new heart valve device could take years to build,"CHICAGO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Top medical device makers are investing heavily in a new way to treat leaky mitral heart valves, a serious condition affecting millions of people, but it will be at least four years before the technology reaches the U.S. market. The minimally invasive treatment, called transcatheter mitral valve replacement, lets a doctor implant an artificial valve using a catheter inserted through the arteries. The technique spares the patient from open-heart surgery, the traditional approach to valve replacement that is considered too risky for many people, especially the elderly. Medtronic Plc, Abbott Laboratories, Edwards Lifesciences Corp and HeartWare International Inc  in recent months have spent a total of $2 billion to buy young companies developing versions of the technology. Boston Scientific Corp has an option to buy an early-stage company developing a mitral replacement system. Nearly 6 million people in the United States may suffer from mitral disease, and Wall Street analysts say it could be the next multibillion-dollar market. But the rush by leading device makers into mitral replacement has raised questions for some investors and heart doctors. Fewer than 100 people worldwide have undergone the procedure, and it is far from clear whether this technique will be significantly better than other treatments or how many patients would be candidates for the surgery. “All these things are still several years away, especially from the U.S. market,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of Medtronic. Mitral disease is “something that very gradually develops. A ton of people may have it, but a smaller number have it at a life-threatening stage.” The mitral valve helps regulate blood flow from the heart’s left atrium into the left ventricle. Mitral valve regurgitation occurs when the valve does not close properly to prevent backflow. It can cause extreme fatigue and shortness of breath and increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death. “If we have a way where we can replace the valve without surgery, that is where all the excitement is,” said Dr. Mathew Williams, chief of cardiac surgery at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. Abbott’s MitraClip is the only minimally invasive product on the U.S. market for the condition. It repairs, rather than replaces, a patient’s own mitral valve. It is approved for a limited group of severely ill patients and its performance improves when certain anatomical characteristics are present. Annual sales are about $250 million worldwide. Abbott sees room for both repair and replacement in treating mitral disease and projects strong double-digit annual growth for the MitraClip over the next several years, said John Capek, a company executive vice president. Rivals Edwards and Medtronic have found huge success with a minimally invasive technique for replacing malfunctioning aortic valves, and some see that as a benchmark for the mitral market. Edwards projects the aortic market will grow to $3 billion in worldwide sales in five years, double its 2014 sales, driven by advancements in the technology and approvals to treat additional patient populations. Some Wall Street analysts, including Morgan Stanley’s David Lewis, predict the mitral market could be two to three times larger because more patients have mitral valve disease than aortic. “What you’ve got is this huge market opportunity. But the challenges are huge, and it’s going to take some time,” said Edwards Chief Executive Michael Mussallem. Edwards may be the first to launch a transcatheter replacement product in Europe, possibly by late 2017, with a U.S. approval possible by 2019. Replacing a mitral valve is particularly tricky, partly due to the valve’s asymmetrical structure, which varies by patient and is more difficult to address than the circular aortic valve, according to doctors. It can also be tougher to guide a mitral valve to the heart through the arteries because of its larger size, and harder to reach the original valve due to its location. Results will not come until the end of 2017 from a key study enrolling up to 430 patients to determine whether repairing the valve using Abbott’s MitraClip is better than medications alone. Doctors say the research could bolster the case for minimally invasive approaches if the results support the procedure’s effectiveness. Patients with mitral valve regurgitation often take medicines used to treat heart failure, but these do not correct the valve condition. “It is a very interesting space, and there is a need for mitral valve replacement,” said Dr. Saibal Kar, director of interventional cardiac research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. But he cautioned it is much too early to predict it will become the industry’s next multi-billion-dollar market. “It is unbridled enthusiasm,” he said.

237,ABT,Abbott Labs to buy diagnostics company Alere for $5.8 billion,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said it would buy Alere Inc ALR.N for $5.8 billion to become a leader in point-of-care testing, a fast-growing market as physicians increasingly adopt rapid tests that speed up treatment. Point-of-care tests provide results to doctors in a matter of minutes as they can be conducted in the physician’s office, an ambulance or even at home. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Alere, which has annual sales of $2.5 billion, makes tests for infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. The deal comes at a time when deadly viruses such as Zika are spreading alarmingly across the globe, putting the spotlight on diagnostic test makers and vaccine developers. It was not immediately clear if Alere or Abbott were involved in making tests for Zika, which has been linked to severe birth defects in babies. “We view the deal positively as we think point-of-care testing is the fastest growing segment in the diagnostic market,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo said. The global diagnostics industry, which is roughly $60 billion in size, is growing at a rate of 5 percent, according to Goldman Sachs. Abbott will pay $56 per share in cash, a premium of about 51 percent to Alere’s Friday closing. Alere shares were trading at $53.95 on Monday. Abbott was down 0.7 percent. Abbott, which makes products ranging from Similac infant formula to Ensure beverages for adults, has struggled to boost sales growth after it sold its developed-markets generics business to Mylan NV (MYL.O) in 2014. The company, which spun out AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) in 2013, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue for the first time in four quarters last week. Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro said the deal helps Abbott become the undisputed global leader in point-of-care diagnostics and help diversify its business. Abbott, whose 2015 worldwide diagnostics sales were $4.6 billion in 2015, said its total diagnostics sales would exceed $7 billion after the close of the deal. The deal will immediately add to Abbott’s earnings per share upon close and contribute significantly thereafter, the companies said. Alere’s net debt, currently $2.6 billion, will be assumed or refinanced by Abbott. Evercore is the financial adviser to Abbott, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP is legal counsel.

239,ABT,Fitch Places Abbotts's Ratings on Negative Watch,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed Abbott Laboratories'  (Abbott) ratings on Negative Rating Watch following its announced intention to  acquire Alere, Inc. (ALR). Abbott had $8.4 billion in outstanding debt at Sept. 30, 2015. A full list of  Fitch's ratings actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sound Acquisition, Increased Leverage: Abbott plans to acquire ALR for roughly  $5.8 billion cash and approximately $2.6 billion of assumed net debt. The  company intends to finance the transaction with debt. Fitch believes the  acquisition makes sense strategically, as the acquisition will increase  Abbotts's presence in point of care diagnostics and has prospects to expand  Alere's products in international markets. Abbott already has a strong position  in the medical diagnostics market and a demonstrable record of successfully  acquiring and integrating acquisitions. Abbott expects to achieve nearly $500 million in pre-tax synergies in 2019, and  more thereafter. Despite the favorable strategic and operational aspects of  adding Alere's products to Abbott's existing portfolio, Fitch expects leverage  to increase significantly because of the transaction. Pro forma leverage could  approach or exceed 3x immediately after the acquisition close, if Abbott does  not pay down any debt beforehand. As such, the degree to which and the pace at  which the company deleverages will factor heavily in Fitch's rating  determination for Abbott. A downgrade could occur if leverage does not decrease  to below or around 2x within 18-24 months after the deal closes. Based on its  operating forecast for the combined company, Fitch believes Abbott will generate  enough free cash flow (FCF) to accomplish this level of debt reduction, but  uncertain as to the company's commitment to deploy capital for this purpose.  Stable Operations: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's diversified product portfolio  will continue to produce low- to mid-single-digit organic growth in the  intermediate term, given the strength of its product offerings and its  geographic mix. However, adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper  reported growth in the near term. Revenue growth and relatively stable margins  should provide for solid FCF generation. Emerging Market Tailwinds with Some Headwinds:  Fitch expects the majority of Abbott's growth will continue to come from  emerging markets. Abbott will generate roughly 50% of its revenues from emerging  markets in 2016, due to strong demand-driven growth in those markets. Nutrition,  Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from  the rapidly growing middle class in these markets, and nearly all purchases are  paid for by consumers. This is in contrast to developed markets, where the vast  majority of purchases of prescription pharmaceuticals, clinical diagnostic tests  and medical devices involve third-party payers. As such, rising disposable  income is an important driver of demand in these markets.  Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic markets, including  restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies in the U.S. and  macroeconomic distress in Venezuela. Restrained budgets in Europe pose  headwinds, although they appear to be moderating. Unfavorable foreign exchange  rate movements will likely continue to hamper reported top-line growth in the  near term. However, the negative effect on margins is muted given that the  company has significant operations (costs) in the same geographies that are  experiencing currency devaluation. New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. The  company often launches new products that are tailored to specific geographies.  Durable Margin Improvement Fitch anticipates that Abbott will continue to focus on driving efficiencies  across its business segments, in an effort to improve margins. The company made  progress in improving the cost structure in its Nutrition and Diagnostic  segments, while also taking out some general and administrative corporate costs.  Fitch believes the margin improvements are largely sustainable over the  intermediate term and bode well for cash generation and debt leverage.  Solid FCF: Fitch estimates that Abbott will generate solid cash flow of at least  $1 billion in 2016, driven by incremental organic revenue growth and moderately  improving margins. Capital expenditures and dividends are expected to steadily  increase during the forecast period as the company invests for growth. FCF  should be sufficient to fund what Fitch expects will be moderate share  repurchases and increasing dividends.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbot Laboratories include:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near- to intermediate-term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Low single-digit reported revenue growth with organic growth offset by  negative foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of at least $1 billion during 2016. --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --Debt above around 2x EBITDA within 18-24 months after the Alere acquisition; --Significant operational stress, which may include an inability to successfully  integrate the planned Alere acquisition and achieve expected synergies; --Resulting FCF weakens to a level where the company cannot meaningfully reduce  debt following the Alere acquisition.  Positive: Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade in the near- to  intermediate-term. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Abbott to maintain adequate liquidity, as the company had  approximately $6.1 billion in cash and short-term investments at Sept. 30, 2015.  The company has an unused $5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in  July 2019, although Abbott had roughly $2.4 billion in short-term borrowings  backed by the credit facility. Abbott generated approximately $809 million in  FCF during the latest 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 2015. In addition, the  company should continue to have ample access to public debt markets. At March 31, 2015, Abbott had approximately $8.4 billion in debt outstanding  (including the $2.4 billion in short-term borrowings). Fitch believes the  company's debt maturities are manageable, with no significant maturities until  2019.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Abbott Laboratories Fitch has placed the following ratings on Negative Watch:  --Long-term IDR 'A';  --Bank loan rating 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt rating 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper program 'F1'.

240,ABT,Antibiotic combination marketed by Abbott in India on list of banned drugs,"MUMBAI, March 13 (Reuters) - A powerful antibiotic combination that is marketed in India by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories is among 344 drug combinations that have been banned by the Indian health authorities. A Reuters investigation revealed in December that a unit of Abbott in India was selling a combination of the antibiotics cefixime and azithromycin without approval from the central government. The combination is not approved for sale in major pharmaceutical markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan. Abbott markets the combination of cefixime and azithromycin under the Zimnic AZ brand. At least 15 other companies in India manufacture and market the same combination under different brand names. A notice issued by the Indian Health Ministry at the weekend said that a government-appointed committee of experts had found that the banned combinations were “likely to involve risk to human beings, whereas safer alternatives to the said drug are available.” The government notice said the ban would take effect immediately. Besides antibiotic combinations, the list of banned drugs also included analgesic combinations containing nimesulide, and codeine-based drugs. Anand Kadkol, a spokesman for Abbott in India, said the government announcement had been made late on Saturday and the company was “reviewing the notification.” Fixed-dose combination drugs, or FDCs, combine two or more drugs in a single pill. In India, many pharmaceutical companies have obtained a license from a state to make FDCs, like Abbott’s Zimnic AZ, and sell them across the country without the consent of the central government. India’s drug regulators have made intermittent efforts over the years to shut down this avenue, but enforcement has been patchy and success limited. In 2007, for instance, the government instructed states to withdraw close to 300 combination drugs that were being sold without the approval of the central government. But drug companies and industry associations took the government to court and the order was stayed. D.G. Shah, the secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents 20 of India’s biggest drugmakers, questioned the legality of the government’s decision and said “the lack of transparency raises doubts about the merits and the process followed or not followed.” Shah said companies that were affected by the ban could challenge the order in court. K.L. Sharma, a senior Health Ministry official who issued the ban order, was not immediately available for comment. In its notice, the government said a panel of experts had found that there was “no therapeutic justification” for any of the 344 FDCs it was banning. The panel reviewed 6,700 drug combinations. In its investigation, Reuters interviewed former and current medical representatives for Abbott who said Zimnic AZ had been promoted and administered as a treatment for a broad array of illnesses, including colds, fevers, urinary tract infections, drug-resistant typhoid and sexually transmitted diseases. Reuters also found chemists who were selling the drug to prevent post-operative infection and for respiratory problems. Medical experts told Reuters that combining cefixime and azithromycin was risky, and said that prescribing the combination for cold symptoms did not make sense. While combination drugs are used worldwide to improve patients’ compliance, in India they have proliferated to the point where in 2014 nearly half the drugs on the market were combinations. Companies in India have increasingly added ingredients to existing drugs so they can promote a new product to doctors and chemists in an effort to increase market share. Doctors and health experts say the spread and misuse of antibiotic combinations may be contributing to antibiotic resistance in India. Some superbugs, which are strains of bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics, have been found in patients who travelled from India to countries including the United States and Britain.

241,ABT,India bans more than 300 combination drugs sold illegally,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has banned the manufacture and sale of more than 300 combination medicines, including two widely used cough syrups, being sold without government approval, a senior health ministry official said on Saturday. The move is aimed at curbing the misuse of such medicines in India, where nearly half the drugs sold in 2014 were so called “fixed dose combinations.” Combination drugs are used worldwide to improve patients’ compliance, as it is easier to get patients to take one drug rather than several. But inconsistent enforcement of drug laws in India has led to the proliferation of hundreds of such medicines entering the market based on approval from regulators of individual states, rather than the central government. In 2014, India set up a committee to review more than 6,000 combinations that had entered the market based only on state regulators’ approval. Policymakers gave pharmaceutical companies a chance to retroactively prove the safety and efficacy of these drugs by submitting data on their drugs.  The committee was tasked with classifying the drugs into rational, irrational, and those that need further studies, said KL Sharma, a joint secretary at the health ministry.  “Now based on responses (and) assessment of products, more than 300 drugs have been prohibited,” he told Reuters. He did not name the medicines, but said an official notice announcing the ban would be issued “in a few days.” The Drug Controller General of India was not immediately available to comment. The banned medicines include the codeine-based cough syrups Phensedyl and Corex, the Times of India said in a report earlier on Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Phensedyl, made by U.S. drug maker Abbott Laboratories, accounts for about a third of the Indian cough syrup market, and its sales are estimated to make up more than 3 percent of Abbott’s $1 billion India revenue. Corex is sold by Pfizer Inc . Reuters reported last October that Indian regulators were privately pressuring drug firms to better police the selling of popular codeine-based cough syrups to tackle smuggling and addiction.  Neither company responded to requests for comment on Saturday. Doctors and public health experts in India and abroad have warned that increasing use of antibiotic combinations in India may be contributing to antibiotic resistance. India is a particular concern as the market share of combination drugs versus single drugs is bigger than anywhere in the world. Reuters reported in December how a powerful antibiotic cocktail being marketed in India by a unit of Abbott and many other local companies did not carry approval from the central government. The combination was not approved for sale in major markets such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and Australia.  Several medical experts said it did not make sense to prescribe the cocktail for cold symptoms. However, Abbott’s former and current medical representatives said the combination was being promoted and administered as a treatment for a wide variety of illnesses, including colds and fevers.

244,ABT,Indian court grants Pfizer temporary relief on cough syrup ban,"(Reuters) - An Indian court granted U.S. drugmaker Pfizer   an interim injunction on a ban on its popular cough syrup Corex, days after the government ordered it to be prohibited citing a potential risk to humans. India’s health ministry banned the combination of chlorpheniramine maleate and codeine syrup, which Pfizer sells as the cough syrup Corex, in a notice over the weekend. Pfizer’s Indian subsidiary appealed the ban through a writ petition in the New Delhi High Court, which granted the company a stay on Monday, pending the next court hearing, Pfizer said in a statement. Pfizer’s Indian business said earlier on Monday it had stopped selling Corex, and expected its profit to be hit, as the brand generated sales of about $26 million in the nine months through December. Pfizer shares closed down 9 percent in Mumbai, before the stay order was issued. The court said the government had not issued Pfizer a “show cause notice” before banning the medicine, two lawyers for the drugmaker told Reuters, declining to be named. The next hearing by on Pfizer’s plea is slated for March 21. The ban also applied to Abbott Laboratories’  Phensedyl cough syrup and Abbott’s Indian subsidiary also filed a writ petition at the same court, which will come up for hearing on Tuesday, local television channels said. Sanjay Jain, a lawyer representing the health ministry, wasn’t immediately available to comment. Abbott’s Phensedyl commands around a third of India’s cough syrup market and makes up over 3 percent of the company’s $1 billion in revenue in India. The shares of Abbott’s Indian arm fell about 3 percent after it said it would comply with the ban. Abbott declined to comment on its case. As the cough syrup contains the narcotic codeine, India has been privately pressuring manufacturers to better police supply chains to tackle smuggling and addiction, Reuters reported last year. Akun Sabharwal, drugs controller for the southern state of Telangana which last year detected an “illegal diversion” of Phensedyl worth about $8.5 million, said he believed the ban would end the syrup’s abuse. The medicine was among 344 fixed-dose combination drugs India banned, saying a panel of experts found the drugs lacked “therapeutic justification”. Market researcher AIOCD AWACS estimated it could cut sales in the local pharmaceutical industry by up to $522 million, with Pfizer and Abbott among the worst hit. The sale of fixed dose combination medicines in India requires the approval of the central government. But several drug combinations have entered the market over the years based solely on approval from individual states. India has made intermittent efforts to shut this avenue, but success has been limited.

But drug companies and industry associations took the government to court and the order was stayed. D.G. Shah, the secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents 20 of India’s biggest drugmakers, questioned the legality of the government’s decision and said “the lack of transparency raises doubts about the merits and the process followed or not followed.” Shah said companies that were affected by the ban could challenge the order in court. K.L. Sharma, a senior Health Ministry official who issued the ban order, was not immediately available for comment. In its notice, the government said a panel of experts had found that there was “no therapeutic justification” for any of the 344 FDCs it was banning. The panel reviewed 6,700 drug combinations. In its investigation, Reuters interviewed former and current medical representatives for Abbott who said Zimnic AZ had been promoted and administered as a treatment for a broad array of illnesses, including colds, fevers, urinary tract infections, drug-resistant typhoid and sexually transmitted diseases. Reuters also found chemists who were selling the drug to prevent post-operative infection and for respiratory problems. Medical experts told Reuters that combining cefixime and azithromycin was risky, and said that prescribing the combination for cold symptoms did not make sense. While combination drugs are used worldwide to improve patients’ compliance, in India they have proliferated to the point where in 2014 nearly half the drugs on the market were combinations. Companies in India have increasingly added ingredients to existing drugs so they can promote a new product to doctors and chemists in an effort to increase market share. Doctors and health experts say the spread and misuse of antibiotic combinations may be contributing to antibiotic resistance in India. Some superbugs, which are strains of bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics, have been found in patients who travelled from India to countries including the United States and Britain.

258,ABT,Abbott to buy St. Jude for $25 billion to boost heart devices,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said on Thursday that it would buy St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N in a $25 billion deal to expand its heart device business, but investors worried that the acquisition would not pay off as promised. Medical equipment makers are under pressure to offer a wider portfolio of products to hospital customers, which have also been through a wave of mergers that have increased their power to negotiate on pricing. Abbott said its deal would help it compete more effectively against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N), but its shares fell nearly 6 percent.  Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White defended the deal on a conference call with analysts, saying it would add to earnings per share in the first full year after it closes.  The company said St. Jude’s devices to treat heart failure and abnormal heart rhythm complement its own cardiovascular products. White also said on CNBC that while St. Jude has had low-growth years, it has new products to introduce over the next few years. “St. Jude is in more mature cardiac rhythm management markets, so does this really become additive to the overall Abbott revenue growth rate?” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said.  Abbott is also trying to buy diagnostics company Alere Inc ALR.N for $5.8 billion and has a plan in place to borrow money for both it and St. Jude. Still, some investors have doubts it will complete the Alere deal because the U.S. government is investigating that company over sales practices.  “Abbott as serial acquirer has built up its medical device division,” Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang said. “Once they make those purchases, it does not seem like management is very good at producing meaningful innovation.”   With St. Jude, Abbott could compete better in an environment where hospitals prefer to deal with only two or three vendors, White said.  “Price pressure has been a way of life for a couple of years, so you have to make it up on volume,” said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas, adding that there is “really no overlap” in the companies’ products. Abbott, which also sells nutritionals such as baby formula, generic pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, said the combined cardiovascular device unit would have annual sales of $8.7 billion. Shares of St. Jude were up 27.3 percent at $78.10 in midday trading, while Abbott was down 5.6 percent after a sharper drop. St. Jude shareholders will receive $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an Abbott share for each of their shares. Based on Abbott’s closing stock price on Wednesday, the deal is worth $25 billion, or about $85 per share, a 37 percent premium. The acquisition will add 21 cents per share to earnings, excluding special items, in 2017 and 29 cents in 2018, Abbott said. Abbott said it would take on or refinance about $5.7 billion of St. Jude’s net debt. It sees $500 million in cost savings by 2020. The move comes after years of speculation about the two medical device companies merging. Bloomberg reported last summer that a deal was under discussion, but Abbott denied it. Responding to analysts’ questions on Thursday, White said the talks did not begin until late last year. “I don’t know that anything has changed,” White said. “I’ve been open about being interested in M&A.;” Evercore and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are advising Abbott on the St. Jude deal, while Guggenheim Securities is the financial adviser to St. Jude. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was legal counsel to Abbott, while Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher advised St. Jude.

260,ABT,Fitch Maintains Abbott on Rating Watch Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained Abbott Laboratories'  (ABT, Abbott) 'A'/'F1' ratings on Rating Watch Negative. The rating action  follows the announcement of Abbott's intention to acquire St. Jude Medical Inc.  (STJ, St. Jude) and its previously announced agreement from February 2016 to  acquire Alere Inc. (Alere). Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch as more details regarding the transactions  become available. However, given the currently available information and  assuming Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch will likely downgrade  Abbott to 'BBB'/'F2'. Abbott had approximately $9 billion in outstanding debt at Dec. 31, 2015. A full  list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --St. Jude and Alere are good strategic fits, but the acquisitions will  significantly stress leverage for at least two years. --Abbott's diversified product portfolio is positioned to deliver  mid-single-digit organic growth with or without the additions of St. Jude and  Alere. --Fitch anticipates that Abbott's efforts to improve operating margins will  continue to yield results through organic improvements in sales mix and cost  control plus integration-related synergies. --Fitch forecasts Abbott generating positive free cash flow (FCF) excluding the  near-term negative effect of one-time acquisition/integration related costs.  --Fitch expects the company's Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals segments to benefit from the growth in emerging markets.  --Abbott's ongoing focus on new product introductions across virtually all of  its business segments bodes well for growth and margins. --The company faces challenges regarding reimbursement for some of its products,  as well as near-term adverse foreign exchange movements and select international  economic stress. --Fitch expects that Abbott will maintain adequate liquidity through cash  generation, bank credit and access to the capital markets. Sound Acquisitions/High Leverage: Abbott's planned acquisitions of St. Jude and  Alere are good strategic fits. Both expand Abbott's market presence in segments  that the company currently operates, by providing the company with broader  product offerings. The acquired portfolios, in aggregate, will also offer  organic growth potential. Abbott should be able to realize the combined  forecasted pre-tax synergies (from St. Jude and Alere) of roughly $800 million  within four years of the acquisitions. The equity value of the St. Jude  transaction is approximately $25 billion ($46.75 in cash and 0.8708 shares of  Abbott common stock per share of St. Jude) plus roughly $5.7 billion assumed net  debt. Abbott intends to acquire Alere for $5.8 billion cash (equity value) and  around $2.6 billion of assumed net debt.  The two acquisitions will significantly increase debt, with leverage forecasted  to remain above 3.0x through 2019. Fitch expects Abbott will reduce leverage to  durably below 3.0x thereafter, through a combination of debt reduction and  increased EBITDA. Operating margins will likely improve because of favorable  shifts in sales mix, good cost control and synergies. FCF should stay  significantly positive (excluding one-time restructuring costs). The potential  BBB'/'F2' post-transaction rating assumes Abbott will pursue a more conservative  approach to capital deployment, with share repurchases, dividend increases and  acquisitions remaining modest. The transaction is likely to close near year-end 2016 pending regulatory  approvals and St. Jude shareholder approval. The addition of St. Jude's products  will significantly expand Abbott's medical device portfolio, particularly in the  area of cardiovascular disease. The deal will position Abbott as the number-one  or number-two player in many of the sub-segments of the cardiovascular device  market. The combination provides minimal overlap in product categories and  offers Abbott a larger presence in the faster growing device areas of atrial  fibrillation, structural heart and neuromodulation. Abbott estimates that it will realize roughly $500 million in annual synergies  by 2020 from the St. Jude acquisition. Broader portfolios within the  sub-segments of cardiovascular should provide Abbott with increased  contracting/shelf space opportunities when contracting with hospital management  and purchasing groups. Cost-related synergies in the areas of sourcing plus some  overlap in sales force and administrative functions should be attainable. In  addition, Abbott has a demonstrable record of accomplishment of acquiring and  successfully integrating acquisitions. Alere Expands Point-of-Care Diagnostics: Fitch believes the acquisition of Alere  makes sense strategically, as the combination will increase Abbott's presence in  point-of-care diagnostics and prospects to expand Alere's products into  international markets. Abbott already has a strong position in the medical  diagnostics market. The point-of-care segment of the diagnostics market will  likely grow faster than the in vitro diagnostic market during the intermediate  term. The company also expects to achieve nearly $300 million in pre-tax  synergies by 2019 and more thereafter. Durable Margin Improvement: Abbott will likely focus on improving margins  through cost control and generating a favorable shift in sales mix. In addition  to securing the forecasted acquisition-related synergies, Fitch looks for Abbott  to continue driving efficiencies across its business segments. Innovative,  value-added product launches should be able to secure attractive pricing. Fitch  expects margin improvements will be durable during the intermediate term. Stable Operations Prior/Post Acquisition: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's  diversified product portfolio (with or without the two acquisitions) will  continue to produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate term,  given the strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix. However,  adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper reported growth in the  near term, although margins should remain moderately insulated from the trend.  Revenue growth and margin support should provide for solid free cash flow  generation. Positive FCF/Conservative Capital Deployment: Fitch estimates that Abbott will  generate normalized free cash flow in 2018 and 2019 of roughly $1.5 billion to  $1.6 billion, with one-time transaction-related costs hampering FCF before then.  Forecasted revenue growth and moderately improving margins will drive cash  generation. Capital expenditures and dividends incrementally increase during the  forecast period, as the company focuses on strengthening its balance sheet and  credit profile. FCF should be sufficient to fund debt reduction, modest share  repurchases and small acquisitions. Select Market Headwinds: Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic  markets, including restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies and  infant nutritionals in the U.S. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements and  economic stress in Venezuela will likely hamper reported top-line growth.  However, foreign exchange affects margins less than reported revenues because  the company has significant operations (costs) in some geographies that are  experiencing currency devaluation. Emerging Markets Supporting Growth: Fitch expects a significant portion of  Abbott's growth will come from emerging markets, fueled by favorable  demographics, economic growth. Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle  class in these markets. Consumer out-of-pocket purchases account for a large  portion of revenues in these markets. This contrasts to developed markets, where  the vast majority of purchases involve third-party payers. As such, rising  disposable income is an important driver of demand in these markets New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. Many of  the company's launches are tailored to specific geographies. Fitch expects the  potential addition of Alere's and St. Jude's pipelines will further support  innovative product introductions over the long term. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbott Laboratories  (excluding the St. Jude acquisition) include:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid single-digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Modest annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2016 but significantly improving throughout the forecast  period. --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch once more details regarding the transaction  are available. However, given the currently available information and assuming  Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch expects that Abbott's ratings  would likely move to 'BBB'/'F2'. The following rating sensitivities exclude the potential acquisition of St.  Jude:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid-single digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins in Nutritional Products and Diagnostics as  well other areas within the firm.  --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects Abbott to maintain adequate liquidity, as it  will term out all of its and STJ's short-Term borrowings ($3.5 - $4 billion) and  ultimately end up with full availability on its $5 billion revolving credit  facility that expires in July 2019 and availability on its CP program.  Independent of the St. Jude acquisition, Abbott also plans to issue $3 billion  of its common stock in the secondary market to provide further flexibility. Manageable Debt Maturities: At Dec. 31, 2015, Abbott had approximately $9  billion in debt outstanding (including $3.1 billion in short-term borrowings).  Fitch believes the company's debt maturities are manageable, with no significant  maturities until 2019.

261,ABT,UPDATE 1-LPC: Abbott's US$17.2bn loan backing St. Jude acq. set to boost M&A; volume,"(Adds expected bank fees, updates throughout.) By Michelle Sierra NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - A US$17.2bn bridge loan that backs Abbott Laboratories’ US$25bn acquisition of medical device maker St. Jude Medical will boost investment grade loan volume that so far this year has been depressed by volatility in equities and global economic uncertainty. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch-led transaction will hike merger and acquisition-related volume of investment grade deals after issuance dropped to US$28.5bn in the first quarter from US$46.6bn in the fourth quarter of 2015 and US$71.6bn in the third quarter of last year. Abbott’s new loan will bring bridge loan volume to US$24.5bn early in the second quarter of 2016, surpassing the US$15.3bn seen last quarter. Freeman Consulting Services estimate the fees for the US$17.2bn bridge to be between US$50m to US$75m. “If this is a catalyst to jumpstart the market, that’d be great,” a banker said. Abbott will assume or refinance St. Jude’s net debt, which is currently US$5.7bn. STILL I-GRADE Abbott is still in the process of completing the US$8.5bn acquisition of Alere Inc, provider of health information through diagnostic tests, announced in February. The significant debt component would bring leverage to 5.0 times, according to an Intraday comment issued by Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit. Leverage was about 2.0 times before either of the two pending acquisitions as of the last published balance sheet in December, Levenson said in a follow-up email. An Abbott conference call transcript Thursday morning indicated the company remains committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating by deleveraging the combined entity. “Abbott appears to have brokered the financing structure with the rating agencies to preserve investment grade ratings,” Levenson said in the note. “The consideration is balanced between cash and equity, with a strong 45% equity component.” In order to further rebalance its capital structure, Abbott also expects to issue US$3bn of common stock, according to the transcript. “Although modestly dilutive to Abbott’s adjusted earnings per share, this issuance provides important financial flexibility and liquidity to achieve our broader business objectives,” said Brian Yoor, Abbott’s senior vice president and chief investment officer, on the call. Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service said in a note Thursday it kept Abbott Laboratories’ A+ rating on CreditWatch with negative implications where it placed it in February following the Alere acquisition announcement. The St. Jude acquisition announcement raised questions among analysts listening to the call on how Abbott’s pending US$8.5bn purchase of Alere fits into the picture. Abbott financed the Alere transaction with a US$9bn bridge loan that closed in February. Moody’s Investors Service placed Abbott ‘s A2 senior unsecured on review for downgrade following the Alere combination news in February. “There is no relationship between Alere and St. Jude here in any of this,” said Miles White, Abbott’s chairman and chief operating officer, on the call. “These are completely independent events. And yet the company can finance both and remain investment grade, we are quite confident.” “Alere still seems to be ‘on’ for the moment, as management said the financing it has lined up is sufficient for both deals,” said Levenson in her intraday comment. As per the terms of the acquisition announced Thursday, St. Jude shareholders will receive US$46.75 in cash and 0.8708 Abbott shares, representing a total consideration of about US$85 per share. The offer represents a 37% premium to St. Jude’s Wednesday closing. St. Jude’s shares were trading up more than 27% from Wednesday, at US$78.44 late Thursday. The deal will add to Abbott’s adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the close of the transaction, the company said. It will add 21 cents per share in 2017 and 29 cents in 2018. Abbott’s cardiovascular device unit will have annual sales of US$8.7bn after the businesses are combined. Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment. Abbott did not provide comment beyond the press release. St. Jude and Alere were not immediately available for comment.

270,ABT,Abbott wins U.S. approval for stent that absorbs into body,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said on Tuesday they approved a stent by Abbott Laboratories that is the first designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream after it is implanted. The stent, called Absorb, is made of a plastic similar to dissolving sutures and offers patients an alternative to metal stents currently used to prop open arteries cleared of blockages. Unlike traditional stents that remain in place after implantation, Absorb is designed to disappear fully within three years of the procedure. Absorb’s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state, free from a permanent metal implant. The approach holds particular promise for patients whose coronary artery disease could require multiple implants over the course of several decades, said Mitchell Krucoff, a professor at Duke University Medical Center who has advised Abbott on Absorb. “This is a game changer,” he said in an interview. “There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.” Absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said. “No metal means the treated artery can pulse and flex naturally as demands on the heart change with everyday activities,” said Gregg Stone of Columbia University Medical Center, who led clinical trials for Absorb. “No metal may also reduce the potential of future blockages that occur with permanent metallic stents.” Data released in October concluded Absorb was comparable to Abbott’s own Xience drug-coated metal stent in safety and effectiveness but showed a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it.     Absorb also will compete with Medtronic Plc’s traditional drug-coated Resolute stent and Boston Scientific Corp’s Synergy and Promus stents. Synergy’s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re-clogging, leaving a metal stent in place.     Abbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton. Absorb will be priced at a “modest” premium to Xience, he said.    Analysts have predicted Absorb will gain a market niche but not surpass drug-dispensing metal stents such as Xience in share until longer-term data show more favorable clinical results.

275,ABT,Abbott sales beat on higher demand for medical devices,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit as strong sales in its medical device business more than made up for the hit from an economic turmoil in Venezuela. Abbott is one of the major U.S. companies to be affected by troubled operations in Venezuela. The Latin American nation’s economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year as plunging oil prices, and what critics of President Nicolas Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll. Venezuela’s official annual inflation rate was the world’s highest at 141.5 percent in the nine months. Abbott, which rakes in two-thirds of its revenue from outside the United States, said emerging market sales increased 1.1 percent but would have risen 4.8 percent excluding the impact of Venezuelan operations. The company’s results, however, beat Wall Street estimates, largely helped by its booming medical device business, where sales rose 6.4 percent to $1.37 billion in the second quarter. Abbott’s device unit develops products for heart, diabetes and eye patients and has been helped by launches including glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre and MitraClip, which repairs heart valves less invasively. Abbott is in the process of acquiring St. Jude Medical Inc for $25 billion. St. Jude on Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue roughly in line with Wall Street estimates. Miles White, chief executive of Abbott, said he had still expected to close the transaction before year-end, as the company prepares to respond to a second request of information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commision. Abbott’s acquisition of diagnostic company Alere Inc however, continues to see challenges, especially after Alere was subpoenaed by the U.S. Department of Justice over its sales practices. Alere rejected a request by Abbott to terminate the deal for a breakup fee in April. “To be honest, no matter what kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them .. one thing I’m certain of is that they are trying to do everything they can, in their way to address the challenges,” Miles said on a conference call with analysts. On an adjusted basis, Abbott earned 55 cents per share in the quarter ended June 30, above the average analyst estimate of 53 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company's net sales rose 3.2 percent to $5.33 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $5.24 billion. (prn.to/2atEUVO) Abbott’s shares were up 2.3 percent at $42.76 in mid-morning trading.

276,ABT,US STOCKS-Microsoft propels Wall Street to new record highs,"* Microsoft surges on better-than-expected results * Morgan Stanley, Abbott also rise after earnings * Indexes up: Dow 0.24 pct, S&P; 0.47 pct, Nasdaq 1.13 pct   (Updates to late afternoon) By Lewis Krauskopf July 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street gained on Wednesday, sending the S&P; 500 and Dow industrials to fresh records, as Microsoft’s strong results boosted the indexes and marked the latest sign that U.S. corporate earnings season may be less dour than feared. Microsoft shares surged 6.3 percent after the software giant posted sharp growth in its cloud computing business. The stock was by far the biggest lift to the major indexes and the tech sector. Defensive sectors such as utilities and telecom have led the market’s gains in 2016, while groups such as financials and tech have trailed. “It seems like the weaker parts of the market are starting to at least try and keep pace with the stronger parts and there really hasn’t been a big selloff in the big winners to this point,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.09 points, or 0.24 percent, to 18,604.1, putting it on pace for its ninth straight day of gains. The S&P; 500 gained 10.27 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,174.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 56.85 points, or 1.13 percent, to 5,093.22. Tech led seven of the 10 major S&P; sectors higher, with the defensive sectors - telecoms, utilities and  consumer staples - down 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent. Second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 companies, which began reporting in earnest this week, are now expected to fall by 3.8 percent, less than the 4.5 percent decline estimated earlier in the week, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The market has been rallying on the expectation of good earnings with some companies even providing decent forecasts,” said Thomas Wilson, managing director of wealth advisory at Brinker Capital. In other quarterly reports, Morgan Stanley was up 2.4 percent after its profit topped analysts’ estimates, rounding off upbeat results from the six biggest Wall Street banks. Abbott Laboratories reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit, sending its shares up 2.2 percent. One of the notable drags on the market was Disney, down 1 percent after Stifel downgraded the stock. Intel, eBay and American Express  are scheduled to report results after the bell. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.42-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 16 new lows.

280,ABT,UPDATE 4-St Jude stock shorted on heart device hacking fears; shares drop,"(Reuters) - The stock of pacemaker manufacturer St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N fell sharply on Thursday after short-selling firm Muddy Waters said it had placed a bet that the shares would fall, claiming its implanted heart devices were vulnerable to cyber attacks. St. Jude, which agreed in April to sell itself for $25 billion to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), said the allegations were false. St Jude shares closed down 4.96 percent, the biggest one-day fall in 7 months and at a 7.4 percent discount to Abbott’s takeover offer. Muddy Waters head Carson Block said the firm’s position was motivated by research from a cyber security firm, MedSec Holdings Inc, which has a financial arrangement with Muddy Waters. MedSec asserted that St. Jude’s heart devices were vulnerable to cyber attack and were a risk to patients. A MedSec report warned of two primary hacks on St. Jude pacemakers and defribillators: One that could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates and one that drains their batteries. MedSec approached Muddy Waters about three months ago and the two struck a deal under which Block agreed to hire MedSec as a consultant, pay it a licensing fee for research and a percentage of any profits from the investment, Block told Reuters.  Reuters was not able to confirm the allegations by Block and MedSec, a firm founded 18 months ago focusing on cyber vulnerabilities in the healthcare industry. The allegations were detailed in a report published on the Muddy Waters website.  The Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration, which work together to investigate and remediate life-threatening cyber vulnerabilities in medical equipment, declined comment on St. Jude. Josh Corman, co-founder of I am the Cavalry, a group that has worked to establish standard procedures for privately disclosing vulnerabilities to manufacturers, said he was surprised St. Jude had been singled out. He said he was aware of other non-public research showing other device makers have cyber vulnerabilities.  “They may have a basis for singling out this one company, but it feels arbitrary and capricious. It doesn’t ring true,” said Corman. Cyber security experts said that it was unprecedented for a cyber security researcher to go public with research about cyber bugs as part of a short-selling strategy.  Researchers typically disclose bugs by approaching affected firms, working through intermediaries who communicate on their behalf, or presenting them at peer-reviewed cyber conferences. MedSec Chief Executive Justine Bone told Reuters that her firm decided to not adhere to those practices.  “We have expenses we incur. This is a business relationship,” she told Reuters. “But our goal here is to bring this to the attention of the public.” MedSec’s report said “low-level” hackers could exploit security vulnerabilities in devices that St. Jude uses to enable doctors to remotely access data on their patients’ implanted pacemakers and defibrillators, which use electricity to stabilize. St. Jude Chief Technology Officer Philip Ebeling said there were several layers of security in place for its devices. “We conduct security assessments on an ongoing basis and work with external experts specifically on Merlin@home and on all our devices,” Ebeling said in a statement. Block also said he has taken a “long” position in Abbott, a bet that its stock will rise. A representative for Abbott had no comment. Abbott dropped 0.76 percent to close around a one-month low of $42.84. At that price, Abbott’s takeover offer for St. Jude was valued at $84.06 a share. Were St. Jude’s fortunes to deteriorate significantly, Abbott could seek to cite a material-adverse-effect clause built into most acquisition contracts to back out of its merger agreement. Abbott would not be required to pay a termination fee. In practice, such moves are rare, because the legal threshold is high for showing an adverse impact on business.  Abbott is already seeking to pull out of one deal this year. The company offered Alere up to $50 million to terminate its $5.8 billion acquisition after the medical testing device maker was hit by accounting issues. Alere, however, has so far resisted efforts by Abbott to end that deal.   Block, who announced his firm’s position on Twitter, told Reuters that his firm felt that MedSec was correct to single out St. Jude because “none of their competitors are anywhere close to this bad.” He said that one of his firm’s researchers had replicated some of MedSec’s findings. Researchers tested second-hand Merlin@home devices obtained on eBay, among the hundreds of thousands that are in use, the report said. It said St. Jude pushed out a software update to some Merlin@home devices but that it “represented a very slight change in security.” ",8252016,http://www.reuters.com/article/st-jude-medical-cyber/update-4-st-jude-stock-shorted-on-heart-device-hacking-fears-shares-drop-idUSL1N1B60ZT
281,ABT,Whiplashed investors stay skittish about St. Jude,"(Reuters) - One day after a short seller claimed that St. Jude Medical Inc’s STJ.N heart implants are vulnerable to deadly cyber attacks, investors appear most concerned about whether the accusation will derail St. Jude’s $24 billion planned deal for Abbott Labs (ABT.N) to buy it.St. Jude’s stock at one point fell around 3 percent on Friday, though it ended the day slightly up, following a drop of around 5 percent on Thursday after Muddy Waters Capital leveled the accusation against St. Jude. The stock continues to trade well below its price on Wednesday of around $82 per share.     St. Jude called the allegations “false and misleading.”     St. Jude in April agreed to sell itself to Abbott, and the deal was widely considered a slam dunk before the cyber security concerns were raised.     “It’s hard to imagine that this could scuttle the deal,” said one investor, who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn’t authorized to speak with the press. “But there are a few paths that could lead to problems.”      Abbott could decide to back out of the St. Jude deal or push for a lower valuation “if they were to conclude remediation steps must be taken with St. Jude’s technology,” Jason Mills, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a note.      One concern being voiced is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could demand a full-scale product recall, which in turn could trigger a “material adverse change” clause in St. Jude’s merger agreement.That would give Abbott the ability to walk away from the deal, according to investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters.     If the deal were called off due to an adverse event, St. Jude would probably fall below the approximately $60 per share that it was trading at before the Abbott deal was announced, investors said. A forced recall, though, is unlikely, according to Mills. The FDA issued its first guidance on managing cybersecurity in medical devices only eight months ago, and is still seen primarily as playing an advisory role in the area.       The more likely solution to any concerns about cyber security would be a software update, which is relatively inexpensive, said another investor, who asked not to be named because he wasn’t authorized to speak with the press.

283,ABT,Alere sues Abbott over $5.8 billion takeover,"(Reuters) - Diagnostic-testing company Alere Inc ALR.N said on Friday it sued Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) in an attempt to force the company to move ahead with its $5.8 billion takeover of Alere. Alere said the lawsuit seeks to compel Abbott to obtain all the antitrust approvals it needs to complete the deal. It said the complaint was filed Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court yesterday and should be made publicly available next week. Abbott has been reluctant to complete the deal, which was struck in February, and tried to call it off in April. Abbott has suggested that Alere misrepresented itself when it negotiated the merger agreement. Alere has received two U.S. Department of Justice subpoenas this year as part of two separate government investigations into its sales practices, and patient-billing records related to Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare. Alere’s lawsuit was “without merit,” an Abbott spokeswoman said. “Abbott is compliant with its obligations under the merger agreement and continues to work toward regulatory approvals, despite Alere’s nearly six-month delay in filing its 2015 10-K (annual report).” Abbott is also in the process of buying medical device company St Jude Medical Inc STJ.N for around $24 billion as it looks to expand its heart device business. But St Jude has had its own set of problems. Short-selling firm Muddy Waters said on Thursday it had placed a bet that the shares would fall, claiming its implanted heart devices were vulnerable to cyber attacks.  St Jude said the allegations were false. Alere shares were down 3 percent at $39.48. The stock had fallen about 25 percent since the Abbott deal was announced through Thursday’s close.

284,ABT,UPDATE 2-Alere sues Abbott over $5.8 bln takeover,"(Reuters) - Diagnostic-testing company Alere Inc ALR.N said on Friday it sued Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) in an attempt to force the company to move ahead with its $5.8 billion takeover of Alere. Alere said the lawsuit seeks to compel Abbott to obtain all the antitrust approvals it needs to complete the deal. It said the complaint was filed Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court yesterday and should be made publicly available next week. Abbott has been reluctant to complete the deal, which was struck in February, and tried to call it off in April. Abbott has suggested that Alere misrepresented itself when it negotiated the merger agreement. Alere has received two U.S. Department of Justice subpoenas this year as part of two separate government investigations into its sales practices, and patient-billing records related to Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare. Alere’s lawsuit was “without merit,” an Abbott spokeswoman said. “Abbott is compliant with its obligations under the merger agreement and continues to work toward regulatory approvals, despite Alere’s nearly six-month delay in filing its 2015 10-K (annual report).” Abbott is also in the process of buying medical device company St Jude Medical Inc STJ.N for around $24 billion as it looks to expand its heart device business.

287,ABT,Alere lawsuit accuses Abbott of 'buyer's remorse' in proposed merger,"(Reuters) - Alere Inc ALR.N alleges Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is trying to stymie its planned $5.8 billion takeover of the diagnostics company by purposefully delaying key submissions to anti-trust regulators, according to a lawsuit made public on Tuesday. Alere claims in its complaint that Abbott has avoided responding to a second request by the Federal Trade Commission in a bout of “buyer’s remorse” spurred by a desire to free up capital for Abbott’s other major planned deal - a $24 billion acquisition of rival St. Jude Medical STJ.N. Abbott denied the allegations, arguing that Alere’s financial problems and related delays in filing its financial statements had slowed the deal’s progress. Abbott also said it had been approached by a whistleblower who alleges that Alere is deliberately hiding information about its Indian operations. “Alere’s complaint is nonsense and without merit,” Abbott said in a statement. “Their description of events is fiction and nothing but a publicity stunt. Abbott is compliant with its obligations under the merger agreement.”  Alere’s planned deal with Abbott ran into trouble when it revealed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for some of its foreign sales practices and that it would not be able to provide certain key regulatory filings on time. Prior to the deal, Alere already had revealed that its accounting practices had been under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Abbott agreed to acquire Alere in February. In late April, Abbott struck an even bigger deal to buy St. Jude to position itself as the dominant player in the market for cardiovascular devices.  After the second deal was announced, Alere said in a filing that it had declined an offer from Abbott to pay it up to $50 million to break off their merger agreement.  Alere said last week that it had sued Abbott in Delaware Chancery Court but the complaint was only made public on Tuesday. In its lawsuit, Alere said Abbott’s chief executive officer, Miles White, said he would make life a “living hell” for everyone in Alere if it did not agree to walk away from the deal. The suit claims that Abbott “inundated” Alere with about 175 document requests and asked for more than 40 interviews in an attempt to find evidence of a breach of its agreement.  It said Abbott’s allegedly slow response to requests from anti-trust regulators was a fall-back attempt to prevent the deal from closing. In a response to Alere’s lawsuit filed Wednesday, Abbott said the timing of its response to regulators amounts to “a tactical disagreement among the parties about how to best secure antitrust clearance.”  Abbott noted the current deal agreement does not expire for at least eight months and that a court intervention into its dealings with regulators at this stage would likely be unprecedented. Abbott also said in its response to the lawsuit that it had received the tip from a whistleblower, who alleged that Alere had been obstructing its attempt to investigate possible legal violations by Alere in India by coaching witnesses to provide false information.

The company expanded its medical device and diagnostics businesses this year with a $25 billion deal for St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N and a $5.8 billion deal for Alere Inc ALR.N. Abbott Medical Optics, which the company acquired for nearly $1.4 billion in 2009, reported sales of $1.1 billion for 2015, J&J; said on Friday. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Abbott was in talks to sell the business to J&J.; “We’ve been actively and strategically shaping our portfolio, which has recently focused on developing leadership positions in cardiovascular devices and expanding diagnostics,” Abbott Chief Executive Miles White said.  The Alere deal has run into rough weather with the target company filing a lawsuit in August, accusing Abbott of dragging its feet on key antitrust submissions to sabotage the deal. To make matters worse, St. Jude is facing allegations that its pacemakers and defibrillators have cyber security flaws that hackers could exploit to harm patients. The company has sued short-selling firm Muddy Waters and cyber security firm MedSec Holdings Inc who raised the allegations.    Wells Fargo analysts said Abbott was likely selling the eye care business because it was less of a strategic fit once it acquired St Jude and the company would need to reduce debt after the two deals.  Abbott had long-term debt of about $6 billion as of June 30. For Johnson & Johnson, the deal would help expand its eye care portfolio with products in cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health units. The World Health Organization estimates that about 20 million people are blind from age-related cataracts and that there are at least 100 million eyes with compromised visual acuity caused by cataracts, J&J; said.

314,ABT,"Abbott moves ahead on St. Jude, Alere deals, but investors fret","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said on Wednesday it was pushing ahead to complete its planned purchases of medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc and diagnostics company Alere Inc despite lingering questions about product safety and government investigations. Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White on a conference call with analysts said he hoped to acquire St. Jude by the end of the year and praised the smaller company’s handling of claims by short-seller Muddy Waters that its implantable heart devices posed cyber security risks. Although White said Abbott was pursuing all necessary regulatory approvals to acquire Alere, he did not go so far as to predict the deal would be approved. “We’ll work through regulatory approvals and see what happens,” White said on the call. Shares of Abbott fell 2.7 percent to $40.04 while Alere rose 2.3 percent to $43.36 and St. Jude  dipped 0.6 percent to $79, all on the New York Stock Exchange. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rick Wise attributed Abbott’s  decline to lingering uncertainty about the St. Jude and Alere deals, and worries about declining overseas sales of Abbott’s baby formulas. “There’s a lot of concern and noise,” he said. “Any hint of anything is making people anxious.” Abbott agreed in February to buy Alere for $5.8 billion, to acquire its diagnostic tests performed at home and in doctors’ offices and hospitals. Just two months later it agreed to pay $25 billion for St. Jude, a leading maker of heart devices. The combined price of the two deals amounted to half of Abbott’s market valuation. The relationship between Abbott and Alere cooled after the target company failed to file financial statements and disclosed probes into billing and foreign sales practices. Moreover, in July, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, Alere recalled its INRatio device used to monitor levels of the widely used blood thinner warfarin because it was found to generate faulty results. In August, Alere filed a lawsuit accusing Abbott of dragging its feet on key antitrust submissions to sabotage the deal. Separately on Wednesday, Abbott reported a quarterly profit that edged past estimates as strength in its medical devices business more than offset a decline in its nutrition unit. Excluding items, Abbott earned 59 cents per share on sales of $5.30 billion in the third quarter. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $5.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global sales of nutritional products, including baby formula Similac and Ensure for adults, fell 2 percent to $1.76 billion. Sales of the products outside the United States dropped 9.4 percent, largely due to declines in China, which is requiring manufacturers to reregister their baby formulas with the government to greater ensure their safety. “The situation in China is leading to a lot of unusually high (price) discounting,” Stifel Nicolaus’ Wise said. In the longer term, however, he said Abbott could benefit as many rival makers of infant formula vanish from the Chinese market due to stricter regulations. Also on Wednesday St. Jude reported its quarterly adjusted profit was 99 cents, missing the average estimate by 2 cents. St. Jude is facing multiple problems, including an investigation by the FDA over claims its heart devices have defects that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks. The company has sued short-seller Muddy Waters and cyber research firm MedSec Holdings after they claimed flaws in the cyber security of Abbott’s devices. St. Jude CEO Michael Rousseau said on a conference call on Wednesday he expected Muddy Waters to continue to “mislead” investors and patients about the cyber safety of its devices. Muddy Waters released several videos on Wednesday morning that claimed to be demonstrations of how attacks could be launched on St. Jude’s implanted heart devices. Reuters was unable to independently confirm claims in the videos, which were posted on a new website set up by Muddy Waters, www.profitsoverpatients.com. A St. Jude spokeswoman said the company had not verified the claims in the videos. In an unrelated matter last week, St. Jude said it will recall some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices due to the risk of premature battery depletion, a condition linked to two deaths in Europe.

321,ABT,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Abbott moves ahead on St. Jude, Alere deals, but investors fret","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said on Wednesday it was pushing ahead to complete its planned purchases of medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc and diagnostics company Alere Inc despite lingering questions about product safety and government investigations. Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White on a conference call with analysts said he hoped to acquire St. Jude by the end of the year and praised the smaller company’s handling of claims by short-seller Muddy Waters that its implantable heart devices posed cyber security risks. Although White said Abbott was pursuing all necessary regulatory approvals to acquire Alere, he did not go so far as to predict the deal would be approved. “We’ll work through regulatory approvals and see what happens,” White said on the call. Shares of Abbott fell 2.7 percent to $40.04 while Alere rose 2.3 percent to $43.36 and St. Jude dipped 0.6 percent to $79, all on the New York Stock Exchange. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rick Wise attributed Abbott’s  decline to lingering uncertainty about the St. Jude and Alere deals, and worries about declining overseas sales of Abbott’s baby formulas. “There’s a lot of concern and noise,” he said. “Any hint of anything is making people anxious.”  Abbott agreed in February to buy Alere for $5.8 billion, to acquire its diagnostic tests performed at home and in doctors’ offices and hospitals.  Just two months later it agreed to pay $25 billion for St. Jude, a leading maker of heart devices. The combined price of the two deals amounted to half of Abbott’s market valuation. The relationship between Abbott and Alere cooled after the target company failed to file financial statements and disclosed probes into billing and foreign sales practices. Moreover, in July, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, Alere recalled its INRatio device used to monitor levels of the widely used blood thinner warfarin because it was found to generate faulty results.  In August, Alere filed a lawsuit accusing Abbott of dragging its feet on key antitrust submissions to sabotage the deal. Separately on Wednesday, Abbott reported a quarterly profit that edged past estimates as strength in its medical devices business more than offset a decline in its nutrition unit. Excluding items, Abbott earned 59 cents per share on sales of $5.30 billion in the third quarter. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $5.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global sales of nutritional products, including baby formula Similac and Ensure for adults, fell 2 percent to $1.76 billion. Sales of the products outside the United States dropped 9.4 percent, largely due to declines in China, which is requiring manufacturers to reregister their baby formulas with the government to greater ensure their safety. “The situation in China is leading to a lot of unusually high (price) discounting,” Stifel Nicolaus’ Wise said. In the longer term, however, he said Abbott could benefit as many rival makers of infant formula vanish from the Chinese market due to stricter regulations. Also on Wednesday St. Jude reported its quarterly adjusted profit was 99 cents, missing the average estimate by 2 cents. St. Jude is facing multiple problems, including an investigation by the FDA over claims its heart devices have defects that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks. The company has sued short-seller Muddy Waters and cyber research firm MedSec Holdings after they claimed flaws in the cyber security of Abbott’s devices. St. Jude CEO Michael Rousseau said on a conference call on Wednesday he expected Muddy Waters to continue to “mislead” investors and patients about the cyber safety of its devices. Muddy Waters released several videos on Wednesday morning that claimed to be demonstrations of how attacks could be launched on St. Jude’s implanted heart devices.   Reuters was unable to independently confirm claims in the videos, which were posted on a new website set up by Muddy Waters, www.profitsoverpatients.com. A St. Jude spokeswoman said the company had not verified the claims in the videos. In an unrelated matter last week, St. Jude said it will recall some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices due to the risk of premature battery depletion, a condition linked to two deaths in Europe. St. Jude and Abbott on Tuesday announced a $1.12 billion deal to sell some of their devices to Japan-based Terumo Corp, an important step toward completing their tie-up.

It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company’s proposed remedies or an EU member state’s request to handle the case. Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days. Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

330,ABT,"Exclusive: EU regulators seen clearing $25 billion Abbott, St Jude deal: source","(Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are expected to give conditional clearance to U.S. medical device maker Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) $25 billion bid for rival St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. A spokesman for the European Commission, which is due to decide on the deal by Nov. 23, declined to comment. Abbott, which also makes prescription drugs and diagnostics, had no immediate comment. St. Jude officials could not be reached for comment. Abbott Chief Executive Miles White in October said he hoped to acquire St. Jude by the end of the year, despite lingering questions about the safety of its implantable heart devices. The suburban Chicago company announced the St. Jude deal in April to expand its heart device business and help it compete against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N). The companies offered concessions to address the European Commission’s concerns on Oct. 31 but did not disclose details.  However, two weeks before that, they announced the sale of some of their medical devices worth about $1.12 billion to Japanese company Terumo Corp (4543.T), saying the move was part of their deal. The all-cash transaction included St. Jude Medical’s Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure products and Abbott’s Vado Steerable Sheath. St. Jude is facing multiple problems, including an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over claims its heart devices have defects that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks. The company sued short-seller Muddy Waters and its investment partner, cyber research firm MedSec Holdings, after they claimed flaws in the cyber security of its devices. MedSec warned the alleged flaws could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates or have their batteries drained. After Abbott reported stronger than expected earnings on Oct. 19, White praised the way St. Jude has handled Muddy Waters’ allegations. In an unrelated matter last month, St. Jude said it will recall some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices due to the risk of premature battery depletion, a condition linked to two deaths in Europe. Shares of Abbott and St. Jude both closed 1.6 percent higher on Tuesday amid moderate gains for the broad stock market. Mergers in the sector have underscored the pressure felt by medical equipment makers to scale up and offer a wider range of products to hospital customers.

332,ABT,Fitch Rates Abbott's Notes Offering 'A(EXP)'; Rating Watch Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A(EXP)' rating with  a Negative Rating Watch to Abbott Laboratories' (ABT, Abbott) notes offering.  The net proceeds are expected to be used to fund the company's acquisition of  St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ, St. Jude). Abbott is also in the process of  potentially acquiring Alere Inc. (Alere). Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch as more details regarding the transaction  become available. Fitch expects to downgrade Abbott to 'BBB'/'F2'. A full list of ratings follows the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --St. Jude is a good strategic fit, but the acquisition will significantly  stress leverage for at least two years with or without the acquisition of Alere. --Abbott's diversified product portfolio is positioned to deliver  mid-single-digit organic growth with the acquisition(s) and on a standalone  basis. --Fitch anticipates that Abbott's efforts to improve operating margins will  continue to yield results through organic improvements in sales mix and cost  control plus integration-related synergies. --Fitch forecasts Abbott generating positive free cash flow (FCF) excluding the  near-term negative effect of one-time acquisition/integration related costs.  --Fitch expects the company's Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals segments to benefit from the growth in emerging markets.  --Abbott's ongoing focus on new product introductions across virtually all of  its business segments bodes well for growth and margins. --The company faces challenges regarding reimbursement for some of its products,  as well as near-term adverse foreign exchange movements and select international  economic stress. --Fitch expects that Abbott will maintain adequate liquidity through cash  generation, bank credit and access to the capital markets. Sound Acquisitions/High Leverage: Abbott's planned acquisitions of St. Jude and  Alere are good strategic fits. Both expand Abbott's market presence in segments  that the company currently operates, by providing the company with broader  product offerings. The acquired portfolios, in aggregate, will also offer  organic growth potential. Abbott should be able to realize the combined  forecasted pre-tax synergies (from St. Jude and Alere) of roughly $800 million  within four years of the acquisitions. The equity value of the St. Jude  transaction is approximately $25 billion ($46.75 in cash and 0.8708 shares of  Abbott common stock per share of St. Jude) plus roughly $5.7 billion assumed net  debt. Abbott intends to acquire Alere for $5.8 billion cash (equity value) and  around $2.6 billion of assumed net debt.  The two acquisitions will significantly increase debt, with leverage forecasted  to remain above 3.0x through 2019. Without the Alere acquisition, forecasted  leverage would likely remain at or above 3.0x through 2018. Fitch expects Abbott  will reduce leverage to durably below 3.0x thereafter, through a combination of  debt reduction and increased EBITDA. Operating margins will likely improve  because of favorable shifts in sales mix, good cost control and synergies. FCF  should stay significantly positive (excluding one-time restructuring costs). The  potential BBB'/'F2' post-transaction rating assumes Abbott will pursue a more  conservative approach to capital deployment, with share repurchases, dividend  increases and acquisitions remaining modest. The transaction is likely to close near year-end 2016 pending regulatory  approvals. The addition of St. Jude's products will significantly expand  Abbott's medical device portfolio, particularly in the area of cardiovascular  disease. The deal will position Abbott as the number-one or number-two player in  many of the sub-segments of the cardiovascular device market. The combination  provides minimal overlap in product categories and offers Abbott a larger  presence in the faster growing device areas of atrial fibrillation, structural  heart and neuromodulation. Abbott estimates that it will realize roughly $500 million in annual synergies  by 2020 from the St. Jude acquisition. Broader portfolios within the  sub-segments of cardiovascular should provide Abbott with increased  contracting/shelf space opportunities when contracting with hospital management  and purchasing groups. Cost-related synergies in the areas of sourcing plus some  overlap in sales force and administrative functions should be attainable. In  addition, Abbott has a demonstrable record of accomplishment of acquiring and  successfully integrating acquisitions. Alere Expands Point-of-Care Diagnostics: Fitch believes the acquisition of Alere  makes sense strategically, as the combination will increase Abbott's presence in  point-of-care diagnostics and prospects to expand Alere's products into  international markets. Abbott already has a strong position in the medical  diagnostics market. The point-of-care segment of the diagnostics market will  likely grow faster than the in vitro diagnostic market during the intermediate  term. The company also expects to achieve nearly $300 million in pre-tax  synergies by 2019 and more thereafter. Durable Margin Improvement: Abbott will likely focus on improving margins  through cost control and generating a favorable shift in sales mix. In addition  to securing the forecasted acquisition-related synergies, Fitch looks for Abbott  to continue driving efficiencies across its business segments. Innovative,  value-added product launches should be able to secure attractive pricing. Fitch  expects margin improvements will be durable during the intermediate term. Stable Operations Prior/Post Acquisition: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's  diversified product portfolio (with or without the two acquisitions) will  continue to produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate term,  given the strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix. However,  adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper reported growth in the  near term, although margins should remain moderately insulated from the trend.  Revenue growth and margin support should provide for solid FCF generation. Positive FCF/Conservative Capital Deployment: Fitch estimates that Abbott will  generate normalized FCF in 2018 and 2019 of roughly $1.5 billion to $1.6  billion, with one-time transaction-related costs hampering FCF before then.  Forecasted revenue growth and moderately improving margins will drive cash  generation. Capital expenditures and dividends incrementally increase during the  forecast period, as the company focuses on strengthening its balance sheet and  credit profile. FCF should be sufficient to fund debt reduction, modest share  repurchases and small acquisitions. Select Market Headwinds: Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic  markets, including restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies and  infant nutritionals in the U.S. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements and  economic stress in Venezuela will likely hamper reported top-line growth.  However, foreign exchange affects margins less than reported revenues because  the company has significant operations (costs) in some geographies that are  experiencing currency devaluation. Emerging Markets Supporting Growth: Fitch expects a significant portion of  Abbott's growth will come from emerging markets, fueled by favorable  demographics, economic growth. Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle  class in these markets. Consumer out-of-pocket purchases account for a large  portion of revenues in these markets. This contrasts to developed markets, where  the vast majority of purchases involve third-party payers. As such, rising  disposable income is an important driver of demand in these markets. New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. Many of  the company's launches are tailored to specific geographies. Fitch expects the  potential addition of Alere's and St. Jude's pipelines will further support  innovative product introductions over the long term. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbott Laboratories  (excluding the St. Jude acquisition) include:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid single-digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Modest annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2016 but significantly improving throughout the forecast  period. --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch once more details regarding the transaction  are available. However, given the currently available information and assuming  Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch expects that Abbott's ratings  would likely move to 'BBB'/'F2'. The following rating sensitivities exclude the potential acquisition of St.  Jude:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid-single digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins in Nutritional Products and Diagnostics as  well other areas within the firm.  --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases.

335,ABT,Abbott seeks to abort planned acquisition of Alere,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said on Wednesday that it had moved to terminate its proposed acquisition of Alere Inc ALR.N, citing a “substantial loss” in the value of the diagnostics company since they struck a deal 10 months back. Abbott filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery to kill the deal it struck with Alere in late January, worth $5.8 billion at the time. “This is likely posturing by Abbott to set up a scenario where a price cut could be arranged,” Canaccord Genuity’s Mark Massaro told Reuters. He said Abbott’s best bet would be to create uncertainty to drive Alere’s stock lower so the company’s shareholders would agree to a lower price. Alere is slated to hold its annual meeting on Thursday. Since the two companies announced the deal, Alere has faced multiple setbacks, while Abbott in April struck a deal to buy heart device maker St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N for $25 billion. When the Alere deal was announced, and shortly thereafter, Abbott has expressed a lot of buyers remorse, Jefferies’ analyst Raj Denhoy said. The relationship between the two companies began to cool after Alere failed to file financial statements and disclosed probes into billing and foreign sales practices. In July, at the behest of the U.S. health regulator, Alere recalled a device used to monitor levels of a widely used blood thinner because it was found to generate faulty results. The following month, Alere filed a lawsuit accusing Abbott of dragging its feet on key antitrust submissions to sabotage the deal. In November, Alere lost reimbursement on its Medicare business. These developments are unprecedented and are not isolated incidents brought on by chance, Abbott said on Wednesday. “This damage ... can only be the result of a systemic failure of internal controls, which combined with the lack of transparency, led us to filing this complaint,” said Scott Stoffel, divisional vice president of external communications at Abbott. Alere said on Wednesday that none of the arguments made by Abbott gave it grounds to abandon the merger. “Alere will take all actions necessary ... to compel Abbott to complete the transaction in accordance with its terms,” the company said. Alere’s shares tumbled 8 percent to $36.67, compared with Abbott’s offer of $56 per share. Abbott’s shares were off 0.15 percent at $38.48. “It is still a good asset for Abbott. One would think that cooler heads should prevail, but we’re not in the boardroom,” Jefferies’ Denhoy said.

336,ABT,Exclusive: U.S. regulator poised to approve Abbott purchase of St Jude - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust enforcers are poised to approve health care company Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) purchase of medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N, two sources knowledgeable about the deal said on Thursday.  Approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission could come as soon as this week or next, said the sources, who spoke anonymously to protect business relationships.  European antitrust enforcers approved the deal in November on the condition that the companies divest two devices used in cardiovascular treatments. It was not immediately known what conditions the FTC would require but Abbott said in October the companies would sell some of their medical devices to Japan-based Terumo Corp (4543.T) for about $1.12 billion as a step toward completing the deal. Abbott has said the $25 billion deal will help it compete better with larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) as hospitals look to cut the number of suppliers. St. Jude has been under pressure after short-seller Muddy Waters and research firm MedSec Holdings alleged in August that its heart devices were riddled with defects that make them vulnerable to cyber hacks. St. Jude has denied the allegations and sued both firms. In October, St. Jude said it had notified doctors to stop implants of one of its cardiac pacemakers, the Nanostim leadless cardiac pacemaker, citing reports of problems with electronic data reporting caused by a battery malfunction that could put patients at risk. There have been no reports of patient injuries associated with the malfunction, St. Jude said. Abbott has been divesting businesses to focus on its cardiovascular devices and diagnostics business, selling its medical optics division to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) for $4.3 billion earlier this year. It spun off its pharma business as AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) in 2013. Abbott is trying to pull out of a second deal, a $5.8 billion dollar acquisition of diagnostic test maker Alere Inc ALR.N after Alere failed to file financial statements and disclosed probes into billing and foreign sales practices. The two companies are suing each other. ",12222016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-stjude-m-a-abbott/exclusive-u-s-regulator-poised-to-approve-abbott-purchase-of-st-jude-sources-idUSKBN14B1XW
337,ABT,Abbott gets U.S. antitrust approval to buy St. Jude Medical,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Healthcare company Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) has won U.S. antitrust approval for its proposed $25 billion acquisition of medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday. Abbott agreed to divest two medical devices used in cardiovascular procedures to resolve FTC concerns the acquisition would stifle competition, the commission said in a statement. “We continue to work to obtain final regulatory approvals and anticipate closing before the end of the year or shortly thereafter,” Abbott spokeswoman Elissa Maurer said in an email. The company will sell St. Jude’s vascular closure device and Abbott’s steerable sheath to Japan-based Terumo Corp (4543.T). In October, Abbott said the companies would sell some of their medical device businesses to Terumo for about $1.12 billion as a step toward completing the deal. Vascular closure devices are used to seal small holes made in an artery to prevent bleeding following a coronary angiogram, a special x-ray to see if coronary arteries are blocked or narrowed. Steerable sheaths are used to help place catheters into the heart. European antitrust enforcers agreed to the deal in November provided the companies divest the two devices. Representatives for Abbott and St. Jude were not immediately available for comment. Abbott has said the deal will help it compete against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) as hospitals look to cut the number of their suppliers.

338,ABT,St. Jude releases cyber updates for heart devices after U.S. probe,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories moved to protect patients with its St. Jude heart implants against possible cyber attacks, releasing a software patch on Monday that the firm said will reduce the “extremely low” chance of them being hacked. The company disclosed the moves some five months after the U.S. government launched a probe into claims the devices were vulnerable to potentially life-threatening hacks that could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates or cause them to fail by draining their batteries.. The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Homeland Security said that St. Jude’s software update addresses some, but not all, known cyber security problems in its heart devices. The patch that Abbott began pushing out to patients on Monday addresses vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk to patients and prevent hackers from accessing the device, said FDA spokeswoman Angela Stark. “The patch is intended to reduce the risk of unauthorized individuals exploiting the vulnerability and support patient safety,” she said. “The FDA has maintained this focus on addressing patient safety first and foremost throughout its investigation.” A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said he had no immediate comment on the remaining problems. St. Jude spokeswoman Candace Steele Flippin declined to identify specific problems, but said: “The cybersecurity landscape is evolving. St. Jude Medical has worked with, and continues to work with, the FDA and DHS to update and improve the security of our technology.” MedSec Chief Executive Justine Bone said in a statement that “a multitude of severe vulnerabilities” were not fixed in the security update. They include the ability to issue an unauthorized command to a cardiac implant from a device other than St. Jude’s Merlin@Home device, Bone said. Monday marked the first time that the FDA and DHS had confirmed that St. Jude devices were vulnerable to hacking. They said they knew of no cyber attacks on patients with the company’s cardiac implants. The FDA said that the benefits of continuing treatment outweighed cyber risks. DHS said only an attacker “with high skill” could exploit the vulnerability. They launched the probe in August after short-selling firm Muddy Waters and cyber security firm MedSec Holdings said the devices were riddled with security flaws that made them vulnerable to potentially life-threatening hacks. When Muddy Waters went public with the claims, it also disclosed it was shorting St. Jude Medical, which was preparing to sell itself to Abbott. The short-selling firm said it believed that disclosure of the vulnerabilities could cause the $25 billion deal to fall apart, but Abbott last week completed its acquisition of St. Jude, one of the world’s biggest makers of implantable cardiac devices. Muddy Waters founder Carson Block said he felt the release of the software patch “effectively vindicates” the research produced by his firm and MedSec. As St. Jude announced the security patch, it declined comment on a lawsuit it filed against Muddy Waters and MedSec in September. It accused them of perpetrating a “willful and malicious scheme to manipulate the securities markets for their own financial windfall.” MedSec said St. Jude has not dropped the lawsuit. Abbott shares closed down 0.1 percent at $40.74. The S&P; 500, by comparison, dipped 0.3 percent.

347,ABT,"Abbott pauses on deals, to focus on St. Jude integration","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said it planned to focus on slashing its debt and integrating its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical in 2017, in a break from the hectic pace of dealmaking last year The company in 2016 also agreed to buy Alere Inc ALR.N for $5.8 billion and to sell its medical optics division to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) for $4.3 billion as it sheds its slow-growth, low-margin businesses and fortifies its presence in cardiovascular devices and diagnostics. Abbott will also hold back on share repurchases, Chief Executive Miles White said on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday.  The company, which is looking to abort the Alere deal, took on $15 billion in debt to finance the St. Jude deal and also assumed the heart device maker’s debt. Abbott reported fourth-quarter sales just shy of estimates, largely due to a strong dollar and waning demand for its nutrition products in China. Global sales of nutrition products, which account for roughly a quarter of Abbott’s net sales, fell 3.7 percent to $1.73 billion in the quarter, including a 1.1 percent hit from a strong dollar.  The decline was mainly due to changes in food safety regulations in China that require manufacturers to reregister their baby formulas with the government.  This has caused an oversupply in the Chinese market, White said, adding that nutrition growth in the country will be relatively flat in the first quarter but improve over the course of 2017.   Abbott also forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of 42 cents to 44 cents per share, below the average analysts’ estimate of 50 cents.  The forecast reflects continued weak nutrition and getting St. Jude up and running, but these are transitory issues, Edward Jones’ analyst John Boylan said. St. Jude’s traditional cardiac rhythm management (CRM) business, which sells pacemakers and defibrillators, continued to struggle in the quarter, as it loses out to rivals with MRI-compatible devices in the United States, Abbott said. Similar approvals for St. Jude are expected shortly, the company said.   Abbott also forecast 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.40-$2.50 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $2.46.  The company’s net sales of $5.33 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, came in just below the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate of $5.38 billion.   Abbott’s shares were marginally down at $40.50 in afternoon trading, recovering from a drop to $39.25 earlier on Wednesday. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 healthcare index .SPXHC.

The company, which is looking to abort the Alere deal, took on $15 billion in debt to finance the St. Jude deal and also assumed the heart device maker’s debt. Abbott reported fourth-quarter sales just shy of estimates, largely due to a strong dollar and waning demand for its nutrition products in China. Global sales of nutrition products, which account for roughly a quarter of Abbott’s net sales, fell 3.7 percent to $1.73 billion in the quarter, including a 1.1 percent hit from a strong dollar.  The decline was mainly due to changes in food safety regulations in China that require manufacturers to reregister their baby formulas with the government.  This has caused an oversupply in the Chinese market, White said, adding that nutrition growth in the country will be relatively flat in the first quarter but improve over the course of 2017.   Abbott also forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of 42 cents to 44 cents per share, below the average analysts’ estimate of 50 cents.  The forecast reflects continued weak nutrition and getting St. Jude up and running, but these are transitory issues, Edward Jones’ analyst John Boylan said. St. Jude’s traditional cardiac rhythm management (CRM) business, which sells pacemakers and defibrillators, continued to struggle in the quarter, as it loses out to rivals with MRI-compatible devices in the United States, Abbott said. Similar approvals for St. Jude are expected shortly, the company said.   Abbott also forecast 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.40-$2.50 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $2.46.  The company’s net sales of $5.33 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, came in just below the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate of $5.38 billion.   Abbott’s shares were marginally down at $40.50 in afternoon trading, recovering from a drop to $39.25 earlier on Wednesday. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 healthcare index .SPXHC.

358,ABT,Abbott Laboratories may see boost from St. Jude's acquisition: Barron's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is likely to see its shares rise again after trading range-bound for nearly a year on the back of its $25 billion acquisition of medical device-maker St. Jude Medical, Barron’s said on Sunday.  The global healthcare company, based in Abbott Park, Illinois, has seen its stock trade between $37 and $45 for a year, as investors remain concerned over currency headwinds given the company’s global business and its St. Jude acquisition.  However, the uncertainty has also created an opportunity to buy inexpensive shares of a company with a “proven track record and a good shot at continuing its double-digit earnings growth,” the report said, adding that a 20 percent return is credible over a year. The St. Jude deal, which closed last month, has weighed on the stock, with some investors questioning whether Abbott overpaid for a company that’s seen a history of delayed product launches. However, the acquisition pushes Abott’s profile more towards the U.S. market, which should ease concerns about the strength of the dollar. Also, a number of St. Jude legacy products are expected to win federal approval later this year following the green light on its Assurity MRI pacemaker earlier this month.

363,ABT,Diagnostic company Alere to delay filing annual report,"(Reuters) - Alere Inc ALR.N said it would delay filing its 2016 annual report, in the latest blow to the diagnostic company engaged in a legal battle with Abbott Laboratories over their deal. Alere said on Wednesday it has not yet fixed a material weaknesses with respect to its revenue recognition practices disclosed in its 2015 annual report, which was also delayed. The company’s shares were down 2.9 percent at $37.19.      While the absolute dollar amounts are not concerning, the residual material weakness in controls creates additional uncertainty, BTIG analyst Dane Leone said. “It is still concerning that this issue was not caught during the review and restatements last year,” Leone added. Alere said in a regulatory filing it was reviewing revenue recognition practices at its South Korean and Japanese units as well as related “inappropriate conduct” at its South Korea unit.   The company said it expects its 2016 annual report to show that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of Dec. 31. Any correction of misstatements is not expected to impact the total revenue, but would rather result in a timing shift of revenue between accounting periods, Alere said.  “This is not the headline Alere shareholders want to see given the current Abbott battle, but we would point out the fact that there is no ‘bad revenue’, this revision just relates to timing,” Raymond James analyst Nicholas Jansen said.     Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) in December moved to end its plan to buy Alere, a deal it struck in January 2016 for about $5.8 billion.  Alere is also being probed over its billing and foreign sales practices and in July recalled a device used to monitor levels of a widely used blood thinner.

367,ABT,Higher heart risk seen with Abbott dissolving stent after two years: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Patients who received Abbott Laboratories’ novel dissolving vascular stent had a significantly higher rate of serious adverse heart events than those treated with the company’s widely used Xience drug-coated metal stent two years after implantation, according to data presented on Saturday. New guidelines for blood vessel size and proper implantation techniques put in place for the new Absorb stent since the study began, however, should lead to better results, researchers said. They reported that 19 percent of those who received Absorb in the 2,008-patient trial had it implanted in blood vessels now deemed too small for the device, hurting overall results. “The difference between Absorb and Xience when they’re both implanted in properly-sized vessels with good procedural technique is likely to be quite modest and possibly not clinically important,” said Dr. Stephen Ellis, director of interventional cardiology at Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington. Stents are tiny tubes used to prop open diseased arteries cleared of blockages. The two stents demonstrated similar safety between one and two years, but a difference turned up by the end of year two.  Absorb, which is larger than traditional metal stents, is made of a plastic designed to fully dissolve over the course of about three years, leaving a naturally flexible blood vessel. After two years, 10.9 percent of Absorb patients had experienced target lesion failure, versus 7.9 percent for  Xience, a statistically significant difference. TLF combines heart-related death, heart attack related to the treated vessel and need for repeat procedure due to reclogging of the treated part of the artery. The TLF finding was driven by a higher rate of heart attacks - 7.3 percent for Absorb versus 4.9 percent for Xience. The difference between the two stents declined and was no longer statistically significant when the smaller-vessel patients were excluded, researchers reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it was informing healthcare providers of the increased rate of major adverse cardiac events observed in patients receiving Absorb in the study. The agency said it will continue to monitor Absorb’s performance in clinical studies and reports submitted to it.  Absorb won U.S. approval last July, but longer-term data is needed to assess its true value. All of the benefit of using the larger, more-difficult-to- place stent, “if there is going to be a benefit, will come after it has been fully absorbed,” said Ellis. “We await long-term outcomes,” he added. “If this device doesn’t produce better long-term outcomes, there’s no point in using it.” ",3182017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-abbott-stent/higher-heart-risk-seen-with-abbott-dissolving-stent-after-two-years-study-idUSKBN16P0IV

370,ABT,U.S. FDA warns Abbott Labs over heart device problems,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to Abbott Laboratories, citing manufacturing flaws with a range of cardiovascular devices acquired with its purchase of St. Jude Medical in January for $25 billion. The letter, dated April 12 and made public on Thursday, sent Abbott’s shares down 2 percent to $42.61. The FDA, which said the company failed to disclose at least one death associated with one of the devices, said an inspection of the company’s facility in Sylmar, California, raised questions about the safety of several implantable defibrillators and its Merlin@home monitor, which allows doctors to care remotely for patients with cardiac devices. The FDA investigation showed that lithium batteries in the devices were draining prematurely and that the company had “underestimated the occurrence of the hazardous situation.” Abbott said in a statement it has a “strong history and commitment to product safety and quality.” It said the FDA’s inspection took place in February and that Abbott responded on March 13 describing corrective actions it was taking. “We take these matters seriously, continue to make progress on our corrective actions, will closely review FDA’s warning letter, and are committed to fully addressing FDA’s concerns,” the company said. The FDA said Abbott had provided implementation dates for several corrective actions but failed to provide evidence that the actions had actually been implemented. Analysts said the FDA may now delay approval of new devices that can be used inside an MRI machine that the company had expected to see approved by the end of the year. That could help rivals Medtronic Plc, which has such devices on the market and Boston Scientific Corp which expects to launch similar devices in the fourth quarter. “These two companies stand to benefit in the event Abbott’s approvals are delayed,” Glenn Novarro, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note. The affected devices, known as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) help pace slow heart rhythms and slow dangerously fast rhythms. In October St. Jude said it would recall certain models due to reports of battery failure caused by deposits of lithium forming within the battery and causing a short circuit.

371,ABT,UPDATE 1-U.S. FDA warns Abbott Labs over heart device problems,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to Abbott Laboratories, citing manufacturing flaws with a range of cardiovascular devices acquired with its purchase of St. Jude Medical in January for $25 billion. The letter, dated April 12 and made public on Thursday, sent Abbott’s shares down 2 percent to $42.61. The FDA, which said the company failed to disclose at least one death associated with one of the devices, said an inspection of the company’s facility in Sylmar, California, raised questions about the safety of several implantable defibrillators and its Merlin@home monitor, which allows doctors to care remotely for patients with cardiac devices. The FDA investigation showed that lithium batteries in the devices were draining prematurely and that the company had “underestimated the occurrence of the hazardous situation.” Abbott said in a statement it has a “strong history and commitment to product safety and quality.” It said the FDA’s inspection took place in February and that Abbott responded on March 13 describing corrective actions it was taking. “We take these matters seriously, continue to make progress on our corrective actions, will closely review FDA’s warning letter, and are committed to fully addressing FDA’s concerns,” the company said. The FDA said Abbott had provided implementation dates for several corrective actions but failed to provide evidence that the actions had actually been implemented. Analysts said the FDA may now delay approval of new devices that can be used inside an MRI machine that the company had expected to see approved by the end of the year. That could help rivals Medtronic Plc, which has such devices on the market and Boston Scientific Corp which expects to launch similar devices in the fourth quarter. “These two companies stand to benefit in the event Abbott’s approvals are delayed,” Glenn Novarro, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note. The affected devices, known as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) help pace slow heart rhythms and slow dangerously fast rhythms. In October St. Jude said it would recall certain models due to reports of battery failure caused by deposits of lithium forming within the battery and causing a short circuit. In its letter, the FDA said the company repeatedly concluded that the cause of premature depletion “could not be determined” even though the company’s supplier had provided evidence that it was due to lithium deposits, known as lithium cluster bridging.

373,ABT,Abbott agrees to buy Alere at lower price from earlier offer,"(Reuters) - Diversified healthcare company Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) on Friday agreed to buy Alere Inc ALR.N at a lower price than it had previously offered, after raising concerns about the accuracy of various representations, warranties and covenants made by Alere in the earlier agreement. Abbott’s revised offer values Alere’s equity around $5.3 billion, down from the about $5.8 billion announced in February last year, the companies said in a statement, ending a prolonged legal battle over Abbott’s plan to acquire the diagnostic-testing company. Abbott will now pay $51 per share for Alere, compared with its earlier offer of $56. The new price was a much better outcome than what Alere’s shareholders had priced in, given that Alere’s shares closed at $42.31 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. While the new deal values Alere at 26.84 times forward earnings, Alere’s peers are on average valued at 37.9 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The new $51 per share deal price is in the middle of the initial $49 to $53 per share range that Abbott had indicated it would be willing to pay for Alere when it first discussed an acquisition in December 2015, according to Alere’s proxy statement to its shareholders.  Abbott at the time had not carried out due diligence on Alere, and subsequent negotiations led to a deal being agreed early last year. However, the deal ran into trouble within months of being announced, as Alere received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice in March last year seeking documents relating to the company’s sales practices, and delayed filing its annual report. Both the companies ended up suing each other last year, with Alere forcing Abbott to move ahead with the deal, and Abbott wanting to back out of the deal citing a “substantial loss” in the value of the diagnostics company. “The renegotiated price is in the realm of investor expectations and seems to reflect the impact from some of the challenges witnessed in Alere’s business over the last 12 months,” Raymond James analyst Nicholas Jansen told Reuters.  Alere has also delayed filing its 2016 annual report and has not yet fixed material weaknesses with respect to its revenue recognition practices disclosed in its 2015 annual report. “We think the new merger agreement now includes all of the known issues that have developed so would not expect any risk to the future of the deal unless something else emerges as of today’s date,” Jansen said.

379,ABT,Abbott sees Alere as challenging 'fixer-upper' after revised deal,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said it was looking to close the recently revised deal to buy Alere Inc in the coming months, calling the diagnostics company “a bit of a fixer-upper”. Abbott, which reported first-quarter sales and profit ahead of analysts’ estimates on Wednesday, first revealed an agreement to buy Alere in February 2016. But the deal ran into trouble as issues related to Alere’s accounting and sales practices came to light. However, last week, Abbott agreed to the takeover at a price of around $5.30 billion down from $5.80 billion, ending the prolonged legal tussle. Alere has had some challenges and closing the deal is going to be a bit unpredictable, because Alere still needs to file its annual report and Abbott is required to divest some businesses for regulatory approvals, Abbott CFO Brian Yoor said on a post-earnings conference call. The Alere deal is now expected to close in the third quarter, and will help Abbott expand in point-of-care diagnostic testing, a market that is rapidly growing as physicians increasingly adopt tests that speed up treatment. Abbott has been considerably active on the M&A; front. Last year, it agreed sell its medical optics division to Johnson & Johnson for $4.3 billion, and closed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical this January. The company’s first-quarter net sales rose 3.2 percent on an operational basis to $6.34 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $6.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While sales in its diagnostics, medical devices and branded generic pharmaceuticals divisions grew in the quarter ended March 31, Abbott’s nutrition business continued to suffer. Global nutrition sales dipped 1 percent on an operational basis, hurt mainly by continued challenges in the Chinese infant formula market. New food safety regulations in China require manufacturers to re-register baby formulas with the government. “As the government transitions through these new regulations, I think that’s going to be a little bumpy and it has been... but I think we feel pretty good about China for the long term,” Abbott CEO Miles White said. Excluding items, Abbott earned 48 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 5 cents.

399,ABT,Abbott profit forecast gets a lift from St. Jude integration,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) raised its full-year profit forecast as the company benefits from its St. Jude Medical acquisition, and said it was confident that the Alere purchase would close this year, sending its shares to a near two-year high. Abbott first offered to buy Alere in February 2016, but the deal ran into trouble when issues related to the diagnostic maker’s accounting and sales practices came to light. The company finally agreed to buy Alere in April for about $5.30 billion, down from its initial $5.80 billion offer. Abbott Chief Executive Miles White, who in April called Alere “a bit of a fixer-upper”, said on an earnings call on Thursday that he was “quite confident” that the deal would be completed this year.  White also said he expected to announce another asset sale in connection with the deal.      Meanwhile, Abbott, which reported second-quarter profit just ahead of analysts’ estimates, is reaping the benefits of its integration of the $25 billion St. Jude acquisition. Sales of St. Jude’s devices, on a standalone basis, increased about 4 percent in the second quarter, White said. Sales in Abbott’s overall medical devices business surged about 89 percent to $2.60 billion on a reported basis, but cardiac rhythm management (CRM) product sales were weighed down by competition from MRI-compatible devices in the United States. “It appears that Abbott continued to lose share to both Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) given its lack of MRI ICDs and battery issues,” Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a client note. Abbott is seeking MRI-conditional labeling from the U.S. health regulator for a clutch of CRM devices. Global nutrition sales dipped 0.6 percent on a reported basis.  New products lifted pediatric nutrition sales in the United States, but international sales declined due to continuing challenging market conditions in China. Adult nutrition product sales fell due to rising competition.   Abbott on Thursday raised its full-year adjusted earnings from continuing operations by 3 cents to a range of $2.43 per share to $2.53 per share. The company’s shares were up 2.37 percent at $50.57 in afternoon trading.  The shares, which had gained 29 percent this year through Wednesday’s close, touched a high of $50.83 earlier.

407,ABT,UPDATE 2-Seven charged in U.S. insider trading ring,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Wednesday announced insider trading charges accusing seven people of generating more than $5 million of profit based on tips from a Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) employee about dozens of pending corporate transactions. Daniel Rivas, who was the alleged tipper and later worked at Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), and James Moodhe, the father of Rivas’ girlfriend, both pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, conspiracy, and making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. The other five defendants were arrested separately on Wednesday, and charged in a 54-count indictment. All seven defendants face related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges. Prosecutors said Rivas, who worked in Bank of America’s capital markets technology group, leaked material nonpublic information about potential mergers, acquisitions and tender offers involving clients and prospective clients more than 50 times to co-conspirators, who then traded on the tips. The trading occurred in three overlapping schemes between August 2014 and April 2017, involving transactions such as the takeovers of St. Jude Medical Inc by Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Monsanto Co (MON.N) by Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), authorities said. Thirty transactions were involved, the SEC said. Rivas, 32, of Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was fired by Bank of America in April, and has now been suspended by RBC, according to spokespeople for the respective banks. RBC has “a zero-tolerance approach to infractions of the law or of our code of conduct,” spokeswoman Sanam Heidary said in an email. Rivas’ lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prosecutors said the romantic relationship between Rivas and his girlfriend was a catalyst for the trading, and that as the relationship progressed, “so did the frequency with which Rivas and Moodhe spent time together, including at Moodhe’s house.” Authorities said Moodhe, 60, of New City, New York, generated more than $2 million of profit from Rivas’ tips. He in turn passed on tips to his friend Michael Siva, 55, of West Orange, New Jersey, who worked at a brokerage firm and made several hundred thousand dollars, authorities said. Other defendants include Rivas’ friends Roberto Rodriguez, 32, of Miami Gardens, Florida; Rodolfo Sablon, 37, of Miami, and Jhonatan Zoquier, 33, of Englewood, New Jersey. The remaining defendant is Jeffrey Rogiers, 33, of Oakland, California, a friend of Zoquier. A lawyer for Sablon said he is reviewing the indictment. A lawyer for Zoquier declined to comment. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

408,ABT,Abbott releases new round of cyber updates for St. Jude pacemakers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said on Tuesday it would issue updates to reduce the risk of its St. Jude heart implants being hacked and to warn patients that the devices’ batteries may run down earlier than expected. It was the second round of updates for the heart implants that Abbott has announced since buying medical device maker St. Jude Medical earlier this year. The U.S. government launched a probe last year of claims the devices were vulnerable to potentially life-threatening hacks that could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates or cause them to fail by draining their batteries. The company also identified a separate problem with lithium batteries in its heart devices last year. St. Jude recalled some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices last October due to risk of premature battery depletion, which was linked to two deaths in Europe.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said then that hospitals should return unused devices and warned patients with an already implanted device to seek immediate medical attention if they get a low-battery alert. “Abbott is resolving all old St. Jude Medical issues,” Abbott spokeswoman Candace Steele Flippin said. The new update will provide doctors with an earlier warning when the batteries in Abbott’s implantable cardioverter defibrillators are at risk of early depletion.  Abbott said it would also update the software embedded in pacemakers to reduce the risk of hacking. The company said there have been no reports of unauthorized access to any patient’s implanted device and that compromising the security of the devices would require a complex set of circumstances.  The FDA said it approved the update to ensure that it addresses the cyber security vulnerabilities, and reduces the risk of patient harm. The FDA and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed in January that St. Jude devices were vulnerable to hacking. But they said they knew of no cyber attacks on patients with the company’s cardiac implants. The FDA said the benefits of continuing treatment outweighed cyber risks, and DHS said only an attacker “with high skill” could exploit the vulnerability. They launched the probe in August after short-selling firm Muddy Waters and cyber security firm MedSec Holdings said the devices were riddled with security flaws that made them vulnerable to potentially life-threatening hacks. When Muddy Waters went public with the claims, it also disclosed it was shorting shares of St. Jude Medical, which was preparing to sell itself to Abbott. The short-selling firm said it believed that disclosure of the vulnerabilities could cause the $25 billion deal to fall apart, but Abbot completed the deal in January.

418,ABT,FDA approves Abbott's blood glucose monitoring device,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Abbott Laboratories’ glucose monitoring device for adults with diabetes, allowing millions of people to track their blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers. Abbott's FreeStyle Libre Flash reduces the need for fingerstick testing, which is painful and inconvenient, by inserting a small sensor wire below the skin to continuously measure and monitor glucose levels. The device can be worn for up to 10 days. (bit.ly/2xxbrbt) Chicago-based Abbott’s shares were trading up 3.6 percent at $54 after the bell on Wednesday. Traditionally, diabetes patients measured their glucose levels nearly a dozen times a day by pricking their finger tips for blood samples. Nowadays, advanced continuous glucose monitoring devices, such as DexCom Inc’s G5 Mobile and Medtronic Plc’s iPRO2 Professional, which have sensors to measure glucose readings are used. However, these devices require fingertip testing two to four times a day for optimal accuracy. DexCom’s shares were down 14.3 percent at $57.85, while Medtronic’s stock rose marginally in after-market trading. Most diabetes patients do not measure glucose as often as they should because of the discomfort caused by these kinds of tests, Jared Watkin, senior vice president of Abbott’s Diabetes Care unit, told Reuters. According to studies, the majority of people with diabetes test glucose levels less than three times a day, Abbott said. Abbott’s device, however, is a long-lasting glucose sensor, which does not require fingerstick testing to ensure its accuracy. The company plans to launch the device before the end of this year, Watkin said on Wednesday.

419,ABT,UPDATE 1-FDA approves Abbott's blood glucose monitoring device,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Abbott Laboratories’ glucose monitoring device for adults with diabetes, allowing millions of people to track their blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers. Abbott's FreeStyle Libre Flash reduces the need for fingerstick testing, which is painful and inconvenient, by inserting a small sensor wire below the skin to continuously measure and monitor glucose levels. The device can be worn for up to 10 days. (bit.ly/2xxbrbt) Chicago-based Abbott’s shares were trading up 3.6 percent at $54 after the bell on Wednesday. Traditionally, diabetes patients measured their glucose levels nearly a dozen times a day by pricking their finger tips for blood samples. Nowadays, advanced continuous glucose monitoring devices, such as DexCom Inc’s G5 Mobile and Medtronic Plc’s iPRO2 Professional, which have sensors to measure glucose readings are used. However, these devices require fingertip testing two to four times a day for optimal accuracy. DexCom’s shares were down 14.3 percent at $57.85, while Medtronic’s stock rose marginally in after-market trading. Most diabetes patients do not measure glucose as often as they should because of the discomfort caused by these kinds of tests, Jared Watkin, senior vice president of Abbott’s Diabetes Care unit, told Reuters. According to studies, the majority of people with diabetes test glucose levels less than three times a day, Abbott said. Abbott’s device, however, is a long-lasting glucose sensor, which does not require fingerstick testing to ensure its accuracy. The company plans to launch the device before the end of this year, Watkin said on Wednesday.

421,ABT,Abbott wins U.S. antitrust approval to buy Alere with conditions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories has won U.S. antitrust approval to buy Alere Inc on condition that it sell two point-of-care medical testing businesses, the Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday. Canada also announced on Thursday that it had approved the proposed transaction on similar terms.  Alere’s shares were up 3.5 percent at $50.61 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday while Abbott was up 3 percent at $53.72.  Abbott first offered to buy Alere in February 2016, but the deal ran into trouble because of issues related to the diagnostic maker’s accounting and sales practices. The company finally agreed to buy Alere in April for about $5.3 billion, down from an initial $5.8 billion offer. Alere also agreed Thursday to pay more than $13 million to resolve Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it committed accounting fraud and made improper payments to foreign officials. To win the U.S. antitrust approval, the FTC required Abbott to sell two types of point-of-care medical testing device businesses, which can be used in doctors’ offices, hospitals and homes.  The companies agreed to divest a blood gas testing system that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and a cardiac marker system used to determine quickly if a patient is having a heart attack or congestive heart failure. Siemens Aktiengesellschaft will buy the blood gas testing business, as well as two Alere facilities in Ottawa. Quidel Corp will buy the heart function testing system business as well as an Alere facility in San Diego. The deal will help Abbott expand in point-of-care diagnostic testing, a market that is growing as physicians increasingly adopt rapid tests that speed up treatment. Point-of-care tests provide results to doctors in a matter of minutes and can be conducted in the physician’s office, an ambulance or even at home. Alere makes tests for infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. Last year, Abbott agreed sell its medical optics division to Johnson & Johnson for $4.3 billion, and closed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical this January.",9282017,http://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-alere-m-a/abbott-wins-u-s-antitrust-approval-to-buy-alere-with-conditions-idUSKCN1C32VH

431,ABT,"Abbott's recent deals, medical device pipeline to fuel growth","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) quarterly results beat estimates and the company raised the top end of its full-year earnings forecast range on Wednesday, as a string of recent deals and medical device approvals help spur growth in its largest unit. The company has acquired several rivals this year, including St. Jude Medical and Alere, to bolster its medical devices business, and favorable tax laws in India are boosting its generics business. The company’s shares rose 2.8 percent to $56.60 to a record in morning trading. Strength in medical devices pulled this quarter, while recent product approvals puts Abbott in a good position, Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy told Reuters. Sales in the medical devices business rose 6.5 percent to $2.60 billion, accounting for more than a third of total sales. The generics unit, which sells drugs in emerging markets, brought in sales of $1.17 billion, up 16 percent. Sales in India, a key market for the company, were helped as the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax prompted inventory restocking. Abbott said it now expects full-year adjusted 2017 profit from continuing operations of $2.48-$2.50 per share, compared with its previous range of $2.43-$2.53. Chief Financial Officer Brian Yoor said he expects the recently closed Alere deal to contribute around $475 million to reported sales this year. Sales in Abbott’s nutrition unit, which had been under pressure due to challenges in China, rose marginally. “We’ve seen a stabilizing of China; it hasn’t been as choppy as it was in the last 2 years,” Chief Executive Miles White said. Abbott and other makers of infant formula have struggled to boost sales in China after the country made it mandatory last year for manufacturers to re-register baby formulas with the government. During the quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved several of Abbott’s devices, including the FreeStyle Libre glucose monitoring system and heart devices HeartMate 3 and Ellipse. “Overall, we’d expect investors to view these results positively - not just for ABT, but again for the broader med-tech group,” Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said. Net sales of $6.83 billion beat the average analyst estimate of $6.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, profit was 66 cents per share, beating estimates by a penny.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

442,ABT,CMS to cover Abbott's glucose monitoring device,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said on Thursday its newly launched glucose monitoring device would be covered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, expanding its usage to millions of diabetes patients in the United States. The device, FreeStyle Libre Flash, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September. It allows diabetes patients to continuously track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers. Abbott’s device is the second continuous glucose monitoring system after DexCom Inc’s G5 Mobile to be covered by the federal agency. DexCom’s device is similar to Abbott’s, but requires fingertip testing about two to four times a day for optimal accuracy. Abbott’s device has a retail price of $70 for a reader and $36 per sensor, which lasts for 10 days.  “(This) cost is much less than other CGM systems that are available commercially,” said Jared Watkin, senior vice president of Abbott’s Diabetes Care unit. Watkin added that the Medicare pricing would be different as it is based on certain reimbursement codes. CMS rolled out deep cuts to reimbursement rates for certain laboratory and diagnostic tests under Medicare in November, a move that could save the government about $670 million in Medicare payments in 2018. The reimbursement rates for the CGM system under the existing codes are $3,000 for a year, of which the federal agency pays $2,400 and the rest is paid out of pocket by the patients, Watkin said. “Those codes can change,” he added.

447,ABT,Abbott to take a pause after deal spree,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said on Wednesday it was not looking  at acquisitions this year as the healthcare company looks to ease its debt burden after a spree of deals last year. Abbott last year bolstered its medical device and diagnostic businesses, scooping up rivals St. Jude Medical and Alere for a combined $30 billion.  Shares of the company, which reported better-than-expected quarterly results spurred by these deals, were up 4 percent at $61.62. The company, which has $24 billion in long-term debt, said it had repaid $4 billion of its debt this month and would continue to pay down debt through the year. “I don’t have any M&A; on the radar screen because I want to hit those debt targets by year-end,” Chief Executive Miles White said in a conference call. Analysts applauded the strong results, with New York-based brokerage Leerink calling Abbott “an execution story” due to the successful integration of the two companies it bought.  The company said it expects organic sales growth of 6 to 7 percent for 2018, based on the performance of all its units, including its lagging nutrition business. The nutrition unit’s sales had been hemmed in since mid-2016 after China made it mandatory for manufacturers to re-register baby formulas with the government. Analysts now say that the China troubles could be behind Abbott. “Last year there was excess inventory at competitors that were preparing for new regulations in China (now in effect), which hampered results,” John Boylan from Edward Jones said. Net sales rose 42.3 percent to $7.59 billion, beating revenue expectations of $7.39 billion.       The Chicago, Illinois-based company, however, posted a net loss of $828 million, or 48 cents per share, mainly related to a $1.46 billion charge from the U.S. tax overhaul. Excluding items, Abbott reported profit of 74 cents per share, a cent higher than analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company forecast full-year adjusted profit of $2.80 to $2.90 per share. Analysts were expecting profit of $2.49 per share.   Abbott said it expects an adjusted tax rate of 14.5 percent to 15 percent for 2018. The company reported an adjusted tax rate of 16.5 percent in the fourth quarter.

The FDA said the 15 mm version of Abbott’s Masters HP series valve was the smallest mechanical valve approved in the world. Traditionally, larger valves meant for adults are used in pediatric patients, but may lead to complications. “It’s like putting a size 10 foot into a size 6 shoe. You can do it but you won’t walk very well,” Jonathan Chen, a doctor associated with the device’s clinical study told Reuters. Congenital heart defects affect nearly 1 percent of all births in the United States, and one in four babies have a defect that may require surgery in the first year of birth, according to the company. Abbott had acquired the Masters HP valve range as part of its $25 billion St. Jude Medical deal.

461,ABT,"Abbott sticks to earlier forecasts, disappoints investors","(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) just beat expectations for first quarter profits and revenue on Wednesday but stuck to a full-year profit forecast some investors had expected would be raised, sending the healthcare company’s shares lower. Some analysts also said a 6.9 percent rise in organic sales, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and certain divestitures and acquisitions, was just shy of a roughly 7 percent expected by investors. Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had no consensus estimate for the organic sales. Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said the miss “may limit upside to the shares today despite an otherwise very good quarter.” Several other analysts said the company had failed to meet heightened expectations among investors.  Abbott shares fell 2.7 percent to trade at $58.22 mid-morning in New York.  On a reported basis, Abbott’s sales rose 16.7 percent to $7.39 billion, beating consensus expectations of $7.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Excluding items, Abbott reported a profit of 59 cents per share against expectations of 58 cents per share.  The company reiterated its full-year 2018 forecast of adjusted earnings from continuing operation between $2.80 to $2.90 per share. “It’s all about the expectations,” Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said, saying that investors may have been disappointed that the healthcare company only maintained its full-year profit forecast.     The company’s first-quarter results were helped by launches of new medical devices and a turnaround in its business that sells baby and adult nutritional supplements. Sales across all the company’s business units, except in its established pharmaceuticals business, beat expectations.      The established pharmaceuticals, which sells generic drugs in emerging growth countries such as India, raked in sales of 1.04 billion, but missed analysts’ consensus estimates of $1.08 billion.  The weak sales were due to a slowing market growth rate in Russia, Chief Executive Miles White said on a conference call.  “We seem to have a given market that affects our established pharmaceuticals or even our nutrition business from time to time somewhere. And in this particular case, it’s Russia,” White said. The company reported net earnings of $418 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared to $419 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit from Abbott’s medical device business - its largest division - continued to benefit from its $25 billion purchase of St. Jude Medical, and from new device launches. Sales for the unit rose 14.6 percent to $2.74 billion in the quarter. ",4182018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-abbott-results/abbott-sticks-to-earlier-forecasts-disappoints-investors-idUSKBN1HP1LL

Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said the miss “may limit upside to the shares today despite an otherwise very good quarter.” Several other analysts said the company had failed to meet heightened expectations among investors.  Abbott shares fell 2.7 percent to trade at $58.22 mid-morning in New York.  On a reported basis, Abbott’s sales rose 16.7 percent to $7.39 billion, beating consensus expectations of $7.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Excluding items, Abbott reported a profit of 59 cents per share against expectations of 58 cents per share.  The company reiterated its full-year 2018 forecast of adjusted earnings from continuing operation between $2.80 to $2.90 per share. “It’s all about the expectations,” Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said, saying that investors may have been disappointed that the healthcare company only maintained its full-year profit forecast.     The company’s first-quarter results were helped by launches of new medical devices and a turnaround in its business that sells baby and adult nutritional supplements. Sales across all the company’s business units, except in its established pharmaceuticals business, beat expectations.      The established pharmaceuticals, which sells generic drugs in emerging growth countries such as India, raked in sales of 1.04 billion, but missed analysts’ consensus estimates of $1.08 billion.  The weak sales were due to a slowing market growth rate in Russia, Chief Executive Miles White said on a conference call.  “We seem to have a given market that affects our established pharmaceuticals or even our nutrition business from time to time somewhere. And in this particular case, it’s Russia,” White said. The company reported net earnings of $418 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared to $419 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit from Abbott’s medical device business - its largest division - continued to benefit from its $25 billion purchase of St. Jude Medical, and from new device launches. Sales for the unit rose 14.6 percent to $2.74 billion in the quarter.
