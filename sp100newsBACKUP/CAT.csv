1,CAT,Dim sum market stirs U.S. borrowers,"BRADENTON/NEW YORK, July 7 (IFR) - One of the U.S. high-grade market’s favorites, Caterpillar Financial Services, is becoming quite the regular issuer in the offshore yuan-denominated market, also called the dim sum or CNH bond market.  On Wednesday CAT (CAT.N) priced a 2.3 billion yuan ($355 million) bond, its second trade in a market that is looking increasingly interesting to U.S. corporations that do business in China.  So far, only five foreign multi-nationals have tapped the dim sum market, McDonald’s (MCD.N), Caterpillar, Unilever (UNc.AS), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Fonterra. But the market averages a good five to 10 deals per week, and outstanding bonds have swelled to more than 130 billion yuan so far. Many expect that volume to exceed 200 billion yuan by the end of the year.  What’s more, a greater proportion of that volume is likely to come from U.S. companies that produce revenue in China. The dim sum market is becoming more user-friendly and American companies are investing more in China.  “For us, it’s part of Caterpillar Financial’s normal strategy that we look to fund in the local market,” said Jim Dugan, spokesman at Caterpillar Inc. “In that sense there’s a great deal of interest in the renminbi market but for us it’s part of our broader strategy.”  Borrowers in need of renminbi funding generally have two options to raise capital directly in the currency. They can access the mainland-China bank loan market where rates are regulated by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) or, as Caterpillar and McDonald’s before it did, they can issue in the offshore renminbi bond market, where rates are market driven, and remit the proceeds to China.  In the current economic climate at least, the offshore market is by far the cheaper alternative for borrowers.  “A two-year mainland renminbi bank loan for Caterpillar would have cost roughly 6.4% compared to the 1.35% rate Caterpillar was able to achieve in the CNH bond market,” said Caroline Owen, head of DCM North America for Standard Chartered, the sole bookrunner on Caterpillar’s offshore yuan transaction.  The 6.4% loan rate is generally for a strong issuer like CAT. The PBOC sets the base rate and allows mainland China banks to charge borrowers as low as 90% of that rate for the highest quality borrower. It’s essentially a PBOC-set floor put in place so banks don’t try to get market share by undercutting and putting themselves in jeopardy. However, banks can, and do, charge well over 100% of the base rate for riskier credits.  For the cost savings alone, the dim sum bond market looks like the better alternative for companies in need of renminbi funding. But there is another big factor motivating borrowers to choose a bond over a loan.  “Ultimately, the central bank controls the tap on mainland lending and it can take measures to dry up liquidity,” Owen said. “However, by funding via the CNH bond market, issuers have the security of knowing they have access to funds when they need them.”  All the obvious advantages of the dim sum market are naturally drawing a lot of interest.  “Although the market is still in its infancy, we have very quickly seen the emergence of a variety of credits, ranging from high quality household names to high yield and unrated issuers,” Owen said.  That said, the dim sum market can still be tough to swallow. The ability to bring CNH bond proceeds into China is strictly controlled by the Chinese regulators. In fact, the approval process to do an offshore yuan-denominated bond is quite lengthy.  “The full potential for growth in issuance volumes, however, is limited by the amount of proceeds issuers can remit into the mainland to finance their operations,” Owen said.  Deal size is essentially capped at what Chinese authorities allow issuers to bring across the border — and is determined by what is known as the foreign debt quota, the difference between the total investment and minimum registered capital.  Issuers seeking to remit bond proceeds to the mainland must apply for approval from the regulators stating the amount they wish to bring into China. Typically, issuers will wait for the required remittance approvals before bringing the deal. Approval from regulators could come within weeks, or within months. Once issuers get approval, they then hit the bond market and hope to get enough demand to reach their approved amount.  Caterpillar, for its part, got the green light for a sizeable haul. The 2.3 billion yuan deal was large compared to its predecessors. Only eight issuers have ever attempted a deal 2 billion yuan or larger, and five of those were government affiliated. The other three, Guangzhou R&F, Melco Crown and Ping An (2318.HK), got done in a much better market environment and actually priced at much higher rates. CAT impressively priced in size in shaky market conditions.  The demand for CNH bonds is high in part because investors don’t have many other options.  “Investors who have access to renminbi really have very limited investment alternatives. They can place their cash in CNH deposit accounts paying about 50-60bp - not a lot, especially when you factor in inflation - or invest in offshore yuan-denominated bonds at a relatively higher yield,” said Owen.  Demand has caused yields on CNH bonds to come in quite dramatically. When Caterpillar made its dim sum debut in November 2010, it paid 2% for a 1 billion yuan two-year bond.  The majority of investors so far are in Asia. But Wednesday’s trade actually saw 20% participation from European investors. It was the largest European participation in the CNH bond market this year.  Standard Chartered, Caterpillar’s lead arranger, is ranked number two behind HSBC in offshore yuan-denominated bond league table.

A deal could be announced this week, Bloomberg said, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.   Neither Joy Global nor International Mining could be reached for comment.   International Mining shares were suspended Monday in Hong Kong trading. The company, controlled by private equity firm Jordan Co LP, has a market value of HK$8.5 billion, or about $1.1 billion, according to Reuters data.   A deal would make strategic sense, partly because it would keep Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) from gaining further scale in China, Baird Equity Research analyst Robert McCarthy said in a note to clients. China is the world’s largest coal mining market, three times the size of the U.S. market.   In May, Joy Global said it would buy Rowan Cos Inc’s (RDC.N) drilling and mining gear unit for $1.1 billion in cash as it looked to offset competition in its main market by entering the oil and gas drilling business. [ID:nL4E7GG1MI]   Joy Global’s expansion into a new market follows Caterpillar’s $7.6 billion purchase of main rival Bucyrus — a deal that leaves Joy Global as the last stand-alone U.S.-based maker of mining equipment.

5,CAT,Australia seeks creativity in stalled Doha talks," * Proposed small package politically difficult for US   * Australia urges US push for farm export competition pact   By Doug Palmer   WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - An Australian trade official on Thursday urged countries not give up on world trade talks and to push for a small package of agreements in December that could pave the way for a broader deal.   “We would like to see more creative suggestions on ways to conclude the Doha negotiations, rather than reasons why it can’t be done,” Cathy Raper, minister-counsellor for trade at Australia’s Embassy in Washington, said during a panel discussion on the nearly 10-year-old round.   Negotiators acknowledged earlier this year that a deal to significantly open agricultural, manufacturing and services markets around the world to more trade was still out of reach, despite countless hours of negotiations since the Doha round was launched in the capital of Qatar in late 2001.   World Trade Organization Director General Pascal Lamy has urged members to focus this year on a smaller package that would first and foremost help Least Developed Countries.   However, two major elements of the proposed December deal — significant cuts in cotton subsidies and duty-free, quota-free treatment for almost all LDC goods — are politically difficult for the United States because of opposition from domestic farm and textile groups.   Raper said Australia believes the December deal could also include the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, liberalization of environmental goods, stronger disciplines on fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing and a comprehensive standstill against new tariffs and subsidies.   Another key element should be a “trade facilitation” agreement to tear down regulatory and other barriers that slow the shipment of goods across borders, Raper said.   She praised a recent letter from Caterpillar (CAT.N) Chairman Doug Oberhelman urging WTO members to reconsider a recent European Union proposal for cutting industrial tariffs, as well as a set of recommendations from the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics on how to ensure any December agreement leads to a larger deal.   “A bold move by the United States” to push for disciplines on export subsidies, export credits and food aid as part of the December package “would be an important sign of commitment to the process from the U.S.,” she added.   Jake Colvin, a vice president at the National Foreign Trade Council, a U.S. business group, said American companies remain interested in a Doha deal but are frustrated with so little progress in the talks over the past four years.   The United States is repeatedly called upon to show leadership but when Washington offers a new concession it is immediately “pocketed” by other WTO members without any movement in response, Colvin said.

6,CAT,Joy Global expands in China mining with IMM stake,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mining equipment maker Joy Global Inc JOYG.O plans to buy an initial 41 percent stake in International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd (1683.HK) (IMM) for $585 million to expand in China’s fast-growing coal market.  TJCC Holdings Ltd, a unit of U.S. private equity firm Jordan Co LP, is selling its entire stake in IMM, which makes underground coal mining machinery.  The agreement calls for Joy Global to buy 535 million IMM shares from TJCC for HK$8.50 each, a 30 percent premium over its last price of HK$6.55 on July 11. Joy Global will be required to make an offer for the remaining 59 percent of IMM once the share purchase agreement is completed.  IMM posted adjusted operating earnings $90 million in fiscal 2010, on sales of $299 million. At least one estimate saw 2011 earnings growing to about $113 million.  IMM would likely add to Joy Global’s fiscal 2012 earnings, several analysts said, depending on how it pays for its purchase. The company said on Thursday it will finance the purchase with a combination of cash and debt, and may issue equity.  Joy Global shares were up 1.2 percent at $95.99, after earlier trading as high as $98.50. Caterpillar turned lower, trading down 0.2 percent to $108.43.  Milwaukee-based Joy Global said the deal was part of its strategy of expanding in emerging markets. Although major mines in China use foreign equipment, many others rely on domestic machinery.  The overall Chinese mining market is dominated by coal, of which 90 percent is underground, in contrast with the U.S. coal market which is mostly surface mining, JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan said in a research note.  The IMM deal is Joy Global’s second in a matter of weeks, part of a strategy that analysts have called at least partly defensive. In May, it said it would buy Rowan Companies’ (RDC.N) drilling and mining gear unit for $1.1 billion.  The M&A activity follows rival Caterpillar’s $7.6-billion purchase of mining machinery competitor Bucyrus, a deal that leaves Joy Global as the last stand-alone United States-based maker of such equipment.  After recession hit in late 2008, the price of many commodities such as copper, aluminum and iron ore fell as demand from manufacturers dropped off. Mining companies idled production and laid off workers.  But since last year, metals prices have rebounded sharply, prompting producers to reopen mines and start up idled projects. That has put a strain on supplies of equipment, with some producers complaining they cannot get adequate supplies.  Machinery suppliers have consolidated to gain scale.  Joy Global’s deal marks a push into the underground mining segment of an equipment market where Caterpillar largely does not participate, Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten said.  “Caterpillar is becoming a major force in the mining market, a powerhouse globally (that) offers mining customers one-stop shopping,” Lustgarten said, adding that Caterpillar has a small market share in Chinese mining.  “This is part of the redoing of the landscape of the mining business,” he said. “China’s mining market is not nearly as important as China’s purchases of commodities that drive commodity purchases globally.”  ",7142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-imm-joyglobal/joy-global-expands-in-china-mining-with-imm-stake-idUSTRE76D39P20110714

11,CAT,Corporations press Republicans for debt deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street, big corporations and business groups are mounting an increasingly frantic lobbying campaign to persuade Republicans to raise the debt limit as fears of a national default grow.  Despite an August 2 deadline to increase the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, Congress and the White House are nowhere close to a deal that would prevent the U.S. Treasury from running out of money to pay certain government bills.  Lobbyists and trade groups for companies such as JPMorgan Chase and Caterpillar have been courting fiscally conservative Republicans all over the country, trying to convince them of the need to take action to stave off a default and financial mayhem that would ensue.  Republican Representative Michael Grimm, who was elected in 2010 and is a member of the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee, said he has met with senior officials with Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, and major hedge fund managers, insurers, realtors and small business owners.  Although the meetings were scheduled because of his position on the House committee, Grimm said the tenor of the conversations have changed.  “The difference is that before, we had these meetings, we would discuss the (committee) issues, and at the end of the meeting we would talk about the debt limit,” he said. “Now it’s the reverse. It comes to the forefront of every conversation. It is really consuming the debate.”  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s biggest business lobby, helped spearhead a massive lobbying campaign that started at the beginning of the year. The Chamber and a broad coalition of business and trade groups already sent lawmakers a letter in April warning of dire consequences if America’s borrowing limit was not increased.  This week, lawmakers received a similar letter signed by 470 top business leaders including Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman, and the CEOs of huge companies such as Deere & Company, General Mills and Honeywell International.  But for all their efforts, the majority of Republicans in the House remain unconvinced.  “My view has not changed very much,” said Kansas Representative Mike Pompeo. “I am even more convinced that we can’t raise the debt ceiling without changes in our spending pattern,” Pompeo said after speaking to a major credit rating agency about the perils of not improving the nation’s fiscal condition.  The U.S. budget deficit is forecast to reach $1.4 trillion for the fiscal year 2011 and the country’s public debt is at $14.3 trillion, prompting the major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch Ratings, to warn of potential downgrades.  Republican Representative James Lankford said he also will not agree to raise the debt cap without deep spending cuts.  Lankford, a member of the House Budget Committee, said he has held numerous meetings with about 30 to 40 people in recent months, including U.S. Treasury officials, former Treasury officials, business people and economists.  He said the meetings had taken place all over Washington and in his home state of Oklahoma. A Lankford aide said the meetings had increased in frequency because of the looming deadline.  “There is not a place I go now where this is not the conversation,” Lankford said.  The fear that lawmakers will be unable to reach a deal has gained ground outside of Washington and Wall Street.  At a meeting in Indiana on Thursday about a dozen business leaders met with the General Services Administration head Martha Johnson and told her that the debt impasse in Washington was stoking worries among companies across the region.  “It’s creating a meaningful degree of instability,” said Stephen Russell, the chief executive of Celadon Trucking, who gives the Chicago Federal Reserve input about the economy on a regular basis. Russell said the business community’s fears have increased over the past few weeks amid the warnings of a U.S. credit downgrade.  Even lobbyists have grown increasingly apprehensive that Congress will not act on time. Bruce Josten, executive vice president for government affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, has held “dozens” of meetings on Capitol Hill.  Last week he spoke to 30 members of the Senate Democratic Steering Committee, followed by a session with the Republican leadership and their staff.

Despite an Aug. 2 deadline to increase the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, Congress and the White House are nowhere close to a deal that would prevent the U.S. Treasury from running out of money to pay certain government bills.   Lobbyists and trade groups for companies such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Caterpillar (CAT.N) have been courting fiscally conservative Republicans all over the country, trying to convince them of the need to take action to stave off a default and financial mayhem that would ensue.   Republican Representative Michael Grimm, who was elected in 2010 and is a member of the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee, said he has met with senior officials with Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N), and major hedge fund managers, insurers, realtors and small business owners.   Although the meetings were scheduled because of his position on the House committee, Grimm said the tenor of the conversations have changed.   “The difference is that before, we had these meetings, we would discuss the (committee) issues, and at the end of the meeting we would talk about the debt limit,” he said. “Now it’s the reverse. It comes to the forefront of every conversation. It is really consuming the debate.”   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s biggest business lobby, helped spearhead a massive lobbying campaign that started at the beginning of the year. The Chamber and a broad coalition of business and trade groups already sent lawmakers a letter in April warning of dire consequences if America’s borrowing limit was not increased.   This week, lawmakers received a similar letter signed by 470 top business leaders including Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman, and the CEOs of huge companies such as Deere & Company, General Mills and Honeywell International.   But for all their efforts, the majority of Republicans in the House remain unconvinced.   “My view has not changed very much,” said Kansas Representative Mike Pompeo. “I am even more convinced that we can’t raise the debt ceiling without changes in our spending pattern,” Pompeo said after speaking to a major credit rating agency about the perils of not improving the nation’s fiscal condition.   The U.S. budget deficit is forecast to reach $1.4 trillion for the fiscal year 2011 and the country’s public debt is at $14.3 trillion, prompting the major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch Ratings, to warn of potential downgrades.   Republican Representative James Lankford said he also will not agree to raise the debt cap without deep spending cuts.   Lankford, a member of the House Budget Committee, said he has held numerous meetings with about 30 to 40 people in recent months, including U.S. Treasury officials, former Treasury officials, business people and economists.   He said the meetings had taken place all over Washington and in his home state of Oklahoma. A Lankford aide said the meetings had increased in frequency because of the looming deadline.  “There is not a place I go now where this is not the conversation,” Lankford said.   The fear that lawmakers will be unable to reach a deal has gained ground outside of Washington and Wall Street.   At a meeting in Indiana on Thursday about a dozen business leaders met with the General Services Administration head Martha Johnson and told her that the debt impasse in Washington was stoking worries among companies across the region.   “It’s creating a meaningful degree of instability,” said Stephen Russell, the chief executive of Celadon Trucking, who gives the Chicago Federal Reserve input about the economy on a regular basis. Russell said the business community’s fears have increased over the past few weeks amid the warnings of a U.S. credit downgrade.   Even lobbyists have grown increasingly apprehensive that Congress will not act on time. Bruce Josten, executive vice president for government affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, has held “dozens” of meetings on Capitol Hill.   Last week he spoke to 30 members of the Senate Democratic Steering Committee, followed by a session with the Republican leadership and their staff.   Asked if he was frustrated that the deadline was so near with no sign of a deal, Josten said: “I’m frustrated with a whole bunch of folks.”  ",7152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-debt-lobbying/u-s-corporations-press-republicans-for-debt-deal-idUSN1E76E17620110715
13,CAT,Industrials could signal slower growth ahead,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers are entering an period where growth is more muted, profit margins are harder to raise and earnings beats are less common.  The easy money has been made, many analysts and shareholders of U.S. industrial stocks say.  General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Jeff Immelt, whose company reports second-quarter earnings next week, acknowledges that the industrial conglomerate is operating in volatile times.  Demand is tremendous, the company’s chief executive says. “You see it getting better, yet at the same time, there’s more discontent,” Immelt said this week at a sprawling GE factory in South Carolina. “This recovery has been so different from previous recoveries.”  Analysts say industrials are in transition from a  “V-shaped” recovery after recession, when nearly everyone increased sales and profits, to an unpredictable period when some businesses thrive, others lag and picking winners is harder.  “Industrials as a group may be among the first to see their profit margins challenged,” said Keith Goddard, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which owns GE, Johnson Controls (JCI.N) and FedEx (FDX.N), among other companies whose fortunes are tied to the business cycle.  “Margins are bumping up against all-time highs,” said Goddard, who favors healthcare stocks. “Don’t go to the industrial space looking for positive earnings surprises.”  Increasing commodity and labor costs will trim profits across corporate America, he said, hitting labor-intensive manufacturers. GE has more than 100,000 workers just in the United States.  Many investors play down the negative effects of the U.S. government debt-ceiling impasse and a cautious, debt-burdened U.S. consumer. Slow growth is not a double-dip recession, they say.  Although the U.S. recovery has stalled by some measures, other large economies are still hungry for heavy machinery, cooling equipment, tools and other industrial goods.  Companies keyed to Brazil, India and China, including 3M (MMM.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N) and Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), will again benefit from robust capital spending, much of it funded by governments.  One question earnings season may answer is whether Europe’s debt crisis will affect growth and alter profit expectations. Europe’s problems are overemphasized, said Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund, which holds shares of Caterpillar (CAT.N), Deere (DE.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N).  Industrial shares have rallied into earnings season. For a graphic, click: r.reuters.com/wes62s “I’m not too worried about earnings this quarter,” Pursche said — but a potential global economic slowdown could damp prospects for corporate profits. “I’m much more concerned about cautionary statements from CFOs and CEOs about the rest of the year. It’s going to be a much more challenging environment.”  Caterpillar could sound a cautious note because of China’s efforts to rein in its economy, he said. China’s leaders have suggested they will again raise interest rates and bank reserve requirements to bring down inflation.  U.S. industrials are among the most globally diverse multinationals, but the U.S. market still accounts for as much as half of their revenue. Recent data offers fodder for both bulls and bears.  U.S. June industrial production data disappointed on Friday, and May was revised lower.  A monthly gauge of factory activity by the Institute of Supply Management rebounded last month from a May slump, easing fears of a broad slowdown.  But construction spending — a key market for companies ranging from Eaton to Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), United Technologies and Tyco TYC.N — has fallen for six straight months to its lowest in a decade.  And a quarterly Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI survey pointed to further growth, but at a slower rate. The poll of financial executives, a leading indicator of manufacturing activity, found a fourth straight decline in sentiment.  Companies whose fiscal years ended in June, including Parker Hannifin (PH.N) and Kennametal (KMT.N), will give initial glimpses into 2012 when they introduce 12-month earnings forecasts. Both are known for starting with conservative profit targets.  Other variables to watch this quarter are how much Japan’s March earthquake hurts companies such as 3M; electrical manufacturers’ ability to offset higher steel and copper costs with pricing; and the impact of a weak U.S. dollar.  Depressed housing and a delayed recovery in non-residential construction could hurt machinery makers and rental companies, as well as makers of air conditioners and components.  Other late-cycle markets, such as power generation equipment and aerospace, are also expected to grow over the next two years after declines in 2009 and 2010, so any sign of whether their rebound has begun will be an area of focus.  Electrical equipment and multi-industry companies are near the end of a beat-and-raise phase of their cycle, said Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callahan.  “You had the big V-shaped snapback against easy comparisons,” he said. “Growth has been abnormally high. We’re entering a maturing part of the cycle.”  Managers will point to moderating growth rates this quarter, with few sounding especially bullish. Corporate crystal balls are as cloudy as anyone else’s, O’Callahan said.  ‘WHITE-KNUCKLE’ BULLS  Enough investors see the glass as half-full that earnings expectations and price-to-earnings ratios have risen this year. Industrial shares .GSPIC are up 7 percent year to date, outperforming the broader market. A few, such as Tyco and SPX SPW.N, have jumped 25 percent or more.  At 16 times this year’s estimated earnings, industrials are more richly valued than the overall S&P 500, but are only slightly above their historical average, according to Goldman Sachs.  Goldman analysts, in a July 10 note, predicted industrial companies would sound a more “constructive” tone about the second half of the year than recent economic numbers suggest. They cited expanding late-cycle markets, the weak dollar, and share buybacks and acquisitions.  Most U.S. industrials will beat Wall Street forecasts by 1 percent or 2 percent, said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co, who calls himself a “white-knuckle” bull.  “I expect bigger beats out of companies levered to energy,” he said, citing Dover (DOV.N), Ametek (AME.N) and Emerson. “Ninety-some-dollar oil makes it worth punching holes in the ground.”  Langenberg said current expectations of double-digit profit growth over the next two years are reasonable.  “We’re not back at peak earnings yet,” he said.

15,CAT,UPDATE 1-US architecture billings index falls in June-AIA," * June ABI 46.3 vs. May 47.2   * Project inquiries index rises to 58.1   * Institutional sector weakest amid tight govt. budgets   * Analyst: Construction recovery in 2012 or later  (Adds analyst comment)   NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - A leading indicator of U.S. non-residential construction activity fell for the third consecutive month in June, suggesting an anticipated construction recovery was still several months away.   The Architecture Billings Index fell 0.9 point to 46.3 points in June, according the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in demand for architects’ services, whose revenue predicts construction activity nine to 12 months in the future.   A separate index of project inquiries rose, however, to 58.1 from 52.6 in May. This measure is typically higher as multiple architecture firms compete for the same work.   “While a modest turnaround appeared to be on the way earlier in the year, the overall concern about both domestic and global economies is seeping into design and construction industry and adding yet another element that is preventing recovery,” AIA chief economist Kermit Baker said.   Demand is weakest in the institutional sector that includes government buildings, reflecting depressed government budgets, according to the monthly survey of architecture firms.   “The threat of the federal government failing to resolve the debt ceiling issue is leading to higher borrowing rates for real estate projects,” Baker said. “Should there actually be a default, we are likely looking at a catastrophic situation for a sector that accounts for more than 10 percent of overall GDP.”   Commercial property values fell to new lows in April and office vacancy rates are well above pre-recession lows, JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan said in a note to clients.   “The recovery has yet to find solid ground and that the non-residential construction environment remains challenging,” she said. “We believe it is more likely that non-residential construction will not recover until 2012+.”   A depressed construction market has been a headwind for manufacturers of construction machinery and components that make up buildings’ infrastructure, such as electrical, cooling and security systems.   Most diversified industrial companies get at least some revenue from the non-residential construction sector, which includes office buildings, retail and warehouse space, and institutional buildings such as schools and hospitals.   Companies exposed to the sector include Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Terex Corp (TEX.N).   European companies such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST) are also big players in the sector.

18,CAT,Caterpillar Q2 profit seen rising 60 percent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reports second-quarter results on Friday, much of investors’ focus will be on the newest part of the company: its just-purchased Bucyrus business.  The maker of heavy equipment used in construction, mining and power generation last week closed its $7.6 billion deal to buy the mining equipment maker, which solidifies Caterpillar’s global leadership in the mining machinery market.  It is expected to detail how much Bucyrus will add to Caterpillar’s sales and profits in coming quarters. To field questions on the deal, Caterpillar has extended its scheduled quarterly conference call by half an hour.  Caterpillar, whose rivals include Terex Corp (TEX.N), Manitowoc (MTW.N), Joy Global Inc JOYG.O and Japan’s Komatsu (6301.T), is expected to earn $1.74 per share on sales of $13.6 billion, a 30 percent revenue increase. Net income is seen rising 60 percent to $1.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Results will likely meet expectations given strong recent dealer sales, which Caterpillar reports monthly, said Tim Hoyle, director of research at Haverford Quality Investing, which manages $6 billion in assets and focuses on stable, dividend-paying stocks, including Caterpillar.  “I want to hear about how they see the Bucyrus merger and how they’re going to exploit that into metals and mining, which is still in huge global growth,” Hoyle said. “They’ve definitely become the leader in that market.”  Haverford, however, recently cut its holdings in Caterpillar and other manufacturers, favoring technology and healthcare names.  “As the recovery matures, investors will probably begin to look to other sectors,” Hoyle said. “Given the huge run in industrials, we thought it was prudent.”  Caterpillar shares are up about 15 percent year-to-date, outperforming their industrial peers .GSPIC and the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which Caterpillar is a component.  Most U.S. manufacturing shares are down from their May highs, reflecting concerns about a slowdown in China, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and a patchy U.S. economic recovery. Caterpillar would also be vulnerable to another global slowdown, so investors will scrutinize results for evidence the recovery has stalled.  They might look, for example, at sales of excavators and loaders in China, which Citigroup says are slowing. Meanwhile, construction activity in Europe remains muted, and an anticipated recovery in U.S. nonresidential construction has been pushed back to at least 2012.  For now, optimism about Caterpillar’s long-term prospects is strong. Investors expect long-term factors such as growth in infrastructure and demand for commodities, especially in emerging markets, to drive Caterpillar to record profits in coming years.

20,CAT,"Earnings, hope for debt deal brighten Wall Street","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors poured into tech shares on Friday as promising chipmaker earnings and optimism that a solution was on the horizon for the U.S. debt stalemate triggered a move into growth-oriented shares.  The Dow was held back by Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), with shares of the heavy equipment maker falling 5.8 percent on disappointing results. The stock exerted a 48.6-point drag on the Dow, which ended off 43 points.  The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 2.2 percent for the week, lifted by strong earnings and a new bailout plan for Greece to contain Europe’s debt crisis. Stocks have been restrained, however, by the long slog of negotiations to resolve the U.S. debt crisis.  “It’s likely an agreement in any form will cause a relief rally for equities,” said Andrew Slimmon, managing director, global investment solutions at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Chicago.  “Coming on the heels of overall pretty good earnings numbers and some sort of resolution in Greece and that could make for a rally in the market,” he said.  President Barack Obama insisted on Friday he was prepared to make “tough choices” for a sweeping deficit-reduction deal to avert a U.S. default, despite Democrats warning him not to make too many concessions.  Semiconductor shares led the market on Friday after Sandisk SNDK.O, a maker of flash memory chips used in smartphones and tablets like the iPad, and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N reported strong results late Thursday. The PHLX Semiconductor index .SOX rose 2.4 percent, led by AMD, which jumped 19.2 percent to $7.75.  “Nasdaq has more things out on the risk curve, and one of the things our folks have been saying is that the risk-on button should be pushed here,” said Glenn Starkman, global head of sales trading at Dahlman Rose in New York.  “You might see some rotation into things like energy, into materials and industrials as well as technology and money might rotate out of things like defensives.”  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 43.25 points, or 0.34 percent, to 12,681.16. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX added 1.22 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,345.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 24.40 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,858.83.  For the week, along with the S&P’s 2.2 percent, the Dow rose 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 2.5 percent.  The second bailout for Greece supported sentiment, even as Fitch ratings agency on Friday said Greece would be in temporary default as the result of the new rescue plan. Fitch pledged to give Greece a higher, “low speculative grade” rating after its bonds had been exchanged and said Athens now had some hope of tackling its debt mountain.  Caterpillar, a maker of equipment used in mining and construction, has been a stalwart performer in recent years and was the top Dow performer for 2010, but rising labor and materials costs hit earnings.  Fellow Dow component McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) income topped estimates, sending the stock up 2.3 percent to $88.56.  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted a greater-than-expected jump in its fiscal fourth-quarter profit but sales of its flagship Windows software disappointed for a third straight quarter. The Dow component rose 1.6 percent to $27.53.  But General Electric Co (GE.N) dipped 0.6 percent to $19.04, even as it reported a 21.6 percent jump in quarterly profit.  Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) lost 2.2 percent to $36.74 after the telecom giant posted second-quarter results and named a new chief executive officer.  Volume was light with about 5.81 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, well below the daily average of 7.48 billion.  Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,530 to 1,400, while on the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers 1,294 to 1,256.

21,CAT,"Feeling the heat on debt, earnings","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City may be frying in near record temperatures but Wall Street has been feeling the heat for months. Wrangling over the debt ceiling and questions marks over corporate earnings mean markets are unlikely to get a break any time soon.  Wall Street is set to close its worst three months in a year as July draws to a close next week after a roller coaster ride for markets. Whacked out fund managers hitting the beach in August may find themselves fiddling with their BlackBerrys more than the little umbrella in their cocktails.  “I need a vacation, man. After all the stuff that’s happened in the last three months I’m pretty much shot, I’m getting weird, even my six-year-old looks at me,” said one New Jersey-based fund manager, who was packing his bags for a destination in the Caribbean as temperatures topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City.  With euro zone leaders having reached a deal for yet another bailout for debt-laden Greece, investors will be free to chew over the rancor in Washington with even more attention.  Negotiations between President Barack Obama and the top Republican in the House of Representatives, John Boehner, still looked far from a deal to avert a looming U.S. default, lawmakers said on Friday, raising the likelihood of more volatility next week if no solution is reached over the weekend.  “It’s likely an agreement in any form will cause a relief rally for equities,” said Glenn Starkman, global head of sales trading at Dahlman Rose in New York.  “Coming on the heels of overall pretty good earnings numbers and some sort of resolution in Greece and that could make for a rally in the market,” he said.  But on the other side of the coin, the prolonged and partisan dispute over solving the country’s debt crisis means there is still a big downside risk.  “Who knows where that is going to go,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global in Chicago. “We’re vulnerable to a buyers’ strike if we don’t get any news.”  In addition, the corporate earnings season suggests other risks could dog the market. Despite generally good results so far, there have been some worrisome signs. The S&P 500 rallied 6 percent in the run-up to reporting season, but earnings misses from big industrial names like Rockwell Collins and Caterpillar Inc weighed on the Dow and S&P 500 on Friday.  Earlier in the week several big consumer names such as Whirlpool and Pepsi warned about sluggishness in developed markets, sending their shares sharply lower.  “The market still has a high degree of skepticism in it,” said Kalivas, summing up the earnings season so far.  Kalivas said he will be closely following earnings from sector and economic bellwethers next week. Those include the package delivery company UPS, chipmaker Texas Instruments, and online retailer Amazon.  Around 30 percent of the S&P 500’s $12.3 trillion market cap have reported earnings so far. They have outpaced consensus estimates by 3.8 percent, and only 7 percent have missed estimates, according to data from Morgan Stanley.  But share prices of those that have fallen short of estimates have taken a severe beating. Given the fragile sentiment a few more prominent misses could derail the market.  “The market is punishing these misses more than it is rewarding beats, an asymmetry we have been calling for and we forecast will continue,” wrote Morgan Stanley’s U.S. equity strategist Adam Parker in a note to clients.  “Our view remains that first half of the year numbers are achievable but the second half of the year looks challenged,” he said.  Next week is also a big week for economic data. Fears of a slowdown in the economy have been a large driver of market volatility over the last few months, and the coming releases will be parsed very closely.  They include early regional manufacturing data from Chicago and New York, a reading of consumer sentiment, and a first reading of U.S. growth for the second quarter, expected to show the economy grew just 1.9 percent in the period.  Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, one of the world’s largest fund managers with around $1.6 trillion of equities under management, said this week that the U.S. economy is at a critical juncture.  Doll points out that since 1960 everytime year-on-year growth has fallen under 2 percent the U.S. economy has gone into recession.  “Our bottom line view is that investors should maintain a reasonably constructive bias toward risk assets, but should also be prepared to scale back exposure if evidence of economic growth acceleration does not materialize,” said Doll.

25,CAT,Caterpillar profit misses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc disappointed Wall Street with a second-quarter earnings miss on Friday, hurt by higher costs, and its shares fell nearly 6 percent, dragging down the U.S. stock market.  The maker of equipment used in mining and construction also said economic growth in the United States and other developed economies was weaker than expected and reported signs of a slowdown in China.  Although Caterpillar raised its full-year sales and profit forecast, the midpoint of its new range was below analysts’ average estimate. Shareholders also noted a more cautious tone in the company’s economic commentary, closely watched by investors in economically sensitive manufacturing and transport stocks.  Caterpillar shares were down $6.65 to $104.95 in afternoon trading and most other industrial stocks were also lower, though off the day’s worst levels.  Rising prices of commodities like steel and copper, as well as higher transportation and labor costs, hurt profit in a quarter with elevated expectations, said Andrew Meister, equity research analyst with Minneapolis-based Thrivent Financial, which holds almost 1 million Caterpillar shares.  “In a quarter where the price increases lag the increases in manufacturing costs, you have a miss like you have today,” Meister said. “But what it says is, the long-term outlook for Cat’s products appears robust.”  Caterpillar’s commentary was more subdued than in the past but its forecasts may eventually prove conservative, said Meister, who called Friday’s stock sell-off an overreaction.  “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Caterpillar,” he said.  Caterpillar finance chief Ed Rapp said raw material inflation was roughly in line with what the company expected when it laid out its 2011 forecasts.  Longer-term, higher commodity prices are a “net positive” for the company, he said in an interview. They drive investment by producers, which in turn boosts demand for infrastructure.  3-CENT MISS  Net earnings rose 44 percent to $1.02 billion, or $1.52 per share, in the second quarter, from $707 million or $1.09 per share a year earlier.  Excluding acquisition costs, Caterpillar earned $1.72 per share, 3 cents short of analysts’ average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales rose 37 percent to a record $14.23 billion.  “The bottom line disappointed,” said Oliver Pursche, Co-Portfolio Manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund that holds Caterpillar shares. “Caterpillar tends to be very sensitive to macro issues.”  The company faced headwinds from China and Japan, he said, but did a good job lifting sales to a record and has been especially successful expanding in Latin America.  The company said the March earthquake in Japan reduced its operating profit by $60 million by boosting costs, but the negative impact from Japan is now past.  Caterpillar said it expects its recently-closed $7.6 billion acquisition of mining equipment maker Bucyrus to add $2 billion to its sales this year and to add to earnings after this year. It now expects 2011 profit of $6.75 to $7.25 per share, excluding Bucyrus, raising its range by 50 cents on either end. Analysts expect $7.08.  “The forward guidance is a little bit disappointing,” said Eric Marshall, director of research for Hodges Capital Management, which recently sold its Caterpillar holdings.  “The dealer statistics were so strong throughout the quarter, it built in a lot of pretty high expectations,” he said. “People expected a little bit more.”  Asked about the company’s initial 2012 estimate for earnings of $8 to $10 a per share, before acquisitions, CFO Rapp said, “We’re still very comfortable with that range.”  Analysts’ 2012 estimates currently average $9.12 per share but vary widely, from $7.54 to $9.90.  Caterpillar forecast slower global economic growth this year than in 2010, and said U.S. growth was being curtailed by “a lack of confidence in the business climate.”  Like many U.S. multinationals, Caterpillar has been able to increase profits, despite a slow economic recovery in its domestic market, thanks to rapid expansion in other economies, including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Caterpillar derives more than a third of sales from such emerging markets.  China, however, has taken steps to cool its economy and tame inflation. Higher interest rates and other policy moves have raised concerns among investors that China’s growth could slow abruptly.  “We’ve seen some softening of growth in China,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement, but he added that expectations remain positive. China is doing a good job of balancing growth and inflation, Oberhelman said. Overall, emerging markets remain robust.  Fellow industrials General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc also reported quarterly results on Friday.  GE shares were little changed after its profit beat forecasts, helped by emerging market demand for equipment used in energy production. Honeywell fell 2.5 percent despite higher earnings and an improved full-year forecast.  (For a Reuters Insider view on Caterpillar vs GE, see link.reuters.com/zur72s.)  Caterpillar’s tumble, its steepest since May, was enough to keep the Dow Jones industrial average in negative territory, even as the S&P 500 index turned positive.

The company said the March earthquake in Japan reduced its operating profit by $60 million by boosting costs, but the negative impact from Japan is now past.   Caterpillar said it expects its recently closed $7.6 billion acquisition of mining equipment maker Bucyrus to add $2 billion to its sales this year and to add to earnings after this year. It now expects 2011 profit of $6.75 to $7.25 per share, excluding Bucyrus, raising its range by 50 cents on either end. Analysts expect $7.08.   “The forward guidance is a little bit disappointing,” said Eric Marshall, director of research for Hodges Capital Management, which recently sold its Caterpillar holdings.   “The dealer statistics were so strong throughout the quarter, it built in a lot of pretty high expectations,” he said. “People expected a little bit more.”   Asked about the company’s initial 2012 estimate for earnings of $8 to $10 a per share, before acquisitions, CFO Rapp said, “We’re still very comfortable with that range.”   Analysts’ 2012 estimates currently average $9.12 per share but vary widely, from $7.54 to $9.90.   Caterpillar forecast slower global economic growth this year than in 2010, and said U.S. growth was being curtailed by “a lack of confidence in the business climate.”   Like many U.S. multinationals, Caterpillar has been able to increase profits, despite a slow economic recovery in its domestic market, thanks to rapid expansion in other economies, including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Caterpillar derives more than a third of sales from such emerging markets.   China, however, has taken steps to cool its economy and tame inflation. Higher interest rates and other policy moves have raised concerns among investors that China’s growth could slow abruptly.   “We’ve seen some softening of growth in China,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement, but he added that expectations remain positive. China is doing a good job of balancing growth and inflation, Oberhelman said. Overall, emerging markets remain robust.   Fellow industrials General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) also reported quarterly results on Friday. [ID:nN1E76L01U] [ID:nN1E76L01M]   GE shares were little changed after its profit beat forecasts, helped by emerging market demand for equipment used in energy production. Honeywell fell 2.5 percent despite higher earnings and an improved full-year forecast.

Air Products, which supplies argon, oxygen and other industrial gases to retail, manufacturing and construction customers, said its operations in North America remain the weakest, hurt by lackluster consumer demand and uncertainty about U.S economic policy.   “The economy in North America has kind of hit a soft patch,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Huck said on a conference call with reporters. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty around there.”   Asian growth remains strong, and the company plans to increase its capital spending there, Huck said.   The Air Products results came on the same day that manufacturing giants Honeywell Inc (HON.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) issued weak forecasts. [ID:nN1E76L01M] [ID:nN1E76L04K]   Planned customer plant shutdowns during the fiscal third quarter dented Air Products’ tonnage business, which operates industrial gas facilities on-site for customers.   Higher costs ate into the merchant business, which supplies industrial gas for retail and construction customers.   Chief Executive John McGlade said he was “very disappointed” about the weak performance.   “With the Tonnage planned maintenance outages behind us and the actions we are taking to improve Merchant performance, we expect margins to improve significantly” in the current quarter, McGlade said in a statement.   Mixed results could continue, the company said. Air Products forecast a profit of $1.48 to $1.53 per share for the current quarter. Analysts expect $1.52.   “As uncertainties surrounding policy, fiscal and sovereign debt issues begin to resolve over the coming months, we would expect growth to pick up early in our fiscal 2012,” said Huck.   For the third quarter, ended June 30, the company posted net income of $326.5 million, or $1.50 per share, compared with $253.2 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.   Excluding a gain from the sale of its healthcare business in 2009, Air Products earned $1.46 per share. That met analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue rose 15 percent to $2.58 billion. Analysts expected $2.53 billion.   Sales to electronics customers showed the fastest growth, up 21 percent to $602 million.   The electronics segment, which supplies gases that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) use to make their popular products, should continue to grow, Huck said.   “We expect continued strong performance from this segment,” he said.   Air Products walked away from a planned $5.9 billion buyout of smaller rival Airgas Inc ARG.N earlier this year. [ID:nN15128419]   Shares of Air Products were down 2.4 percent to $93.16 in midday trading. The stock has traded between $69.89 and $98.00 in the past 52 weeks.

30,CAT,"Futures fall 1.0 percent, debt talks produce no deal","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock index futures fell more than 1.0 percent on Sunday as the failure by the government to come to an agreement on the debt ceiling made the prospects of a default— once considered an impossible outcome— more likely.  Congress and the White House remained at odds over a deal and House Speaker John Boehner pulled out of talks with President Barack Obama on Friday, killing hopes for a weekend deal, as had been widely expected.  White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley warned that there would be a “few stressful days” ahead for financial markets, with the deadline to lift the $14.3 trillion U.S. borrowing limit now only nine days away.  A default “has the potential to be like Lehman on steroids,” said Jim Awad, managing director at Zephyr Management in New York. “It is a very serious near-term issue, even if markets are still assuming it won’t happen.”  “A default is not priced into markets right now,” he added.  S&P 500 futures fell 15.5 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures sank 131 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 37.25 points.

32,CAT,Wall St Week Ahead: Markets edgy on debt talk stalemate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Much of the United States may be frying in near-record temperatures but Wall Street has been feeling the heat for months. Wrangling over the debt ceiling has kept markets on edge, and investors are still waiting for a breakthrough that leads to a deal to avoid a devastating default.  Investors have viewed as extremely unlikely the possibility of a U.S. default if the federal government does not agree to raise the debt ceiling. But the odds are growing, and Congress and the White House remained at odds just a few hours before Asian markets opened on Monday.  “Unless during the course of the day there is a specific, concrete proposal that placates the market before Asian markets open, the worst-case scenario is that the markets just sell off — sell off dramatically,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  White House officials and Republican leaders scrambled on Sunday to reassure global markets the United States would avert a debt default, but the two sides gave no sign they were moving closer to a deal.  White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley warned that there would be a “few stressful days” ahead for financial markets, with the deadline to lift the $14.3 trillion U.S. borrowing limit now only nine days away.  “To some degree the outcome of there being no deal has been priced in, but the discounting is not fully in the market and this is adding to uncertainty that has already been coupled with the events in Europe and expectations that growth was already going to be weak,” Krosby said.  Wall Street is set to close its worst three months in a year as July draws to an end this week after a roller-coaster ride for markets.  With euro zone leaders having reached a deal for yet another bailout for debt-laden Greece, investors will be free to chew over the rancor in Washington with even more attention.  In addition, the corporate earnings season suggests other risks could dog the market. Despite generally good results so far, there have been some worrisome signs.  The S&P 500 rallied 6 percent in the run-up to reporting season, but earnings misses from big industrial names like Rockwell Collins and Caterpillar Inc weighed on the Dow and S&P 500 on Friday.  Earlier in the week several big consumer names such as Whirlpool and Pepsi warned about sluggishness in developed markets, sending their shares sharply lower.  “The market still has a high degree of skepticism in it,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global in Chicago, summing up the earnings season so far.  Kalivas said he will be closely following earnings from sector and economic bellwethers this week. Those include the package delivery company UPS, chipmaker Texas Instruments, and online retailer Amazon.  Around 30 percent of the S&P 500’s $12.3 trillion market cap have reported earnings so far. They have outpaced consensus estimates by 3.8 percent, and only 7 percent have missed estimates, according to data from Morgan Stanley.  But share prices of those that have fallen short of estimates have taken a severe beating. Given the fragile sentiment, a few more prominent misses could derail the market.  “The market is punishing these misses more than it is rewarding beats, an asymmetry we have been calling for and we forecast will continue,” Morgan Stanley’s U.S. equity strategist Adam Parker wrote in a note to clients.  “Our view remains that first half of the year numbers are achievable, but the second half of the year looks challenged,” he said.  This week is also a big week for economic data. Fears of a slowdown in the economy have been a large driver of market volatility over the last few months, and the coming releases will be parsed very closely.  They include early regional manufacturing data from Chicago and New York, a reading of consumer sentiment, and a first reading of U.S. growth for the second quarter, expected to show the economy grew just 1.9 percent in the period.  Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, one of the world’s largest fund managers with around $1.6 trillion of equities under management, said last week that the U.S. economy is at a critical juncture.  Doll points out that since 1960 every time year-on-year growth has fallen under 2 percent the U.S. economy has gone into recession.  “Our bottom line view is that investors should maintain a reasonably constructive bias toward risk assets, but should also be prepared to scale back exposure if evidence of economic growth acceleration does not materialize,” said Doll.  And many believe economic activity will be depressed if a failure to raise the debt ceiling interrupts key government services such as social security and Medicare.  The uncertainty is sure to stress markets further, and fund managers hitting the beach in August may find themselves fiddling with their BlackBerrys more than the little umbrella in their cocktails.  “I need a vacation, man. After all the stuff that’s happened in the last three months I’m pretty much shot, I’m getting weird, even my 6-year-old looks at me,” said one New Jersey-based fund manager, who was packing his bags for a destination in the Caribbean as temperatures topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City.

36,CAT,Companies churn out profits but not jobs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The sluggish pace of hiring may be hobbling the U.S. economy, but it’s not been holding back big U.S. companies’ profits thanks to growth overseas and cost controls at home. And that’s bad news for the more than 14 million Americans without jobs.  Big businesses would normally be desperate for surging job growth as it would feed into domestic demand but these aren’t normal times. Massive growth opportunities overseas, especially in China and other buoyant Asian economies, have some of the largest American companies on track for record profits, even if they’re businesses are mostly treading water in the U.S.  The message last week from the chief financial officer of one of the nation’s industrial giants couldn’t be clearer.  “We’ve driven all this cost out. Sales have come back, but people have not,” said Greg Hayes, chief financial officer at United Technologies Corp. “It’s the structural cost reductions that we have done over the past few years that have allowed us to see strong bottom-line results.  The company, the world’s largest maker of air conditioners and elevators, said second-quarter profit rose 19 percent, and it is doing most of its hiring in emerging markets where demand for its products is growing fastest.  It isn’t alone in seeing profits climb in the current earnings reporting season.  About 78 percent of companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index that have reported second-quarter earnings have beaten Wall Street expectations. Many benefited after slashing costs when the financial crisis hit and then keeping tight control on them even as sales recovered.  Economists say the ability to do more with less has helped create a two-speed U.S. recovery. The S&P 500 has doubled in value since the recession ended and per-share earnings are currently on track for a new annual record, while employment remains below the level seen in late 2008 when corporate profits troughed.  Employers added fewer jobs in June than at any time in the past nine months, and the jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent - not far below its level of 9.5 percent in June 2009 when the recession ended.  “We’ve never seen the kind of shedding of jobs that we saw in this recession. America’s corporations have never been running so efficiently,” said Ellen Zentner, senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities in New York.  What’s more, workers have never claimed such a paltry share of real national income growth. Economists at Northeastern University in Boston recently found corporate profits captured 88 percent of income growth between the second quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010.  Workers’ take? Slightly more than 1 percent.  “The only major beneficiaries of the recovery have been corporate profits and the stock market and its shareholders,” the study concludes.  The high jobless rate is also keeping wage growth severely restrained in the U.S., which is also good for profit margins.  Recent Department of Labor data showed unit labor costs edged up 0.7 percent in the year to March, though not enough to make up a 2.9 percent decline in the prior 12-month period.  Northeastern economics professor Andrew Sum called the mismatch “historically unprecedented” and said it bodes ill for future growth, especially given many companies are sitting on their cash rather than investing it.  “Workers have no money, no purchasing power, so that’s why consumption is not moving,” he said. By sitting on profits, firms are acting like earners “who take their money and stuff it in the mattress. That’s happening across the economy.”  U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter and was expected to remain below 2 percent in the April-June period.  Some blamed that on high energy prices and supply shortages caused by Japan’s earthquake and are betting on a rebound in the second half.  A July Reuters poll put the median estimate for 2011 growth at 2.7 percent, down from 2.9 percent in 2010.  Businesses’ ability to do more with the same or less — what economists term increased productivity — has been rising since the 1990s, thanks partly to technological advancements and the ability to tap markets in fast-growing, lower-cost developing countries.  Some of the most profitable firms are those with overseas markets. The largest U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co. tied its 21.6 percent rise in earnings partly to strong foreign demand for its heavy equipment, including jet engines and electric turbines.  In the United States, things are obviously different. Consumers are still trying to pay down large debts built up during the boom years, which suppresses spending and means there is little incentive for companies to hire.  “It’s a chicken-and-egg thing — whether demand or supply drives growth,” Zentner said. “Studies show that lack of sales for small business is the biggest impediment to hiring.”  Even companies selling basic consumer products are feeling the pinch as the jobless and those on low incomes watch the pennies. Pepsi Co Inc tempered its full-year outlook this week and said performance in its North American beverage business was worse than expected.  In the cost-conscious auto industry. General Motors Co’s top U.S. sales chief, Don Johnson, told Reuters that its manufacturing managers have been “squeaking out extra units through improving line rates, adding on extra shifts”. The company indicated it is in no hurry to build new factories or hire lots of new workers.  Uncertainty about future tax rates and policy, a by-product of the deadlock in Washington over whether to raise the country’s borrowing limit and how to rein in a gaping budget deficit, has also made firms cautious, said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.  But Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said investors and CEOs alike should probably prepare for more subdued earnings in the second half and beyond.  For one thing, growth abroad appears to be slowing as booming economies such as China and Brazil try to tame inflation. Heavy machine maker Caterpillar blamed slower U.S. and global growth for disappointing quarterly earnings on Friday.  And while U.S. interest rates are likely to remain very low for some time, companies won’t be able to rely on massive federal spending, which Cliggott said also helped boost profits over the past two years.

Two or three parties remain in the auction as the bidding process for Caterpillar’s third-party logistics business has reached the final round, four people said on Tuesday.  Centerbridge Partners has teamed up with Houston businessman Jim Crane, two of the people said. BC Partners is also pursuing the unit, the people said.  Representatives for Caterpillar declined to comment. Centerbridge and BC Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of heavy equipment, hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Robert W. Baird & Co earlier this year to review a potential sale of the unit. The auction comes as Caterpillar sharpens its focus on its core business of making mining and construction equipment.

39,CAT,"Cummins profit beats expectations, raises outlook","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Diesel engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) raised its 2011 outlook after a strong second-quarter profit that beat Wall Street expectations and sent its shares higher.  Cummins, which also makes power generation equipment and filtration systems, warned of a near-term slowdown in China. It said measures taken by the Chinese government to control inflation have hit demand for its engines used in trucks and off-highway markets.  But the company sees the fall in demand as just a correction and will continue with its plans to add capacity in the Chinese market, Chief Operating Officer Tom Linebarger said on a conference call with analysts.  The third quarter will likely be the low point, and improvement will be seen again in the fourth quarter, Linebarger said.  Cummins shares were boosted by the profit beat from strong growth across all its segments and international markets, and were up 4.3 percent in late morning trading to $111.28.  Last week, heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), which competes with Cummins in some markets, said economic growth in the United States and other developed economies was weaker than expected and reported signs of a slowdown in China.  Higher interest rates and other policy moves to tame inflation have raised concerns among investors that China’s growth could slow abruptly.  Cummins expects strong growth in Brazil and India, and for its power products in China.  Manufacturers such as Cummins and United Technologies (UTX.N), which have greater exposure to international markets, have posted better results in their most recent quarters than companies like Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), which have significant exposure to U.S. consumers.  Cummins’ second-quarter earnings rose to $505 million, or $2.60 a share, from $246 million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier.

The debt ceiling debate has grabbed much of investors’ attention this week as the August 2 deadline approaches, but it took a back seat for much of the day as the market reacted to earnings disappointments in industrial and technology sectors.  A profit warning from Juniper Networks (JNPR.N) sent its shares down 20.9 percent to $24.66, damaging sentiment in the technology sector, which has been among the strongest this reporting period.

50,CAT,UPDATE 1-U.S. architects group cuts construction forecast,"   * Sees U.S. construction spending down 5.6 pct in 2011   * Sees 2012 rebound led by hotel sector   * Tight credit, govt budget shortfalls depress spending   NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - An architects’ trade group cut its 2011 U.S. construction forecast on Wednesday, citing tight credit conditions, government budget shortfalls and a depressed housing market.   The American Institute of Architects (AIA) said it now expects spending on nonresidential construction projects to fall 5.6 percent this year before rebounding in 2012. In January it forecast a 2 percent decline this year.   “Consumer and business confidence is poor and the overall economy has yet to pull out of the downturn that began in 2008, which both add to the general sense of anxiety and uncertainty in the real estate market” said AIA Chief Economist Kermit Baker.   “The depressed demand for new construction isn’t likely to improve until next year, led by the commercial sector: offices, retail and hotels.”   Overall nonresidential spending is expected to rise 6.4 percent in 2012, the group said, a slightly stronger recovery than it forecast six months ago.   The AIA publishes a widely cited index of architecture billings that is considered a leading indicator of construction spending up to a year ahead. The billings index has been below 50, indicating contraction, for three consecutive months, after recovering earlier in the year. [ID:nN1E76J08K]   The AIA Consensus Construction Forecast Panel is conducted twice a year with leading nonresidential construction forecasters, including McGraw Hill Construction, IHS-Global Insight and Moody’s economy.com.   Construction of hotels and industrial space is forecast to fall by double digits this year, while smaller declines are forecast for the office and retail sectors.   But in 2012, spending on hotel construction is seen rising 18 percent. AIA said spending on factories and other industrial buildings will rise 8.4 percent; office buildings up 9.8 percent; and retail up 11.8 percent.   The AIA forecast more modest recoveries next year in institutional categories that include churches, schools and healthcare facilities.   A weak U.S. construction market has been a source of frustration for multinational manufacturers that sell machinery to erect buildings or components such as elevators and cooling and security systems. Many industrial names stand to gain once a full-fledged construction recovery finally gains momentum.   U.S. construction spending fell for a sixth straight month in May to its lowest level in more than a decade, according to a government report. June figures due on Monday are forecast to be flat. [ECI/US]   Companies exposed to the sector include Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Emcor Group (EME.N) and Terex Corp (TEX.N).   European companies such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST) are also big players in the sector.

53,CAT,"UPDATE 4-Emerson warns of slowing U.S., European economies"," * U.S., European economies ‘clearly slowed’ in June, July   * Three-month orders up 10 pct-15 pct   * Shares down 6.3 pct  (Adds analyst and shareholder comment, updates shares)   By Nick Zieminski   NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) warned on Wednesday that U.S. and European economies have “clearly slowed” in the past two months and said order growth moderated, sending its shares down 6.7 percent to their lowest level since September.   Consumer and discretionary spending remain weak and industrial markets are slowing, Emerson said, citing Europe’s debt crisis and the U.S. budget impasse that is threatening a potential debt default as soon as next week.   Shares of Emerson fell $3.38 to $50.67 in late morning trade. Other industrial shares were lower across the board. Rival Rockwell Automation (ROK.N) fell 3.1 percent ahead of its earnings report due Thursday.   Large European industrials were also down after the news. Shares of Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) were down 3 percent, those of Switzerland’s ABB Ltd (ABB.NS) were down 3 percent and France’s Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA) was off 4 percent.   “We have seen a definite weakening of general business activity in June and July,” Emerson management said in a regulatory filing. “U.S. and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft-patch and it remains unclear if they will improve much in the second half of the calendar year.”   Emerson reported total orders up 10 percent to 15 percent in the three months to June, down from the 15 percent pace in the three months to May. A boost from the weak U.S. dollar contributed about 7 percentage points to the growth.   Emerson’s warning was the most strongly-worded commentary on a second-half slowdown from any U.S. industrial company so far this earnings season.   Emerson’s Chief Executive Dave Farr, widely respected among industrial analysts and investors for his often blunt, no-nonsense opinions, earlier this year warned that inflation was not going away and could stay high for two or three years.   Emerson said on Wednesday its industrial-related businesses are still strong, but added:   “We expect them eventually to soften due to the generally poor economic environment (the negative budget discourse in Washington D.C. and ongoing European debt crisis) and weakening trends,” Emerson said in its monthly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   Its orders showed slower growth in its industrial automation and network power segments, though orders remained high in its process management segment that serves energy and other process industries.   A weak U.S. housing market hurt Emerson’s climate technologies market, where orders were flat to down 5 percent.   Several analysts said next year’s profit forecasts for Emerson will come down.   A slowdown in the climate unit was expected, given weak demand from makers of air conditioners, said Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan, but now growth rates in the process and industrial automation businesses are also moderating. He said Emerson’s macro economic comments were the most blunt he had seen in recent weeks.   “Emerson’s management team has their finger on the pulse of the global economy pretty well,” O’Callaghan said. “Their upfront statement is sending a message about a broader slowdown.”   O’Callaghan estimates Emerson’s 2012 earnings at $3.75 per share. Some Wall Street analysts forecast earnings as high as $4 next year.   “This is a report that will put risk into consensus and especially the bullish estimates,” he said. “It sets the stage for an interesting conference call from the CEO, Dave Farr.”   Emerson shares, which typically trade at a premium to its peers, are down about 18 percent from their February 52-week high but had rebounded in recent weeks in anticipation of a strong profit report next Tuesday.   U.S. industrial shares have lagged the wider S&P 500 index this month and year-to-date, according to Standard & Poor’s. In 2010, only the consumer discretionary sector posted bigger gains than manufacturing stocks.   S&P analysts recommend the sector, saying the global economy is gradually improving and industrial stocks are increasingly exposed to robust emerging markets and benefiting from the deep cost cuts made during the 2008-2009 downturn.   Several multinational manufacturers report monthly sales or orders data, including Caterpillar (CAT.N), Illinois Tool Works (ITW.N) and tool maker Kennametal (KMT.N), offering a glimpse into future revenues and the direction of economic cycles.   Emerson’s orders bottomed as the U.S. recession ended in mid-2009. They peaked in late 2010 and have been trending lower so far this year.   St. Louis-based Emerson is scheduled to report quarterly results next Tuesday. Analysts expect it to earn 91 cents a share, up from 78 cents a year ago, and forecast a 13-percent rise in sales to $6.4 billion.   Confirmation of a U.S. industrial slowdown came in Wednesday’s durable goods report, which came in well short of economists’ forecasts. New orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell unexpectedly in June, weighed down by weak receipts for transportation equipment.   (For a graphic, see r.reuters.com/xuh82s )   Wednesday’s warning presents an opportunity for investors to buy a high-quality stock, said Catherine Maniscalco Avery, President and CEO of CAIM LLC, which owns Emerson stock.   Emerson “did a phenomenal job in the whole financial crisis,” she said. It has raised dividends for 53 years in a row, generates strong cash flow, and has low debt.   “They’re managing expectations, which is what we want.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Additional reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Dave Zimmerman and Tim Dobbyn)   ",7272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/emerson/update-4-emerson-warns-of-slowing-u-s-european-economies-idUSN1E76Q04X20110727

55,CAT,"Debt crisis strains banks, threatens consumers","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The crisis over raising the debt ceiling may have been manufactured by politicians, as many on Wall Street charge, but its effect on consumers and the broader economy is likely to prove very real.  Fear that Congress may not raise the government’s $14.3 trillion legal borrowing limit by August 2, inviting a credit rating downgrade or default, has already made it more costly for banks and companies to borrow short-term money.  If that persists, consumers and small businesses may also find it harder to access credit. Those who can get loans will likely pay more for them. Companies, meanwhile, are hardly likely to ramp up hiring if funding costs are on the rise.  That’s just about the last thing the U.S. economy needs after it grew at a plodding 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter and produced nearly flat growth in the first quarter.  “What this debt ceiling debate has done has created an unintended tightening,” said Jim Caron, head of interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley. “It’s given providers of capital another reason not to lend.”  Congress has refused to raise the debt ceiling without a long-term deficit reduction plan. With the August 2 deadline looming, Republicans and Democrats had yet to agree on spending cuts and tax increases.  “If it’s dragged out, that would be the point where it hurts the consumer. We could see companies hoarding cash out of uncertainty,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, fixed income analyst at 4Cast Ltd in New York.  Most on Wall Street think Treasury will avoid defaulting on its debt and will come up with a way to meet interest payments due in early August.  But lenders are taking no chances. Rates on $91 billion of Treasury bills due August 4, the first to mature after the August 2 deadline, spiked to 28 basis points on Friday, the highest rate the bills have paid since they were issued in February.  Analysts say money market funds have been increasingly wary of holding such bills or lending against them in the repurchase, or repo market, where large Wall Street banks raise short-term funds.  The funds themselves, large providers of short-term loans, have lost $37.5 billion in withdrawals in the latest week as investors, worried about their exposure to Treasuries, have sought safety in traditional bank accounts. That means they need to keep more cash on hand to meet further redemptions.  Unlike deposit accounts, money market funds are not insured. In 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund imploded after plowing more than 1 percent of assets in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. When the bank collapsed, the fund suffered a flood of redemptions.  The worst case scenario for markets and consumers would be a rerun of 2008, when Lehman’s failure caused credit to seize up across the globe and brought world markets to the edge of collapse. The U.S. economy fell into its worst recession since World War Two.  Most analysts think that’s not likely this time.  Yet even if the country avoids default, a downgrade from at least one of the big three credit ratings agencies is increasingly likely.  That could force banks to pay more to finance short-term loans with Treasuries and could ratchet up the borrowing costs for companies in the commercial paper market.  If it costs General Motors or General Electric more to borrow in short-term markets, “they will pass that on to the consumer” looking for a car or appliance loan, said Roseanne Briggen, analyst at IFR, a unit of Thomson Reuters.  Over time, it could also push up longer-term borrowing costs. Lawrence White, a professor at New York University, said Treasury yields could rise by a quarter percentage point over time, dragging up mortgages and student loan costs.  “It’s certainly not good news,” he told Reuters Insider. “Every quarter percentage point matters in a weak economy.  One saving grace may be that firms have cut back reliance on commercial paper markets after getting burned when Lehman Brothers failed.  At the close of the second quarter, GE Capital, a unit of General Electric had $40.7 billion in commercial paper outstanding, down from $105 billion in early 2008.  That move away from short-term borrowing is one reason the largest U.S. conglomerate has made its peace with having lost its once-coveted “AAA” credit rating in 2009.  It has also vastly boosted the amount of cash it holds on its books over that time. At the quarter’s end, the largest U.S. conglomerate had about $91 billion in cash on hand, up from $16 billion at the start of the financial crisis.  “With $90 billion in cash, we’re prepared for a liquidity disruption if there were one,” Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin said in a July 22 interview. “It’s just a dramatically different liquidity profile for the company.”  Caterpillar Inc, which has a smaller finance arm that is focused on financing purchases of the company’s heavy equipment, had about $4 billion in commercial paper outstanding at the close of the first quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

57,CAT,U.S. business hopes debt deal clears way for trade,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling after weeks of tough talks between the White House and Congress has raised hope leaders will now turn their attention to resolving difference blocking three long-delayed trade deals, U.S. business groups said on Monday.  “It would be good if we can start those wheels turning before (lawmakers) go away” for their month-long August recess, said Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, whose members include major exporters such as Boeing and Caterpillar.  The ugly negotiations over raising the debt ceiling and cutting the huge budget deficit occupied most of the White House and congressional leaders’ time in July, blocking work on a deal to move the trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to Congress for votes.  But now that it looks like Congress will approve a debt agreement, “I think there’s a very strong desire to come together and work out something” on the trade accords, said Bill Morley, president of Altrius Group, which lobbies on behalf of the American Chamber of Commerce in Colombia.  Morley said he hoped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell would “lay out a framework” for action in September on the pacts and a worker retraining program known as Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).  That would give South Korea, Colombia and Panama some reassurance that years of U.S. delay in passing the agreement are nearly over, he said.  However, congressional aides said it was unclear whether such an announcement would come.  There have been “productive” talks with leaders in the House of Representatives and the Senate, but “there is not an agreement on a path forward,” a Senate Democratic aide said.  The administration expects the three pacts to boost exports by about $13 billion, helping to create or support about 70,000 jobs and giving the U.S. economy a much-needed lift.  The deals were all signed during the administration of former President George W. Bush. However, they languished because of strong opposition from Democrats, who controlled the House of Representative from 2006 through 2010.  Frank Vargo, vice president at the National Association of Manufacturers, said his group estimates American workers would have earned $12 billion more in wages and benefits over the past several years had the pacts not been delayed.  Unless the debt deal falls apart and “turns everything upside down ... I am optimistic for the trade agreements in September,” Vargo said.  President Barack Obama’s administration has negotiated a number of side agreements to address Democratic Party concerns about the pacts and had hoped to win congressional approval of the deals before the August break.  But Republicans strongly objected to a White House plan to include an extension of TAA in the implementing agreement for the South Korean pact. Many party members question the value of the nearly 50-year-old retraining program for workers who have lost their jobs because of foreign competition.  Last week, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said the administration was open to a separate vote on TAA and hoped a deal could be reached soon to clear the way for it and the trade deals to be approved in September.  Timothy Keeler, a lawyer at Mayer Brown and former U.S. trade official, said that target was more likely now that the administration has reconsidered its plan to include TAA in the legislation for the Korea pact.  The most likely way forward is for the Senate to start by debating and approving TAA, as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp outlined last week, Keeler said.  Once that has been done, Obama would submit the free trade agreements to Congress and the House would begin action on the pacts along with TAA, he said.

Morley said he hoped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell would “lay out a framework” for action in September on the pacts and a worker retraining program known as Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).   That would give South Korea, Colombia and Panama some reassurance that years of U.S. delay in passing the agreement are nearly over, he said.

62,CAT,US business urges big changes in WTO trade talks," * Doha round said “incapable” of reaching good conclusion   * Manufacturers urge new “business model” for WTO talks   By Doug Palmer   WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - With U.S. economic growth nearly stalled and unemployment stuck above 9 percent, Caterpillar’s (CAT.N) man in Washington, Bill Lane, has been pitching what many think is a crazy idea: one more try to reach a big market-opening deal through the World Trade Organization.   Facing a panel last week of top trade lobbyists for the U.S. manufacturing, services and farm sectors, Lane warned that countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe were striking new trade deals at much faster pace than the United States.   “We’re being disadvantaged not because of protectionism but because they’re embracing trade liberalization in a much more aggressive form than the U.S. The only way we can leapfrog what’s going on ... is to do something bold and do something bold through the WTO (World Trade Organization),” Lane said.   It was a rousing call for resuscitating the all-but dead Doha round of global trade talks, which the United States helped launch in the capital of Qatar just two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks.   But these days it is hard to get cheers in Washington for the epic-length talks. Lane’s friends and colleagues, as much as they would welcome a global deal to open new markets to U.S. exports, essentially told him there was no hope.   “The WTO, for services, holds no promise,” said Bob Vastine, president of the Coalition of Service Industries. “It’s a vehicle incapable of delivering the goods.”   “The premise that a breakthrough idea is possible in Geneva is not borne out by the facts,” said Scott Miller, director of global trade policy for consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG.N). “It’s hard to find ambition in Geneva.”   In four months, the 153 members of the WTO will gather in Geneva to try chart a new path for the Doha negotiations.   Caterpillar has benefited mightily from trade reforms and the construction equipment giant has been at the forefront of efforts to push long-stalled U.S. free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama through the U.S. Congress.   But many U.S. business groups have soured on the Doha round, seeing it now as more of an obstacle to trade liberalization than an opportunity for export growth.   They complain the never-ending talks have kept the WTO from moving on to other more promising projects.   “Nobody wanted a deal to slash trade barriers more” than the National Association of Manufacturers, said Frank Vargo, the group’s vice president for international economic affairs.   “(But) the Doha round has failed miserably in generating new market access that we want for ourselves and other countries,” he said.   Last month, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, a former chief U.S. trade negotiator, criticized the United States for not showing more leadership in the talks.   But Vargo and other panel members at the discussion put the blame on major emerging countries such as China, Brazil and India for refusing to offer deep enough tariff cuts to create new export opportunities for the United States.   Those concessions are needed to persuade Congress to cut U.S. farm subsidies and remaining high U.S. tariffs in areas such as textiles and trucks, the businessmen said.   In the services negotiations, “the offers on the table (from major developing countries) offer virtually no new commercial advantage,” Vastine said.   “Why are we wasting our time? Let’s find other venues,” Vastine said, such as the proposed TransPacific Partnership between the United States and eight other countries.   Others said putting the WTO back on track as a venue to negotiate new market openings required changes in the conduct of the  multilateral trade talks.   “The Doha round is committed to a strategy that may not work any more,” Miller said, arguing the WTO should shift from its focus on a wide-ranging deal involving all 153 members to smaller agreements with fewer countries.   Vargo agreed, saying the Doha round’s governing principle that nothing is resolved until everything is resolved has in effect prevented any agreement.   WTO members should also “look at moving away from universal MFN (most-favored nation),” Vargo said, referring to the long-established principle that all WTO members provide each other the same degree of market access.   Abandoning MFN would allow groups of WTO members to strike deals to liberalize trade in a particular services or manufacturing sector, but bar countries that don’t want to open their own markets from benefiting from the pact.

63,CAT,COLUMN-Tax gateways to India: David Cay Johnston," The author is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.   By David Cay Johnston   SINGAPORE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The equatorial island nations of Mauritius and Singapore are competing for the role of preferred gateway for foreign investments into India and other Asian countries.   Think of it as a triangle, not of love, but of lucre.   Companies and rich investors use gateway countries so they can earn profits in such places as India, China and Indonesia. Favorable tax treaties let them send dividends and other payments to such places as Mauritius and Singapore while paying little or no tax. The United States can even provide such benefits under some of its tax treaties.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   U.S. companies with subsidiaries in Mauritius, Singapore:   r.reuters.com/fag23s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   These treaties are sold to the public as vital to avoiding double taxation of the same money and thus encouraging cross-border investments. Countries with tax treaties that enable lightly taxed or tax-free profits can benefit if their rules require local work by accountants, bankers, executives, investment bankers and lawyers, who earn high pay and require little in government services.   But just as tax laws can be drafted to fashion loopholes, so too can tax treaties.   One of the biggest loopholes involves what is commonly known as “black money” and a circular movement of capital known as “round tripping.”   Black money refers to capital that is being hidden, sometimes from the tax authorities and sometimes from partners, litigants, estranged spouses or even criminals such as loan sharks or drug dealers.   Round tripping involves getting the money out of one country, say India, sending it to a place like Mauritius and then, dressed up to look like foreign capital, sending it back home to earn tax-favored profits.   The problem for the home country is that native profits escape taxation this way. And instead of foreign capital flowing into the country, local capital just gets a free ride.   While the principles are simple, the mechanics of getting black money to a favored tax treaty partner can be the financial equivalent of a Rube Goldberg machine, only this is no complex contraption that ultimately turns on a toaster or opens a door. Instead, cash moves out of the country in seemingly nonsensical ways designed to throw off auditors or anyone else trying to follow the money. Once the cash is safely out of the mother country, it’s easy to place it in a jurisdiction with a favorable tax treaty and to use a shell company to send the money back home so profits become tax-free or taxed at very low rates.   Under a tax treaty signed 28 years ago, Mauritius has been the gateway country of choice for foreign investment in India. Companies like Caterpillar (CAT.N), the maker of earth-moving equipment, as well as Bank of America (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) invest in India via subsidiaries in Mauritius.   As the Indian economy has begun to take off — thanks to a mixture of high tech, manufacturing and call centers — seemingly foreign money has been pouring into India. Since the turn of the millennium about US$55 billion has come via shell companies set up in Mauritius. This is more than 40 percent of the direct foreign investment in India.   Tax authorities in New Delhi believe a lot of that investment was black money from India making a roundtrip to Mauritius. Overall the Indian Finance Ministry estimates faux foreign direct investments from Mauritius are costing it $600 million in taxes annually.   India is not alone in its suspicions. Indonesia terminated its tax treaty with Mauritius in 2005, convinced that its government treasury, or fisc, was under assault from round tripping of Indonesian black money.   In India, a series of scandals, tax audits and investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation, India’s anti-corruption agency, have strained the once intimate financial relationship with Mauritius.   And just as the two partners were sparring, along came Singapore, eager to show it can be a more faithful partner by acting as a tax-favored conduit for real foreign investment in India and not round tripping.   Singapore boasts that it does not allow shell companies, but rather wants a real economic presence. It puts the standard for that at S$200,000 a year spent running a Singapore office. That is a mere drop in a bucket of money, but as with perfume and love triangles, a drop may be all it takes to turn an already disaffected partner’s head.   While India has a reputation for letting legal issues drag on for years, it started talking publicly about a tax treaty with Singapore last year and the two signed an agreement in June. Whether the treaty will actually deter round tripping remains to be seen, but on paper it looks better for India than the Mauritius treaty.   Mauritius has for several years dallied on negotiating a new tax treaty with India. But the speed with which India moved to embrace Singapore clearly motivated Mauritius to pay more attention to its longtime partner.   This past week officials in Port Louis and Delhi spoke of a new agreement being almost at hand. But then that is often how it goes in triangles, when one party is unsure of whether to stick it out with the old partner or move on to a new one.

The monthly Architecture Billings Index fell to 45.1 last month, a 1.2-point drop that was its steepest since February 2010, the American Institute of Architects said on Wednesday. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction in billings by architects, whose revenue projects construction activity over the next six to nine months.  “Business conditions for architecture firms have turned down sharply,” said Kermit Baker, the group’s chief economist. “Late last year and in the first couple of months of this year there was a sense that we were slowly pulling out of the downturn, but now the concern is that we haven’t yet reached the bottom of the cycle.”  By region, the Midwest was weakest, while the South was strongest. By sector, demand was weakest for multifamily residential buildings and strongest for commercial and industrial sites.  “The steep decline in the ABI since February suggests that the nonresidential construction recovery struggles to gain traction,” said J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan, noting that the sector may not recover until next year or later.  Weak construction activity for both commercial properties and homes has depressed demand for building components including elevators, air conditioners and electrical systems as well as contributing to high unemployment in the construction trades.

U.S. stocks struggled to end barely higher, while gold, a traditional safe haven, hit a third consecutive all-time high near $1,900 after staging its biggest weekly gain in 2-1/2 years last week.  Sharp volatility in stocks, which has marked trading in recent weeks, underscored investor nervousness.  The turmoil largely reflects persistent worries that the United States may fall back into recession, as well as the threat that sovereign debt problems in euro zone peripheral countries could spread to the larger economies.  The cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one another rose again, heading back toward their highest levels since late 2008 as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to European counterparts in the face of the intractable debt crisis.  “The ground zero of all worries is financials,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group.  Bank stocks, seen as most vulnerable to the debt crisis in Europe, underperformed other sectors. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) fell 2.7 percent to $33.41 and was the top drag on the Dow, followed by Bank of America (BAC.N), down 7.9 percent at $6.42.  Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his Friday speech at a central banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a new monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy.  That helped support stocks and gold but weigh on U.S. bond prices.  Bernanke, however, is most likely to outline gradualist measures, which would disappoint those looking for a big-bang approach such as a fresh round of bond buying, known as QE3.  The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bank could tweak the Fed’s balance sheet as a means to put further pressure on medium and long-term interest rates and anchor them at low levels. These could be implemented in September and October at coming Fed meetings.  “The Fed is definitely on people’s minds, and you could argue that some of the bounce seen in high-yield commodity currencies is at least in part related to hopes for more policy measures,” said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov in New York.

Gold prices rose, but were off record highs near $1,900 an ounce earlier in the day, and U.S. Treasuries fell.  The more than 1 percent bounce in U.S. stocks follows four weeks of losses. Gains were broad-based, with shares of Caterpillar (CAT.N) up 2.4 percent at $81.87.  Persistent worries that the sovereign debt crisis in euro zone peripheral countries may spread to the larger economies in the region have kept investors on edge.  The cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one another rose again on Monday, heading back toward their highest levels since late 2008, as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to European counterparts in the face of the intractable debt crisis. For details, see [ID:nL5E7JM1B5]  Brent crude fell by more than a dollar as investors anticipated the resumption of oil exports from OPEC-member Libya. U.S. crude oil CLc1, however, rose less than $1 a barrel.  ""Brent is taking more of a battering but that's only to be expected,"" said Christopher Bellew, a trader at Jefferies Bache. ""The divergence is just another graphic example of the dislocation between (U.S. crude) WTI and Brent.""  The potential for a restart of Libyan oil flows into the market if the Gaddafi regime collapses weighed on the benchmark oil price. If Libyan production comes back it would ease gasoline prices, potentially boosting economies worldwide as disposable income increased.

78,CAT,Irene could lift machinery and engineering shares,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Heavy equipment makers and rental companies stand to benefit from reconstruction efforts after Irene damaged roads and other infrastructure, took out power to millions of homes and flooded businesses.  U.S. industrial shares were higher in the first trading day after Hurricane Irene passed over the northeastern United States, outperforming the broader stock market.  “Anytime something needs to get rebuilt, it’s good for construction equipment, good for people that rent it, make it, obviously,” said Langenberg & Co analyst Brian Langenberg.  He said makers of electrical distribution transformers will be winners as power lines are restored, naming Cooper Industries CBE.N, SPX Corp SPW.N and ABB ABBN.VX.  Oshkosh Corp (OSK.N), Terex Corp (TEX.N) and Manitowoc should do well, he said.  For engineering and construction companies, such as Quanta Services Inc (PWR.N) and Pike Electric PIKE.N, the boost to demand will depend in large measure on their geographic mix. Some are more exposed to parts of the United States that were not affected by Irene.  National distributors such as Watsco Inc (WSO.N) and W.W. Grainger (GWW.N) will also get a pop, Langenberg said, but he added that Monday’s stock gains were driven more by macro-economic factors than reaction to possible storm-related business.  “People are starting to realize we’re not actually going to have a global rollover in the economy,” Langenberg said, adding that the damage from Irene was not nearly as bad as that from Katrina, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005.  For a huge global company like Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), any added sales will be small relative to the size of the company. As equipment fleets are used more intensely, the need to replace them with new machines will be incrementally stronger. Such fleets are aging anyway, since the recession made many users reluctant to replace expensive bulldozers and the like.  Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets said Generac Holdings Inc (GNRC.N) could benefit from a spike in demand for portable generators. Watsco stands to gain from repair and replacement of heating and cooling systems.  Equipment rental companies and portable storage providers could be winners, according to KeyBanc. These include United Rentals (URI.N), RSC Holdings RRR.N and H&E Equipment Services (HEES.O). If more people need temporary storage, as they did after recent Mississippi flooding, Mobile Mini (MINI.O) could benefit.  “This was about as widely predicted a storm event as has occurred in some years,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners.  There was a lot of forward buying at Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N), as well as Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), which sells outdoor power equipment. Johnson described brisk sales of generators, plywood, batteries, buckets, mops, tape and chainsaws before the storm.  Lowe’s said Emergency Command Center is fully activated. It has moved more than 1,000 inbound loads to Distribution Centers or directly to stores.  Products in high demand are batteries, flashlights, bottled water, generators, wheel barrows, temporary fencing, ladders and other goods. Lowe’s said it adheres to a policy of not raising prices in the event of an extreme natural disaster.  A number of publicly traded storage real estate investment trusts (REITs) could see a temporary benefit, if history is any guide. Extra Space Storage (EXR.N), U-Store-It YSI.N, Sovran Self Storage SSS.N and Public Storage (PSA.N) are prominent names in this area.  About a third of Extra Space Storage properties and customers were located in Irene’s path, said spokesman Clint Halverson. While it is too early to gauge demand from Irene, the self-storage operator typically sees an increase in demand after a hurricane from two sources.  The first is from people who move into the area, such as contractors, to help with the cleanup.  “On the other side, we see increased demand from homeowners that have to get their stuff out while they rebuild and reestablish and get things fixed,” Halverson said.  Existing tenants also usually end up staying longer, he said. The company on Monday was evaluating both Irene-inflicted damage to its own properties and renter demand changes.

79,CAT,Wall Street gains as Fed minutes boost stimulus bets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose for a third straight day on Tuesday in a volatile session, after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting boosted expectations the U.S. central bank will act again to stimulate the economy.  Equities surged near the close of the market, though they quickly pared gains, after the release of the Fed’s August 9 minutes showed the central bank had considered bold steps to help the fledgling economy.  News earlier in the day showing consumer confidence fell to its worst level in two years cemented the growing belief the Fed will have to intervene with aggressive steps when it meets in late September. Many market participants had thought that the odds of more action from the Fed were slim.  “The Fed has recognized that economic conditions may warrant more aggressive actions, which gives hope to the prospect that something will be forthcoming at the next meeting that will provide more to goose risk assets,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia  “At the same time, there’s still enough doubt about whether we should expect anything to not want to make the trade,” added Luschini, who helps oversee $53 billion in assets under management.  Equities fell as much as 1 percent in the morning after the Conference Board, an industry group, reported consumer confidence crumbled in August to its lowest level in more than two years due in part to fallout from political wrangling over a budget deal.  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N) were among the top boosts to the Dow. Boeing was upgraded to “neutral” by Nomura, which see improved profits from the company’s 737 and 777 plane programs. Caterpillar rose 1.9 percent to $89.79, while Boeing gained 2.2 percent to $65.99.  The market has suffered from a long bout of selling for the better part of August, falling nearly 18 percent from its 2011 high in April to a recent low, though it has risen for six of the last seven sessions.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 20.39 points, or 0.18 percent, at 11,559.64. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 2.80 points, or 0.23 percent, at 1,212.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 14.00 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,576.11.  The rebound into positive territory was seen as a sign recent selling was overdone. Technical analysts pointed to Monday’s S&P close above 1,200 as a sign bulls may be regaining their footing. The S&P has risen more than 7 percent over the past seven sessions but remains 6.1 percent lower for August.  Financials were the day’s big losers, with Bank of America (BAC.N) off 3.2 percent to $8.12 and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) down 1.5 percent at $37.06. Both firms are Dow components.  In other data, single-family home prices fell slightly in June as the market crawled along at depressed levels.  Dow component Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) fell 0.3 percent to $73.91. The company and state-owned Russian peer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) will develop oil and gas reserves in the Russian Arctic.

83,CAT,UPDATE 1-China Citic Bank unveils jumbo CNH bond offer," * Total offer of 30 bln yuan unlikely to be in single tranche   * More issuers seen after recent policy moves to boost market   (Adds background)	   By Soo Ai Peng	   SHANGHAI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - China Citic Bank Corp Ltd   plans to sell up to $4.7 billion in offshore yuan-denominated bonds by 2013, indicating that issuers are lining up to sell debt in the territory after the authorities unveiled fresh reforms this month.	   While Chinese banks have long been issuers of short-dated paper in this market in the form of certificates of deposit, the bond deals point to a growing ability of the offshore yuan market in Hong Kong to absorb large sizes.	   Citic did not say in how many tranches it would sell the bonds, although analysts said it was likely to be multiple rather than a single tranche issue.	   The lender’s board of directors had approved a debt programme totalling 30 billion yuan consisting of maturities of no more than five years, it said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange late on Monday.     	   The funds raised would be channeled into its loan business and other corporate activity, it said.	   Citic’s announcement comes days after China’s Ministry of Finance sold 20 billion yuan ($3.13 billion) of offshore bonds, the biggest renminbi-denominated deal ever and as Vice-Premier Li Keqiang unveiled fresh measures to boost the growth of the CNH market.	   More Chinese companies will be allowed to issue so-called ‘dim-sum’ bonds, rather than only financial institutions and foreign companies previously.	   Beijing also plans to create a transparent framework to remit yuan bonds to China, a departure from its current policy of allowing remittances on a case-by-case basis, a policy that will give a shot in the arm to the growing line of issuers.  	   Demand for yuan exposure in Hong Kong, where renminbi in bank deposits far outstrip the amount of assets available, and expectations that Beijing will allow a more rapid appreciation of its currency have helped boost the CNH market.	   As of late-August, 112 billion yuan ($17.55 billion) worth of dim sum bonds had been issued in 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data, nearly three times the amount issued in the whole of 2010.  	   Big-name foreign borrowers, including the World Bank, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), McDonald’s Corp and Caterpillar Inc , have sold dim-sum bonds joining mainland and Hong Kong issuers.

84,CAT,Wall Street ends worst month in year on upbeat note,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed out the worst month in more than a year on an up note on Wednesday, with sharp gains in the last several days still not enough to repair the damage from a U.S. credit downgrade and fears of a slide back into recession.  Sentiment turned dramatically in recent days on expectations the Federal Reserve will again intervene to support the economy. With Wednesday’s gains, the Dow was back in positive territory for 2011.  Banks led a late-day surge on Wednesday, helping to extend a four-day rally, followed by industrial shares. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) rose 1.3 percent to $37.56 while Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) was up 1.3 percent at $91.00.  Minutes from the most recent Fed policymakers’ meeting released on Tuesday that indicated several Fed members favored more monetary easing bolstered the appetite for equities.  “The market has been somewhat schizophrenic lately, but the idea of more stimulus lets you put a rosy spin on everything,” said Steve Sosnick, equity-risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.  “Our rally has quieted down since the data wasn’t great this morning, and we still don’t know if that kind of weakness will be enough to trigger ‘extraordinary action’ from the Fed,” he said.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, at an annual Fed conference in Wyoming last week, said the U.S. central bank’s scheduled meeting in September would run for two days instead of the planned one to mull options for additional monetary stimulus.  Data on hiring by private employers in August and factory activity in the U.S. Midwest released on Wednesday showed some signs of weakening growth.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI finished up 53.58 points, or 0.46 percent, at 11,613.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 5.97 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,218.89.

The deal relieves any concerns that the drilling business would cause Joy Global to lose its focus on mining operations at a time when Caterpillar Inc , which bought Bucyrus, is building its dominance in the $40 billion mining gear market.	   Joy Global said the LeTourneau unit sale will help it to complete its acquisition of China-based International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd .	   U.S.-based Joy Global, which has purchased 18 percent of IMM shares on the open market so far, has plans to buy an initial 41 percent stake in the company for $585 million to expand in China’s fast-growing coal market. 	   UBS machinery analyst Henry Kirn said investors would like  Joy Global’s LeTourneau drilling unit deal.	   Shares of Joy Global, which shed 13 percent of their value since its IMM deal announcement in mid-July, touched a near one-month high of $88.45 in Wednesday morning trade on Nasdaq.	   The divestiture of the LeTourneau drilling business represents Joy Global’s 2010 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) multiple of 11.6 times, above the multiple of 10 times it paid for LeTourneau in total, Kirn wrote on a note to clients.	   Joy Global acquired LeTourneau International from Rowan Co  for $1.1 billion in May.	   Joy global on Wednesday posted market-beating third-quarter earnings, while raising its 2011 outlook on strong bookings.	   Joy Global said its total bookings for the quarter ended July 29 rose 49 percent to $1.4 billion. Surface mining equipment bookings almost doubled to $732.1 million.	   For 2011, Joy Global now expects earnings of $5.70-$6.00 a share, on revenue of $4.3-$4.5 billion, up from its prior outlook of earnings of $5.30-$5.60 a share on revenue of $4.1-$4.3 billion.	   The outlook is driven by continued improvement in operational efficiencies, investments in LeTourneau and IMM and commodity and energy fundamentals that remain intact, JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan wrote in a note to clients.	   “Capex increases in 2010 and 2011 have returned customer capital expenditures to 2008 levels, and further increases are expected in 2012,” the company said in a statement.	   Joy Global said it sees a “real” possibility of some slowing of demand growth going forward, but do not expect the macro concerns to lead to a major market correction.

89,CAT,"Doha not working, new approach needed - U.S. official"," * US addresses Cairns farm export group   * WTO members to meet in December on Doha talks   By Rod Nickel   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Attempts by the World Trade Organisation to broker a sweeping liberalization of world trade won’t succeed without a new approach at December’s WTO meetings in Geneva, a U.S. trade official said on Thursday.   Ambassador Michael Punke, speaking to the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries in the Western Canadian province of Saskatchewan, said WTO countries should admit the 10-year-old Doha round of talks hasn’t worked.   “For us, it is clear that what WTO members are doing today in the Doha negotiations - indeed what we have been doing for at least the past three years - is not working,” Punke, the deputy United States trade representative said.   “In the weeks between now and December, the United States will be highly skeptical of any proposal that assumes we can fix our problems by rearranging the deck chairs,” he said.   The Doha Round of WTO negotiations began in 2001 with the aim of reforming international trade by lowering trade barriers and revising trade rules.   However, the negotiations have become bogged down as participating countries have been unable to agree on ways to achieve that.   The Cairns Group, consisting of 19 member countries but not the United States, is meeting to brainstorm ways of resolving the Doha impasse. But Punke said WTO members should instead admit Doha hasn’t worked and start looking at other steps.   “The problem, in our view, is profoundly substantive ... The world has changed and WTO members have starkly different views about the implications of that change,” Punke said.   Punke’s comments come as U.S. business interests have debated whether a broad trade breakthrough is possible through the WTO.   In mid-summer, construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT.N) called for a bold trade breakthrough via the WTO, but the Coalition of Service Industries said the organisation is incapable of getting the job done. [ID:nN1E77119I]   A Cairns Group source told Reuters this week that developing countries like China and India have not offered sufficient market access to foreign manufacturers that would entice the United States and European Union to lower their rich farm subsidies - a key target of the Doha talks.   Efforts to resolve the impasse come as many economies are struggling to recover, Punke noted.   Cairns meetings wrap up on Friday. The group’s members, who include Canada, Australia, Brazil, Argentina and other countries, represent more than one-quarter of the world’s agricultural trade.

The company is following a small but growing number of Western multinationals into the so-called “dim sum” market.   The amount raised — 1.75 billion yuan ($274 million) — is relatively small, but Air Liquide said it marked a diversification of funding sources and showed international investor confidence in the group.   “The bond proceeds will contribute to the financing of the development of Air Liquide’s activities in China,” the company said. It employs more than 3,500 staff and operates more than 40 plants in China, a market that helped buoy its first-half 2011 results despite Japan’s earthquake and turmoil in North Africa. [ID:nLDE77001W]   As of July, only five foreign multinationals had tapped the “dim sum” market: McDonald’s (MCD.N), Caterpillar (CAT.N), Unilever (UNc.AS), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Fonterra.

The dichotomy in the makeup of the workforce is threatening U.S. and Canadian competitiveness, Caterpillar CEO Doug Oberhelman said.  “We cannot find qualified hourly production people, and for that matter many technical, engineering service technicians, and even welders, and it is hurting our manufacturing base in the United States,” he told a business audience at the Spruce Meadows equestrian facility outside Calgary.  “The education system in the United States basically has failed them and we have to retrain every person we hire.”  Obama, seeking to rescue the U.S. economy, announced a $447 billion job creation plan on Thursday.  The White House sees the plan, a mix of payroll tax cuts and spending to upgrade roads, bridges and school buildings, as the best hope for reducing the 9.1 percent U.S. unemployment rate, which Obama called a “national crisis”.  Oberhelman said the service technician shortage is hurting Caterpillar’s dealers as well.  “These things have pretty sophisticated instruments and we have to train for that. I would hope our education system could help and make up for some of that,” he said. “Today it’s several thousands shortage of those technicians for us around the world. It’s acute.”  Oberhelman said it is too early to tell if the United States or Europe is heading for another recession.  “Certainly the storm clouds have thickened a bit,” he said.

94,CAT,Indonesian miner ABM Investama plans $300 mln Oct IPO-regulator," JAKARTA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Indonesian coal miner ABM Investama will sell 20 percent of its enlarged capital in an October initial public offering, a regulator said on Monday, seen raising up to $300 million in the fourth planned offering by a miner in Jakarta this year.	   The Hamami family, which controls the miner, will not include its crown jewel Trakindo Utama, the sole authorised Indonesian dealer for heavy equipment maker Caterpillar , in the offering, cutting its appeal to investors, sources said.	   “The company will use 67 percent of the funds for capital expenditure and acquisitions,” said Gonthor Ryantori Aziz, a director at capital market regulator Bapepam-LK, confirming the plan.	   Aziz said the company plans to sell 550.6 million new shares in late October.	   An ABM spokeswoman declined to comment on the IPO plan.	   A source familiar with the firm’s operations said the miner is expected to produce 1.5 million tonnes of thermal coal this year, increasing to 3 million tonnes next year, making it a small player compared to the country’s leading miner Bumi Resources’ 67 million tonnes of coal output.	   Sources said bankers had been pitching for the owners to include Trakindo Utama, which is a rival of the country’s leading heavy equipment distributor United Tractors  that has a market cap of nearly $11 billion.	   “If they put Trakindo into the firm the demand would be huge, but unfortunately they didn’t and so the valuation will be smaller,” said one the sources, who declined to be identified because the details were not public.	   ABM Investama has appointed Morgan Stanley , Macquarie  and local brokerage Mandiri Sekuritas as its underwriters, the sources said.

A Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the automaker and the union agreed to continue discussions after the contract expires on Sept. 14 “in an effort to reach a tentative agreement that is in the best interest of both parties.”   UAW leadership has focused on making progress toward a quicker deal at GM and Chrysler, where workers are prohibited from striking under the terms of their 2009 bankruptcies.   At Ford, the only of the three Detroit automakers to have avoided a government-funded bankruptcy, a simmering grievance over the automakers decision to reinstate white-collar profit-sharing payouts will either be wrapped into a contract settlement or decided in arbitration set for later this week.   Jimmy Settles, UAW Vice President and lead negotiator with Ford, told Ford workers about the extension in a memo on Tuesday afternoon.   “As in years past, one company is chosen as the primary target for contract negotiations,” according to the memo obtained by Reuters. “This contract it will either be General Motors or Chrysler, but it will not be Ford Motor Company.”   In these talks, which will set wages and benefits for about 113,000 workers for the next four years, the companies are focused on keeping their labor costs down. The UAW is angling for more auto production jobs in the United States.   The talks are being watched by investors as an indication of how much Detroit has changed since the steep downturn and sharply tighter financing that almost forced GM and Chrysler out of business in late 2008.   Negotiating teams from the United Auto Workers union met into the night Monday at GM and Chrysler. Parallel talks between the UAW and GM and Chrysler in Detroit are expected to continue into the night Tuesday.   As of Tuesday afternoon, representatives of the GM council from local bargaining units had not yet been summoned to Detroit to review proposed contract terms, which must occur before a deal is presented to workers.   Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said the automaker and the UAW are not close to a deal but continue to target Wednesday night for completion of a tentative pact.   “The negotiations are not concluded and I don’t have a contract yet. We are not close,” Marchionne told reporters at an auto show in Frankfurt.   If the deadline is not met, the union and the company teams would have to agree to extend the current contracts, which is seen as a routine matter, labor analysts said.   GM has about 49,000 UAW-represented workers, Ford has about 41,000, and Chrysler, controlled by Italy’s Fiat SpA FIA.MI, has about 23,150.   GM, Chrysler and Ford have been working to narrow the gap on issues including the size of signing bonuses for workers once a new contract is ratified, the sources said.   GM started with a proposal for signing bonuses of around $3,500 per worker, equal to a cost of about $171 million for the automaker, the sources said. That proposed figure is based on amounts paid by other industrial companies such as Deere & Co (DE.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) in recent settlements with the UAW.   Analysts have said signing bonuses will likely be between $5,000 and $7,500 per worker.   GM’s willingness to consider even higher bonuses hinges on its ability to win concessions in other areas that would offset the higher up-front costs, other sources have said.   Chrysler has indicated that its signing bonuses should be lower than those paid to workers at the more profitable GM, a person close to the talks said.   Ford workers may get higher one-time payments than their GM and Chrysler counterparts if Ford and the union roll separate, pending grievances into a contract settlement. Ford workers have authorized a strike in local votes.   GM has been unwilling to add costs in the form of higher base wages that could widen its cost gap with rivals led by Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) or hurt it in a renewed downturn.

97,CAT,BUY OR SELL-U.S. industrial shares show profit pessimism," * Industrial stocks have lagged broader market   * Companies may soon start lowering outlooks   * Executives, some analysts still see strong growth   By Nick Zieminski   Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial stocks are flashing yellow, having lost a fifth of their value in the last two months in what some describe as a warning that another recession is looming.   The market is suggesting U.S. manufacturing multinationals may be poised to cut earnings estimates or ratchet down expectations for next year, as slowing economies and uncertainty over any resolution of Europe’s debt problems raise more questions about demand for high-value capital goods.   The Standard & Poor's Capital Goods index .GSPIC has fallen more than 20 percent since mid-July, when General Electric Co (GE.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), 3M Co (MMM.N) and other big manufacturers began reporting second-quarter results. That is a steeper decline than the broad S&P 500 index's .SPX 13 percent slide.   Even as the shares have sunk, management of top U.S. manufacturers and the Wall Street analysts that follow them have largely stood by profit targets that call for double-digit-percentage growth in the second half of the year.   Industrial distributor W.W. Grainger (GWW.N) said on Monday that August sales rose at the same pace as in July. Danaher Corp’s (DHR.N) chief executive officer said last week that he felt “very good” about the conglomerate’s third-quarter forecast.   This month will determine who is right — bullish managers or skittish investors — since September accounts for up to 45 percent of third-quarter sales. The companies will begin reporting their results in October.   Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan cut 2012 earnings estimates for a dozen manufacturing giants, including GE, Danaher, 3M and Tyco International TYC.N, to an average of 9 percent below consensus.   For some companies, such as Ingersoll Rand (IR.N) and SPX Corp SPW.N, his estimates are 17 percent below the Wall Street average. O’Callaghan also lowered the companies’ share-price targets. [ID:nWNAB5908]   His reasoning? Profit warnings are coming.   “Further slowing has yet to manifest itself via guidance cuts ... but will likely do so in coming months,” O’Callaghan said in a note to clients, adding price-to-earnings ratios have come down in anticipation of such cuts.   O’Callaghan said the stocks could do well if recession risks erode, but “that is still a big ‘if’ right now.”   Headwinds to 2012 forecasts include the European debt crisis; political gridlock in Washington; and the possibility that China’s efforts to curb inflation could slow its economy too much.   Stocks are pricing in not just a slowdown but an actual decline in earnings. Cooper Industries CBE.N, Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Dover Corp (DOV.N) and Eaton Corp (ETN.N) are trading at 10 or less times next year’s estimated earnings, only slightly above their multiples in the last recession.   Only financial stocks have fallen more steeply so far this year. Industrials were the second-best-performing sector in 2010 as the global recovery gained speed, but that recovery is increasingly in doubt, according to Standard & Poor’s.   Bulls point to healthy demand from markets like utilities and commercial aerospace. Home prices are stabilizing, and credit remains accessible to large companies. Some late-cycle markets, such as nonresidential construction, have yet to recover, but are unlikely to fall much further.   Some economists expect U.S. economic growth to accelerate next year. An index of U.S. factory activity in August came in above estimates and remains at a level that indicates expansion.   Still, electrical and multi-industry stocks trade at a discount to the S&P 500 index based on expected 2012 profits for the first time since the 2008-2009 recession: evidence that investors have lost confidence in Wall Street estimates.   “It’s goblins in people’s heads right now,” said analyst Nick Heymann of William Blair & Co. “The fear factor is casting a far, far bigger shadow on valuations than the fundamentals.”   Most companies are likely to meet forecasts when they report third-quarter results, said Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague. But they may start to talk down expectations about the fourth quarter and beyond while giving 2012 forecasts that are below Wall Street expectations.   “It feels like we’ve discounted a full-fledged recession, and the odds are that we might have some kind muddle-through, slow growth,” Sprague said. “There could be a pretty significant bounce-back if it turns out September was OK.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski in New York; Additional reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)   ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-manufacturing-outlook/buy-or-sell-u-s-industrial-shares-show-profit-pessimism-idUSS1E78C0GC20110914

99,CAT,"UPDATE 3-GE makes Russian push with energy, health ventures"," * Sees $10 bln to $15 bln in revenue over next few years   * Part of push to boost GE’s presence outside U.S.  (Adds interview with GE executive, details)   By Scott Malone   Sept 16 (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) formed two new joint ventures in Russia, in energy and healthcare, that the largest U.S. conglomerate said on Friday could generate $10 billion to $15 billion in new revenue over the next few years.   The move is part of a broad push by the world’s biggest maker of jet engines and electric turbines to expand its footprint in faster-growing economies outside its home market. GE expects to generate some 60 percent of its forecast $147.32 billion in 2011 revenue outside the United States.   Big markets including China, India and Russia have offered multinational companies including GE, United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) stronger growth opportunities as the U.S. and European economies have been sluggish. GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt on Thursday told reporters that growth in the United States was “decent” while the rest of the world was “fairly good.”   Russia in particular has rising demand for the sort of heavy equipment GE makes, said Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, the head of GE’s European and North Asian businesses.   “Russia is one of the fastest markets that we have, particularly when you are talking about building and rebuilding the infrastructure,” Beccalli-Falco said in a phone interview. “It is a market that needs energy, needs health care, needs transportation, needs several different technologies where we are leaders in the market.”   Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE signed a joint venture with Russian holding company Inter RAO IUES.MM and UEC to make gas turbines and another with conglomerate Russian Technologies to make CT-scan machines.   GE noted that the Russian government believes the country needs to invest about $80 billion in power production equipment  over the next decade and more than $30 billion through 2014 on healthcare.   The company has also used joint ventures as a way of speeding its growth in China, another fast-growing market where the government takes a strong hand in economic policy.   “In these kinds of markets it is always better to be in a joint venture rather than to be totally by yourself,” Beccalli-Falco said. “It is a formula which is a good, successful formula that we know how to deal with.”   GE said it will hold 50 percent stakes in each joint venture in Russia and “exercise operational control over the businesses.”   Inter RAO and UEC will each hold a 25 percent stake in the energy joint venture, while Russian Technologies will hold a 50 percent stake in the healthcare joint venture.   GE’s other recent moves to boost its presence outside the United States included relocating Vice Chairman John Rice to Hong Kong — a move the company said would speed decision-making outside the United States — and moving the management of its X-ray business to China.   GE shares were up 1.3 percent at $16.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.

100,CAT,Wall Street snaps winning streak on Europe uncertainty,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Monday but staged a late comeback after fears of a looming Greek debt default diminished on news of a possible deal to advance new bailout funds to Greece.  Stocks spent most the session sharply lower after European leaders disappointed investors by failing to come up with any new solutions to the euro zone’s sovereign debt crisis over the weekend.  However, a Greek finance ministry official said after talks on Monday with the European Union and International Monetary Fund that the country was near an agreement with international lenders to continue receiving money.  “For the time being it looks as though there is hope the conversation is going to take on a more positive and constructive tone,” said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, New Jersey.  “A little reason for a little buoyancy in the market, but we’ve seen this before.”  Energy and financial stocks were among the worst performers of the session.

102,CAT,UPDATE 4-China's Sany Heavy braves markets with $3.3 bln HK IPO," * Deal could be second-biggest stock sale in HK this year   * Co offering 1.34 bln shares at HK$16.13-HK$19.38 each-term sheet   * Sany’s CEO is China’s richest man   * China accounts for 40 pct of global construction machinery sales   * IPO may be priced around Sept 26, HK trading may start Oct 3   (Adds Sany Heavy’s share performance, Hongguo IPO pricing)	   By Elzio Barreto	   HONG KONG, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Sany Heavy Industry  , China’s largest construction machinery maker, aims to raise up to $3.3 billion in what could be Hong Kong’s second-biggest  stock offering this year, as it defies volatile markets to fund an expansion.	   Sany Heavy’s offering is one of several deals that are pushing through Hong Kong’s narrowing IPO window, with most stock market sales pulled or on hold until markets steady across the globe.  	   The company, controlled by China’s richest man, Liang Wengen, is offering 1.34 billion shares for HK$16.13-HK$19.38 each, putting the total offer value at up to HK$25.97 billion ($3.3 billion), according to a term sheet seen by Reuters on Monday.	   The sale would be the biggest since commodities trader Glencore  raised nearly $10 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and London in May and would top a $2.5 billion initial public offering by luxury goods maker Prada  in June.	   “Selling H shares would help Sany build its international branding and would play an important role in accelerating its exports and international expansion,” said Zou Runfang, analyst at China Galaxy Securities Co.	   “However, the current market sentiment may hurt demand for its H-shares in the short term.”	   Sany, often referred to as China’s Caterpillar  , and rival XCMG Construction Machinery  have benefited from China’s construction boom over the past several years.	   Sany’s CEO and founder Liang is listed China’s richest man by Forbes, with an estimated wealth of $9.3 billion. Liang, 55, owns 58 percent stake in Sany Group and the Hong Kong offer is set to further boost his fortunes. His stake in the company will drop to 51 percent after the Hong Kong offer, according to the offer prospectus.	   Liang along with three others founded Hunan Lian Yuan City Welding Materials Factory in 1989 which later became Sany. 	   He graduated with an engineering degree from Central South University in China’s Hunan Province in 1983. In a recent interview with Forbes magazine, Liang said becoming wealthy had made him more tired because of the amount of work he puts into the business. He likened meetings to playing golf, as he tries to have fun with both.	   Sany’s success partly reflects the rapid growth of China’s high-value added manufacturing sector over the past decade, with exports from makers of pricey machinery and construction equipment advancing faster than low-value goods like toys.    Sany is based in Changsha, the capital of Hunan in southern China.	   The company’s Shanghai-listed shares closed down 1.2 percent on Monday at 14.85 yuan, its lowest level since Feb. 10. The stock is up 3 percent so far in 2011, compared with a 13.2 percent plunge in the Shanghai Composite Index .	 	   Citic Securities Co Ltd , China’s largest publicly traded brokerage, began meeting investors on Friday to market an up to $1.94 billion Hong Kong deal.	   Offerings from Citic Securities and Sany Heavy could also open the way for other large deals in coming months.	   Sinohydro, the builder of the Three Gorges Dam, said on Monday it would launch a $2.7 billion initial public offering this week, confirming a recent Reuters report.  	   Chinese consumer companies, including tea maker Tenfu Holdings Co Ltd and Xiao Nan Guo Restaurants Holdings Ltd recently launched $485 million worth of IPOs in Hong Kong. 	   Shoe retailer Hongguo International Holdings Ltd  raised about $148 million late on Friday, pricing its IPO at HK$2.3 a share, at the low end of a proposed price range. Hongguo was the first company to go public in Hong Kong since the $1.2 billion IPO in July by hypermarket operator Sun Art Retail Group Ltd .	   With markets continuing to be volatile, pricing plays an even bigger role in ensuring how offerings fare. 	   Sany is offering a 16.6 percent discount to its A share reference point, more than the 13.3 percent discount offered by Citic, given the bigger size of the fund-raising.	   Sany Heavy’s Hong Kong offering values the company at up to 14.7 times its 2011 estimated earnings and up to 10.9 times its 2012 earnings, according to forecasts by the banks underwriting the deal.	   By comparison, 13 Chinese construction companies on average trade at 19.4 times 2011 earnings and 14.1 times 2012 earnings, according to brokerage CLSA.	   China’s share of global sales of construction machinery grew to 40 percent in 2010 from just 5 percent in 2005, driven by a 15 percent compounded annual growth in China’s GDP between 2000 and 2010.	   However, the company, which makes more than 500 models of construction machinery, faces challenges due to a slowdown in the Chinese economy caused by weak global economic growth.	   “There is a concern about the impact of tightened liquidity on infrastructure spending which may have an impact on its clients,” said Alex Wong, a director at Ample Finance.	   Sany plans to use nearly half of the proceeds to build new plants to expand capacity for excavators, crawlers and cranes.	   Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citic Securities and Citigroup Inc were tapped as joint global coordinators to manage the offering.	   Sany Heavy, which has a market value of about $18 billion, plans to price the offer around Sept. 26 and the shares are set to start trading in Hong Kong on or around Oct. 3, the term sheet showed.

104,CAT,UPDATE 2-SEC asks US companies to disclose offshore cash,"   * Big tax bills may affect companies’ cash picture   * Overseas cash at center of lobbying effort   By Dena Aubin   Sept 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked companies including Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, Fortune Brands Inc FO.N, Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) to tell investors more about cash they hold offshore, according to letters on the SEC’s website.   Many companies with apparently large overseas cash hoards would have to pay a big tax bill if they brought the money back to the United States, and the SEC has been asking some companies to disclose that in their filings.   Overseas profits have helped boost cash at many U.S. companies, but much of the money is effectively trapped there because of the large tax payments due if it were brought back to the United States. [ID:nN05234711]   In letters commenting on companies’ regulatory filings, the SEC suggested that more detailed information on overseas cash is needed to help investors understand companies’ liquidity, or the amount of cash they have available when needed.   Companies usually do not have to pay U.S. taxes on earnings generated overseas until they are brought home, and then the companies receive a credit for foreign taxes they paid overseas. Many companies have cash stashed in countries where the tax rate is far lower than the United States’ 35 percent corporate rate.   Accounting rules generally require companies to recognize a tax expense on overseas profits as soon as they are earned, but an exception is granted if management intends to keep the earnings permanently invested overseas.   That exception gives companies an extra incentive to keep cash permanently invested offshore.   “Generating cash outside of the U.S. is the result of being a global company operating in a global economy,” said Jim Dugan, Caterpillar’s chief corporate spokesman.   About 70 percent of Caterpillar’s business last year came from outside the United States, Dugan said, adding that the cash generated offshore reflected normal business activities.   The issue has taken on more importance amid a debate about how to tackle the nation’s budget deficit and debt and whether changes are needed in lucrative corporate tax breaks. [ID:nN1E76P22A]   In addition, some U.S. lawmakers have been pushing for a repatriation holiday to allow companies to bring overseas cash home. The Obama administration has refused to consider a holiday outside the context of making broad changes in the convoluted tax code. [ID:nN1E77N0M2].

105,CAT,UPDATE 1-Caterpillar North American dealer sales improve," Sept 20 (Reuters) - Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported on Tuesday a slight acceleration in North American dealer sales of machinery for the three months ended in August, a sign that demand remains steady despite the weak U.S. economy.   The world’s largest maker of construction equipment said on Thursday that dealer sales — an indicator of future revenue — rose 30 percent in North America in the trailing three months, an improvement over their pace in the three months ended in July.   Worldwide dealer sales over the past three months were up 34 percent, slightly below the 35-percent growth reported a month ago, Caterpillar said in a monthly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. August marked the fourth consecutive monthly decline in the worldwide growth rate.   Asia dealer sales accelerated while those in Latin America, Europe, Africa and Middle East decelerated slightly.   Caterpillar, whose competitors include Japan’s Komatsu Ltd (6301.T) and South Korea’s Doosan Infracore Co Ltd (042670.KS), said separately that its Chief Information Officer John Heller would retire early next year. It plans to name a replacement before the end of 2011.   Caterpillar shares were little changed at $84.77 in morning trade.  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Gerald E.

106,CAT,China's Sany Heavy delays retail part of $3.3 billion HK offer,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s Sany Heavy Industry Co Ltd (600031.SS) has delayed the retail portion of its planned $3.3 billion Hong Kong share offering, saying it needs more time to meet investors before pricing the deal.  Any delay during a share-sale process is usually indicative of lack of interest in the deal, but it was unclear whether Sany Heavy, China’s largest construction machinery maker, would be under pressure to re-price the offer as global markets struggle.  “Many stocks in the same sector have been down quite a lot and Sany Heavy has to offer shares at an even lower price to generate interest as investors have a very low risk appetite,” Ben Kwong, chief operating officer of KGI Asia said.  The news of the delay comes after Hong Kong's benchmark share index .HSI fell to a 26-month closing low on Monday and as Standard and Poor's downgraded its unsolicited ratings on Italy, adding to concerns of contagion in the debt-stressed euro zone. The Hang Seng index firmed 0.5 percent on Tuesday.  “The road show is still ongoing, but the timing of the relaunch has to be confirmed,” a company spokesman said on Tuesday, confirming an earlier report by IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.  Companies have to publish a prospectus with terms of the offering ahead of the launching the deal to retail investors.  A delay would give Sany Heavy and its underwriters the flexibility to tweak the terms to match demand for the deal, including a change in the number of shares or the price, according to a banker not involved with the process.  Controlled by China’s richest man, Liang Wengen, Sany Heavy had launched the global share offering on Monday, braving volatile markets to fund its expansion.  The retail portion, which was scheduled to start on Sept 21, accounted for just 5 percent of the total offer, according to a term sheet sent to investors and seen by Reuters.  The company, often referred to as China’s Caterpillar (CAT.N), had planned only a six-day bookbuilding with institutional investors, shorter than the usual eight-day period. It was unclear whether the institutional offering will be extended, IFR reported, quoting sources.  Sany Heavy’s Shanghai-listed shares closed up 1.3 percent on Tuesday.  Sany Heavy’s offer is the third multi-billion-dollar deal to hit Hong Kong in recent weeks as the world’s biggest listing market roars back to life after being shut for nearly two months.  Companies from insurers to brokerages to banks, including Citic Securities Co Ltd (600030.SS), Haitong Securities Co Ltd (600837.SS), New China Life, have unveiled plans to raise $35.4 billion in coming months.  New China Life, the country’s third-largest life insurer, may delay the launch of its Shanghai initial public offering until after it lists in Hong Kong, a Chinese financial magazine reported on Monday.  Sany Heavy had planned to price the offering on Sept 26 and trading in Hong Kong was slated for Oct 3.  The offer would be the biggest since commodities trader Glencore International Plc (GLEN.L) 0805.HK raised nearly $10 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and London in May and would top a $2.5 billion initial public offering by luxury goods maker Prada SpA (1913.HK) in June.  Sany Heavy is offering 1.34 billion shares for HK$16.13-HK$19.38 each, putting the total offer value at up to HK$25.97 billion ($3.3 billion), according to a term sheet seen by Reuters on Monday.  The company is offering a 16.6 percent discount to its Shanghai A share reference point, more than the 13.3 percent discount offered by Citic, due to the offer’s large size and the market uncertainty, analysts said.  Sany’s Hong Kong offering values the company at up to 14.7 times its 2011 estimated earnings and up to 10.8 times its 2012 earnings, according to forecasts by the banks underwriting the deal.  By comparison, 13 Chinese construction companies on average trade at 19.4 times 2011 earnings and 14.1 times 2012 earnings, according to brokerage CLSA.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Citic Securities (600030.SS) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) were tapped as joint global coordinators to manage the offering.

107,CAT,UPDATE 1-Emerson industrial automation order growth slows," Sept 20 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) reported its second consecutive sequential deceleration in industrial orders on Tuesday, saying comparisons with year-earlier growth were getting more difficult.   Emerson’s industrial automation orders were up 5 percent to 10 percent in the three months through August, down from their pace in the three months through July, which itself marked a deceleration from the prior period.   Total company orders were up 10 percent to 15 percent, the same pace as in the previous two months, helped by currency exchange rates, the company said in a monthly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   “Strong backlog should ensure solid revenue growth over the next several quarters,” Emerson management said.   The pace of order growth improved in the company’s tools and storage segment. Orders were flat to down 5 percent in the climate technologies business and rose more than 20 percent in process management. The network power business, which makes uninterruptible power systems for data centers and other uses, showed a 5 percent to 10 percent increase in orders, according to the filing.   Emerson is among a handful of U.S. industrial companies that report monthly data to give investors a glimpse of business trends beyond quarterly earnings statements. Others include Caterpillar (CAT.N), Kennametal Inc (KMT.N), and Illinois Tool Works (ITW.N).

Total operating revenue rose 16 percent for its latest three-month period, compared with a 17 percent growth for the three months ended July 31. The increase is within the range of sales growth ITW had forecast for the third quarter, whose results it will report next month.   Its sales growth slowed in areas including industrial packaging, power systems and electronics, and in ITW’s decorative surfaces segment.   But sales accelerated in ITW’s construction products segment, a key market for many U.S. industrial names. On Wednesday, an architects’ trade group reported a sharp increase in a billings index that is considered a leading indicator  of construction activity. [ID:nS1E78K08X]   Demand was slightly better in September than in August, JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan said in a note to clients, citing a conversation with ITW management.

113,CAT,US architecture billings index rebounds in August," * August ABI up 6.3 pts to 51.4 in August   * Project inquiries index up 3.2 pts to 56.9   * Trade group: construction market may have bottomed   NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - A leading indicator of U.S. nonresidential construction activity surprisingly rebounded last month after four months of declines, an architects’ trade group said on Wednesday.   The architecture billings index jumped to 51.4 last month from 45.1 in July, according the American Institute of Architects. Any reading above 50 indicates rising demand for design services, a predictor of construction spending nine to 12 months in the future.   “Based on the poor economic conditions over the last several months, this turnaround in demand for design services is a surprise,” said AIA Chief Economist, Kermit Baker.   A separate index of inquiries for new projects, typically higher than the ABI, rose to 56.9 in August from 53.7.   Architects’ clients continue to struggle to find financing for projects, but the August data suggests the U.S. construction industry may have bottomed, the AIA said.   A depressed construction market has been a headwind for manufacturers of construction machinery and components that make up buildings’ infrastructure, such as electrical, cooling and security systems.   Analysts who cover industrial stocks have called the ABI as important an economic indicator as the monthly industrial data from the Institute for Supply Management.   Most diversified industrial companies get at least some revenue from the non-residential construction sector, which includes office buildings, retail and warehouse space, and institutional buildings such as schools and hospitals.    Companies exposed to the sector include Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Tyco International Ltd TYC.N, Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Terex Corp (TEX.N).   European companies such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST)  are also significant players in the sector.

The company, China’s largest construction machinery maker, has set no new dates for the deal, said the sources, who couldn’t be named because the decision isn’t public. Sany Heavy’s deal would have been Hong Kong’s second-largest offering this year.  Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI tumbled nearly 5 percent on Thursday amid concern about Europe's debt crisis and the U.S. economy.  The index has retreated 11.4 percent since Sany Heavy and its underwriters began meeting with investors to drum up demand for the deal on September 5, while Sany Heavy’s Shanghai-listed stock has declined 5.4 percent over the same period.  “There’s not much you can do with a market like this,” said a source with direct knowledge of Sany Heavy’s listing plans.  Calls to Sany Heavy’s external public relations firm in Hong Kong were not immediately returned.  Sany Heavy, controlled by China’s richest man, Liang Wengen, will continue meeting investors in the United States and London next week, said one source. It might go forward with the deal on an accelerated basis once it decides to resume the sale, since it already held extensive meetings with investors, the source added.  Xiao Nan Guo Restaurants Holdings said late on Wednesday it had decided not to proceed with its planned Hong Kong offering of up to $95 million because of “excessive market volatility.”  The Sany Heavy sale would have been the biggest since commodities trader Glencore (GLEN.L) 0805.HK raised nearly $10 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and London in May and topped a $2.5 billion initial public offering by luxury goods maker Prada (1913.HK) in June.

116,CAT,RPT-UPDATE 2-Volvo eyes best-in-class operating margin," (Repeats to fix formatting)	   * Organic sales growth should at least equal competitors   * Operating margin should be ranked among top two competitors   * Shares down 4.4 percent   (Adds analyst quotes, background)	   By Helena Soderpalm and Veronica Ek	   STOCKHOLM, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Swedish truckmaker Volvo (VOLVb.ST) is to focus on efficiency more than growth to meet new financial targets calling for an operating margin among the top two of named competitors.	   Shares in the world’s number two truckmaker after German group Daimler (DAIGn.DE) were down 4.4 percent by 0955 GMT on Thursday, in line with a 4.1 percent lower European industrial goods and services sector .	   Volvo, which sells trucks under the Eicher, Mack, Renault and UD Trucks brands as well as its own name, said organic sales growth for its truck, bus and construction equipment operations and Volvo Penta should at least equal a weighted-average for comparable competitors.	   Investor relations director Patrick Stenberg told Reuters the new goals were more challenging than previous targets, which were for an entire business cycle or for the group as a whole.	   “They (targets) are more focused on the operational efficiency compared with growth ... the growth goal is more in relation to our competitors,” he said.	   Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard said the new targets were not that concrete since figures from competitors could be tough to pin down. He was upbeat about the broader move.	   “They now shift the focus more towards earnings and becoming a best-in-class truck maker. So, that way it is a clear signal to the market that they want to be in the lead on the earnings side going forward,” he said.	   Volvo said its truck operations will be measured together with its bus operations against Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Iveco  , MAN , Navistar , Paccar , Scania SCVb.ST and Sinotruk .	   Its construction equipment business will be measured, with Volvo Penta, against rivals Brunswick , CAT , CNH, Cummins , Deere , Hitachi , Komatsu and Terex .	   Credit Suisse analysts said in a note: “Such benchmarking targets represent a hindrance as opposed to help for new CEO Olof Persson as he seeks to galvanize and mould the company around him.	   “Continually monitoring yourself against peers as opposed to defining your own strategy and targets is both backward looking and non-motivational in our view.”	   Sydbank’s Imsgard said Volvo still had a sizeable gap to Scania — one of its biggest competitors — in terms of margin. 	   “There is a big potential in these targets if they really can fulfill being on level with a company like Scania. Then there is a huge upside for Volvo going forward,” he said.	   UBS analysts said in a note that Volvo aimed to improve significantly its performance in downturns.	   “While among the top two in trucks margins in a normal environment, it was the worst performing truck manufacturer and one of the weakest construction equipment manufacturers during 2009, and far from the top two in profitability,” they said.	   “We believe the group is in better shape this time around with cost cutting already ongoing, increased flexibility and preparedness so it is positive to see that the board also sees scope to improve performance significantly.”	   Volvo suffered a sizeable operating loss during the 2009 downturn but bounced back relatively quickly thanks to strong demand in emerging markets and renewed growth in Europe and North America.	   “Following the completion of the streamlining of the Volvo Group towards commercial vehicles and a number of acquisitions, the company now has the size and geographical footprint necessary to achieve long-term success,” chairman Louis Schweitzer said.

117,CAT,"UPDATE 1-Volvo sets new targets, benchmarks against rivals"," * Volvo sets new financial targets against relevant competitors   * Says annual organic sales growth should equal or exceed competitors   * Says operating margin should be ranked among top two competitors   (Adds quotes, details)	   STOCKHOLM, Sept 22 (Reuters)-Volvo (VOLVb.ST), the world’s number two truck maker, announced new financial targets on Thursday, benchmarking its businesses against key competitors rather than setting targets for a business cycle or the group as a whole.	   Volvo, which sells trucks under the Renault, Mack, UD Trucks and Eicher brands as well as its own name, said its annual organic sales growth for the truck, bus and construction equipment operations, as well as Volvo Penta, should be equal to or exceed a weighted-average for comparable competitors. 	   Its annual operating margin should be ranked among the top two of its named competitors.	   Its truck operations will be measured with its bus operations against Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Iveco , MAN  , Navistar , Paccar , Scania SCVb.ST and Sinotruk . Its construction equipment business will be measured, with Volvo Penta, against rivals Brunswick , CAT , CNH, Cummins , Deere , Hitachi  , Komatsu and Terex .	   “Following the completion of the streamlining of the Volvo Group towards commercial vehicles and a number of acquisitions, the company now has the size and geographical footprint necessary to achieve long-term success,” Chairman Louis Schweitzer said in a statement.	   He said that while growth would remain important in the future, the board was of the opinion that the prerequisites were now in place to also set new profitability targets for the company and its new chief executive officer.	   Volvo’s previous financial targets for the group were adopted in September 2006 and comprised an annual sales increase of 10 percent and an operating margin for industrial operations of 7 percent or more. 	   Those targets were measured over a business cycle.	   Volvo has seen sales bounce back since the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, but investors still wonder whether market turmoil and renewed worries about recession may yet have an impact on demand for new trucks.

118,CAT,Heavy machinery shares up on euro zone rescue talks,"(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. heavy machinery makers, with strong sales in Europe, shot up on Tuesday, encouraged by news on euro zone officials working to beef up the region’s rescue fund to ease the debt crisis.  The S&P 1500 Construction & Farm Machinery & Heavy Trucks Index .15GSPMCHD gained as much as 5 percent. The DJ Industrial Average .DJI was up 2 percent in morning trade.  Shares of heavy equipment major Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) rose 4 percent. Shares of its mining rival Joy Global Inc JOYG.O jumped 8 percent, as fears of a European debt crisis abate, improving these companies’ outlook in their key markets.  “If Europe is able to get itself through the potential crisis without going into a terrible recession, that is going to have a positive impact on China, which exports a lot of goods to Europe,” analyst Adam Fleck at Morningstar said.  China is a major market for mining equipment and heavy machinery companies. Farm equipment makers such as Agco Corp (AGCO.N), which depends heavily on Europe, has also been pumping up investments in the Chinese market.  Fleck said China is the world’s largest consumer of many mined commodities including coal, an important commodity for Joy Global’s equipment.  Other stocks Terex Corp (TEX.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and CNH Global CNH.N were significantly up as well.

122,CAT,Awful quarter for Wall Street may be only the beginning,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - This past quarter was miserable for bullish U.S. stock investors. The bad news is, things may get worse before they get better.  The S&P 500 .SPX fell about 14 percent in the third quarter -- losing about $1.7 trillion in market cap, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream -- as the U.S. economy struggled and a resolution to Europe's sovereign debt woes proved elusive.  The quarter was the S&P’s weakest since the fourth quarter of 2008, the peak of the financial crisis. Many analysts say persistent uncertainty overshadows any near-term value created by share price declines.  “I don’t see great opportunities and wouldn’t encourage aggressiveness until we see some stabilization in Europe, China and here,” said Jerry Harris, president of asset management at Sterne Agee in Birmingham, Alabama.  “We may be approaching that point, but it’s too early to have a lot of conviction and there’s not much potential for prices until we start getting better economic numbers.”  According to a recent Reuters poll, the S&P is seen ending 2011 at 1,250, which would represent a gain from current levels but would still be slightly in the red for 2011.  The 1,250 target was lower than the 1,400 target in the previous quarter’s poll, a sign of how global headwinds have dented sentiment.  In a sign of how investor fear has spiked, the CBOE Volatility index .VIX surged 146 percent in its biggest-ever quarterly percentage move. The concern is that this volatility shock may not dissipate — a sign investors may be looking at another recession and an extended period of underperformance.  Derivatives strategists at MKM Partners found that in periods in which volatility remained high for several months, stocks underperformed. During similar periods in 2002 and 2010, the S&P 500 was range-bound and choppy and did not set a long-term floor until the VIX dropped below the 25 threshold. It closed on Friday at 42.96, the highest in six weeks.  As protection from downside, many money managers are advocating positions in large-cap, dividend-paying stocks, which are seen as more stable in a volatile market.  Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Cleveland, Ohio-based Key Private Bank, said the next quarter would be a stockpicker’s market. He cited McKesson Corp (MCK.N), McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) as attractive plays.  “These are names where the fundamentals are strong and they’re likely to do well regardless of what the economy does,” he said. “Given the potential for significant overseas slowing and therefore weakness in U.S. exports, we think it’s better to focus on fundamentals.”  The market’s sell-off over the past three months could have created some bargains.  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) lost about a third of its value in that time while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc (FCX.N) has slumped 41 percent. Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), an investor favorite that was the S&P’s top gainer in 2010, lost 57 percent, one of the worst slides in the S&P this quarter.  “The October earnings reports might provide investors with a better sense of things in 2012 ... stocks may recover some of their lost ground,” said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, with $18 billion in assets.  “Investors should be positioning for better stock conditions, lowering cash balances and renewing their commitment to commodities.”  Bank of America (BAC.N) lost 44 percent while JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) fell 26 percent in a brutal quarter for banks.  “Financials may have found a bit of a bottom at these levels, so from that standpoint they might find some support going forward,” said Michael Matousek, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc, which manages $3 billion in San Antonio.  “We’re seeing people start to buy them, but I wouldn’t go all-in with that bet. The odds for further declines aren’t completely gone.”  The underlying problems in Europe remain a tremendous weight. Measures of insurance against default show investors still worried about European banks and those that may be exposed to them. The market’s penchant for falling on unsupportive headlines shows institutional investors remain unconvinced of the equity market’s direction.  German lawmakers’ approval of new powers for the euro zone’s crisis fund was seen as progress in confronting the sovereign debt issue. But it has hardly been resolved.  “The vote in Germany was good news, but we also remain at the mercy of politicians here and abroad,” said Andrew Goldberg, market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York.  “That’s my biggest concern, and why investors should be cautious over the coming months.”  ",9302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-q4outlook/awful-quarter-for-wall-street-may-be-only-the-beginning-idUSTRE78T55D20110930
123,CAT,Exclusive: Small business borrowing jumps: PayNet,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. businesses jumped in August, a bright spot in an economy whose weaknesses are so pronounced that the Federal Reserve last month launched a new program aimed at encouraging just such borrowing.  The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index, which measures the overall volume of financing to U.S. small businesses, gained 19 percent in August from a year earlier, and 8.6 percent from July, PayNet said on Monday.  It is at its highest since April 2008, after gaining by double digits every month for 13 months.  Borrowing by small businesses is seen as a harbinger for the broader economy because they account for the lion’s share of new hiring. Two years into a recovery from the worst recession in decades, the United States is still dogged by 9.1 percent unemployment, and in August, U.S. employers overall added no jobs.  The latest surge in borrowing suggests the jobs picture will brighten in coming months, said PayNet founder Bill Phelan in an interview.  “Any time you put in new plants and equipment, you’ve got to have people who sit in front of them - we will see some job growth,” Phelan said.  PayNet tracks borrowing by millions of small U.S. businesses, which cut back dramatically on borrowing in 2008 and 2009. Now they are back to borrowing again, on a scale that points to real optimism about demand for products rather than simply the need to replace outdated machines, Phelan said.  “These are ‘show-me’ people — they won’t do things on a hope and a prayer,” he said.  The loans PayNet tracks are typically used to buy or update plants and equipment, and on average are for four-year projects.  Economic news has been so dismal since the summer slowdown that the Fed after its September 20-21 policy meeting declared there were “significant” downside risks. The central bank plans to start a new $400 billion stimulus program to push down long-term interest rates on October 12.  Amid the weak economic reports, including one Friday that showed income in August slipped for the first time in two years, there have been a few other signs of strength, including a decline in jobless claims last week and a stronger-than-expected showing by U.S. Midwest manufacturers in September.  Separate data from PayNet showed small business health was improving, as loan delinquencies continued to abate.  Accounts in moderate delinquency, or those behind by 30 days or more, fell in August to 1.64 percent from 1.76 percent in July, PayNet said.  Accounts 90 days or more behind in payment, or in severe delinquency, fell to 0.44 percent in August from 0.51 percent in July.  Accounts behind 180 days or more, or in default and unlikely to ever get paid, fell to 0.68 percent of total receivables in August, from 0.70 percent in July, according to PayNet, which provides risk-management tools to the commercial lending industry.  The Thomson Reuters/PayNet small business lending index is correlated to developments in the overall economy, with changes in the index preceding changes in the overall U.S. economy by two to five months.  PayNet collects real-time loan information, such as originations and delinquencies, from more than 250 leading U.S. capital equipment lenders.

125,CAT,UPDATE 1-Twin rebukes jolt US business tax holiday campaign," * Think tanks on left and right nix push for tax holiday   * Reports question jobs impact of foreign profit tax break  (Adds Heritage Foundation study, Thornell comment)   By Kevin Drawbaugh   WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A lobbying push in the U.S. Congress to give major corporations a tax break on their overseas profits suffered a setback on Tuesday when influential left- and right-wing think tanks both issued reports rejecting it.   The left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies said 10 big companies, including banking giants Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), laid off workers after enjoying a similar foreign profits tax break in 2004-2005.   Despite promises that the tax break would boost the economy and stimulate hiring, the institute said that did not happen six years ago, and it likely would not happen this time either, if Congress were to approve another tax “holiday.”   The conservative Heritage Foundation, normally in conflict with the institute, agreed on this one.   The Bush administration’s 2004-2005 income tax repatriation holiday “did not produce the hoped-for subsequent surge in domestic investment,” the foundation said in a report.   “The current proposal would cut taxes, which is generally a good thing, but if another repatriation tax holiday were enacted, one should expect a similar result as last time: specifically, a surge in repatriations and little appreciable increase in domestic investment or job creation,” it said.   At issue is an estimated $1.5 trillion in foreign profits that U.S. multinationals have parked abroad, avoiding the 35-percent U.S. corporate income tax. The companies want to bring these earnings home to the United States, but they do not want to pay the full tax. So they are pressing for a replay of the Bush-era tax break, except on a larger scale.   In 2004-2005, 843 corporations brought home $362 billion in overseas income at a 5.25-percent tax rate.   Legislation under study in Congress would let corporations repatriate their foreign profits again at the same rate. And just as they did before, companies are today portraying this proposal as a boost to jobs and the economy.   EXECS, SHAREHOLDERS GOT GAINS-REPORT   Chuck Collins, co-author of the institute’s report, was skeptical. “History shows that many ‘tax holiday’ companies use repatriated profits to reward executives and other shareholders, then lay off workers. Corporate tax holidays have resulted in precious few U.S. jobs,” Collins said.   The institute’s report concluded that 58 corporations which accounted for 70 percent of overseas profits repatriated under the Bush tax break collectively saved $64 billion in taxes, then cut 600,000 jobs through layoffs in subsequent years.   “A study blaming seven years of job losses on repatriation is truly bizarre and isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on,” said Doug Thornell, spokesman for WIN America, a coalition of multinationals lobbying in Congress for the tax break.   “The fact is, the year after repatriation was passed, unemployment dropped by half a point and (gross domestic product) grew by 1.3 percent,” Thornell said.   The New Democrat Network, a centrist group, issued a report in August saying an overseas tax repatriation holiday would bring new net revenue into the U.S. Treasury.   At a time of soaring government deficits, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional research arm, has estimated that another tax holiday, like the one favored by WIN America, would eventually cost taxpayers about $78.7 billion over the next decade.   Besides Citi and Bank of America, the institute’s report focused on technology group Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N), drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), and manufacturers Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N).   Telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and chemical makers Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, and DuPont DD.N are also singled out as corporations that “benefited the most financially from the tax holiday and slashed the most jobs.”   The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is looking into the results of the 2004-2005 tax holiday as well. A report from the panel is expected within a few weeks, its chairman, Democrat Carl Levin, told Reuters last month.   Merck declined to comment. Other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

126,CAT,Analysis: Latest 401(k) lawsuit highlights ongoing fee concerns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - While workers can’t do much when a stock market sell-off hits their 401(k) balances, they can speak up about poor investment choices and unreasonable plan fees. Now, more are taking those complaints to the courts as they bring lawsuits against employers they believe have allowed poorly-performing and overly-expensive funds into their retirement plans.  The most recent 401(k) fee lawsuit was filed last week against Ameriprise Financial Inc, which bills itself as “America’s leader in financial planning.” The suit, which was brought on behalf of several employees and is seeking class action status, alleges the financial firm pushed workers into expensive and untested proprietary funds at a cost the lawyers for the employees say is more than $20 million.  It’s one of some three dozen lawsuits filed in recent years in the ongoing tussle over 401(k) costs. Experts don’t expect those cases - or high 401(k) fees - to disappear anytime soon, even though a rule scheduled to kick in by mid-2012 should give workers much more insight into the fees built into their plans.  “They put people into their products, and they were not vetted and were excessively expensive,” Jerome Schlichter, who is representing the Ameriprise employees, told Reuters in an interview. He says the company was “self dealing.”  Donald E. Froude, president of the Ameripise’s Personal Advisors Group, defended his firm on Monday, while speaking at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit. “We feel we’ve acted appropriately,” he said, adding, “This law firm has done several other cases.”  Schlicter’s firm, Schlichter, Bogard & Denton, has filed many of the class action suits in the last five years. A number of those cases have been thrown out or remain in litigation, but others - notably those against Caterpillar Inc., and General Dynamics Corp. - resulted in multimillion dollar settlements for thousands of employees. “These lawsuits have really helped shine a light on the fact that there are very large plans that have fees that are too high,” said Mike Alfred of Brightscope, a firm which monitors and grades 401(k) plans.  In recent years, the down market has focused greater attention on 401(k) fees, many of which are very difficult for workers and even employers to ferret out. A survey released in April by AARP found that more than seven in 10 of plan participants incorrectly reported that they did not pay any fees.  At issue are not just the management fees of the mutual funds held in the plans, but other fees that can be buried in plan management contracts. There can be wrap fees, annuity contract fees and even sales and marketing charges on the mutual funds. Alfred contends that large companies, in particular, have the muscle to negotiate low per-participant management costs and very low-fee investment options for their workers.  Those fees can keep 401(k) management costs down for companies, but their effect on workers’ retirements can be significant. A worker with a $25,000 balance in her 401(k) account, who earned 7 percent annually and paid 0.5 percent a year in fees would have $227,000 saved after 35 years. If an extra 1 percent in fees were drained out of her account every year, she’d only have $163,000 at the end of that period, according to an estimate published by the Labor Department.  Beginning in May, 2012, companies will have to disclose far more information about 401(k) fees to their workers, under rules issued by the Labor Department.  But workers shouldn't wait for that, says Alfred. He suggests that a first step can be checking out your company's plan at his firm's web site, Brightscope.com. (There, Ameriprise logged a ""grade"" of 76 - about average for its peer group. The average 401(k) participant in the plan is missing out on some $50,600 in lost retirement savings because it's not a top plan, according to the Brightscope calculations.)  Workers can also ask their human resources departments for a breakdown of their 401(k) fees, and find out how plan chores - such as recordkeeping - are paid for. Employers may not have all of that information at the ready, but will be required to by May, 2012.

127,CAT,"Citi, BofA cut workers after US tax holiday-report"," * Left-leaning group hits push for another tax holiday   * Report singles out 10 companies for cutting jobs   WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ten major U.S. corporations, including big banks Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), laid off workers after enjoying a tax holiday in 2004-2005 that had been billed as a form of economic stimulus, said a report released on Tuesday.   With large multinational companies today pressing Congress for another tax holiday, the Institute for Policy Studies reported that the last one did not fulfill its rosy promises for hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers.   Fifty-eight corporations that accounted for 70 percent of overseas profits repatriated under the 2004-2005 tax break collectively saved $64 billion in taxes, then cut 600,000 jobs through layoffs, the report said.   It is the latest in a series of warring studies on whether U.S. multinationals should be allowed, for the second time, to bring home hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas profits at a bargain-basement tax rate.   Large companies are lobbying again for such a tax break, which would let them repatriate much if not all of an estimated $1.5 trillion in overseas profits for well below the full 35-percent corporate income tax rate.   Legislation in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives would let them repatriate those profits at 5.25 percent, the same tax rate given to them under a similar tax holiday during the Bush administration.   Just as they are doing now, companies six years ago said that the repatriation tax break would boost jobs and the economy. But the institute said this did not happen, as earlier academic studies have also found.   “History shows that many ‘tax holiday’ companies use repatriated profits to reward executives and other shareholders, then lay off workers. Corporate tax holidays have resulted in precious few U.S. jobs,” said Chuck Collins, co-author of the report from the left-leaning institute.   Besides Citi and Bank of America, the report focuses on technology group Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N), drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), and manufacturers Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N).   Telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and chemical makers Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, and DuPont DD.N are also singled out as corporations that “benefited the most financially from the tax holiday and slashed the most jobs.”   The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is looking into the results of the 2004-2005 tax holiday as well. A report from the panel is expected within a few weeks, its chairman, Democrat Carl Levin, told Reuters last month.   In 2004-2005, 843 corporations brought home $362 billion in overseas income at a 5.25-percent tax rate. Analysts said that experience encouraged companies to park more income overseas, allowing them to postpone indefinitely paying any U.S. income tax on it, as long as the money stays abroad.   With the economy struggling and new government stimulus hard to come by, a well-financed corporate lobbying campaign — organized under the WIN America coalition — is arguing that another tax holiday would boost the economy.   As reported by Reuters in August, the coalition has hired dozens of former congressional tax-writing committee staffers.   The New Democrat Network, a centrist group, issued a report in August saying an overseas tax repatriation holiday would bring new net revenue into the U.S. Treasury.   At a time of soaring government deficits, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional research arm, has estimated that a tax holiday, like the one proposed in the House and favored by WIN America, would eventually cost taxpayers about $78.7 billion over the next decade.

130,CAT,"Caterpillar masters slowdown, posts record results","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc muscled through murky economic conditions with a surprising 44 percent jump in quarterly profit, and forecast strong demand through next year in a sign of optimism for the global economy. The company said on Monday that it expects full-year 2011 profit and revenue to set records on the back of surging sales for mining equipment and construction machinery in most markets around the world — suggesting the underlying health of the global economy may not be as dire as is widely believed. Caterpillar executives expect that momentum to carry into next year, with sales rising up to 20 percent above the expected record $58 billion in sales in this year. “We’re having a great year in 2011, and 2012 is shaping up to be better,” said Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman. Stronger demand at the world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer means more jobs and investment. Caterpillar said it hired nearly 5,000 people in the quarter. The company typically breaks out its employment figures on a year-over-year basis, but this time it detailed the improvement from second quarter to third quarter. The comparison showed that Caterpillar is coupling earnings growth with a steady commitment to hiring. “To the degree that we see continuing increases in demand for our products, it will lead to additional hiring,” Chief Financial Officer Ed Rapp said in an interview. Caterpillar’s production should continue to rise in the months to come. The bullish news from the world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer, which follows strong forecasts from the likes of General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp, helped spark an overall rally in the market Monday. The stock gained about 5.5 percent, or $4.77, to $92.16 on the New York Stock Exchange, and accounted for a third of the 125-point gain seen Monday in the Dow Jones industrial average. “When a big-name company like this reports numbers like these, that will help turn around talk about another recession,” said Andrew Bodner, president of Double Diamond Investment Group in Parsippany, New Jersey. “Record (third quarter) sales and profit results were particularly impressive to us in light of economic challenges in developed nations,” Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Michael Jaffe said. “Caterpillar’s current trends also lead us to expect ongoing demand growth in 2012.” CFO Rapp said the current environment “looks very dissimilar to 2008,” when the economy last fell into recession. He said that Caterpillar’s finance arm is able to readily fund purchases of machinery, and he said dealers — many of whom panicked with recession on the horizon a few years ago — are showing considerable optimism. “It’s just not as bad as people want to make it out to be,” Rapp said. Caterpillar said it ended the third quarter in one of the healthiest positions in its recent history, with backlog orders standing at record levels and higher commodity prices leading to a favorable environment for its growing mining business, which is performing well in a variety of markets in all regions of the world. “Although there is a good deal of economic and political uncertainty in the world, we are not seeing it much in our business at this point,” CEO Oberhelman said. “We believe continued economic recovery, albeit a slow recovery, is the most likely scenario as we move forward.” PENT-UP DEMAND The construction industry — influenced by housing, commercial expansion and infrastructure development — is currently a tale of two sectors. Emerging economies are scrambling to buy enough new equipment to keep up with booming demand. But in mature markets, where construction spending is well below historic trends, customers are simply buying equipment to replace aging machinery. The company did caution that it is seeing a bit of a slowdown in China’s demand levels due to measures the government is taking to tighten the economy. Caterpillar executives, speaking during a conference call with investors, said the slowdown is needed and indicated the company continues to build share in that market. Rapp said Caterpillar is optimistic about ongoing policy discussions in the U.S. as well. The company expects a glut of “pent-up demand” for new construction to eventually spark new growth in more mature markets. Caterpillar’s forecast outlook indicates the company is successfully “coming to grips with a slower global economy,” Longbow Research equity analyst Eli Lustgarten said. Caterpillar is able to succeed in the cloudy environment due to “very big growth outside of the United States and what’s been a very strong (machinery) replenishment rate in the U.S.,” he said. Caterpillar reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.14 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with $792 million, or $1.22 per share, a year before. Analysts on average had expected Caterpillar to earn $1.54 per share in the third quarter. Sales rose 41 percent to $15.7 billion, which is a record, according to the company. Caterpillar earned $1.93 per share on $14.58 billion in sales excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Bucyrus mining business earlier this year. It now expects annual sales of $58 billion, including the impact of its acquisition of Bucyrus, in 2011. Its previous forecast had been a range of $56 billion to $58 billion. Profit is now expected to be $6.75 per share for the year, compared with a prior forecast of $6.25 to $6.75. Including the impact of Bucyrus, Caterpillar expects 2011 profit to reach $7.25 per share.

Chinese data showing a rebound in manufacturing eased fears of an abrupt slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, sparking the biggest jump in copper prices in nearly three years. Eurozone policymakers neared agreement over the weekend on bank recapitalization and on how to leverage their rescue fund to try to stop bond market contagion. But final decisions were deferred until a second summit on Wednesday. Optimism that officials will come up with a broad agreement this week lifted the euro to a six-week high against the dollar, despite concerns about deep divisions over the extent of losses that private holders of Greek bonds would have to accept. “Investors are pricing in the fact that the worst will be avoided with the conclusion of Wednesday’s EU summit,” said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. MSCI’s all-country world stock index rose 1.8 percent, after hitting its highest since early September. Some investors remained unconvinced that this week’s summit would fortify the bailout fund — the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) — enough to tackle the debt crisis. The concerns sent German government bond prices higher, while the spread between the yield on the 10-year Italian BTP benchmark bond and the equivalent German Bund widened. Italy is under mounting pressure from European partners to introduce measures to stimulate growth and restore market confidence. “All eyes are looking at Wednesday (for) possible answers. We are still not sure how the EFSF would work. This leaves a wide range of options open,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 61.98 points, or 2.35 percent, at 2,699.44. Caterpillar Inc gained 5 percent after reporting a 44 percent jump in quarterly profit on record revenues. Demand for its heavy equipment is seen as a gauge of global economic health. European shares closed up 1.1 percent, and emerging market shares rallied 3.6 percent. China’s vast manufacturing sector expanded moderately in October to snap three months of contraction, reflecting the resilience of robust domestic demand and rising expectations for metals demand.

135,CAT,"UPDATE 5-Caterpillar masters slowdown, posts record results","* Q3 $1.71 a share handily beats expectations * Q3 sales rise 41 pct, a company record * Sees 2012 sales increasing 10 to 20 pct * Shares up 5.5 pct, accounts for a third of Dow rise By John D. Stoll Oct 24 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc muscled through murky economic conditions with a surprising 44 percent jump in quarterly profit, and forecast strong demand through next year in a sign of optimism for the global economy. The company said on Monday that it expects full-year 2011 profit and revenue to set records on the back of surging sales for mining equipment and construction machinery in most markets around the world — suggesting the underlying health of the global economy may not be as dire as is widely believed. Caterpillar executives expect that momentum to carry into next year, with sales rising up to 20 percent above the expected record $58 billion in sales in this year. “We’re having a great year in 2011, and 2012 is shaping up to be better,” said Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman. Stronger demand at the world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer means more jobs and investment. Caterpillar said it hired nearly 5,000 people in the quarter. The company typically breaks out its employment figures on a year-over-year basis, but this time it detailed the improvement from second quarter to third quarter. The comparison showed that Caterpillar is coupling earnings growth with a steady commitment to hiring. “To the degree that we see continuing increases in demand for our products, it will lead to additional hiring,” Chief Financial Officer Ed Rapp said in an interview. Caterpillar’s production should continue to rise in the months to come. The bullish news from the world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer, which follows strong forecasts from the likes of General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp , helped spark an overall rally in the market Monday. The stock gained about 5.5 percent, or $4.77, to $92.16 on the New York Stock Exchange, and accounted for a third of the 125-point gain seen Monday in the Dow Jones industrial average. “When a big-name company like this reports numbers like these, that will help turn around talk about another recession,” said Andrew Bodner, president of Double Diamond Investment Group in Parsippany, New Jersey. “Record (third quarter) sales and profit results were particularly impressive to us in light of economic challenges in developed nations,” Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Michael Jaffe said. “Caterpillar’s current trends also lead us to expect ongoing demand growth in 2012.” CFO Rapp said the current environment “looks very dissimilar to 2008,” when the economy last fell into recession. He said that Caterpillar’s finance arm is able to readily fund purchases of machinery, and he said dealers — many of whom panicked with recession on the horizon a few years ago — are showing considerable optimism. “It’s just not as bad as people want to make it out to be,” Rapp said. Caterpillar said it ended the third quarter in one of the healthiest positions in its recent history, with backlog orders standing at record levels and higher commodity prices leading to a favorable environment for its growing mining business, which is performing well in a variety of markets in all regions of the world. “Although there is a good deal of economic and political uncertainty in the world, we are not seeing it much in our business at this point,” CEO Oberhelman said. “We believe continued economic recovery, albeit a slow recovery, is the most likely scenario as we move forward.” PENT-UP DEMAND The construction industry — influenced by housing, commercial expansion and infrastructure development — is currently a tale of two sectors. Emerging economies are scrambling to buy enough new equipment to keep up with booming demand. But in mature markets, where construction spending is well below historic trends, customers are simply buying equipment to replace aging machinery. The company did caution that it is seeing a bit of a slowdown in China’s demand levels due to measures the government is taking to tighten the economy. Caterpillar executives, speaking during a conference call with investors, said the slowdown is needed and indicated the company continues to build share in that market. Rapp said Caterpillar is optimistic about ongoing policy discussions in the U.S. as well. The company expects a glut of “pent-up demand” for new construction to eventually spark new growth in more mature markets.

Stocks were also helped by Chinese data that eased fears of an abrupt slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. The euro climbed to a six-week high against the dollar in volatile trade, though investors remained wary of sharp differences over the extent of losses private holders of Greek bonds will have to accept. European Union leaders neared agreement over the weekend on bank recapitalization and on how to leverage their rescue fund to try to stop bond market contagion. But final decisions were deferred until a second summit on Wednesday. “There is still a lot of hope that a solution out of Europe this time will last, and that is sending the market higher to break above trading ranges,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. MSCI’s all-country world stock index was up 1.7 percent, after hitting its highest level since early September. Some investors remained unconvinced plans on the table at a midweek European summit would fortify the European Financial Stability Facility enough to tackle the euro zone debt crisis. Those concerns sent German government bond prices higher, while the spread between the yield on the 10-year Italian BTP benchmark bond and the equivalent German Bund widened. Italy is under mounting pressure from European partners to introduce measures to stimulate growth and restore market confidence. “All eyes are looking at Wednesday’s possible answers. We are still not sure how the EFSF would work. This leaves a wide range of options open,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The euro zone should combine two proposals for increasing the firepower of its rescue fund — an insurance model and a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV) — according to an EU paper for the mid-week summit obtained by Reuters on Monday. U.S. stocks rose, adding to three weeks of gains for the S&P; 500 index after stronger-than-expected Caterpillar results and some proposed acquisitions. Demand for Caterpillar’s heavy equipment is seen as a gauge of global economic health. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 90.60 points, or 0.77 percent, at 11,899.39. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 14.05 points, or 1.13 percent, at 1,252.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 55.51 points, or 2.10 percent, at 2,692.97. European shares rose 1.1 percent. Earlier, Japan’s Nikkei added 1.9 percent. Emerging market shares rallied 3.5 percent. Further boosting sentiment was a rise above the 50 level in China’s flash purchasing managers’ index, suggesting a rebound in manufacturing in the world’s second-largest economy after three months of contraction. The encouraging Chinese data lifted commodity prices across the board. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange rallied 5 percent. China consumes 35-40 percent of global metals supply, making it a key factor for industrial metals prices. Spot gold last traded at $1,652.36 an ounce, after falling more than 2 percent last week. Brent crude was up  $1.58 at $111.14 a barrel. U.S. crude rose $3.08 to $90.48 a barrel, after reaching an intraday high of $90.86. The euro last traded 0.2 percent higher at $1.3928 .

144,CAT,Caterpillar to offer $885 million for China's ERA Mining,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said it will make an offer to buy China’s ERA Mining Machinery Ltd (8043.HK) to strengthen its mining business and ramp up investment in the fast-growing country, in a dual-option deal that could be worth up to $885 million. Shares in ERA, which makes underground coal mining equipment, rose 21.2 percent to HK$0.8 on Friday. “Coal consumption in China is growing faster than anywhere else in the world,” Caterpillar Group President Steven Wunning told Reuters in a telephone interview on Friday. Wunning said that China already consumes nearly half of the world’s coal, creating a huge market for underground mining of the resource. Caterpillar will either pay HK$0.88 cash per share, and/or offer a loan note alternative, which will entitle ERA’s loan note holders to receive a minimum of HK$0.75 and up to HK$1.15 per loan note upon redemption. The offer values Hong Kong-listed ERA at HK$4.490 billion-$6.885 billion ($577.25 million-$885.15 million), Caterpillar said in a statement. Caterpillar, the world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer, said its offer will be made if clearance from China’s Ministry of Commerce and any other related bodies is obtained. Caterpillar’s investments in mining have paid off, helped by solid demand for resources. Last year, the company agreed to acquire Wisconsin-based mining giant Bucyrus International for nearly $9 billion, giving it a substantial foothold in the mining industry. Caterpillar expects that acquisition to add $5 billion to the company’s sales in 2012. In China, Caterpillar is one of several heavy machinery makers looking to grow rapidly, with investments in a spate of projects, from residential expansion to infrastructure development. Joy Global Inc, a Milwaukee-based mining company with a strong presence in China, also recently saw a healthy increase in underground mining equipment sales. China is a big purchaser of coal, and inventories of that resource have been worked down in recent months. Efforts to restock those inventories could support coal demand even if there is an expected slowdown in growth in China. “We generally like this acquisition, given this is another indication that CAT is leveraging itself to what we think is a relatively long-dated international mining up-cycle, driven by relatively strong emerging market commodity demand,” Barclays Capital said in a note to investors. Barclays also said Caterpillar’s cash generation has been quite strong recently and it “could potentially generate enough cash in the next quarter or two to finance this deal.” The offer will be made by a wholly owned unit of the company, Caterpillar (Luxembourg) Investment Co. S.A. ERA makes mining equipment in mainland China through its unit Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical & Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Co Ltd, known as Siwei. Siwei’s Chairman and Chief Executive Wang Fu will continue to lead business operations after completion of the offer, Caterpillar said. Citigroup (C.N) was Caterpillar’s financial adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP served as legal adviser. Blackstone Group (BX.N) was the financial adviser for ERA, while DLA Piper served as legal adviser.

147,CAT,APEC CEOs see threats but little impact on business,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Europe’s debt crisis and political gridlock in Washington are heightening business uncertainty among global corporations, but so far CEOs say strong global demand is offsetting any damage. Washington’s problems pose a longer-term threat. Business leaders fear that lawmakers are losing the ability to perform basic functions, making Congress unable to tackle policy needed to ensure the United States remains competitive. For now, companies from Caterpillar Inc to Eli Lilly and Co attending a CEO summit at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, said they are managing any loss of sales caused by turmoil in southern Europe. “We are seeing very minor impact,” Doug Oberhelman, the chief executive of Caterpillar told reporters on the sidelines of the APEC CEO summit here in Honolulu. APEC finance ministers on Thursday agreed that they need to shore up their defenses against fallout from a euro-zone debt crisis that threatens to pose a drag on growth for many months ahead. Oberhelman said the debate about Italy and Greece, which are struggling to stay solvent, has raised the degree of uncertainty in the world. But in terms of Caterpillar’s outlook, strong demand elsewhere has offset any losses. “Other parts of Europe and Eastern Europe and Africa are doing fairly well and will more than compensate for southern Europe in our industry,” he said. The world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer recently reported a surprising 44 percent increase in its quarterly results, driven by strong demand for mining equipment and construction machinery. Resource and construction industries are expanding rapidly to meet robust demand from China and other fast-growing emerging economies. Likewise, Nissan Motor Co’s corporate vice president told reporters there had been no impact on the Japanese automaker’s business. Eli Lilly, which has drug manufacturing and sales offices in Italy as well as dozens of other facilities around the world, is more on the front lines of the European crisis. In southern Europe, the 10th largest pharmaceutical company essentially depends on payments from governments since health care is largely funded by those countries’ authorities. “We are feeling the aftershocks of this crisis ... with pressure on pricing and in some cases delays in payments. But we are managing through that,” Lilly’s Chief Executive John Lechleiter told Reuters. “The impact so far has not been material.” After pulling through the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession, Caterpillar’s CEO said he expected the company to manage its business “no matter what.” “I am hopeful that the European authorities will find a way through that, but if they don’t we are prepared,” Oberhelman said. FedEx Express’ chief operating officer would not say whether the fallout had spilled into the shipping company’s operations, but Michael Ducker told Reuters: “We are doing what we have to do to manage this. “We have great flexibility in our business.” In the United States, companies are growing frustrated with Congress where Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided over how to reduce the $15 trillion U.S. public debt. “As businesses we are very concerned about it. Problems have to be solved. The political debate has gotten so caustic it has gotten in the way of that,” Tom Craren, managing partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, told Reuters. Lawmakers meeting in a special committee are trying to strike a longer-term deal to reduce the deficit. They have two weeks left to come up with a proposal. Many Republicans oppose raising taxes, while Democrats oppose deep cuts in social programs. The conflict follows a chaotic August budget fight, which nearly saw a government shutdown and a debt default. Business leaders urged compromise. “The U.S. fiscal problem has to get solved because long term it is not sustainable,” Craren said. Microsoft Corp’s chief research and strategy officer, Craig Mundie, also voiced concerns over the gridlock in Congress. “The deadlock that everybody observes in Congress, people outside the country, it makes them worried about whether the necessary policy things will get done,” Mundie told Reuters. A protracted fight over how to raise the country’s borrowing limit and rein in spending caused Standard & Poor’s to downgrade the United States’ top credit rating in August.

Barloworld said on Monday it was in early talks with Caterpillar to distribute more of its products, after the U.S. firm bought out mining equipment maker Bucyrus International in a $7.6 billion deal earlier this year. Barloworld, the biggest dealer of Caterpillar products in southern Africa, benefits as miners invest more on equipment such as trucks and loaders to meet booming commodities demand. “These results are a reflection of what has been happening in the mining industry,” said Byron Lotter, a portfolio manager at Vesact Asset Management. “We’ve seen record results from BHP Billiton, good numbers from the likes of Anglo American and that has flowed through to Barloworld’s results.” Barloworld, which also sells and leases cars and forklifts, reported diluted headline earnings per share of 461.2 cents for the year to end-September, compared with 170.3 cents a year earlier. That was well above the 428.8 cents average estimate in a Thomson Reuters poll of nine analysts. Headline EPS is the primary profit measure in South African, strips out certain one-off items. Shares in Barloworld, which are up about 4 percent so far this year, jumped as much as nearly percent following the results. The shares were up 1.4 percent at 70.50 rand at 1021 GMT. Sales were up 22 percent to 49.8 billion rand ($6.3 billion), helping it boost annual dividend by 107 percent to 155 cents per share. Barloworld expects the strong growth to continue in the 2012 fiscal year albeit at slower rate in the second half due to the higher base. “While commodity prices are off their highs, they are anticipated to remain favourable for mining investment and production,” Chief Executive Clive Thomson said.",11142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/barloworld/update-2-barloworld-year-beats-estimates-eyes-bucyrus-rights-idUSL5E7ME04G20111114

North American dealer sales rose 38 percent in the period, faster than the 26 percent growth reported in the three months ended Sept. 30. Dealer sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were up 32 percent, slower growth than the 41 percent rate reported a month earlier. Rising concerns about Europe’s spreading sovereign debt crisis have investors focused on the continent.

151,CAT,Caterpillar president -- replacement demand strong,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Caterpillar Group Inc (CAT.N) President Stu Levenick said on Monday the company is seeing “surprising” strength in replacement demand for machinery in developed markets and is confident Europe can still be a great market for the company despite near-term expectations for “pretty paltry” overall economic growth. Levenick, speaking to Reuters during the Global Manufacturing & Transportation Summit, said Caterpillar is “keeping a close eye on what’s going on in Europe” and is not planning for a break-up in the euro zone. He reiterated the company’s forecast for about 1 percent gross domestic product growth in the euro zone next year. Levenick said Caterpillar is hopeful that a new highway bill could be passed in coming months, spurring demand for the company’s machinery. “The theme we’re trying to drive with policy makers is that this is the foundation of an economy (and) the U.S. is woefully behind as you measure it against the rest of the world.” He said Caterpillar is optimistic that additional progress could be made when it comes to investments in water resources, water infrastructure, and air transport — all areas which could positively impact Caterpillar due to the range of products it sells. Caterpillar is capping off a 2011 performance widely expected to be strong. Excluding major acquisitions, sales and revenues are projected to grow 31 percent, while profit per share is expected to grow 75 percent in 2011. The Peoria, Illinois, maker of heavy machinery has recently made major acquisitions, including the $8.8 billion purchase of Bucyrus International, a major mining company. Levenick said the company is currently focused on “effectively integrating” recent acquisitions it has made, but is keeping an eye on additional opportunities. He said the company’s balance sheet could handle more acquisitions if the right opportunity presented itself. Caterpillar has announced several new capacity investments in recent months around the world. Those investments include a variety of initiatives in the United States. “We’re not necessarily growing our business in Illinois, but we’re reinvesting in the capacity we’ve got to make it much more efficient. So the U.S. has got a fair amount.” He said expanding capacity at a fast enough rate to keep up with global demand increases creates a major concern for the company. “Frankly the biggest thing we’re concerned about is our capacity (installation) speed ... To get that in place in a reasonable amount of time is a challenge,” Levenick said, noting that even though the company is making announcements, manufacturing capacity takes considerable time to install. “These are long-term investments.” (For summit blog: blogs.reuters.com/summits/) ",12122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-manufacturing-summit-caterpillar/caterpillar-president-replacement-demand-strong-idUSTRE7BB1AS20111212

153,CAT,Economic turmoil delays Caterpillar's logistics sale,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Tuesday it remained in talks with interested parties over a potential sale of its third-party logistics business but several factors including the global economic environment have caused delays in reaching a deal. Caterpillar said the company would not have a decision on the strategic review of its logistics business before the end of the year. It is hopeful that a decision can be reached in the first quarter of 2012 given the current market and business trends, Caterpillar said in a statement to Reuters. In March, Caterpillar said it would examine a range of options for its third-party logistics business including a potential sale, and hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Robert W. Baird & Co to advise on the process. Private equity firms TPG Capital, Centerbridge Partners and BC Partners were the final suitors left in the running for the logistics business, which could fetch more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. Two sources said Caterpillar’s final negotiations focused on TPG Capital as the buyer, but cautioned that there was no certainty that a deal would be reached. TPG and Centerbridge declined to comment while BC Partners did not respond to a request for comment. The third-party logistics unit — part of Caterpillar’s wholly owned subsidiary, Caterpillar Logistics Services Inc — was formed 24 years ago in response to requests from other companies that wanted to use Caterpillar to ship parts all over the world.

Hastings Deering is the principal Australian subsidiary of Sime Darby Industrial. As part of the deal, nearly 400 former Bucyrus employees are expected to transition to Hastings Deering, it added. The portion of the former Bucyrus distribution business was included in Caterpillar’s acquisition of Bucyrus International, a major mining company, in November 2010.

The world’s largest maker of construction machinery on Monday reported substantial increases in three of the four major regions in which it does business — North America, Europe and Asia. Growth in Latin America continued to slow. North America represented Caterpillar’s strongest region of growth, increasing 41 percent after gains of 38 percent in October and 26 percent in September. Latin American sales were up 8 percent after gains of 16 percent and 33 percent in the prior two months. The Caterpillar report came as Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW.N) reported a slowdown in its organic growth rate in November. The Glenview, Illinois, company said organic revenue — excluding currency translation and acquisitions — grew 4 percent in the three months ended November 30, down from 7 percent in the three months ended October 31. ITW makes a variety of products, from auto components to construction supplies to industrial packaging. Caterpillar reports machine and engine sales on a monthly basis. Sales of reciprocating and turbine engines climbed 15 percent in November compared with a year earlier, led by the petroleum and electric power segments. Caterpillar shares were up 1 percent at $88.21 in afternoon trading. The gains came despite wide weakness in the market, led by slumping financial stocks.

156,CAT,Caterpillar unit rejects CAW contract extension request,"* Contract for Ontario locomotive workers ends Dec 31 * Caterpillar open to mediator, rejects extension Dec 31 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc said a Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) labor contract that expires Saturday at midnight will not be extended despite the union’s request for two more months of talks and a mediator. Caterpillar’s Electro-Motive Canada subsidiary has been negotiating a new labor contract for locomotive production workers at a plant in London, Ontario with the CAW for several months, but the parties have run into a road block over terms. On Friday, union members authorized a strike against Caterpillar’s operation if the company imposes unilateral changes. In a statement emailed to Reuters, Caterpillar’s subsidiary said it received a request for a two-month contract extension from the CAW in order to make time for mediation. Caterpillar said it already granted a six-month extention earlier in 2011 and “does not see the value of any further extension.” It is unclear whether the dispute will lead to a labor stoppage or trigger the unilateral contract changes that the union has said it fears. CAW officials were not immediately available for comment. Electro-Motive is part of Caterpillar’s Alabama-based Progress Rail Services division, which competes with General Electric Co and Bombardier Inc. Caterpillar said it has taken steps to ensure Electro-Motive can continue fulfilling orders regardless of what happens in negotiations with the CAW. Electro-Motive said it “indicated to the CAW that while open to discussions with a mediator, any extension of the current collective agreement will not be considered.” The CAW has flagged two major concerns in its dealings with Caterpillar’s subsidiaries. The union has said the company wants to cut pay and benefits by more than 50 percent, and eliminate pensions. CAW officials also see Caterpillar’s move to bulk up Electro-Motive operations outside of Canada as a prelude to a reduction in the Ontario operations, including a potential plant closure. The CAW represents more than 400 workers in London, Ontario. “Throughout this negotiation process, which began seven months ago, Electro-Motive Canada has made it clear to the CAW that the company’s ability to be cost-competitive, enhance product quality and meet on-time delivery commitments is critical,” the company said in a statement. The company said Electro-Motive Canada has offered proposals since May and said the CAW has “not addressed any of the market competitive issues” it faces. The CAW has only offered “conflicting positions,” including refusing any concessions and then allegedly shifting course by offering to consider some non-wage and non-benefit concessions.

158,CAT,Caterpillar profit jumps 58 percent,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc reported a 58 percent rise in quarterly earnings that blew away Wall Street expectations on record sales of construction and mining equipment, and projected strong growth for 2012. The strength seen by Caterpillar, a bellwether for global spending and credit conditions, could be seen as a much-needed boost to those concerned about consumer confidence and sovereign debt. The company’s forecasts have long been seen as one of the more telling indicators of future growth or malaise. Caterpillar’s results cap a record 2011 in terms of revenue and profits, and it posted its biggest yearly growth rate for sales and income since 1947. The company has been a leading name in a U.S. industrial sector that enjoyed a widespread rebound in 2011. Acquisitions, increased demand for mining equipment, high commodity prices and sales growth in construction machinery and parts supported Caterpillar during the year. Price increases and higher inventories also fueled the performance. Investors reacted positively to the report, with shares up 3.2 percent at $112.57, about $4 shy of a 52-week high set in May. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar said it would continue to break records in 2012, with profit expected to rise 25 percent to $9.25 a share and revenue projected to increase between 13 percent and 20 percent. The outlook outpaced analyst expectations and is based on a forecast for higher sales for all geographic regions and business segments except marine engines. “We’re expecting 2012 to be another year of good growth,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a press release. “We have to be prepared for recovery in the developed world beyond 2012 and continued growth in emerging markets.” The company said the U.S. economy will continue to experience slow growth. Meanwhile, China is moderating, and Latin America growth could slow down. It estimated that the eurozone debt crisis could lead to negative growth in the region during the first two quarters of 2012 but “it is unlikely to trigger a worldwide recession,” and sees improvement there by the second half of the year. The company said tax expenses are the biggest challenge in 2012 due to its geographic sales mix and regulations. Caterpillar said construction markets in the United States and Europe remain “depressed,” contrasting the strong growth taking place in emerging regions. Still, the company sees buyers in developed markets snapping up new machinery in order to replace outdated equipment. During a conference call, the company said it expects to “finally” see some growth in U.S. construction spending, but it will remain relatively low. The company is gaining market share in many key regions — including China — putting further pressure on the company’s production capacity. In some cases, customers are on waiting lists that span several years because of these constraints. Buyers of new large trucks are being quoted delivery times into 2014, for instance. Meeting demand will also lead to increased costs as the company scrambles to add capacity in key regions, particularly to meet demand for mining equipment. Caterpillar will invest about $4 billion on capital expenditures in 2012, compared with $2.6 billion in 2011. Caterpillar said it added 14,000 employees in 2011 in order to meet growing demand, 6,500 of which were added in the United States. The company said it exported nearly $20 billion worth of goods in 2011, representing a third of its total revenue for the year. Caterpillar spokesman Jim Dugan said the company anticipates adding more employees in 2012 as it opens or expands facilities. The company posted net income for the fourth quarter of $1.55 billion, or $2.32 per share, compared with $968 million, or $1.47 per share, a year ago. That result was 59 cents above the analysts’ average estimate of $1.73 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 35 percent to $17.24 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $16.05 billion. Caterpillar reported growth in all three of its product sectors — construction equipment, such as bulldozers; resource equipment needed for activities like mining; and power systems, including engines. The resource equipment segment was the fastest-growing unit in terms of sales, but profit growth in the construction business was more robust. It also is seeing steady demand for after-market parts needed for equipment already in use. Increased expenses related to production volume, capacity expansion and incentive compensation added about $450 million worth of costs in the fourth quarter alone. The company also spent money on its Caterpillar Japan restructuring and integrating new business.

159,CAT,"Caterpillar to close London, Ont. locomotive plant","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc has decided to close its Electro-Motive locomotive plant in London, Ontario, and lay off at least 450 workers following several months of unsuccessful contract negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers union. The move deals a tough blow to the Canadian labor market, which has been under pressure from a strong Canadian dollar and the struggle to persuade unionized workers to accept deep concessions in a relatively stable economy. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar said on Friday the closing is taking place because the cost structure of the operation is not sustainable. A contract with Electro-Motive Canada workers in London expired December 31, and Caterpillar had been looking for wage and benefit concessions from the CAW. Electo-Motive was acquired by Caterpillar for $820 million in 2010 and is a part of its Alabama-based Progress Rail Services unit, which competes with General Electric Co and Bombardier Inc. Workers at the London plant have been locked out of the plant since the beginning of 2012 due to the contract dispute. About 200 people are employed in salaried jobs at the London operation. Those employees are expected to help wind down operations following Friday’s decision, but it is unclear how long they will continue working for the company. The union is negotiating severance deals for the hourly workers, CAW President Ken Lewenza said Friday. “It is regrettable that it has become necessary to close production operations at the London facility,” Caterpillar said in a news release. “Progress Rail’s global manufacturing network assures its customers that delivery schedules will not be impacted by this decision.” Electro-Motive makes diesel-electric locomotives, and has facilities in Mexico and Illinois, in addition to London. In an interview, Lewenza said the CAW had not engaged in meaningful conversations with company officials since late December. “We were never in the ring here in a meaningful way,” Lewenza said, in reference to what he believes was a lack of interest at Caterpillar to save the London plant after acquiring the Electro-Motive unit in 2010. “They designed this a year ago, no doubt in my mind,” he said. The plant closure was raised by opposition legislators in the Canadian Parliament on Friday as it coincided with a dismal report on January employment. “We do sympathize with those that have lost jobs but we are creating jobs and we need the Liberals to get on board to help us do that,” said Shelly Glover, parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance. Lewenza will remain in the spotlight in 2012 as the CAW engages in negotiations with the auto sector - including General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co. “We know how to negotiate,” he said. And Canadian workers are a “highly productive, highly skilled” group and they should be “on solid ground because these companies are going to make good money.” However, Lewenza said the CAW cannot sway companies looking to chase the lowest-cost manufacturing base. In Caterpillar’s case, company officials were looking for at least a 50 percent wage cut, a doubling of health-care costs for workers, and a significant rework of pension arrangements, he said. Pat Byrne, the managing director heading management consulting at AlixPartners LLP in New York, said labor unions in Canada need to show more willingness to adjust. “The labor unions (involved) - I’m not sure they really get it in terms of globalization,” Byrne said Friday. “When the Canadian dollar was 65 cents .(Canada) was a near-sourcing opportunity. It’s a whole different ball game.” On Friday, the Canadian dollar was roughly on par with its U.S. counterpart. Lewenza said the Canadian government needs to show more support for the manufacturing sector by holding companies, such as Caterpillar, accountable for decisions after tax incentives have been granted. “You have to have the carrot to entice investment in Canada, but once you produce the carrot, you’ve also got to provide the stick.” ",2032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar/caterpillar-to-close-london-ont-locomotive-plant-idUSTRE81215920120203
160,CAT,"UPDATE 1-Caterpillar selects Athens, Georgia, for new plant","Feb 17 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc has picked a site near Athens, Georgia,  for a plant that will build small tractors and excavators, investing $200 million to shift some production from Japan, the machinery maker said on Friday. The facility will employ 1,400 people once it is fully operational in about five years. Construction will begin in the next 45 days. Another 2,800 jobs will be created among suppliers and other employers, according to the company and Georgia state officials. Caterpillar will export small track-type tractors from the facility. The company moved production from Japan to be closer to customers in North America and Europe, and Athens was picked because of its proximity to the ports in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. The move by Caterpillar comes as President Barack Obama has increasingly positioned so-called insourcing as a key theme heading into the upcoming presidential election. Obama has proposed closing tax breaks for companies that move U.S. jobs overseas, while providing incentives to firms that bring work home, particularly in high-tech manufacturing. The insourcing sentiment was echoed this week by top executives who gathered at an event organized by General Electric Co. Some said that U.S. manufacturers moved their production out of the country too quickly over the past decades and now see a competitive advantage in building up their footprints back home. Caterpillar’s decision, however, did not come without controversy. The Peoria, Illinois, company indicated in recent weeks that higher state income tax rates were a factor in its decision to locate this plant outside of its home state. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn shot back, saying he believed the decision was based solely on Caterpillar’s logistics requirements. Caterpillar first signalled its desire to move work from Japan in November, and at the time said it would also consider sites in Canada and Mexico with good access to ports. It said it did not expect job cuts at its plant in Sagami, Japan. A month later, the company said it had decided to locate the new facility on U.S. soil.

164,CAT,UPDATE 1-Caterpillar taking full control of Japan venture,"* Buying out Mitsubishi Heavy for $450 million * Company strategy centered on emerging markets * Record profits forecast on pick up in U.S., China TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc, the world’s largest heavy machinery maker, said it would spend 36.5 billion yen (about $450 million) to take full control of its Japanese joint venture to strengthen its expansion in Asian markets. The Peoria, Illinois based company said it would buy out Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd’s remaining one-third stake in Caterpillar Japan Ltd, which makes hydraulic excavators and other earthmoving equipment. The deal is expected to close in the April-June quarter. The two companies set up a 50-50 joint venture in 1963. Caterpillar, which competes with smaller Japanese rival Komatsu Ltd, raised its stake to two-thirds in 2008. The latest decision reflects Caterpillar’s strategy to focus on competing in emerging markets of Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Rich Lavin, group president in charge of construction industries and growth markets, said in a statement. The company’s chief executive, Doug Oberhelman, told reporters previously that he expects record sales and profit this year as economic activity in China and the United States picks up. In 2011, Caterpillar booked revenue of $14.99 billion in the Asia-Pacific region, or about a quarter of its total $60.14 billion, according to its financial statement. By comparison, Komatsu booked sales of 1.176 trillion yen ($14.53 billion) when combining Japan, China, and Asia-Oceania sales for the year ended March 2011, its most recently completed full financial year. That was nearly two-thirds of its total annual sales of 1.843 trillion yen ($22.77 billion).

172,CAT,TEXT-S&P; summary: C.A.T. oil AG,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) March 27 - =============================================================================== Summary analysis — C.A.T. oil AG ————————————————- 27-Mar-2012 =============================================================================== CREDIT RATING: BB-/Stable/B                  Country:        Austria Primary SIC:    Oil and Gas Field Services =============================================================================== Credit Rating History: Local currency    Foreign currency 20-May-2011   BB-/B               BB-/B 07-Mar-2008   B+/B                B+/B =============================================================================== Rationale The ratings on C.A.T. oil AG, an Austria-registered oilfield services company that conducts all of its operations in Russia and Kazakhstan, reflect our view of the company’s “weak” business profile and “significant” financial risk profile. C.A.T. oil’s key business risks are, in our view, the industry’s cyclicality, competitiveness, and limited barriers to entry. The company’s small scale limits its pricing power and diversity, and it faces risks inherent to operating in the Russian Federation (foreign currency BBB/Stable/A-3; local currency BBB+/Stable/A-2; Russia national scale ‘ruAAA’). These constraints are partly offset by C.A.T. oil’s strong niche positions in hydrofracturing and sidetracking, which are more resilient to economic downturns than other segments of the oilfield services industry. In view of the company’s recent and ongoing expansion into conventional drilling, we expect sidetracking, fracturing, and conventional drilling each to contribute about one-third of EBITDA from 2012 onward. Our assessment of C.A.T. oil’s financial risk profile takes into account the company’s low leverage, adequate corporate governance practices and transparency, conservative financial policies, and adequate liquidity. S&P; base-case operating scenario For 2012, we anticipate an increase in both revenues and EBITDA, following the company’s ongoing expansion into conventional drilling. We understand that in 2012 CAT oil will start operating nine rigs in Russia. Accordingly, we expect EBITDA for 2012 to be about EUR70 million-EUR80 million, with some upside potential. At the beginning of March 2012, the total order book stood at EUR306 million. For the first nine months of 2011, EBITDA was EUR46 million and the EBITDA margin was about 22%. Operating margins were, however, squeezed by front-loaded startup costs for expansion into conventional drilling. We expect the EBITDA margin to improve closer to 25% in 2012. Key cash flow and capital-structure developments We expect C.A.T. oil’s credit metrics to remain robust in 2012. We believe that the expansion program will be completed in the first half of the year, after which the company’s capital spending requirement will return to maintenance levels, leading to positive free operating cash flow for the rest of 2012. We forecast fully adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt exceeding 100% and debt to EBITDA at much less than 1x at year-end 2012. Reported debt increased to EUR62.4 million as of Sept. 31, 2011, from about EUR7 million at year-end 2010. Liquidity We consider C.A.T. oil’s liquidity to be “adequate.” This reflects ourestimate that the company’s sources to uses ratio will remain above 1.4x over the next 12 months, and that net sources will continue to exceed uses, even if EBITDA were to decline by 15%. The company’s main sources of liquidity include: — Balance sheet cash of about EUR32.8 million as at Sept. 31, 2011, although we believe part of this is tied to operations; — FFO, which we estimate at about EUR51 million in 2011 and EUR60 million in 2012 in our base-case scenario; and — Committed credit lines, notably a EUR100 million revolving facility due November 2015, of which about EUR38 million was undrawn at Sept. 30, 2011. We expect this facility largely to cover the company’s expansion into conventional drilling. The facility contains no financial covenants or material adverse change clauses. Key potential uses of liquidity include: — Short-term debt maturities of close to zero; — Some moderate working-capital outflows, which we estimate at EUR10 million-EUR15 million; — Capital expenditure of about EUR25 million in 2012; and — Dividends, which we estimate at about EUR5 million. The company’s long-term debt of EUR62 million mainly constitutes drawings under the committed credit facility due 2015. Our assessment of C.A.T. oil’s liquidity is constrained by the company’s relatively limited scale and our view that its position in the credit markets is not sufficiently robust as to warrant a “strong” assessment. We note that the committed credit facility carries no financial covenants, which in our view increases flexibility. Outlook The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company will continue to benefit from strong operating cash flow, low leverage, and the supportive oil industry environment. It further reflects our belief that the company will adhere to its prudent financial policies, notably those relating to funding its expansionary capital expenditures and dividend payouts. We consider an EBITDA margin of 20%-25% and a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDA of about 1x as commensurate with the current rating. We believe adjusted debt to EBITDA of up to 2x in a downturn could be accommodated within the current rating. We could downgrade C.A.T. oil if its operating cash flow were to decline or if its investment program and dividend policy were to become more aggressive than we anticipate, leading to a substantial increase in leverage, for example debt to EBITDA exceeding 2x. We do not currently see any potential for ratings upside, mainly because of C.A.T. oil’s small scale of operations and limited diversity in a challenging industry.",3272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA531020120327

174,CAT,Caterpillar's big bet on the U.S. economy,"VICTORIA, Texas (Reuters) - It hasn’t been long since Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) looked like the typical resident of the Rust Belt. Having misjudged how deep the U.S. economy would decline, the world’s largest maker of construction machinery reduced its workforce by 33,000 people worldwide in 2009, closed plants and posted lower profits. But the Peoria, Illinois-based company has mounted a quick recovery and is emerging as the poster child for America’s manufacturing renaissance. In 24 months, 15 Caterpillar facilities have been built or updated in the United States, tens of thousands of workers have been added to the payroll and $2 billion is committed for capital investments on its home soil this year. “We haven’t seen Caterpillar doing this much building in the United States since probably the 1960s,” said Peter Holt, owner of the Holt Caterpillar dealership in San Antonio. Caterpillar is building a $200 million plant two hours southeast of his store, in Victoria, Texas, that is slated to start churning out badly needed excavators later this summer. Underpinning Caterpillar’s U.S. momentum is a flood of demand by heavy equipment users in America - ranging from construction companies to oil drillers to cement producers - who are looking to replace aging machines now that the economy is improving and credit is easier to obtain. But a major U.S. expansion is not without risks for Caterpillar. The U.S. economic recovery could still derail, given high unemployment and weak housing markets. And the growth rate of global machinery sales is also tracking at its slowest pace since May of 2010, although U.S. demand is brisk. Even Holt, the dealer whose family was influential in founding Caterpillar, has a bad taste in his mouth from previous downturns. “Caterpillar has always tried to forecast,” he said. “We’ve never been any good at it (because) there is no consistency in the world economy.” <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic-Nearly half Caterpillar's 31 global expansion projects are in the U.S.: link.reuters.com/gas27s Graphic-Caterpillar's capital spending and employment hit record levels: link.reuters.com/tev27s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Caterpillar has money to spend.

While the company has expanded quickly in emerging markets and new sectors, including mining and railroads, much of its confidence hinges on its faith in a gradually improving U.S. economy. “We came out of the recession much stronger and faster than expected,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a company report in March. “I’m not one for passing up sales, so we really had to ramp up production quickly.” Key to this optimism is Caterpillar’s record order backlog of $30 billion, three times higher than it was in 2009. Some customers will not get trucks they have ordered until as late as 2014. For contractors in south Texas, one of the key drivers of demand is the oil-rich Eagle Ford shale. “You can’t get enough bulldozers and excavators right now,” said Barry Peterson, who buys equipment for Bay Ltd, a Corpus Christie, Texas-based construction company. He often is in the market for used equipment with relatively little wear and tear, but machines made in 2009 and 2010 are nearly impossible to find, forcing Bay to rely on the new market. Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Ed Rapp said the company’s business cycles typically run in six-year increments and the current upswing is still in its early stages. “This time, we’ve tried to invest earlier in the economic cycle... you want to take advantage when the wind is at your back,” Rapp told Reuters in an interview. Meeting the needs of buyers like Peterson and the rest of the market is a risky but necessary proposition for Caterpillar. If it does not move quickly to boost production, Caterpillar risks losing market share to a growing group of global competitors that are edging in on its turf. “There are a lot of them trying to come in,” Peterson said of Caterpillar’s competitors. He said many of those players, including South Korea’s Hyundai (009540.KS) and Japan’s Komatsu (6301.T), are effectively undercutting Caterpillar on price, and have better availability and adequate warranties. “Hyundai has one of the best excavators on the market right now and their price point is 35 percent lower than Caterpillar’s. I buy a lot of equipment and that’s something I look at very closely.” Holt, the dealer, said that availability of machines is a roadblock Caterpillar needs to clear. “We’ve had allocation issues,” he said, referring particularly to excavators - versatile machines that represent Caterpillar’s largest volume product. Despite the current demand-driven expansion, it is not that long ago that the U.S. manufacturing sector was in painful retrenchment. The U.S. auto industry laid off tens of thousands during the last recession as Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Chrysler FIA.MI and scores of parts companies shut plants to compensate for overcapacity. Frank Smith, a 31-year-old production worker at a Caterpillar facility near the company’s headquarters who was laid off in early 2009, knows well the pain such moves can cause. “You go from a lot of overtime and earning quite a bit of extra money to getting an unemployment check,” Smith said, adding that he built a house in Metamora, Illinois only two years before the layoff. “We got rid of all the fun stuff; no more renting movies and going to McDonald’s all the time.” Smith is back working for the company but with the “looming feeling that we are lucky... right now Caterpillar’s going through the roof, exploding with business. But it’s good to have an escape route in case it ever slows down again.” For shop owners like Kelly High in Victoria, a slowdown is not in the plan. His High Brehm western wear outfitter store is located about six miles away from the new excavator plant that Caterpillar has been rushing to complete. Every time the new facility adds a worker, Caterpillar gives them a voucher for a pair of work boots that can be bought exclusively at High Brehm. “We look forward to when they’ve got 600 employees,” High said while standing by racks of cowboy hats and boxes labeled with Stetson and Resistol logos. High isn’t the only Victoria resident rooting for the new employer in town. Fossati’s Delicatessen, a 130-year-old restaurant on Main Street, is often used to host corporate events. Down the street at a local grocery store, significant shelf space has been cleared to make room for a batch of yellow toy bulldozers and dump trucks dressed in CAT logos. Victoria has typically hosted a boom-and-bust economic cycle due to its reliance on the oil industry. In the 1980s, after watching the crude market collapse, Victoria city planners set out on a mission to diversify the economy. When Caterpillar came to town looking for land on which to build its plant, city officials offered a 320-acre site developed specifically for a manufacturer. For now, the company is only using half the land for manufacturing activities, but has plenty of room to grow.

175,CAT,FEATURE-Caterpillar's big bet on the U.S. economy,"* Company expands quickly to meet demand * Dealers, buyers cite shortages of machines * Risks from fragile recovery, Asian competition By John D. Stoll VICTORIA, Texas, April 9 (Reuters) - It hasn’t been long since Caterpillar Inc looked like the typical resident of the Rust Belt. Having misjudged how deep the U.S. economy would decline, the world’s largest maker of construction machinery reduced its workforce by 33,000 people worldwide in 2009, closed plants and posted lower profits. But the Peoria, Illinois-based company has mounted a quick recovery and is emerging as the poster child for America’s manufacturing renaissance. In 24 months, 15 Caterpillar facilities have been built or updated in the United States, tens of thousands of workers have been added to the payroll and $2 billion is committed for capital investments on its home soil this year. “We haven’t seen Caterpillar doing this much building in the United States since probably the 1960s,” said Peter Holt, owner of the Holt Caterpillar dealership in San Antonio. Caterpillar is building a $200 million plant two hours southeast of his store, in Victoria, Texas, that is slated to start churning out badly needed excavators later this summer. Underpinning Caterpillar’s U.S. momentum is a flood of demand by heavy equipment users in America - ranging from construction companies to oil drillers to cement producers - who are looking to replace aging machines now that the economy is improving and credit is easier to obtain. But a major U.S. expansion is not without risks for Caterpillar. The U.S. economic recovery could still derail, given high unemployment and weak housing markets. And the growth rate of global machinery sales is also tracking at its slowest pace since May of 2010, although U.S. demand is brisk. Even Holt, the dealer whose family was influential in founding Caterpillar, has a bad taste in his mouth from previous downturns. “Caterpillar has always tried to forecast,” he said. “We’ve never been any good at it (because) there is no consistency in the world economy.” Caterpillar has money to spend. The company reports first quarter earnings on April 25, with analysts expecting $2 billion of profit on $16 billion in sales, or a 47 percent increase in earnings over the entire course of 2009. Revenue this year is expected to top $71 billion, which would be $20 billion more than the company reaped in 2008.

182,CAT,Caterpillar profit up; outlook seen as modest,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported a 29 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Wednesday and beat analyst expectations as the company relied on its growing mining business and sales to U.S. buyers looking to replace aging equipment. The world’s largest maker of construction machinery also increased its profit guidance for the year, but the new forecast may not be strong enough to comfort investors. Caterpillar stoked Wall Street’s fears over emerging markets by repeatedly citing slowdowns in China and Brazil in its earnings press release. Shares slipped about 2.6 percent in Wednesday trading. “The quarter was good, but guidance was only increased by the amount of the beat and revenue guidance was unchanged,” Jefferies & Co equities analyst Stephen Volkmann said in a note to investors. He said the company’s growing inventory levels “may raise some investor concerns.” In recent quarters, Caterpillar has been a leading player in a U.S. industrial sector that has shrugged off economic fears by posting record profits and providing an optimistic outlook. While emerging markets have provided an increasing slice of sales growth, an improving U.S. economy is increasingly underpinning the performance of these companies. “We just continue to see throughout this quarter that North America continues to be strong for these industrial companies, and that is definitely true for Caterpillar,” Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones, said. While traditional construction markets are weak, North American customers are scrambling to replace aging machinery, including excavators and bulldozers. This is taking place as construction companies work to keep up with a backlog of expansion projects in the United States and Canada, including a relative boom in the energy sector. Many of these construction companies did not buy new machinery during the 2008 through 2010 time frame due to credit constraints and a lack of business. Now, they are rushing into the market, helping drive Caterpillar’s backlog to $30.7 billion, or $10 billion more than it was a year ago. Another factor driving Caterpillar is growing strength in the mining business, which was bolstered by its 2011 acquisition of Wisconsin-based Bucyrus. The company’s power equipment sales, including locomotives and engines needed for gas and oil companies, are also running at a solid clip. “We remain on track...at a time when U.S. construction activity remains depressed and economies in Europe, China and Brazil have slowed,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a press release. The slowing in China and Brazil comes as those countries “took steps in 2011 to slow their economies and bring inflation under control,” Oberhelman said. Both economies are expected to ease their policies. “Although it’s tough to predict the exact timing, we expect positive economic growth moving forward,” Oberhelman said. The company will need its prediction to hold as it steadily installs and expands global production capacity, leading to a brisk hiring pace and increased costs related to lifting production and headcount. In addition, material costs — including steel prices — continue to rise. Analysts were encouraged by the company’s incremental profit margins during the quarter, which were robust even as the company only modestly raised prices. “We thought the quality was good, especially in margins that continue to improve without relying on the pricing lever,” Rob Wertheimer, a Vertical Research Partners analyst, said. The company’s strategy of lifting profit margins via productivity and cost improvements on the plant floor is paying off, he said. The strength in North America as emerging markets sag is actually a positive trend for Caterpillar, Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said. Chinese customers tend to buy a larger percentage of smaller, less-expensive machinery while buyers in established markets more often opt for bigger goods. Caterpillar reported net earnings of $1.6 billion, or $2.37 per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.84 per share, a year earlier. Caterpillar’s sales rose 23 percent to $16 billion during the first quarter, the company said. Analysts on average had projected a profit of $2.13 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue, however, fell short of the $16.2 billion that Wall Street had expected. The company increased its profit outlook for the year to $9.50 per share from $9.25 previously. The outlook for revenue, however, remained in the range of $68 billion to $70 billion. Caterpillar’s resources segment, which includes mining, was delivered a 73 percent increase in revenue and a 46 percent jump in earnings. Construction products reported a 13 percent jump in both sales and profit. ",4252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar/caterpillar-profit-up-outlook-seen-as-modest-idUSBRE83O0KE20120425

184,CAT,Caterpillar braces for strike amid labor dispute,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) expects a strike early Tuesday morning at its Joliet, Illinois plant after talks with the union broke down Monday just hours after union workers there overwhelmingly turned down a new six-year contract. Caterpillar spokesman Rusty Dunn said the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or the IAM, has informed the company that it will strike after the current contract expires after midnight on May 1. But the world’s largest maker of construction machinery does not expect a strike to disrupt production at this point, Dunn said. The labor dispute comes as Caterpillar is scrambling to meet growing demand for its machinery in North America. About 800 workers at the company’s Joliet manufacturing facility are covered under a contract. Steve Jones, an official with the IAM Local 851 that represents affected workers, said Caterpillar’s offer was rejected because it calls for “wage stagnation” over the next six years and higher health care premiums. “We’re going to be in a much worse economic position six years from now than we are now,” Jones said. He said the union has informed Caterpillar that it is willing to meet, but said there are no further negotiations currently scheduled. Caterpillar spokesman Rusty Dunn said the outcome of the vote, which took place on Sunday, was “unfortunate” and that the company hoped to avoid a work stoppage. But production will continue, even if the current workforce decides to walk out. “The Joliet facility will continue to work safely, meet production levels and conduct business as usual as we focus on meeting customer needs,” Dunn said. “Caterpillar has work plans, processes, policies and people ready to be deployed in the event of any business interruption, whether it is a tornado, fire or a strike.” Jones said union officials expect striking workers to remain calm and orderly even if replacement workers are deployed to the plant. Dunn said Caterpillar and the IAM had been negotiating for more than a month. Specific terms of the new labor pact were not disclosed by Caterpillar, but Dunn said the company had put forth a “competitive contract offer.” IAM officials were not immediately available for comment. IAM workers in the Joliet plant produce hydraulic components and systems for a variety of Caterpillar machines, including track-type tractors, wheel loaders and mining trucks. The labor dispute in Joliet follows a high-profile conflict between Caterpillar and the Canadian Auto Workers late last year. Caterpillar had employed hundreds of CAW-represented workers at a London, Ontario locomotive plant. The company closed the plant after failing to come to terms with the CAW.

187,CAT,Caterpillar workers strike; rejected signing bonus,"(Reuters) - About 800 workers at a Caterpillar Inc plant in Joliet, Illinois went on strike early Tuesday morning less than two days after rejecting a six-year contract that included a $5,000 ratification payment and participation in the company’s annual bonus plan. The employees, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, rejected the deal because it did not include sufficient pay raises and called for higher health care costs, a union official said. On Monday, the union and Caterpillar broke off negotiations indefinitely. Caterpillar has responded to the strike by bringing in replacement workers so that it can continue meeting production schedules as planned, spokesman Rusty Dunn said on Tuesday. The workers on strike produce hydraulic components and systems for a variety of Caterpillar machines, including track-type tractors, wheel loaders and mining trucks. Steve Jones, an official with the IAM Local 851, said about 50 workers showed up to the picket line in Joliet on Tuesday morning. No further negotiations are scheduled with Caterpillar, he added. The labor dispute comes as Caterpillar is racing to fill growing demand in North America and in the global mining sector. While the company has experienced a slowdown in China, Europe and Brazil, it is relying on its strength in North America and its mining business to offset that weakness. IAM’s strike also follows a high-profile labor dispute that took place late last year between Caterpillar and the Canadian Auto Workers at a locomotive plant in London, Ontario. CAW workers voted down a Caterpillar offer, and the company ended up closing the plant and moving the work elsewhere. Caterpillar posted details of its proposed contract on an informational website: jolietbargainingupdates.cat.com. It listed key terms of the potential deal under the heading “Highlights of the final offer.” The top highlight — “$5,000 up-front ratification bonus for all employees” — has been crossed out with a red line because the contract was overwhelmingly rejected during a ratification vote Sunday night. Last year, workers represented by the United Auto Workers at an Oshkosh Corp plant in Wisconsin rejected a contract offer that included a significant signing bonus. The UAW and Oshkosh eventually came to terms, but workers did not receive the ratification payment. Other details of the offer that appear to still be on the table include participation in the company’s so-called incentive compensation plan and “market-based wage adjustments” for employees hired over the past seven years. Workers hired before May 2, 2005, would have wages frozen. Under terms of the agreement, Caterpillar would guarantee the Joliet plant would not close. On Monday, the IAM’s Jones told Reuters that Caterpillar’s recent offer was rejected because it calls for “wage stagnation” over the next six years and higher health-care premiums. “We’re going to be in a much worse economic position six years from now than we are now,” Jones said. Caterpillar has said its proposed deal represented a “competitive contract offer.” Shares of Caterpillar were down 55 cents at $102.22 in mid-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The workers on strike produce hydraulic components and systems for a variety of Caterpillar machines, including track-type tractors, wheel loaders and mining trucks. Steve Jones, an official with the IAM Local 851, said about 50 workers showed up to the picket line in Joliet on Tuesday morning. No further negotiations are scheduled with Caterpillar, he added. The labor dispute comes as Caterpillar is racing to fill growing demand in North America and in the global mining sector. While the company has experienced a slowdown in China, Europe and Brazil, it is relying on its strength in North America and its mining business to offset that weakness. IAM’s strike also follows a high-profile labor dispute that took place late last year between Caterpillar and the Canadian Auto Workers at a locomotive plant in London, Ontario. CAW workers voted down a Caterpillar offer, and the company ended up closing the plant and moving the work elsewhere. Caterpillar posted details of its proposed contract on an informational website: jolietbargainingupdates.cat.com. It listed key terms of the potential deal under the heading “Highlights of the final offer.” The top highlight — “$5,000 up-front ratification bonus for all employees” — has been crossed out with a red line because the contract was overwhelmingly rejected during a ratification vote Sunday night. Last year, workers represented by the United Auto Workers  at an Oshkosh Corp plant in Wisconsin rejected a contract offer that included a significant signing bonus. The UAW and Oshkosh eventually came to terms, but workers did not receive the ratification payment. Other details of the offer that appear to still be on the table include participation in the company’s so-called incentive compensation plan and “market-based wage adjustments” for employees hired over the past seven years. Workers hired before May 2, 2005, would have wages frozen. Under terms of the agreement, Caterpillar would guarantee the Joliet plant would not close. On Monday, the IAM’s Jones told Reuters that Caterpillar’s recent offer was rejected because it calls for “wage stagnation” over the next six years and higher health-care premiums. “We’re going to be in a much worse economic position six years from now than we are now,” Jones said. Caterpillar has said its proposed deal represented a “competitive contract offer.” Shares of Caterpillar were down 55 cents at $102.22 in mid-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",5012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpillar-joliet/update-1-caterpillar-workers-strike-rejected-signing-bonus-idUSL1E8G16PS20120501

The employees, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, firmly rejected the company’s six-year contract offer during a vote Sunday night. On Monday, union officials said talks had ended with Caterpillar.

190,CAT,Caterpillar braces for strike amid labor dispute,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) expects a strike early Tuesday morning at its Joliet, Illinois plant after talks with the union broke down Monday just hours after union workers there overwhelmingly turned down a new six-year contract. Caterpillar spokesman Rusty Dunn said the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or the IAM, has informed the company that it will strike after the current contract expires after midnight on May 1. But the world’s largest maker of construction machinery does not expect a strike to disrupt production at this point, Dunn said. The labor dispute comes as Caterpillar is scrambling to meet growing demand for its machinery in North America. About 800 workers at the company’s Joliet manufacturing facility are covered under a contract. Steve Jones, an official with the IAM Local 851 that represents affected workers, said Caterpillar’s offer was rejected because it calls for “wage stagnation” over the next six years and higher health care premiums. “We’re going to be in a much worse economic position six years from now than we are now,” Jones said. He said the union has informed Caterpillar that it is willing to meet, but said there are no further negotiations currently scheduled. Caterpillar spokesman Rusty Dunn said the outcome of the vote, which took place on Sunday, was “unfortunate” and that the company hoped to avoid a work stoppage. But production will continue, even if the current workforce decides to walk out. “The Joliet facility will continue to work safely, meet production levels and conduct business as usual as we focus on meeting customer needs,” Dunn said. “Caterpillar has work plans, processes, policies and people ready to be deployed in the event of any business interruption, whether it is a tornado, fire or a strike.” Jones said union officials expect striking workers to remain calm and orderly even if replacement workers are deployed to the plant. Dunn said Caterpillar and the IAM had been negotiating for more than a month. Specific terms of the new labor pact were not disclosed by Caterpillar, but Dunn said the company had put forth a “competitive contract offer.” IAM officials were not immediately available for comment. IAM workers in the Joliet plant produce hydraulic components and systems for a variety of Caterpillar machines, including track-type tractors, wheel loaders and mining trucks. The labor dispute in Joliet follows a high-profile conflict between Caterpillar and the Canadian Auto Workers late last year. Caterpillar had employed hundreds of CAW-represented workers at a London, Ontario locomotive plant. The company closed the plant after failing to come to terms with the CAW. Shares of Caterpillar closed down 1.8 percent at $102.77 on Monday.

191,CAT,IAM plans rally as Caterpillar strike hits week 2,"* Union walked off Caterpillar job on May 1 * 800 workers affected by strike * Negotiations currently on hold * Company meeting production needs with replacements May 8 (Reuters) - Union members at a Caterpillar Inc  plant in Joliet, Illinois have scheduled a rally for Friday to gather support for their strike against the company, which is now in its second week. About 800 Caterpillar employees, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, walked off the job on May 1 after negotiators failed to agree on a new contract. Caterpillar responded by bringing in replacement workers so that production schedules could stay on track. “We’re doing this to rally the troops and bring the community into what is happening,” Steve Jones, an official with the IAM Local 851, said on Tuesday. Talks between the IAM and Caterpillar are currently on hold. “No new negotiations are scheduled,” Caterpillar spokesman Rusty Dunn said. “The Joliet facility continues to work safely and effectively.” Caterpillar has characterized its recent proposal, delivered in April, as its “final offer.” The company posted details about its offer on jolietbargainingupdates.cat.com. Caterpillar’s offer was rejected because it did not include sufficient pay raises and called for higher health care costs, union officials said. Caterpillar’s six-year contract offer had included a $5,000 ratification payment and participation in the company’s annual bonus plan. The plant produces hydraulic components and systems for a variety of Caterpillar machines, including track-type tractors, wheel loaders and mining trucks.

193,CAT,TEXT-S&P; summary: Caterpillar Inc.,"We expect the slow global economic recovery and good mining demand to support 	 continued increases in demand for Caterpillar’s products in 2012. This year we 	 expect equipment sales growth at close to 20%, benefiting from the Bucyrus 	 International Inc. acquisition, which closed in mid-2011. We also expect that 	 profitability will remain good, with adjusted EBITDA margin of about 17% this 	 year. We believe the equipment operations’ free cash flow should comfortably 	 exceed $2 billion. We believe Bucyrus is a good strategic fit for Caterpillar. The acquisition 	 expanded the company’s offering of mining products, presents synergy 	 opportunities, and added a business with adjusted EBITDA margin in the 	 high-teens. Caterpillar’s credit measures following the largely debt-financed 	 acquisition deteriorated less than we had initially anticipated because of 	 strong operating performance and cash flow generation. Our ratings on Caterpillar incorporate our expectation of operating 	 volatility, although we expect continued growth in 2012. We expect that 	 Caterpillar’s operating performance will remain very cyclical, reflecting the 	 volatility of important end markets including construction and mining. For 	 instance, in 2009, results deteriorated significantly amid a weaker global 	 economy; equipment sales declined nearly 40%. Subsequently, revenue growth has 	 been strong, and with improving economic conditions we believe Caterpillar is 	 likely to achieve more than $68 billion of equipment operations revenue in 	 2012. We believe the company has the financial capacity to weather downturns while 	 maintaining overall credit quality. Adjusted for Standard & Poor’s captive 	 finance method and allowing for 10x debt to equity of Caterpillar’s financial 	 services operations, adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to total debt was 	 close to 40% at the end of the first quarter. We expect that Caterpillar will 	 post adjusted FFO to total debt of about 45%-50% this year, in line with our 	 expectation for the current ratings. These measures will vary considerably 	 during the course of the operating cycle. Adjusted debt for Caterpillar’s 	 equipment operations includes sizable underfunded pension and postretirement 	 obligations—about $7 billion on a tax-adjusted basis. We believe the 	 company’s pension and other postemployment benefit funding requirements are 	 manageable, given its ability to generate cash. Liquidity Liquidity is strong. We expect sources of funds will be more than 1.5x uses 	 over the next two years. In addition, we believe Caterpillar has solid 	 relationships with banks and high standing in credit markets. The company’s captive finance operation maintained good access to bond markets 	 throughout the financial downturn and continues to have solid access. On March 	 31, 2012, consolidated cash and short-term investments totaled about $2.9 	 billion. Total credit lines available to equipment and financial services 	 operations to support commercial paper (CP) totaled about $8.5 billion. These 	 included a $3.86 billion, five-year facility expiring in September 2016; a 	 $2.09 billion, four-year facility expiring in 2014; and a $2.55 billion, 	 364-day facility expiring in September 2012. The company also has about $4.4 	 billion of other credit lines. Outstanding CP was manageable, at $3.5 billion 	 at the end of the quarter, and availability under credit lines for the 	 consolidated company was substantial—about $7.1 billion. CFSC, Caterpillar’s finance subsidiary, is an active issuer of CP and 	 medium-term notes and has demonstrated access to asset-based securitization 	 markets in the past. The company’s past-due financial receivables have 	 decreased from their peak, to about 3% as of March 31, 2012, from about 4% a 	 year earlier. Caterpillar’s debt maturities are manageable, and substantial near-term debt 	 maturities at CSFC largely match receivables collections. The company manages 	 fixed- and floating-rate interest exposure through swaps and its issuance of 	 fixed- and floating-rate medium-term notes. Caterpillar has no rating triggers 	 or contingent obligations that could considerably affect liquidity. Outlook The outlook is stable. Credit measures are improving with help from a better 	 operating environment and the company’s cost reductions. Given currently 	 decent end-market conditions, we expect continued improvement in credit 	 measures, which have recently approached levels we consider appropriate for 	 the ratings. We could lower the ratings if favorable operating trends reverse or if the 	 company engages in further debt-financed acquisitions or share repurchases 	 that weaken credit measures significantly. We would consider a downgrade if, 	 for example, we expected adjusted FFO to total debt to decline to less than 	 30% at the end of 2012 without prospects for rapid near-term improvement, or 	 if this measure appears unlikely to return to the 45%-50% range in the coming 	 years. An upgrade would probably require Caterpillar to pursue a more conservative 	 financial policy such that funds from operations to total debt would be 	 50%-55% over the operating cycle. In addition, we would look for the company 	 to dampen cyclicality—possibly by increasing its more stable service 	 offerings or by further diversifying its product offerings.

195,CAT,Caterpillar dealer equipment sales slow in April,"May 17 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s dealers reported slowing growth in their sales of heavy equipment in April, with the sharpest deceleration coming in the Asia-Pacific region, the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. Global equipment sales were up 12 percent in the three-month rolling period ended in April, slower than the 18 percent rate reported for the March period, the Peoria, Illinois-based company said. Asia-Pacific region sales were up 5 percent, slower than the 15 percent recorded for March. Sales of the company’s power systems — used on industrial job sites and energy-producing projects, for instance — rose 5 percent in the period through April, after declining 1 percent in the period through March. That lift was driven by strong demand from the petroleum sector, which was up 26 percent in April the April period, building on a 12 percent rise in the March period. Caterpillar shares fell 3.3 percent to $88.81 on the New York Stock Exchange.",5172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpilllar-sales/caterpillar-dealer-equipment-sales-slow-in-april-idUSL1E8GH5OK20120517
196,CAT,WRAPUP 4-U.S. firms eye Myanmar as sanctions suspended,"* US approves investment by energy, mining, banking firms * Myanmar welcomes “excellent” decision * Rights groups say US move overlooks wars on minorities * GE says looking at opportunities in health, energy * Caterpillar aims to step up financial presence By Andrew Quinn and Alison Leung WASHINGTON/HONG KONG, May 18 (Reuters) - The suspension of U.S. sanctions barring investment in Myanmar in response to political reforms in the poor Southeast Asian state opens the door to U.S. companies queuing to scout for business in one of the last frontier markets. Industrial heavyweights including General Electric Co  and Caterpillar Inc are joining rivals from Asia and Europe that have already moved into a market of up to 60 million people in the former British colony. Analysts and experts have said there will be opportunities for foreign companies across the industrial landscape - from energy, mining and construction to agriculture, finance and tourism. GE, the biggest U.S. conglomerate, said on Friday it was working with the Myanmar government on possible infrastructure projects and opportunities in the healthcare and energy sectors. “We are looking at healthcare. We are working with the government on energy. Eventually we will look into all of the infrastructure businesses,” GE Vice Chairman John Rice told Reuters in Hong Kong. “We are looking at Yangon’s power needs, working with the ministry and the government to figure out how we can help reduce some of the shortages,” said Rice, who runs GE’s global operations and visited Myanmar in April. Even before the suspension of sanctions, Caterpillar sold its bulldozers and excavators in Myanmar through an independent dealer - an arrangement it uses around the world. The suspension will allow the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment to use its financial services arm to help that dealer expand. “There had been prohibitions on financial services support, and as we understand it these would be lifted (with the suspension of sanctions) and we believe this will give us an opportunity to support that dealer better, to better allow them to expand and grow and support the customers in the market,” said Jim Dugan, a spokesman for the Peoria, Illinois-based company. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the suspension of sanctions at a news briefing on Thursday with Myanmar Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin, on his long-isolated nation’s first official visit to Washington in decades. “Today we say to American business: invest in Burma and do it responsibly,” Clinton said. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has huge gas resources, but a dysfunctional power grid, with nationwide rolling blackouts. A spokesman for automaker Ford Asia told Reuters: “It’s very encouraging to see the rapid and positive developments ... We are sure Ford will find opportunities to participate in this ongoing transformation.” Hotel chains and airlines are also looking for a chance to move in — earlier this year executives of Starwood Hotels & Resorts and Marriott International said they were interested in opening properties in the country. “The country won’t be the same in five years as global competition to make investments and provide services heats up as a result of this U.S. policy decision,” said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition. The International Monetary Fund has estimated Myanmar’s gross domestic product at a little more than $50 billion. Neighbouring Thailand, with a population of about 67 million, has a GDP of $348 billion. Clinton said Washington would issue a general licence to permit U.S. investments across Myanmar’s economy, allowing U.S. energy, mining and financial services companies to look for opportunities in an economy which is rapidly re-opening after having been run down by five decades of military rule. But she stressed the laws underpinning U.S. sanctions on Myanmar would remain - as leverage while pushing the government further on democratic reforms. “We are suspending sanctions. We believe that is the appropriate step for us to take today,” Clinton said. “We will be keeping the relevant laws on the books as an insurance policy, but our goal and our commitment is to move as rapidly as we can to expand business and investment opportunities.” Myanmar welcomed the announcement. “It is excellent,” Industry Minister Soe Thein said in an interview with Reuters in the capital, Naypyitaw. “This morning I heard the news and I am very, very happy. “For the investor, financial sanctions are very important. Because of them, I haven’t been able to move ... The U.S. can invest in a lot of areas.” Soe Thein, who met GE’s Rice in Naypyitaw last month, said  the company was interested in leasing generators to supply electricity to Yangon. An official in Yangon said the project would consist of four generators of 25 megawatts each. President Barack Obama, elaborating on the policy shift, said Washington would work to “ensure that those who abuse human rights, engage in corruption, interfere with the peace process, or obstruct the reform process do not benefit from increased engagement with the United States”. Myanmar’s reformist, quasi-civilian government took office a year ago and has started overhauling its economy, easing media censorship, legalizing trade unions and protests, freeing political prisoners and agreeing to cease-fires with ethnic minority rebels. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has a seat in parliament. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, Myanmar’s biggest opposition force, won a 1990 election by a landslide but the  military refused to cede power and for two decades suppressed the party’s activities, jailing many of its members. In response, the United States and other Western countries imposed sanctions that drove the country closer to China. Now, Derek Mitchell, the State Department’s coordinator for policy towards Myanmar, is to be nominated U.S. ambassador. Pro-democracy advocates have urged the United States to move cautiously, saying sanctions are an important tool to maintain pressure on the government to follow through on pledges of greater democratic openness. Illustrating those concerns, the United Nations is investigating reports of possible weapons-related deals between North Korea and Myanmar, according to a confidential report seen by Reuters. In preparation for a likely wave of foreign investment into the resource-rich economy, Myanmar’s central bank said it would seek to weaken its newly floated kyat currency and prevent further rises that could derail economic reforms. “In the near future there will be a massive inflow of foreign direct investment, and as a result Myanmar’s kyat is expected to appreciate. We will do our best to prevent this,” Nay Aye, a deputy central bank governor, told Reuters in an interview. Hans Vriens, a Dutch consultant and adviser to European companies and the Myanmar government, said the economy was “desperate for foreign investment and especially for Western investment” as it didn’t want to be “a client state of China”. “The regulatory system is completely outdated,” Vriens told Reuters. “It’s difficult to import, difficult to export. They need to modify that most of all. The government means well and they’re very open to asking for advice, but you need to remember that the government is staffed by former generals. “They know how to fight an insurgency, but they don’t know how to run an economy,” he said. Some human rights activists remain wary. U.S. Campaign for Burma, which opposes wholesale lifting of sanctions until the government makes deeper reforms, said Myanmar’s army continues to wage a campaign against the Kachin ethnic minority in northern Myanmar and the new U.S. policy would do little to stop it. Bill Davis, Burma Project director of the group Physicians for Human Rights, said Kachin and other ethnic minority groups whose homelands hold Myanmar’s natural resources told him in interviews they were “still afraid of the government”. “If the people of Burma do not trust their government, the U.S. administration should not either,” he said.",5182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-myanmar/wrapup-4-u-s-firms-eye-myanmar-as-sanctions-suspended-idUSL4E8GI89L20120518
197,CAT,Caterpillar sees chance to raise profile in Myanmar,"(Reuters) - Following the U.S. move to lift trade sanctions that had limited investment in Myanmar, Caterpillar Inc aims to use its financial services arm to boost its presence in the poor Southeast Asian nation. The world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment had already sold its bulldozers and excavators in the country through an independent dealer, but had to maintain an arm’s-length distance from that company due to the rules that prohibited direct U.S. investment. “The opening up of opportunities with the decision on sanctions is something that will allow us to have a more traditional relationship with the dealer there,” said Jim Dugan, a spokesman for the Peoria, Illinois-based company. The biggest change is that its finance arm — which accounted for 4.6 percent of its $60.14 billion in revenue last year — will now be able to lend money to its local dealer to help finance sales of Caterpillar equipment and expand its footprint in the country, which has huge natural gas reserves but an under-developed infrastructure after two decades of military rule, which ended after elections last year. “There had been prohibitions on financial-services support, and as we understand it these would be lifted (with the suspension of sanctions) and we believe this will give us an opportunity to support that dealer better, to better allow them to expand and grow and support the customers in the market,” Dugan said. Like many big industrial companies, also including General Electric Co, Textron Inc and Harley-Davidson Inc, Caterpillar operates a financial services unit intended to make it easier to sell its products. Asia has broadly emerged as a weak spot for Caterpillar sales this year, largely due to slowing Chinese investment in construction and infrastructure. The company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that its dealers’ sales in the region grew at just 5 percent in the three months ended in April, down from 20 percent in the three months ended in February.

199,CAT,Caterpillar workers reject contract; strike goes on,"(Reuters) - Striking workers at a Caterpillar Inc plant in Joliet, Illinois, on Wednesday rejected the company’s latest contract offer, an official with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said. Of roughly 800 workers at the plant, 620 voted, and 81 percent of them rejected the proposed contract. Union official Steve Jones said they did so because proposed pay raises were too small and it included higher health-care costs. The factory makes hydraulic components and other systems for Caterpillar loaders and mining trucks. Jones said the workers plan to continue the strike they began on May 1. The world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment is running the facility with management-level workers. “Our sole focus now is on continuing to run the Joliet facility in a safe, efficient and productive manner,” said Caterpillar spokesman Rusty Dunn. “With today’s result, the company will now prepare to take the Joliet contingency work plan to the next level to ensure the facility’s long-term success.” Talks between the union and the Peoria, Illinois-based company have broken off since the strike was called. Jones said the union offered to reopen negotiations after the vote but it was rebuffed by management. “We told them we’re available to meet when we notified them of the results, and they said if our position hasn’t changed, there is no need,” Jones said. Caterpillar said there is “a significant gap” between the two sides. “It is unfortunate that the union’s unworkable and impractical approach to these labor negotiations has led to this result,” Dunn said. The strike follows a labor showdown last year between Caterpillar and workers represented by the Canadian Auto Workers union at a locomotive plant in London, Ontario. Those workers rejected a Caterpillar offer, and the company ended up closing the plant.

Natgas prices have fallen to levels of $2 per million British thermal units from about $10 in 2008 as surging output from shale fields has flooded the market. U.S. diesel prices have changed little over the last one year, costing about $3.9 per gallon at the end of May. “Many of our customers are asking for natural gas-powered equipment in order to reap the financial and environmental benefits,” Steve Fisher, a vice president at Caterpillar, said in a statement.

206,CAT,Manufacturing execs fight fear with flexibility,"* European demand no worse than expected-execs * Caterpillar, 3M officials ready to react * Euro crisis, U.S. job worries fuel investor angst By Scott Malone and Nick Zieminski June 5 (Reuters) - Facing a rising current of economic worry, manufacturing executives are taking their cue from yoga. Flexibility is their mantra. Officials from big U.S. industrials including Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co said they have not seen a sharp deterioration in European demand — which they had expected to be weak — but stand ready to cut back if things get worse. The lessons of the 2007-2009 recession, which big manufacturers weathered by slashing tens of thousands of workers, are burned in their brains. “You do have to be prepared and you do a lot of work ahead of time on flexibility,” said Rich Lavin, group president at Caterpillar who oversees emerging markets and construction operations. But he noted the Peoria, Illinois-based company has not seen demand for its earth-moving equipment decline. The company looks for profit to rise about 2 8 percent this year to $9.50 per share. “In our particular case, we have a significant chunk of our workforce which is flexible, temporary, contract agency people,” Lavin told an investor conference organized by J.P. Morgan. “We have quite a bit of flexibility within our labor agreements to do temporary facility shutdowns, if need be.” Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment, employs about 127,000 full-time and 28,000 “flexible” workers worldwide. Investors have become increasingly concerned over the past few weeks that Europe’s financial crisis will throw the 17-nation currency bloc into a sharper downturn and derail the United States’ tepid recovery from the recession. That has taken a toll on stocks. The widely watched Standard & Poor’s 500 index has fallen almost 7 percent over the past month and its industrial component is down 9 percent. Adding to worries, Friday’s U.S. payrolls report showed fewer jobs were added than expected jobs in May, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent. One of Lavin’s peers, 3M Co Chief Financial Officer David Meline, said the company was also ready to react if the economy sours. “We have the flexibility should there be a significant downturn in the economy. We don’t believe that to be the case right now,” said Meline. He told the J.P. Morgan conference he had just returned from a trip through Germany and France and had not seen any significant change in European demand for 3M products, which range from films for TV screens to Post-it notes. “Right now, I don’t have anything to indicate we’ve seen some significant inflection,” Meline said. Despite investors’ fears, executives overall haven’t seen a sudden change in European demand — which was expected to be weak this year. “We haven’t seen a marked change in end-market demand overall,” said Jeremy Smeltser, a SPX Corp vice president who will become CFO this summer. “Europe has been softer than the rest of the world for us, year to date, but we haven’t seen major change.” Lavin emphasized that while Caterpillar would be ready to cut production in the face of a drop in demand, it has no plans to jump the gun on a downturn. “This is the third year in a row we’ve had this summer crisis of confidence in the world economy,” Lavin said. “You don’t completely discount it, but you have to manage your business based on what you’re actually seeing on the ground and it really hasn’t changed that much.”",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-manufacturing-flexibility/manufacturing-execs-fight-fear-with-flexibility-idUSL1E8H58HO20120605

Apple Inc results fell short of Wall Street’s expectations as the European economy sagged and consumers held off buying the company’s flagship iPhone ahead of a new version expected in the fall. Apple’s stock lost 3.9 percent to $577.60. The sour news from the consumer technology giant was offset by reports from Boeing and Caterpillar, which strengthened industrial stocks and helped boost the Dow industrials. Shares of Caterpillar rose 1.4 percent, giving up some earlier gains, as the company remained cautious on its outlook. Cat rallied sharply in the morning after the company noted an improvement in U.S. home sales, an assertion belied by a weak report on U.S. home sales from the Commerce Department. “The comments in Caterpillar’s earnings report was that they were seeing a recovery in housing and then to get some news after that it was maybe not, that maybe took some of the CAT inflation away,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. Housing stocks ranked among the worst performers after the biggest drop in U.S. single-family home sales in more than a year. The PHLX housing sector index tumbled 2.1 percent, pulled lower by a 2.6 percent drop in D.R. Horton shares to $18.19. The S&P; 500 is testing support at its 50-day moving average at 1,332.85. The benchmark index broke through that level on Tuesday, but rebounded above it after reports the Fed was likely to provide more stimulus. Both the Dow and the S&P; 500 had received a lift at the start of Wednesday’s session from a report in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday afternoon that Federal Reserve officials are moving closer to taking more steps to aid the flagging economy. Expectations that the Fed will act, maybe as soon as its rate-setting meeting next week, have been growing. Tuesday’s story, while nothing new, helped cement that view. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 94.49 points, or 0.75 percent, to 12,711.81. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 3.46 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,341.77. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 2.34 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,865.33. Caterpillar’s quarterly profit easily beat Wall Street’s expectations, helped in part by growing sales of mining equipment. The world’s largest maker of construction machines also raised its 2012 forecast. Boeing also helped the Dow, reporting a greater-than-expected increase in second-quarter profit and raising its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday as rising airplane deliveries offset higher pension costs. Boeing’s stock gained 2.7 percent to $73.99. Ford Motor Co. reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit on Wednesday, but roughly doubled its forecast for losses in Europe, where a deepening economic crisis pushed  the auto industry’s sales to their lowest level in nearly 20 years. Ford shares slid 0.9 percent to $8.98. Of the 195 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings to date for the second quarter, 64.6 percent have reported earnings above analysts’ expectations. Wall Street had sold off for three straight days on fears that Spain may need a bailout and signs that the global economy is starting to slow down. Despite the pessimism, the S&P; 500 is up 6.8 percent this year, and is one of the best-performing broad stock indexes in the world.",7252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-edges-up-despite-apples-miss-idUSL2E8IPD3820120725
215,CAT,"Caterpillar boosts outlook, remains cautious on growth","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, raised its 2012 profit forecast on Wednesday and said the global economy was slowly improving amid pockets of weakness. The outlook came after Caterpillar posted a quarterly profit that trounced Wall Street forecasts due to higher sales of bulldozers, marine engines and mining trucks. Sales rose 31 percent in North America, helped by the 2011 acquisition of Wisconsin-based mining equipment provider Bucyrus. The continent is Caterpillar’s strongest growth area, executives said on a conference call with investors. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales rose 15 percent, although sales of excavators and backhoes were flat. Business for many customers has not returned to pre-recession levels, but aging equipment is forcing them to invest in new machines, a boon for Caterpillar. “You just get to a point where (large equipment) gets to the end of usable life, and you get into a replacement cycle,” Caterpillar chief financial officer Ed Rapp said in an interview. “Contractors, even if they’re doing the same amount of work as before, just have to buy new machines. That’s a factor that we’re definitely seeing in our numbers.” Sales to energy and rail customers are the strongest product growth areas, with housing showing “some signs of stabilizing,” Rapp said. The company raised its annual earnings forecast by a dime a share but beat second-quarter expectations by 26 cents, making the new 2012 target easier to hit. Still, analysts cautioned that Caterpillar — like the rest of the world — is not yet out of the woods. “It’s not that there’s lots of fear in Caterpillar numbers, but everyone is affected by the much weaker global outlook,” said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten. Caterpillar is “beginning to see signs of it across their business, though their business is still holding up for this year.” Executives warned that Caterpillar’s third quarter typically is slower due to summer production slowdowns, which could dampen sales. If necessary, Caterpillar is willing to take the same defensive actions it took in 2008 and 2009, Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said. During that period, the company laid off thousands of workers and temporarily furloughed others to cut costs. “While we’re expecting a record year in 2012, we understand the world is facing economic challenges, and if it becomes necessary, we are prepared to act quickly,” Oberhelman said. “The good news is, this doesn’t feel like 2008.” Many of Caterpillar’s customers did not buy new machinery from 2008 through 2010 due to credit constraints and a lack of business. Now, to replace aging machines, they are rushing into the market, helping lift Caterpillar’s backlog to $28.2 billion, up 11 percent from a year ago. For the second quarter, Caterpillar reported a profit of $1.67 billion, or $2.54 per share, compared with $1.02 billion, or $1.52 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of $2.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 21 percent to $17.37 billion. Analysts expected $17.11 billion. The company now expects to earn $9.60 per share in 2012, up from a previous forecast of $9.50. For the year, analysts expect a profit of $9.54 per share. The results and outlook came after Caterpillar said on Tuesday that its global retail sales for the quarter had risen 11 percent from a year earlier. After Caterpillar posted results, its shares rose nearly 5 percent in early trade. Caterpillar came off its highs after weak U.S. housing data but remained up more than 1 percent at $82.39 in afternoon trade.

The factory makes hydraulic components and other systems for Caterpillar loaders and mining trucks. The company has been staffing the facility with temporary hires and office workers since the strike began.

217,CAT,WRAPUP 1-U.S. growth offsets Europe's woes for some industrials,"* Caterpillar, Boeing beat Street view, raise forecasts * Ford warns that Europe’s troubles taking a toll on profit * Caterpillar CEO ready to react if economy worsens * U.S. companies increasing profit, lagging on revenue By Scott Malone BOSTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Some U.S. manufacturers shook off weak European demand in the latest quarter, with makers of products ranging from bulldozers to cars finding solid demand at home was enough to offset weakness abroad. Caterpillar Inc, Ford Motor Co, Boeing Co  and Rockwell Automation Inc reported earnings that topped Wall Street’s expectations. Caterpillar and Boeing raised their forecasts for the rest of the year, while Ford and Rockwell cut theirs, in part due to Europe’s ongoing financial crisis. Wednesday’s earnings reports were less grim than a day earlier when United Parcel Service Inc, printer maker Lexmark International Inc and phone company AT&T; Inc  warned that belt-tightening by their corporate customers was taking a toll on results. “The U.S. has a few positive things going for it. There’s a stronger currency, which will draw in investment, the housing sector is slowly repairing itself and commercial construction is still very tepid but that’s not going to get worse and could become a positive,” said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio. “I don’t think we’re looking at a recession or a recessionary environment (in the United States), we’re just looking at a really slow period,” he said. Sixty-five percent of the 195 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index  that have reported earnings so far this quarter have topped Wall Street estimates, with earnings on average up 13.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But the majority — 59 percent — have missed revenue forecasts, with mean revenue up just 3.9 percent. Even at companies that had managed their way around Europe, that economic crisis remained foremost in executives’ minds. “We understand the world is facing economic challenges, and if it becomes necessary, we are prepared to act quickly as we did in late 2008 and 2009,” said Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman. The world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment slashed about 20,000 jobs in 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis. “While we’re prepared, the good news is, this doesn’t feel like 2008,” Oberhelman said. “Interest rates are low, central banks are prepared to inject more liquidity if needed, and housing is coming off lows, not a peak, and seems to be improving.” Caterpillar’s results benefited from strong demand from Asian and North American mining sectors. North American equipment sales rose 34 percent in the quarter, while sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up 25 percent. Demand for mining equipment also lifted Rockwell Automation in the quarter. CEO Keith Nosbusch said that reflected the fact that mining equipment is a less-discretionary purchase for a corporate customer than office gear such as printers and phones. “Mining tends to be a tough application where the equipment wears out,” Nosbusch said. “If your mines are running and producing — and because of the commodity prices they are — you tend to have to maintain them and part of that means replacement equipment.” No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford beat analysts’ expectations in the second quarter but warned investors it now expects operating profit to decline for the year due to mounting losses in Europe. “As we look over the next five years and lay out all of our plans for our business, we just think the situation in Europe is going to be challenging,” Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters at Ford’s headquarters. Boeing, which reported better-than-expected 3 percent earnings growth and is on track to overtake European rival Airbus as the world’s largest plane maker, tried to restrain Wall Street’s enthusiasm. CEO Jim McNerney warned in a slide presentation for analysts that “global economic growth continues at a slow pace (and) uncertainties remain.” Caterpillar shares were up 0.9 percent at $82.13 on Wednesday afternoon, while Ford stock was down 0.9 percent at $8.98. Boeing shares were up 2.8 percent at $74.04. All three trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Companies reporting results on Wednesday generally saw solid revenue growth in North America, for two reasons: demand was higher and the value of their sales in Europe was reduced by the slump in the euro currency versus the dollar. Rockwell Automation, a maker of equipment that runs factories and other industrial processes, saw its fastest sales growth in Canada, where demand from miners helped drive sales up 19 percent. Sales in the United States — its largest market —  rose 6 percent, and revenue fell 6 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as Latin America. It reported third fiscal-quarter profit that topped Wall Street’s expectations, but cut its forecast for the rest of the year, sending shares down 1.7 percent to $64.05 on Wednesday afternoon. TE Connectivity, the former Tyco Electronics, also reported relatively stronger results in the Americas — where its sales were up 1 percent — versus Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where they fell 8 percent. The maker of electronic connectors said it expected a further slowing in Europe in the current quarter, partly because of production shutdowns among auto manufacturers. Investors will obtain a deeper sense of how the industrial sector is holding up on Thursday, when blue-chips United Technologies Corp and 3M Co report results. “I would suspect there will be some downgrading of expectations, because they’re such a leveraged play on the global infrastructure build-out in developing economies,” said Robert McIver, co-portfolio manager of the Jensen Quality Growth Fund, referring to United Tech.",7252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-corporate-results/wrapup-1-u-s-growth-offsets-europes-woes-for-some-industrials-idUSL2E8IP4SF20120725

Apple Inc results fell short of Wall Street’s expectations as the European economy sagged and consumers held off buying its flagship iPhone ahead of a new version expected in the fall. Apple’s stock lost 4.8 percent to $572.04. The Dow advanced slightly following stronger-than-expected earnings from Caterpillar and Boeing. “We had a little bounce this morning on the Caterpillar and Boeing news. A little positive news certainly set the day off right, but certainly hard to sustain, given that there was competing negative news,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. Both the Dow and the S&P; 500 had received a lift at the start of Wednesday’s session from a report in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday afternoon that Federal Reserve officials are moving closer to taking more steps to aid the flagging economy. Expectations that the Fed will act, maybe as soon as its rate-setting meeting next week, have been growing. Tuesday’s story, while nothing new, helped cement that view. On the earnings front, Caterpillar’s quarterly profit easily beat Wall Street’s expectations, helped in part by growing sales of mining equipment. The world’s largest maker of construction machines also raised its 2012 forecast. Caterpillar’s stock rose 0.8 percent to $82.06. Earlier, it hit a session high at $85.42. Boeing reported a greater-than-expected increase in second-quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday as rising airplane deliveries offset higher pension costs. Boeing’s stock gained 2.2 percent to $73.63. Ford Motor Co. reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit on Wednesday, but roughly doubled its forecast for losses in Europe, where a deepening economic crisis pushed  the auto industry’s sales to their lowest level in nearly 20 years. Ford shares slid 0.9 percent to $8.98. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 41.70 points, or 0.33 percent, to 12,659.02. But the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 2.14 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,336.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 9.36 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,853.63. The S&P; 500 is testing support at its 50-day moving average at 1,332.73. The benchmark index broke through that level on Tuesday, but rebounded above it after the Wall Street Journal’s story that the Fed was likely to provide more stimulus. Housing stocks ranked among the worst performers after data from the Commerce Department showed the biggest drop in U.S. single-family home sales in more than a year. The PHLX housing sector index tumbled 2.1 percent, pulled down by a 2.2 percent drop in D.R. Horton shares to $18.26. Of the 195 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings to date for the second quarter, 64.6 percent have reported earnings above analysts’ expectations. Wall Street has sold off for three straight days on fears that Spain may need a bailout and signs that the global economy is starting to slow down.

221,CAT,Caterpillar exporting China-made goods,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) has begun exporting Chinese-made machinery to the Middle East and Africa, part of a plan to offset a dip in China’s economic growth, a top official at the company said in an interview. The move by the world’s largest maker of construction equipment is only temporary and the company still expects China to remain its fastest growth market, Richard Lavin, who oversees Caterpillar’s business in China, told Reuters. Lavin declined to name specific countries in the Middle East and Africa where the Chinese-made goods are headed, or list the amount of product, but noted front-end loaders and excavators comprise the bulk of exports. “The global economic situation, especially the situation in China, has presented us a short-term opportunity to serve very specific markets with some supplies over the last half of 2012,” he said. “But that is not part of overall strategy for China.” China’s economy has been pressured this year by a drop in its domestic property market and high inflation, with the economic growth rate slowing to 7.6 percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace in more than three years. That is reflected in waning demand for the machinery Caterpillar makes at its 18 Chinese plants, and caused a glut of inventory. While Caterpillar’s Chinese sales are small — in the first quarter they only comprised 3 percent of total revenue — the company has been aggressively growing in the country and believes the country will fuel growth for years. Worries about China’s slowdown overshadowed Caterpillar’s strong first-quarter profit and did little to bolster second-quarter results earlier this year. The Chinese government recently cut interest rates and is planning to boost infrastructure spending, both of which Caterpillar expects to help its sales. “It will have a positive effect on our industry,” Lavin said. “The Chinese government has shown itself to be pretty adept over history at being able to pull the right levers at the right point in time to adjust growth trajectories.” Typically, though, any boost to the construction industry from interest rate cuts doesn’t happen until six-to-nine months after government action, Lavin said. That would help results for the first quarter of 2013, but not 2012, reflecting previous comments from Caterpillar executives who not expecting any “material improvement” in China this year. The rate cuts “cause us to be somewhat more optimistic” about 2013, said Lavin, who is based in Hong Kong. “The growth story for China is still quite compelling.” The latest Reuters benchmark poll forecasts that China’s economy should recover modestly in the second half of the year, with third-quarter growth of 7.9 percent and fourth-quarter growth of 8.2 percent. The pending change in China’s top political leadership later this year and early next won’t affect Caterpillar’s expansion plans, Lavin said. Chinese President Hu Jintao must retire from running the country’s Communist Party later this year and from the presidency in early 2013. “China has shown itself capable to manage these leadership transitions seamlessly,” Lavin said. “I think what we can expect is stability in the transition, and that’s going to be good for the economy and good for industry.” ",8082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-interview/caterpillar-exporting-china-made-goods-idUSBRE8771PU20120808
222,CAT,"John Deere reminds you it makes bulldozers, too","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deere & Co (DE.N) is best known for its mammoth green farm tractors and combine harvesters, but much of its growth potential is in the construction equipment market, taking on Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and Komatsu Ltd (6301.T). The brutal U.S. summer drought is killing large swaths of the nation’s corn crop, sparking concerns among investors that farmers could delay new machinery purchases. As the drought intensified in the past month Deere’s shares fell 2 percent. By contrast, shares of Caterpillar, which does not make agricultural equipment, gained 6 percent. Amid all the bad agriculture news, investors do not give Deere enough credit for its construction business, analysts say. The company expects emerging market sales of bulldozers, front-end loaders and dump trucks to help double annual revenue to $50 billion in 2018 from $25 billion in 2010. “I think John Deere is in a sweet spot. To me, the stock is dirt cheap,” said Gary Bradshaw of Hodges Capital, who manages Deere shares for clients and holds the stock in his personal portfolio. “Construction sales will definitely help Deere grow its business, even if their main focus is agriculture.” The Moline, Illinois-based company’s construction and forestry unit brought in $5.37 billion in revenue last year, roughly 17 percent of total revenue. That more than doubled from 2009 levels, when construction sales only brought in 12 percent of total revenue. Agriculture remains Deere’s bread and butter, contributing about 80 percent of 2011 revenue. There are also concerns about the impact on construction spending from the slowdown in China’s economic growth, the eurozone debt crisis and the looming U.S. fiscal stalemate. But Deere’s net income should jump 10 percent each year for the next three years, and its stock’s intrinsic value is 75 percent higher than current levels, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, which analyzes top analyst opinions. Intrinsic value is a measure of how much shares should be worth when considering expected growth rates over the next decade. Deere declined to comment ahead of its quarterly earnings release next Wednesday, when it will further outline growth expectations. Deere’s 2011 construction revenue eclipsed the $3.88 billion in construction equipment revenue last year from rival CNH Global NV CNH.N, which is being acquired by Fiat Industrial FI.MI, but was well below the $19.67 billion in revenue from Caterpillar’s construction industries unit. Analysts expect Deere to report earnings of $2.32 per share for its fiscal third quarter ended July 31, according to StarMine, a 37 percent jump from a year ago. Revenue is expected to grow 23 percent to $9.48 billion. “Agriculture will likely remain three-quarters of Deere’s business in the long run,” said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. “But construction is more and more an important part of Deere’s portfolio.” Analysts say Deere’s success as the world’s largest farm equipment maker and the outsized presence of rival Caterpillar stifles its ambitions in the construction industry. The color green, part of Deere’s brand identity, coats every piece of farm equipment the company sells. Celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher don Deere baseball caps on top-rated TV shows, giving free advertising. But the color yellow is also part of Deere’s stable. The color is usually considered by many as Caterpillar’s trademark, reflecting its success in defining the market and Deere’s challenge as it works to boost construction equipment sales. “Deere is no slouch in the construction business, but certainly they don’t have the pricing power or the market strength to be able to push around the market like Caterpillar can,” said Fleck, the Morningstar analyst. “I think that’s reflected in the fact that Deere’s construction equipment is yellow. They had to conform to the norms, which were set by Caterpillar, rather than set their own way.” Not every Caterpillar product is more expensive than rival Deere machines, but Caterpillar has the ability to boost prices before Deere given its market dominance, Fleck said. For instance, a new Caterpillar 980K front-end loader in Minnesota was recently priced around $438,000, about 31 percent higher than John Deere’s comparable 844K model. Most of Deere’s construction sales are in North America, but a rising middle class in Russia, Brazil, China and India is expected to increase demand overseas, analysts say. “In India and China, Deere will be able to leverage off its already strong brand name in farm equipment,” said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with Longbow Research.

223,CAT,Caterpillar signs tentative deal with striking workers,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, said it has signed a tentative, 6-year agreement with workers at a plant in Joliet, Illinois, to end a nearly 4-month-long strike. The deal still needs to be approved by the union’s roughly 800 workers, and a vote is scheduled for Friday. If approved, each union member will receive a $1,000 ratification bonus, according to Marion Modesitt, a union member who has seen the contract. Workers will not return to the plant, which makes hydraulic parts for much of Caterpillar’s construction equipment, until the contract is ratified, a company spokesman said. A representative of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers confirmed a tentative deal had been reached, but declined to comment on the details. The strike began on May 1, when the union rejected an initial contract that would have included a $5,000 ratification payment for each union member and participation in the company’s annual bonus plan. Union members rejected the deal because it did not include sufficient pay raises and called for higher health care costs, a union official said at the time. Caterpillar used office workers and temporary labor to staff the plant, and said production did not dip during the strike. The company’s proposal to the union earlier this year included “market-based wage adjustments” for employees hired over the past seven years. Workers hired before May 2, 2005, would have wages frozen as Caterpillar said they were already paid above-market wages. The two-tier wage structure offers starting pay of about $14.75 an hour, more than $10 an hour less than many workers hired before that contract were paid. Caterpillar says the lower rate better corresponds to wages offered at its peers. The tentative contract announced on Wednesday offers workers hired after 2005 an automatic 3 percent raise annually for the life of the contract. Workers hired before 2005 will not receive a raise, if the contract is ratified. The contract also increases health care costs for all employees at the plant. Marion Modesitt, 58, who has worked at Caterpillar for more than 38 years, said she will vote against the contract. “They’re screwing everybody. We have our lives set on the wages we have now, but our insurance costs are going to double over the life of the contract,” said Modesitt. The Illinois strike follows a high-profile labor dispute that took place late last year between Caterpillar and the Canadian Auto Workers at a locomotive plant in London, Ontario. CAW workers voted down a Caterpillar offer, and the company ended up closing the plant and moving the work elsewhere. Shares of Caterpillar fell about 0.3 percent to $87.61 late Wednesday afternoon.

232,CAT,Caterpillar sees China stimulus helping in 2013,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Caterpillar (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, expects a $157 billion Chinese infrastructure spending drive to feed through to its sales next year, boosting its operations both locally and in North America. China has given the go-ahead to 60 infrastructure projects as it seeks to export weakness resulting from Europe’s debt crisis and a slow U.S. recovery that have dragged its economic growth to a three-year low. President Hu Jintao pitched the stimulus plan in a keynote speech on Saturday to business leaders attending an Asia-Pacific summit, drawing an enthusiastic response from Caterpillar’s top regional executive. “It’s very good news,” Richard Lavin, who oversees Caterpillar’s China business, told Reuters during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Russia’s eastern port of Vladivostok. “To have President Hu ... talking about infrastructure and the role it plays in ongoing stable economic development ... I thought that was really exciting.” Highlighting increasing downward risks to global growth, Hu said in his speech that China would “leverage the role of infrastructure in boosting domestic demand, creating jobs and improving people’s livelihood”. Hu reeled off a list of areas where China needed to upgrade its infrastructure - in agriculture, energy, water conservation and information technology. He also called for a buildout of transport networks, listing railways, highways, waterways, airports and pipelines. Lavin said he expected details of the infrastructure spending plan to become clearer in the next few days or weeks, but Hu’s comments suggested “it’s going to be very broad in its application”. “He talked about roads, bridges, airports, sewage systems, energy - all of these are areas that we play in, it’s the core of our business,” said Lavin, who is Caterpillar’s group president and is based in Hong Kong. “I think we can expect a fairly broad and significant impact across our business.” Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., posted record earnings in the second quarter, and forecasts 2012 revenues of $68-$70 billion this year and earnings per share of $9.60 - which would also be records. The company has, however, suffered a slide in China as the far larger stimulus package - put into effect in response to the global financial crisis of 2008 - created a raft of bad debts that weighed on the construction sector. Chinese economic growth slowed to 7.6 percent in the second quarter of the year and, in his speech, Hu cautioned that growth was facing “notable downward pressure”. Chinese sales as a share of Caterpillar’s overall business slipped to 3-3.5 percent last year from 6 percent in 2010, and should roughly hold pace with overall sales this year, Lavin said. He predicted a positive impact from the stimulus in 2013. The company, which has 18 plants in China and nine under construction, has suffered from overcapacity and has started temporarily exporting machinery made there to the Middle East and Africa, but expects its bet on the long-term China growth story to work out. “I would fully expect that the heavy focus on earth moving-type work - roads, airports, bridges - that it’ll have a very positive effect on our China manufacturing,” said Lavin. “We don’t serve China 100 percent from China - we import machines for construction, also for mining, from outside of China, principally from North America. We expect to see a boost from North America, as well as in China.” (This story corrects executive’s job title, paragraph 10) ",9082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-stimulus-caterpillar/caterpillar-sees-china-stimulus-helping-in-2013-idUSBRE88701Q20120908

234,CAT,Caterpillar dealers post double-digit sales growth for summer,"Sept 21 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s dealers reported a double-digit sales jump for the three-month period ended in August, partly due to strong sales in North America as customers replaced aging equipment. Retail dealers for the world’s largest heavy equipment maker reported a 13 percent sales increase for the June-through-August period. The figure is down slightly from the 14 percent increase for the May-through-July period, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar said dealer sales in North America — where most of the company’s revenue comes from — were up 24 percent for the period, and dealer sales in Asia/Pacific — the second-largest region — were up 27 percent. While the U.S. economy remains depressed, many construction firms are having to replace aging heavy equipment, boosting Caterpillar and its peers. Sales in China have been dented this year, Caterpillar executives have said, and the company began exporting Chinese-made machines earlier this summer. The company does brisk business in Australia and other Asian nations, though, and expects China’s recently announced $150 billion in stimulus spending to help results by next year. Caterpillar, whose competitors include Japan’s Komatsu Ltd  and South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd , said dealer sales were flat in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Dealer sales fell 5 percent during the period in Latin America. Caterpillar shares were down 29 cents at $92.25 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",9212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpillar-retail/caterpillar-dealers-post-double-digit-sales-growth-for-summer-idUSL1E8KL68X20120921

236,CAT,Caterpillar cuts 2015 forecast as growth slows,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) cut its 2015 earnings forecast on Monday, blaming a perfect storm of sluggish economic recovery and sliding commodity prices around the world even as it stressed it does not expect the global economy to slip back into recession. “We’ve seen a slowing in economic growth more than we expected,” Caterpillar CEO Doug Oberhelman told analysts and reporters in Las Vegas. “We expect fairly anemic and modest growth through 2015.” Prices for coal and iron ore have dropped more than 20 percent this year, causing many customers of the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment to rethink capital expenditures. The company now expects to earn $12 to $18 per share in 2015, down from its previous forecast of $15 to $20. “It’s prudent, especially with what’s happened in 2011 and 2012 in the economy, to readjust,” Oberhelman said. “I, for one, am still thinking $15 to $20 (earnings per share by 2015), but we need better economic growth.” Caterpillar shares fell 2.2 percent to $88.88 in after-hours trading on Monday. The new forecast comes a year after Caterpillar paid $7.6 billion for mining equipment maker Bucyrus International, the most in Caterpillar’s 87-year history. The buyout added mining shovels and draglines to the company’s lineup of trucks and excavators to become the world’s largest producer of mining equipment. Given the weak economy, though, some on Wall Street have questioned the timing of the deal. Among the world’s eight largest miners, only three are boosting capex spending next year. Vale VALE5.SA, which has the largest capex budget among miners, plans to cut its 2013 mining budget by 4 percent from 2012 levels. Capital expenditures in the mining sector could slip at least 10 percent by 2014, JPMorgan estimates. Since roughly 70 percent of spending in mines is for large trucks, capex cuts are not good news for Caterpillar and peers that include Komatsu (6301.T). Caterpillar spends roughly 30 percent of its own capex and most of its research and development dollars on mining products. Given the mining market uncertainty, Caterpillar’s forecast cut was not a complete surprise to Wall Street, where many had kept expectations low ahead of Monday’s event. The economic trouble has taken its toll on Caterpillar’s stock price: shares have slipped 15 percent in the past six months. Still, many analysts remain bullish, with price targets above $100 per share and hopes for the company to continue to provide the large equipment needed when a global economic recovery occurs. The forecast cut is “a realistic reflection of the slowdown in the global economy,” said Oliver Pursche of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund, which owns Caterpillar shares. “We’re not overly surprised by the announcement.” Recent commentary from railroad Norfolk Southern (NSC.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) has also tempered investor expectations about global and U.S. economic growth. “Certainly in the short-term there are some headwinds, but long-term ... we’re still bullish on Caterpillar,” Pursche said. Oberhelman, who joined the Peoria, Illinois-based company right out of college in 1975 and has had the top job since 2010, said Caterpillar remains committed to China despite slowing growth there. “By 2015, at the latest, we will be the market share leader in China for all of our construction equipment,” he said. “This little slowdown allows the industry to consolidate, and we intend to be there when it recovers and win there.” Excavator sales are down roughly 40 percent in China so far this year, though, and are expected to improve only slightly next year, according to data from Off-Highway Research. Caterpillar began exporting Chinese-made machinery earlier this summer to the Middle East and Africa, part of a plan to offset a dip in China’s economic growth. In Australia, BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) and other miners have delayed expansion of mining projects and buying equipment. Caterpillar acknowledged the slowdown there, but said it expects only a temporary blip and for sales to resume next year. “We are seeing some delays” in Australia, Steve Dunning, the Caterpillar executive who oversees the mining business, said at the analyst presentation. “Some of our customers are pushing orders out six months, nine months. But we’re talking in terms of months, not any longer than that.” Caterpillar executives spoke during the MINExpo mining exhibition in Las Vegas, a global convention for mining suppliers that takes place every four years. In a sign of how seriously Caterpillar takes its investment in the mining sector, all 16 members of the company’s board of directors flew to Las Vegas for the convention. The company spent heavily on MINExpo, securing the largest exhibitor space at 55,000 square feet and hosting 6,000 customers. Caterpillar displayed more than 100 products, including a locomotive so heavy that the company had to reinforce the floor at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Minutes before the close, Caterpillar cut its earnings forecast for 2015, citing weakness in the world economy. Its stock fell 0.9 percent to $90.87 and was the top drag on the Dow. After the bell, Caterpillar’s stock lost another 2.1 percent to $88.99. An index of German business sentiment declined for a fifth consecutive month in September, showing Europe’s strongest economy was moving closer toward recession as the euro zone’s debt crisis remains unresolved. Concerns about a stalling global economy also were reflected in energy and technology shares, with the S&P; energy index  down 0.5 percent and the S&P; 500 technology index  down 0.8 percent. But the S&P; 500 is on track for a 7.6 percent gain for the quarter. Analysts said investors are probably now participating in “window dressing,” where fund managers add some of the latest outperformers to their portfolio. “Hedge funds remain somewhat short the market, and the end of the quarter is coming up, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see equity markets push a bit higher over the near term,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist of RDM Financial, in Westport, Connecticut. The gains have largely been tied to central bank stimulus plans. On Sept. 6, the European Central Bank announced its bond-buying plan; a week later, the Federal Reserve unveiled a third round of quantitative easing intended to bolster the economy and reduce U.S. unemployment. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 20.55 points, or 0.15 percent, to close at 13,558.92. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 3.26 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,456.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 19.18 points, or 0.60 percent, to end at 3,160.78. Dragging down the Nasdaq, Apple Inc fell 1.3 percent to $690.79 even as its latest iPhone sold out. Concerns arose that the company was unable to produce the new phone quickly enough to meet demand. Among other high-profile tech decliners, Facebook  shares dropped 9.1 percent to $20.79. It was the Nasdaq’s most actively traded stock. In contrast, shares of Google Inc, the world’s No. 1 search engine, climbed to a record high of $750.04 as analysts said its solid advertising business and its revenue make the company look more attractive compared with once-hot newcomers to the social media scene. Google’s stock closed at $749.38, up 2.1 percent. In the energy sector, the PHLX oil service sector index  shed 1.4 percent, while U.S. crude oil declined 1 percent to settle at $91.93. Worries about global demand pushed crude prices down more than 6 percent last week. For the third quarter so far, the energy sector has performed well, however, with the S&P; energy index up 10.6 percent so far. Shares of home builder Lennar Corp fell 1.5 percent to $36.96 despite reporting steep increases in its third-quarter earnings and revenue. Lennar’s results follow a similarly strong report from KB Home last week, and together give further evidence the housing market is moving toward recovery. The PHLX housing index is up 61.1 percent for the year so far. “What we’re watching is the stocks in the sector recover from a very depressed base from a couple of years ago,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Among the largest decliners on Monday was Peregrine Pharmaceuticals Inc, which plunged 78.5 percent to $1.16 after the company said it found major discrepancies in results from a mid-stage study of its experimental lung cancer drug conducted by a third-party contractor. Volume was lower than average, with roughly 5.54 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the Amex, compared with the year-to-date average daily closing volume of 6.54 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by about 3 to 2, and on the Nasdaq, about seven stocks fell for every six that rose.",9242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-drops-after-caterpillar-forecast-german-data-idUSL1E8KOIEL20120924

Technology shares came under pressure after a second day of weakness for Apple Inc, the world’s most valuable public company. Shares fell 2.5 percent to $673.54 as the company sold out of its initial supply of the new iPhone, raising concerns about keeping up with demand. Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, said on Monday sluggish global growth was responsible for reduced estimates. Other companies to recently cut expectations include FedEx Corp  and Norfolk Southern. Shares of Caterpilar were the biggest weight on the Dow for a second day and ended down 4.2 percent at $87.01. That was the stock’s biggest daily percentage drop since May. The declines Tuesday reversed earlier gains attributed to portfolio “window dressing” as the quarter ends. Stronger-than-expected figures on U.S. consumer confidence also contributed to temporary gains. This is “a market that has rallied and climbed a wall of worry. Right now the market is getting skittish and looking for reasons for buyers to be less aggressive,” said Jim Fehrenbach, head of equity distribution at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 101.37 points, or 0.75 percent, at 13,457.55. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 15.30 points, or 1.05 percent, at 1,441.59, its fourth day of losses. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 43.06 points, or 1.36 percent, at 3,117.73. It was the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage daily loss since June 25 and the biggest for the Nasdaq since July 20. The S&P; 500 is up 2.5 percent so far in September, historically a difficult month for the market, and recently hit the highest level in nearly five-years. For the quarter the S&P; is up 5.8 percent so far, with gains largely tied to the latest moves by the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate their economies. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Monday he expected the central bank to expand its bond-buying program next year to more aggressively combat the unemployment rate, but Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser countered on Tuesday the latest monetary stimulus will not do much to boost economic growth or lower unemployment.

The latest moves by the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate their economies has put the benchmark index ahead nearly 7 percent for the quarter and 3.5 percent for September, historically a difficult month for the market to achieve gains. As the actions by the central banks have helped contain declines, investors have found little reason to justify any additional move higher. “Any downdraft is going to be abbreviated with the recognition of the fact the Fed has effectively put a floor in the market, and it’s not just the Fed, it’s the ECB as well,” said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, New Jersey. “What we are kind of dealing with here is a rudderless ship - there is no economic data to support any sort of robust buy activity.” Dow component Caterpillar Inc became the latest company to cut its profit outlook due to a sluggish global economy. Besides Caterpillar, other companies to cut their financial views include FedEx Corp, Norfolk Southern  and Tesla Motors. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Monday he expected the central bank to expand its bond-buying program next year to more aggressively combat the unemployment rate, but Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser countered on Tuesday the latest monetary stimulus will not do much to boost economic growth or lower unemployment. Caterpillar, the heavy machinery maker, cut its 2015 profit outlook, warning that weaker commodity prices would result in a bigger-than-expected decline in demand. Shares of Caterpillar fell 2.6 percent to $88.31 as the biggest drag on the Dow while Tesla slumped 8.5 percent to $28.06. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 18.39 points, or 0.14 percent, to 13,540.53. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 2.36 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,454.53.

249,CAT,"Caterpillar pares bullish 2015 view on ""anemic"" economy","LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) cut its 2015 earnings forecast on Monday, becoming the latest heavyweight in Corporate America to sound alarms on the sluggish global economic recovery. The world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment stopped short of forecasting a global recession, but warned of a bigger-than-expected fall-off in demand for its products over the next few years because of weaker commodity prices. The deceleration will undermine Caterpillar’s expansion in the mining sector, where demand for the company’s mega trucks is expected to slow. Equipment sales in Australia and China may also decline. “We’ve seen a slowing in economic growth more than we expected,” Caterpillar CEO Doug Oberhelman told analysts and reporters in Las Vegas. “We expect fairly anemic and modest growth through 2015.” Oberhelman reduced the earnings forecast for 2015 to $12 to $18 per share, from $15 to $20 per share previously. The outlook cut was reported minutes before U.S. stock exchanges closed, weighing on the Dow Jones industrial average. In after-hours trading, Caterpillar shares fell more than 2.4 percent to $88.73. The new forecast comes a year after Caterpillar paid $7.6 billion for mining equipment maker Bucyrus International - the largest deal in its history - and bullishly predicted the deal would help boost earnings to as much as $20 per share by 2015. Large companies tend not to issue earnings forecasts for so many years into the future. Caterpillar did so partly to reassure those on Wall Street who questioned the timing of the Bucyrus deal while the economy remained weak. “It’s prudent, especially with what’s happened in 2011 and 2012 in the economy, to readjust,” Oberhelman said on Monday. “I, for one, am still thinking $15 to $20 (earnings per share by 2015), but we need better economic growth.” Oberhelman stressed he stands by the Bucyrus deal. “I don’t regret it,” he told Reuters in an interview. “And I don’t think we could have got it cheaper today than what we paid.” The Bucyrus deal added mining shovels and drag lines to Caterpillar’s stable of trucks and excavators, making it the world’s largest producer of mining equipment. Caterpillar will discuss 2013 expectations when it releases quarterly earnings next month, Oberhelman said. For 2012, analysts expect the company to earn $9.62 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Caterpillar is considered a key barometer for manufacturing, mining and construction sector health. The company’s decision to cut its 2015 forecast shows much work remains to heal those parts of the economy. Railroad operator Norfolk Southern (NSC.N) and shippers FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and UPS Inc (UPS.N) are among the many large U.S. companies that have blamed slowing demand around the world for their weaker financial results or forecasts. In a sign of how seriously Caterpillar takes its investment in the mining sector, all 16 members of the company’s board of directors flew to Las Vegas this week for MINExpo, a global convention for mining suppliers that takes place every four years. Prices for coal and iron ore have dropped more than 20 percent this year, causing many customers to rethink capital expenditures. Since roughly 70 percent of spending in mines is for large trucks, capital spending cuts are not good news for Caterpillar and peers that include Komatsu (6301.T). Among the world’s eight largest miners, only three are boosting spending next year. Vale VALE5.SA, which has the largest budget among miners, plans to cut its 2013 mining spending by 4 percent from 2012 levels. Given the uncertainty in the mining market, Caterpillar’s forecast cut was not a complete surprise to Wall Street, where expectations had been low ahead of Monday’s event. Still, many analysts remain bullish on Caterpillar, with price targets above $100 per share and hopes for the company to continue to provide the large equipment needed when a global economic recovery occurs. The forecast cut is “a realistic reflection of the slowdown in the global economy,” said Oliver Pursche of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund, which owns Caterpillar shares. “We’re not overly surprised by the announcement. “Certainly in the short term there are some headwinds, but long term ... we’re still bullish on Caterpillar,” Pursche said. Oberhelman, who joined the Peoria, Illinois-based company right out of college in 1975 and has had the top job since 2010, said Caterpillar remains committed to China despite slowing growth there. “By 2015, at the latest, we will be the market share leader in China for all of our construction equipment,” he said. “This little slowdown allows the industry to consolidate, and we intend to be there when it recovers and win there.” Excavator sales are down roughly 40 percent in China so far this year, though, and are expected to improve only slightly next year, according to data from U.K.-based consultant Off-Highway Research. Caterpillar began exporting Chinese-made machinery earlier this summer to the Middle East and Africa, part of a plan to offset a dip in China’s economic growth. In Australia, BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) and other miners have delayed expansion of mining projects and buying equipment. Caterpillar acknowledged the slowdown there, but said it expects only a temporary blip and for sales to resume next year. “We are seeing some delays” in Australia, Steve Dunning, the Caterpillar executive who oversees the mining business, said at the analyst presentation. “Some of our customers are pushing orders out six months, nine months. But we’re talking in terms of months, not any longer than that.” ",9252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-minexpo-forecast/caterpillar-pares-bullish-2015-view-on-anemic-economy-idUSBRE88N0YQ20120925

Data on U.S. home prices and consumer confidence scheduled for later on Tuesday could help give the market direction. Just minutes before markets closed on Monday, Caterpillar Inc cut its 2015 profit outlook, warning that weaker commodity prices would result in a bigger-than-expected decline in demand, sending shares down 1.4 percent to $89.60 in premarket trading. The news follows lowered forecasts by transportation companies FedEx Corp and Norfolk Southern. “Caterpillar is another global-reaching firm that’s speaking negatively to the pace of the economy, and with slowdowns in Europe and Asia this is something we should get used to,” said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. Equities have rallied in recent months on expectations of  stimulus from central banks around the world, and announcements of easing earlier this month from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have kept the S&P; 500 near multiyear highs. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Monday he expected the central bank to expand its bond-buying program next year to more aggressively combat the unemployment rate. He also expects the program to end before the close of 2014. “Monetary policy has been enough to offset a lot of what we’ve been worried about lately,” Hogan said. “It is acting as a backstop for corporate warnings and Europe fears and keeping us higher in a historically weak month.” S&P; 500 futures rose 1.3 points and remained above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 23 points and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 15 points. The S&P; 500 is on track for a 7.6 percent gain for the quarter, a rally largely tied to central banks’ actions to stimulate their economies. After those gains, many market participants are looking for new catalysts to keep pushing shares higher. Analysts said investors are probably now participating in “window dressing,” where fund managers add some of the latest outperformers to their portfolio. Investors are looking ahead to July Case-Shiller home price data, due at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT), which is expected to show a 0.9 percent rise. Data on September consumer confidence is on tap for 10 a.m. and is seen rising to 63 from last month’s 60.6. Paychex Inc reported a first-quarter profit that narrowly beat estimates, helped by higher revenue from its human resource services business. The stock fell 5.3 percent to $32.55 before the bell. Red Hat Inc reported a lower-than-expected adjusted profit as costs rose, and lowered the top end of its full-year revenue outlook on slow growth in its services business.

252,CAT,TEXT-Fitch comments on Caterpillar Inc,"Sept 27 - Fitch Ratings believes a softening outlook for heavy equipment sales to the global mining and construction industries could eventually lead to moderately weaker credit metrics for Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and could potentially have the same effect on other companies with similar exposure to these industrial customers. Weakening demand for construction and mining-related equipment underscores continuing signs of slowing global economic growth. Rising mining costs in Australia as well as softening demand have resulted in rationalization and project delays that will impact mining equipment volume. In the U.S., coal mining is suffering from near-term competition from extremely low natural gas prices and producers are redeploying equipment and cutting capital spending.  Mining represents the majority of CAT’s Resource Industries segment, which  generates approximately 30% of Machinery and Power Systems (M&PS;) revenue. We  believe muted demand in the mining industry could temper near-term benefits from Caterpillar’s integration of Bucyrus which was acquired last year. CAT is also  integrating other previous acquisitions, including MWM Holding GmbH and ERA  Mining Machinery Limited. While risks to CAT’s financial performance have  increased, the Rating Outlook continues to be Stable, reflecting CAT’s strong  operating profile, large market share, effective product development, and  financial flexibility.  CAT has reduced leverage since the Bucyrus acquisition was completed in mid 2011 (debt/EBITDA was 1.1x at June 30, 2012 at M&PS;), but benefits of the  transaction, including cost improvements and using CAT engines and other  components in Bucyrus’ equipment, may occur more slowly if demand declines  further for coal, metals, and other commodities. Mining companies have postponed large projects and reduced capital spending plans that drive sales of mining  trucks and other equipment produced by CAT. Other concerns that surround demand  for CAT’s equipment include slower economic growth in China that has reduced  excavator sales by as much as 30%-40%, the increasing use of natural gas that is replacing coal consumption in the U.S., and construction activity that remains  at low levels in developed regions.   Fitch estimates free cash flow (FCF) at M&PS; could decline by approximately half for all of 2012 from $2.8 billion in 2011, reflecting larger planned pension  contributions (including voluntary contributions) and an increase in capital  expenditures expected in 2012. (Fitch excludes from FCF changes in accounts  receivable purchased by Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation.)  However, cash flow could benefit from steps taken by CAT to adjust or delay the  pace of capital expenditures. Also, an improvement in inventory turnover could  generate additional cash in a weak operating environment.   Our primary credit concerns for CAT revolve around volume in the mining business and the effectiveness of its realignments and cost reductions following  completed acquisitions. We note that CAT has made significant operating  improvements during the past few years that should enable it to cope effectively with a moderate slowdown. Also, the substantial amount of aftermarket business  acquired with Bucyrus mitigates CAT’s exposure to equipment sales. However,  margins and cash flow could be sensitive to a sustained or significant economic  downturn and economic trends in CAT’s mining and construction markets will be  especially important in the near term.  CAT is not alone in noting heightened risks associated with a global slowdown.  Transportation bellwethers Maersk, FedEx, and Norfolk Southern have all  cautioned in recent weeks that slowing growth in China, in addition to ongoing  uncertainty in Europe and risks related to the U.S. fiscal cliff, will affect  future earnings. We forecast China’s 2012 growth at 7.8%, trimmed down in June  from our 8.0% expectation, reflecting the release of data showing real GDP grew  7.6% year-over-year in Q212. We expect some modest quasifiscal stimulus to raise growth towards 8.0% by year end and to support growth of about 8.2% in 2013,  followed by 7.5% in 2014.  Taking into consideration recent monetary policy interventions by the Federal  Reserve, European Ccentral Bank, and Bank of Japan, we project that economic  growth in the major advanced economies will remain sluggish at 1.0% in 2012,  followed by only a modest acceleration to 1.4% in 2013 and 2.0% in 2014. Our  global growth forecast is 2.1% for 2012, 2.6% in 2013, and 3.0% in 2014.  For a complete listing of CAT and CFSC ratings, please see our website  www.fitchratings.com.

254,CAT,Caterpillar says two more executives will retire,"* News comes day after two of five group presidents retired * Other executives to be moved to new positions * Wall Street shrugs at news; shares up slightly By Ernest Scheyder Oct 12 (Reuters) - Two vice presidents at Caterpillar Inc  announced their retirements on Friday, the second round of departures from the world’s largest construction equipment maker in as many days as sales continue to lag in key growth markets. The retirements of four senior executives at nearly the same time, as well as the shuffling of five other executives to different positions, come less than a month after Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman cut Caterpillar’s 2015 earnings forecast, citing slumping demand and rising commodity prices. Wall Street appeared to take the news in stride, with analysts voicing confidence in the ability of Oberhelman and the board of directors to managing talent effectively. Caterpillar shares were up four cents to $82.89 in Friday midday trading. “This is a company that has shown through internal promotions in the past that they consider their employees one of their biggest assets,” said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. “While today’s retirements are close in time to the 2015 announcement and yesterday’s retirement news, I think Wall Street will largely shrug it off as being coincidental.” Bill Springer, 61, head of a Caterpillar division that sells products for paving and forestry customers, will retire next February, the company said. Gary Stampanato, 56, head of the company’s excavation division, will also retire next February. Caterpillar has a mandatory retirement age of 65. In a six-page statement outlining replacements for both men, as well as other executive shuffles, Caterpillar stressed it has an adequate talent bench from which to draw for the foreseeable future. Caterpillar’s 28 vice presidents report to five group presidents, each with control over a different part of the company. The five, in turn, report to Oberhelman. Springer and Stampanato’s retirements come the day after two of Caterpillar’s group vice presidents announced their own retirements. “Relatively speaking there are maybe more moves here than typical, but they’re not extraordinary or unusual,” Caterpillar spokesman Jim Dugan said. “We’ll have a very orderly and smooth transition.” The Peoria, Illinois-based company also named Qihua Chen the head of China operations, a newly created position that signals how focused the company is on boosting weak sales there. Oberhelman said last month that he intends to “win in China.” Demand for Caterpillar’s front-end loaders and excavators has slipped in China, and the company has begun exporting Chinese-made machinery to Africa and the Middle East, executives told Reuters in August.

257,CAT,"Caterpillar slashes forecast again, sees weaker economy","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators, slashed its 2012 forecast for the second time this year and warned the global economy was slowing faster than it had expected. The caution sign was the latest in a string of comments from multinational manufacturers, including General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), that the economic recovery remains tenuous and tepid at best. Caterpillar’s retail dealers are selling off inventories, rather than buying new machines, forcing the company to idle some production at plants earlier this year with additional shutdowns coming, executives said on Monday. “As we’ve moved through the year, we’ve seen continued economic weakening and uncertainty,” Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement. Caterpillar does not expect the global economy to begin to improve until the second half of 2013, he added. Shares were up 0.4 percent at $84.22 on Monday afternoon after a drop of nearly 2 percent at the opening bell. Analysts and investors said the stock, down more than 20 percent in the past six months, appeared to be a good buying opportunity given Caterpillar’s strong growth prospects after the world economy recovers. “The next couple of quarters will be tough-going, but longer-term I don’t think their competitive position is threatened,” said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. “They’re still globally the world leader, and this isn’t an industry that is going away.” Caterpillar posted better-than-expected third-quarter profit on a rebound in U.S. sales of heavy equipment from a 30-year low. Europe and parts of Latin America remain tough regions for Caterpillar. The weakening euro zone is the “most significant” risk to the company’s 2013 outlook, executives said. Caterpillar’s growth is closely linked to global macroeconomic trends, which are now trending “flat-to-down,” said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten. “They’ve been muddling through this kind of weak environment,” he said of Caterpillar. The company expects sales of mining equipment to slip in 2013 as falling metal and coal prices force companies to pull back on production. Sales of construction equipment should improve next year, especially in emerging markets. And sales of power generators should be flat next year, Caterpillar executives said. The three areas each comprise roughly one-third of the company’s sales. For the third quarter, Caterpillar posted profit of $1.7 billion, or $2.54 per share, compared with $1.14 billion or $1.71 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.26 per share. By that measure, analysts expected $2.22, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5 percent to $16.45 billion. Analysts looked for $16.77 billion. For 2012, the company now expects to earn $9 to $9.25 per share on sales of $66 billion. The company had previously looked for about $9.60 per share. Analysts estimated 2012 profit of $9.40 per share on revenue of $67.64 billion. It was the second time this year that Caterpillar has cut its 2012 forecast. Caterpillar spooked markets at a major industry conference last month, when it looked three years into the future and slashed its earnings forecast for 2015. Oberhelman blamed an “anemic” economic outlook, especially in the mining sector. The results come the week after Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar announced a wave of senior executive retirements, including two members of its leadership team.

258,CAT,"Global shares falter, but U.S. stocks, euro gain","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks faltered on Monday on weak corporate results and outlooks, while the euro gained after a regional vote in Spain was seen as moving a solution to the euro zone debt crisis one step closer. U.S. stocks eked out gains in a late-day rally that was helped by a 4 percent gain in Apple Inc, which reports earnings later in the week. The tech heavyweight provided the biggest boost to the benchmark S&P; 500 index. Trading also was influenced by heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) after it slashed its 2012 forecast and warned that the global economy was slowing more quickly than it had expected. Caterpillar’s outlook helped oil prices to retreat and put the S&P; 500 on track for almost the entire session for a third straight decline after it suffered its worst one-day fall since late June on Friday. But the S&P; closed 0.04 percent higher after the surge in Apple. Peter Kenny, a managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, New Jersey, said with 15 days to go until the U.S. presidential election on November 6, investors are hesitant, with the economy close to a stall and the euro zone still a concern. “It’s more of a wait-and-see. Once we have some clarity on the political front, I think people are going to be more than willing to put some bets on the table,” Kenny said. Of the 123 S&P; 500 companies that have reported results, 60.2 percent have topped analysts’ expectations for earnings. But 61 percent have missed revenue forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The majority of earnings so far have been on the weak side and a number of high-profile companies have issued profit warnings, making investors a little more cautious about the outlook for profits in 2013,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial, in Westport, Connecticut. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 2.38 points, or 0.02 percent, at 13,345.89. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 0.62 point, or 0.04 percent, at 1,433.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 11.33 points, or 0.38 percent, at 3,016.96. Shares of Caterpillar, considered a bellwether for the economy, rose and fell in rocky trade. Caterpillar closed up 1.5 percent at $85.08. “Caterpillar is a cyclical stock, and there’s always a battle between a slowdown in the economy and growth expectations,” said Shawn Hackett, president at Hackett Financial Advisors in Boynton Beach, Florida. “The stock is extremely volatile during periods when the economic outlook is uncertain.” Caterpillar’s lowered outlook helped push European shares lower as it echoed other corporate views in recent weeks. By the European market close, all STOXX Europe 600  sectors except financials were negative. The news from the U.S. heavy equipment manufacturer “is being treated as more macro than just a set of company results, and with a lack of other news flow today, I think people are being cautious on the back of it,” said Will Hedden, a trader at IG Markets. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of top European shares fell 0.4 percent to close at 1,107.42. The STOXX Europe 600 fell 1.1 percent. European shares earlier had traded higher on renewed expectations Spain was moving closer to seeking a bailout, but the decline in U.S. equity markets pulled Europe down. The euro rose after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s party retained an absolute majority in the parliament of his home region of Galicia on Sunday, a result seen as overcoming a hurdle to Spain’s formally requesting a bailout. According to European officials and analysts, Rajoy had wanted to wait until the election results. A bailout request would trigger the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program aimed at lowering Spain’s high borrowing costs. The euro was up 0.3 percent against the dollar at 1.3055. The U.S. dollar index .DXY fell 0.03 percent to 79.594. Oil prices edged lower in choppy trading as economic concerns, in addition to expected production and pipeline restarts, offset fears about Middle East turmoil and the potential threat to the region’s supply. The Caterpillar warning, along with data showing tumbling Japanese exports, weighed on crude oil, pushing Brent to below $110 per barrel. Brent crude for December delivery fell 70 cents to settle at $109.44 per barrel. U.S. oil settled down $1.32 at $88.73 a barrel. U.S. Treasury prices slipped, erasing some of Friday’s gains, as investors pressured prices before the sale of $99 billion of U.S. government debt this week.

Peter Kenny, a managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, New Jersey, said with 15 days to go until the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 6, investors are hesitant, with the economy close to a stall and the euro zone still a concern. “It’s more of a wait-and-see. Once we have some clarity on the political front, I think people are going to be more than willing to put some bets on the table,” Kenny said. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 78.35 points, or 0.59 percent, at 13,265.16. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 7.92 points, or 0.55 percent, at 1,425.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.59 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,003.03. Shares of Caterpillar, considered a bellwether for the economy, rose and fell in rocky trade. Caterpillar was last up 0.8 percent at $84.52. “Caterpillar is a cyclical stock, and there’s always a battle between a slowdown in the economy and growth expectations,” said Shawn Hackett, president at Hackett Financial Advisors in Boynton Beach, Florida. “The stock is extremely volatile during periods when the economic outlook is uncertain.” Caterpillar’s lowered outlook helped push European shares lower as it echoed other corporate views in recent weeks. By the European market close, all STOXX Europe 600 sectors except financials were negative. The news from the U.S. heavy equipment manufacturer “is being treated as more macro than just a set of company results, and with a lack of other news flow today, I think people are being cautious on the back of it,” said Will Hedden, a trader at IG Markets. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 0.4 percent to close at a provisional 1,107.42 points. The STOXX Europe 600 fell 1.1 percent. European shares earlier had traded higher on renewed expectations Spain was moving closer to seeking a bailout, but the decline in U.S. equity markets pulled Europe down. The euro rose after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s party retained an absolute majority in the parliament of his home region of Galicia on Sunday, a result seen as overcoming a hurdle to Spain’s formally requesting a bailout. According to European officials and analysts, Rajoy had wanted to wait until the election results. A bailout request would trigger the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program aimed at lowering Spain’s high borrowing costs. The euro was up 0.3 percent against the dollar at 1.3051. The U.S. dollar index fell 0.07 percent to 79.627. Oil prices edged lower in choppy trading as economic concerns, in addition to expected production and pipeline restarts, offset fears about Middle East turmoil and the potential threat to the region’s supply. The Caterpillar warning, along with data showing tumbling Japanese exports, weighed on crude oil, pushing Brent to below $110 per barrel. Brent crude for December delivery was down 30 cents to $109.84 per barrel. U.S. oil settled down $1.32 at $88.73 a barrel. U.S. Treasury prices fell, taking back a portion of Friday’s gains.

Caterpillar’s shares seesawed after the heavy equipment maker became the latest to exceed expectations on the bottom line, but fall short of revenue forecasts. The stock fell early, but was most recently up 0.5 percent at $84.31. Caterpillar also slashed its 2012 forecast for the second time this year, warning the global economy was slowing faster than it had expected. With this reporting period, investors are looking at both sides of the earnings story, with earnings beating lowered expectations, but revenues coming in weak and profit warnings staying at a high level. “The majority of earnings so far have been on the weak side and a number of high-profile companies have issued profit warnings, making investors a little more cautious about the outlook for profits in 2013,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial, in Westport, Connecticut. Of the 123 S&P; 500 companies that have reported results, 60.2 percent have topped analysts’ expectations for earnings, but 61 percent have missed revenue forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters data. Third-quarter earnings are expected to fall 2.4 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P; 500 broke below its 50-day moving average around 1,434, which had proven to be a strong support level. A lasting break below that level could signal further declines. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan lost 2.4 percent to $40.18 after it said third-quarter profit fell sharply, missing Wall Street’s estimates, because of a big drop in gold production in Indonesia. Shares of Apple Inc shot up 2.8 percent to $626.72 and helped limit the Nasdaq’s loss. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 84.70 points, or 0.64 percent, at 13,258.81. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 8.80 points, or 0.61 percent, at 1,424.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 3.69 points, or 0.12 percent, to 3,001.93. Nine of the 10 industry sectors in the S&P; 500  were lower, with only information technology higher, in part because of Apple’s advance. Other tech gainers included Oracle, up 0.6 percent at $30.66. Coal miner Peabody Energy Corp’s third-quarter profit beat analysts’ expectations as improved U.S. margins and higher Australian sales volumes offset price declines. The stock rose 9.8 percent to $28.42. Ancestry.com Inc jumped 7.9 percent to $31.47 after the company said it will be acquired by a group led by Europe-based private equity firm Permira in a $1.6 billion deal.

263,CAT,European shares dented by Caterpillar outlook,"* FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.4 percent * Banks, insurers sole sector risers By Tricia Wright LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday after U.S. industrial bellwether Caterpillar joined other multinational manufacturers in giving a sobering take on the outlook for the global economy. The FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 0.4 percent at 1,107.42, having dropped 0.8 percent on Friday. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators, became the latest to exceed expectations on the bottom line but fall short of revenue forecasts, while warning that the global economy was slowing faster than it had expected. The firm’s cautious view follows similar comments from a number of companies in recent weeks, and by the close in Europe all STOXX Europe 600 sectors bar the banks and insurers were in negative territory. “It is being treated as more macro than just a set of company results, and with a lack of other newsflow today, I think people are being cautious on the back of it,” Will Hedden, a sales trader at IG, said, referring to the Caterpillar news. Of the 23 percent of S&P; 500 companies to have reported so far, around two thirds have beaten or met profit expectations, though just over a third have done so on the top line, Thomson Reuters Starmine data through to Friday showed. “The balance of what is going to drive the market in the short term is the earnings season,” said Paras Anand, head of European equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which has 143.7 billion pounds ($230.4 billion) assets under management. “On a medium to longer term view, I think putting money in the right equities you’re going to do very very well... for example, I see corporate M&A; continuing to be a feature - probably a growing feature - over the next three years, and obviously that will act to underpin market valuations overall.” Banks and insurers bucked the weak market trend, with European shares having enjoyed gains earlier in the session after Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy clinched election victory in his home region of Galicia on Sunday, removing a potential hurdle on the path to him asking for a bailout. Expectations that Spain will request a bailout, triggering the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program aimed at reducing the country’s borrowing costs, have helped underpin equity markets in recent weeks, although uncertainty over the timing of such a move has limited any gains. “The fact that (Rajoy) has got one vote of confidence emboldens him to a certain extent to negotiate the memorandum of understanding with the euro zone regarding the bailout, so I think that’s been carried positively,” said Shaniel Ramjee, an investment manager at Baring Asset Management, which has 31 billion pounds of assets under management. Ramjee believes sectors that have previously suffered, like financials, appear more attractive - particularly in the United States and Europe - given tail risks have been greatly reduced by central bank action such as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s $40 billion a month of security purchases.

267,CAT,"Caterpillar slashes forecast again, sees weaker economy","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators, slashed its 2012 forecast for the second time this year and warned the global economy was slowing faster than it had expected. The cautionary note was the latest in a string of comments from multinational manufacturers, including General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), that the economic recovery remains tenuous and tepid at best. Caterpillar’s retail dealers are selling off inventories, rather than buying new machines, forcing the company to idle some production at plants earlier this year with additional shutdowns coming, executives said on Monday. “As we’ve moved through the year, we’ve seen continued economic weakening and uncertainty,” Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement. The statement also noted that sales in China, the world’s largest user of construction equipment, had also declined in the quarter and had yet to improve, although Caterpillar expected China’s construction industry to pick up through next year. Caterpillar does not expect the global economy to begin to improve until the second half of 2013. It anticipates that China will take further steps to prod its slowing economy. “We expect additional easing in 2013 and project economic growth will improve to 8.5 percent” in China, it said. That forecast compares with economists’ expectations for 7.8 percent, according to a recent Reuters poll. The company’s shares rose 1.45 percent to $85.08 on Monday. Analysts and investors said the stock, down more than 20 percent in the past six months, appeared to offer a good buying opportunity given Caterpillar’s strong growth prospects after the world economy recovers. “The next couple of quarters will be tough-going, but longer-term I don’t think their competitive position is threatened,” said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. “They’re still globally the world leader, and this isn’t an industry that is going away.” Caterpillar posted better-than-expected third-quarter profit on a rebound in U.S. sales of heavy equipment from a 30-year low. Europe and parts of Latin America remain tough regions for Caterpillar. The weakening euro zone is the “most significant” risk to the company’s 2013 outlook, executives said. Caterpillar’s growth is closely linked to global macroeconomic trends, which are now trending “flat-to-down,” said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten. “They’ve been muddling through this kind of weak environment,” he said of Caterpillar. The company expects sales of mining equipment to slip in 2013 as falling metal and coal prices force companies to pull back on production. Sales of construction equipment should improve next year, especially in emerging markets. And sales of power generators should be flat next year, Caterpillar executives said. The three areas each comprise roughly one-third of the company’s sales. For the third quarter, Caterpillar posted profit of $1.7 billion, or $2.54 per share, compared with $1.14 billion or $1.71 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.26 per share. By that measure, analysts expected $2.22, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5 percent to $16.45 billion. Analysts looked for $16.77 billion. For 2012, the company now expects to earn $9 to $9.25 per share on sales of $66 billion. The company had previously expected about $9.60 per share, while analysts estimated 2012 profit of $9.40 per share on revenue of $67.64 billion. It was the second time this year that Caterpillar has cut its 2012 forecast. Caterpillar spooked markets at a major industry conference last month, when it looked three years into the future and slashed its earnings forecast for 2015. Oberhelman blamed an “anemic” economic outlook, especially in the mining sector. The results come the week after Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar announced a wave of senior executive retirements, including two members of its leadership team.

Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of mining equipment, last year acquired Bucyrus for $7.6 billion. Caterpillar typically sells through a network of independent dealers, of which Barloworld is one. The deal, which bets on buoyant demand for trucks and loaders from mining companies in Russia, comes two days after Barloworld gave an optimistic outlook for equipment demand in Russia. Shares in Barloworld, which have hardly moved so far this year, fell 2.3 percent at 72.57 rand by 1147 GMT, lagging behind a 0.7 percent decline in the JSE All-share index. The transaction is expected to be implemented on 3 December 2012.

273,CAT,Caterpillar writes off most of China deal after fraud,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc uncovered “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at a subsidiary of a Chinese company it acquired last summer, leading it to write off most of the value of the deal and wipe out half a quarter’s profits. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators, said on Friday it would take a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $580 million, or 87 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2012. Analysts had expected the company to earn $1.70 per share in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Caterpillar closed the purchase of ERA Mining Machinery Ltd and its subsidiary Siwei last June, paying HK$5.06 billion, or $653.4 million at current exchange rates. A member of the Caterpillar board during the course of the Siwei deal told Reuters the board was distracted at the time by a larger transaction and paid relatively little attention to the Siwei acquisition. “It came as a complete surprise to us,” the former board member said of the fraud, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. “It was presented to us as a pretty straightforward transaction. It’s a shame. It should have been investigated further.” In a statement, Caterpillar said an ongoing investigation launched after the deal closed “determined several Siwei senior managers engaged in deliberate misconduct beginning several years prior to Caterpillar’s acquisition of Siwei.” The company said it had replaced several senior managers at Siwei, adding that their conduct was “offensive and completely unacceptable.” Caterpillar was not immediately available for further comment. Representatives for Siwei were not immediately available for comment before business hours on Saturday morning in China.

276,CAT,Caterpillar writes off most of China deal after fraud,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc uncovered “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at a subsidiary of a Chinese company it acquired last summer, leading it to write off most of the value of the deal and wiping out more than half its expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012. Shares of Caterpillar fell 1.5 percent in afterhours trading following news of the fraud, which was discovered after problems were found with the Chinese company’s inventory. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators, said on Friday it would take a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $580 million, or 87 cents per share, in the quarter. Analysts had expected the company to report $1.70 per share when it reports its results on January 28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Caterpillar closed the purchase of ERA Mining Machinery Ltd and its subsidiary Siwei, China’s fourth-largest maker of hydraulic roof supports, last June, paying HK$5.06 billion, or $653.4 million. ERA had been publicly traded in Hong Kong, doing business through Siwei, which is known for making equipment to support roofs in mines. A member of the Caterpillar board during the course of the Siwei deal told Reuters the board was distracted at the time by a larger transaction and paid relatively little attention to the Siwei acquisition. “It came as a complete surprise to us,” the former board member said of the fraud, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. “It was presented to us as a pretty straightforward transaction. It’s a shame. It should have been investigated further.” The source said the driving force behind the deal was Ed Rapp, the former Caterpillar chief financial officer who now serves as a group president with responsibility for China, among other operations. The source said it was Rapp who presented the deal to the board and pushed for its completion. A Caterpillar spokesman declined to comment on Rapp’s role in the deal. Rapp could not be immediately located for comment. At the time of the Caterpillar purchase, ERA Mining was listed in the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) of the Hong Kong stock exchange, which is “designed to accommodate companies to which a higher investment risk may be attached,” according to the offering circular filed by Caterpillar last year in Hong Kong. The company was previously known as ERA Holdings Global Ltd. and provided “corporate secretarial services” before being acquired by Siwei in September 2010 through a reverse takeover. Caterpillar’s write-off could revive concerns over accounting scandals and corporate governance issues of Chinese companies voiced by investors including Muddy Waters founder Carson Block. Reverse takeovers have been of particular concern, since most of the recent accounting scandals in the United States have come from small Chinese companies who went public via a reverse takeover, including China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. A Hong Kong arbitration panel on Wednesday ruled China MediaExpress was a “fraudulent enterprise.” In a statement, Caterpillar said an ongoing investigation launched after the deal closed “determined several Siwei senior managers engaged in deliberate misconduct beginning several years prior to Caterpillar’s acquisition of Siwei.” According to a question-and-answer dialog Caterpillar included in its statement, the company found discrepancies in November between the inventory in Siwei’s books and its actual physical inventory, triggering the probe. The company also said it had replaced several senior managers at Siwei, adding that their conduct was “offensive and completely unacceptable.” Representatives for Siwei didn’t respond to calls and requests for comment on the Caterpillar announcement. The company employs about 4,000 people in Zhengzhou and produces hydraulic roof supports used to prevent rocks from falling into a coal mine’s working area. Siwei competes with market leader Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery, according to Zhengzhou Coal’s IPO prospectus filed in November. Citigroup and law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP served as financial and legal advisers to Caterpillar on the transaction. Blackstone and DLA Piper acted as ERA’s financial and legal advisers. Freshfields said in an emailed statement that it wasn’t able to comment on client matters. Representatives for Blackstone, Citigroup and DLA Piper didn’t respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The Siwei deal came as part of Caterpillar’s larger ambitions in China. In early 2012, it added Jon Huntsman, the former U.S. ambassador to China, to its board of directors. The company, which already has 23 manufacturing facilities in China and four more under construction, said the Siwei episode would not change its strategy in the country. Caterpillar’s experience with Siwei may also renew focus on the standoff between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and audit firms over access to accounting documents of U.S.-listed Chinese companies suspected of fraud. While Siwei was not U.S.-listed, the broader accounting question has been a thorny one for U.S. companies looking to grow their business in China.

278,CAT,HK government under fire for plan to protect corporate data,"HONG KONG, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Hong Kong has come under fire for a plan to restrict public access to corporate data, with investors and media groups worried it will block early warning of accounting scandals like the one that cost Caterpillar Inc  $580 million. Hong Kong is proposing changes to corporate laws that would block residential addresses and full identity card numbers of company directors from public view at the Companies Registry website, citing the need to maintain privacy of individuals. Critics say it would hinder due diligence of companies by prospective investors and hurt the city’s reputation as an open and transparent business centre. As a major investment hub for mainland China, Hong Kong has become a popular place for Chinese to set up companies and conduct business, in some cases to obscure their assets through a complex web of shell companies and directorships. “For people doing due diligence for investment, including people like Caterpillar, as potential buyers if they want to double-check things looking at company filings, they are going to find it harder in future,” said David Webb, a Hong Kong-based shareholder activist. “Obviously the more the government interferes ... it will make it harder to do business here.” Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators, took a $580 million charge last week as a result of “accounting misconduct” at a unit of a Chinese mining equipment company it bought last year. Caterpillar purchased ERA Mining Machinery Ltd and its subsidiary Siwei last June. ERA had been publicly traded in Hong Kong, doing business through Siwei, which is known for making equipment to support roofs in mines. The U.S. multinational said an ongoing investigation launched after the deal closed “determined several Siwei senior managers engaged in deliberate misconduct beginning several years prior to Caterpillar’s acquisition of Siwei.” Siwei has not commented. The Hong Kong Journalists Association has launched a petition opposing the government proposal to block access to corporate data, scheduled to take effect early next year, saying it will be hampered from exposing “illegal or immoral activities”. The Hong Kong Association of Banks has also expressed concern over the move. Chan Ka-keung, head of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, which proposed the changes, said on Wednesday the bureau would continue to discuss the rules with the city’s privacy commissioner to eliminate public concern. MONEY-LAUNDERING CONCERNS The bureau has said a public consultation was conducted between late 2009 and early 2010 and most respondents preferred protecting personal data. “Where necessary, law enforcement agencies can access the protected information through the Companies Registry. There will be no implications to our enforcement work on this front,” the bureau said in an e-mail to Reuters, addressing concerns that anti-money laundering work might be affected. Angelina Kwan, a former director of enforcement at Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, shrugged off concerns saying the move was good from a privacy point of view. Critics, however, say the fact that some Chinese use aliases makes it difficult to trace the true identity of people, providing a case for maintaining access to personal details. “It’s actually going to hurt the honest businessman who has nothing to hide, and who is very prepared to allow potential business partners to carry out due diligence,” said Violet Ho of risk consultant Kroll Advisory Solutions, adding there was a risk of fraud going undetected if the changes went ahead. “Now you will be in a situation where you can’t immediately exclude any of the say 2,000 companies associated with the Chinese equivalent of a John Smith, and you have to do a lot of manual work that is basically unnecessary.” Ho said the proposed law would impact any investor - private equity companies, M&A; investors and even banks. Nearly 3.5 million searches of records were conducted through the registry’s electronic search services in 2012, up nearly 8 percent from 2011. The registry has more than a million local companies, many of which are connected to Chinese businesses or investors. “Chinese mainland investors and large corporations in Hong Kong are among the supporters of the amendment to withhold the information. Why? Because those so-called big bosses don’t like their residential addresses to be shown to the public nor their true identity,” said Democratic lawmaker James To.",1232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-corporatelaw/hk-government-under-fire-for-plan-to-protect-corporate-data-idUSL4N0AS1U320130123
279,CAT,Red flags revealed in filings of firm linked to Caterpillar fraud,"HONG KONG, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A Chinese mining equipment company at the centre of an alleged accounting fraud was also involved in a web of insider loans and asset transfers prior to its purchase by Caterpillar Inc., public filings show. The transactions, while not illegal, should have sounded warnings about the company’s finances when the U.S. firm came calling last year, corporate governance experts said. The world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators said last week it was writing off most of the $654 million value of its purchase of ERA Mining Machinery Ltd after uncovering “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at its subsidiary Zhengzhou Siwei. Caterpillar said an internal investigation had uncovered improper accounting of inventories, revenue recognition and cost allocation at Siwei, designed to overstate the profitability of the business in the years before it bought it. Corporate disclosures from ERA filed prior to the takeover show some unusual transactions, including directors lending the company cash at relatively high interest rates and asset-shuffling between Siwei and related parties. Investors and corporate governance experts say these were potential red flags that should have prompted Caterpillar and its team of lawyers, accountants and bankers to ask some searching questions before pulling the trigger on the deal. “Every time there’s a horror story like this, it acts as a damn good wake-up call that you need to look carefully before you do a deal,” said David Holloway, senior managing director at FTI consulting and an expert in investigation of business fraud. Caterpillar declined to comment on the ERA directors’ loans and did not respond to a request for comment on Siwei’s operations. ERA directors could not be reached for comment. A source directly involved with the Caterpillar deal said RSM Nelson Wheeler was ERA’s auditor, while Deloitte and Ernst & Young acted on Caterpillar’s side. RSM did not respond to calls and emails and Deloitte and E&Y; declined to comment. One of the directors who lent the company money was Beijing-based U.S. businessman Emory Williams Jr, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and son of a former Sears Bank and Trust Co. chairman and chief executive. A second was Li Rubo, a graduate of the South Dakota School of Mines and former Chinese government official. There are no allegations of illegality against any of ERA’s directors. A security guard at Siwei’s six-storey, glass-fronted headquarters on the outskirts of Zhengzhou, eastern China, stopped a Reuters reporter from entering the campus, saying senior managers were all in Beijing for meetings. Reuters’ efforts to contact ERA chairman Williams, Li and other directors and major shareholders at listed addresses in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhengzhou and by telephone and email were also unsuccessful. One concern about ERA should have been why the Hong Kong-listed company needed to borrow more than $9.5 million from four directors — who earned nearly $500,000 in interest — at loan rates that were among the most expensive on its balance sheet. “It wouldn’t necessarily mean there are cash flow problems but it would be a massive red flag”, because it would call into question whether the financing was in the company’s best interests, a U.S. lawyer experienced with China transactions, commenting on condition of anonymity, wrote in an email. The personal loans are detailed in regulatory filings made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prior to ERA’s takeover by Caterpillar in June last year. “While company loans to directors are a governance no-no, the opposite is more of a grey area,” said Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, in an emailed response to a Reuters’ question. “Is the interest rate fair and at arm’s length? Why didn’t the company go to a bank?” Allen said he had not studied the ERA deal in detail, but these would have been important questions to ask. David Webb, a shareholder activist and member of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission’s Takeover and Mergers Panel, said local listing rules allowed directors to lend money to companies at normal commercial terms, provided the loan was not securitised, although it was not a common practice. “Presumably the board would have looked at alternative sources of funding,” he said. In one example, in April 2010, Williams and Li lent $6.4 million to pay down loans of nearly $20 million, mostly funded by a U.S. private equity firm, that were used to acquire Siwei, and for working capital, according to the filings. Williams and Li made the loan at an interest rate of 8 percent per year, compounded annually. In a letter from the board at the time of ERA’s reverse merger, the directors, who did not yet include Williams and Li, called the loans “fair and reasonable” and “justifiable”. ERA’s loans with commercial banks at the time were at interest rates ranging from 4.9 percent to 7.4 percent. At the time of the Caterpillar takeover, ERA was listed in the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) of the Hong Kong stock exchange, which is designed to accommodate companies with a higher risk profile. ERA had absorbed Siwei through a reverse takeover in 2010, a corporate manoeuvre that has become controversial in the United States following a series of accounting scandals involving small Chinese companies listed there. Caterpillar said it found discrepancies in November between the inventory on the books of Siwei, which makes hydraulic supports for coal mines, and its actual physical inventory, triggering the probe. The company blamed “several senior managers” whose misconduct it said began some years before it acquired Siwei. Caterpillar did not identify the senior managers. Corporate filings show that the amount of money Siwei was owed by its customers had grown 58 percent a year since 2008, overtaking total sales in 2011, and that some 90 percent of those debts were overdue when Caterpillar launched its bid. John Hempton, a prominent hedge fund manager with Sydney-based Bronte Capital, said 20 minutes research into ERA was enough to convince him to short Caterpillar’s shares after he heard it was buying the Chinese company. Hempton found what he considered a problem with ERA’s receivables — it often took 180 days to collect payment, twice the industry average. “This was something that should have been spotted in only a few minutes,” he said. Caterpillar declined to comment further on whether its examination of ERA’s accounts had been sufficiently thorough, although last week it said it believed its due diligence process was “rigorous and robust”. Williams and Li also helped finance the 2007 purchase of Zhengzhou Siwei with a $2.95 million interest-free loan, according to ERA’s reverse takeover prospectus. Li helped fund his part of the loan by borrowing $2.565 million from another company where both he and Williams were directors. Records from around that time show some unusual transfers of company assets at Zhengzhou Siwei. In one instance, Siwei disposed of an industrial tank-making business valued at nearly $5 million at “nil consideration” to a company in which a Siwei director and former substantial shareholder had taken a majority stake four months earlier. The company said the assets were loss-making, but continued to purchase millions of dollars worth of equipment and services from the same firm between 2007 and 2009, paying an average of 2 percent to 4 percent above the market rate for the “better quality services provided”, according to regulatory filings. Efforts to contact those involved were unsuccessful. In another case, Siwei transferred a 7.5 percent stake in a mining equipment firm to one of its partners — a company linked to one of China’s biggest weapons manufacturers — to offset “trade payables”, an accounting term that usually refers to liabilities owed to suppliers and could suggest Siwei was having trouble paying its bills. A director surnamed Wang reached by telephone at the head office of the former partner, Shaanxi Dynamic, said her company had severed ties with Siwei a few years ago. David Smith, head of corporate governance for Asia at fund manger Aberdeen, said shuffling of assets between related entities was not uncommon in China and could be legitimate. “It’s not necessarily a red flag, but it’s a catalyst that would have us look into the matter in quite a lot of detail to understand why it is happening,” he said. “Our concern would be value leaving the company as a result of the swapping.”",1242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpillar-siwei-redflags/red-flags-revealed-in-filings-of-firm-linked-to-caterpillar-fraud-idUSL4N0AQ3WJ20130124

281,CAT,Caterpillar sets cautious tone for year after low profit,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, posted a 55 percent drop in quarterly profit on Monday and set a cautious tone for the year, citing weak demand and oversupply. Executives at the company, which last year slashed production to reduce inventory, balanced their optimism on recent improvements in U.S. housing starts with concern about China’s slowing growth, the U.S. deficit and eurozone instability. However, investors took heart in Caterpillar’s 2013 profit forecast of $7 to $9 per share, lifting the stock 1.8 percent in afternoon trading. Of the 25 analysts in the United States, Canada, Britain and South Korea who cover Caterpillar’s stock, seven had cut 2013 profit estimates in the past month, with the lowest at $7.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. High inventory remains a short-term challenge for the Peoria, Illinois-based company. While Caterpillar cut its equipment inventory glut by $2 billion sequentially in the fourth quarter, levels remain $1 billion higher than a year ago. Caterpillar still has an oversupply of products in China, and executives said they hope to sell some of it by June. Quarterly results were hit by a charge of 87 cents per share after the company discovered accounting fraud at a Chinese coal mining supplier it bought last year. In a somber note on the global economy, Caterpillar said the “most significant favorable factor” for 2013 profit will be the absence of the ERA accounting fraud writedown, not increased demand for its machines. “We’re encouraged by recent improvements in economic indicators, but remain cautious,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said on Monday. For the fourth quarter, Caterpillar posted net income of $697 million, or $1.04 per share, compared with $1.55 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.46 per share. Analysts had expected $1.69. Caterpillar’s operating margin fell to 6.5 percent from an all-time high of 15.8 percent in the third quarter of 2012. Revenue fell 7 percent to $16.08 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $16.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Caterpillar closed the purchase of ERA Mining Machinery Ltd and its subsidiary Siwei, China’s fourth-largest maker of hydraulic coal mine roof supports, last June for $653.4 million (HK$5.06 billion). After the deal closed, Caterpillar found that physical inventory did not match accounting statements, a discovery that led to the charge. The case has opened questions about Caterpillar’s research into ERA before the deal, as well as the adequacy of its auditors. Caterpillar does not expect the fraud to harm its 2013 profit, but it will hinder the company’s expansion into China, the world’s largest coal producer. “I recognize the decision to acquire (ERA) happened on my watch and the buck stops at my desk,” Oberhelman said on a call with investors. “I am accountable for that acquisition.” Oberhelman, CEO since 2010, said Caterpillar is “considering all options to recover our losses and hold those responsible accountable for their wrongdoing.” Emory Williams, the chairman of ERA when the Caterpillar deal closed, ended days of silence on Monday, saying in a statement issued before the Caterpillar earnings statement that he was “dismayed” by the accounting charge Caterpillar was taking.

Caterpillar shares helped cap losses in the Dow industrials even as the company posted a 55 percent drop in quarterly profit due to a charge connected with accounting fraud at a Chinese subsidiary and weak demand among its dealers. Caterpillar’s shares, down 2.2 percent in the past three sessions, rose 1.5 percent Monday to $96.97. Boeing, down 1.2 percent at $74.14, shares led  decliners on the Dow.  The aircraft maker risks losing about $5 billion in revenue by the grounding of its 787 Dreamliner fleet, according to a Bloomberg report. The S&P; 500 is coming off a streak of eight sessions of gains, the longest in eight years, but the index remained above 1,500. It ended above that level on Friday for the first time in more than five years. “I think this multi-year high is really something that’s in play both for short-term traders and for folks with money on the sidelines,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Investors poured $55 billion in new cash into stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in January, the biggest monthly inflow on record, research provider TrimTabs Investment Research said. Bargain hunters lifted Apple after the tech giant’s stock dropped 14.4 percent in the previous two sessions. With Apple’s stock up 2.4 percent at $450.29, the iPad and iPhone maker regained the title as the largest U.S. company by market capitalization as Exxon Mobil fell 0.9 percent to $90.94 and slipped back to second place. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 10.70 points, or 0.08 percent, at 13,906.68. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 0.50 points, or 0.03 percent, at 1,502.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 9.37 points, or 0.30 percent, at 3,159.08. Data on Monday pointed to growing economic momentum as companies sensed improved consumer demand. Thomson Reuters data showed that of the 150 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings so far, 67.3 percent have beaten analysts’ expectations, which is a higher proportion than over the past four quarters and above the average since 1994. U.S. durable goods orders jumped 4.6 percent in December, a pace that far outstripped expectations for a rise of 1.8 percent. Pending home sales unexpectedly dropped 4.3 percent. Analysts were looking for an increase of 0.3 percent. Equities have also gained support from a recent agreement in Washington to extend the government’s borrowing power. On Monday, Fitch Ratings said that agreement removed the near-term risk to the country’s ‘AAA’ rating. Hess Corp shares shot up 6.3 percent to $62.59 after the company said it would exit its refining business, freeing up to $1 billion of capital. Separately, hedge fund Elliott Associates is looking for approval to buy about $800 million more in Hess stock.

290,CAT,"UPDATE 3-Ex-chairman of firm linked to Caterpillar fraud ""dismayed""","By Clare Baldwin HONG KONG, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The former chairman of a Chinese mining equipment firm bought by Caterpillar Inc  said on Monday he was dismayed by allegations of accounting misconduct at a subsidiary that prompted the U.S. firm to take a $580 million writedown. Emory Williams Jr said Caterpillar had conducted extensive due diligence before its takeover of Hong Kong-listed ERA Mining Machinery Ltd last June, adding that he was seeking further details from the company, the world’s largest maker of tractors and excavators. “We were shocked and dismayed to learn, from press reports, about the very significant goodwill impairment that Caterpillar is taking in relation to the acquisition of ERA’s subsidiary Siwei,” Emory Williams Jr said in a statement. Caterpillar said on Jan. 18 that it would write off most of the $654 million it paid for ERA after uncovering “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at its subsidiary Zhengzhou Siwei. “We cooperated very closely with the Caterpillar team during their extensive due diligence,” Williams said, adding that he and John Lee — the English name used by fellow ERA director Li Rubo — had taken the company’s fiduciary and reporting responsibilities very seriously prior to its acquisition. A Caterpillar spokesman declined to comment. Caterpillar is due to report earnings in the United States later on Monday, with the Siwei writedown expected to wipe out more than half its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012. Williams is a Beijing-based U.S. businessman. He is a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and the son of a former Sears Bank and Trust Co. chairman and chief executive. Li, his long-time business associate, is a graduate of the South Dakota School of Mines and a former Chinese government official. Monday’s statement was the first comment by any of ERA’s former directors or major shareholders since Caterpillar’s statement 10 days ago. ERA had absorbed Siwei through a reverse takeover in 2010, a corporate manoeuvre that has become controversial in the United States following a series of accounting scandals involving small Chinese companies listed there. Announcing the writedown, Caterpillar said an internal investigation had uncovered improper accounting of inventories, revenue recognition and cost allocation at Siwei, designed to overstate the profitability of the business in the years before it bought it. Williams said the former ERA directors had contacted Caterpillar senior management last week to ask for further details. “To date we have received no response and are now taking advice on how best to respond to the situation in a manner which is constructive for all parties involved,” he said. “We are absolutely committed to providing a comprehensive response to any information Caterpillar shares with us.” Caterpillar said it found discrepancies in November between the inventory on the books of Siwei, which makes hydraulic supports for coal mines, and its actual physical inventory, triggering the internal probe.

The cuts will come at the Gosselies site just outside of Charleroi, one of the largest Caterpillar facilities in Europe, where the group makes hydraulic excavators, loading vehicles and engine parts. The site employs 3,700 people. “Though they are painful, these measures are indispensable to allow us to be competitive and give a chance of survival to our factory,” said Nicolas Polutnik, CEO of Caterpillar Belgium. The job cuts at Caterpillar are the latest in a string of large-scale layoffs in Belgium. The world’s largest steelmaker, ArcelorMittal ISPA.AS, said in January it planned to shut facilities at its site in Liege, with the likely loss of around 1,300 jobs, while Ford Motor Co (F.N) announced last October it would close its plant in Genk, affecting 4,000 workers. “The numbers we have received are a catastrophe, and that in a region like Charleroi...,” a spokeswoman for the socialist FGTB union said.

304,CAT,"Caterpillar misses, cuts view, but says mining has bottomed","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) posted disappointing quarterly results and cut its 2013 profit forecast on Monday to reflect a drop in demand for heavy equipment from its mining customers. But the world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment said it believed the pullback in spending by miners was temporary, and its shares rose on news it was reviving a buyback program and would purchase $1 billion in stock this year. Caterpillar, whose shares have been weighed down for months by concern about the mining sector, is encouraged by “stability” in the construction markets in both the United States and China, said Chairman and Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman. “We have been watching relatively flat but slightly increasing sales to users for a number of months,” he told analysts on a conference call. Mining equipment is Caterpillar’s most profitable product category. Sales to the sector have been hurt in recent quarters because miners, facing investor backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metal prices, have slashed capital spending, slowing development on some projects and shelving others entirely. “Investors knew it would be bad, but wanted some quantification from the company,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst At Morningstar. Caterpillar’s revised outlook reflects an expected 50 percent decline in sales of its traditional mining trucks and loaders and a 15 percent decline in sales of the draglines made by Bucyrus, the mining equipment company it purchased in 2010. The delayed and cancelled sales from mining companies are hardly a surprise. Caterpillar has warned investors about the weakness in the sector several times, most recently this month, when it laid off 11 percent of its workforce at the Decatur, Illinois, plant that makes mining equipment. In January, the company also specifically warned that results for the first quarter would be “well below” those posted during the same period last year as dealers, awash in product, tried to sell off existing inventory before placing new orders. Robert Wertheimer, a principal at Vertical Research Partners, said the drop in mining orders that Caterpillar was experiencing was “in line” with what rivals were seeing. “We met with several competitors last week and they all seem to be having similar experiences,” he said. “It’s not a (market) share issue at Caterpillar.” The Peoria, Illinois-based company said it now expects to report a 2013 profit of $7 per share on sales of $57 billion to $61 billion. That was down from a previously estimated profit of between $7 and $9 a share on sales of $60 billion to $68 billion. The news came as the company reported a weaker-than-expected first-quarter profit. Caterpillar said it earned a profit of $880 million, or $1.31 a share, down from $1.59 billion, or $2.37 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of $1.40 per share. Sales during the period fell 17 percent to $13.20 billion. Alexander Blanton, a senior analyst at Clear Harbor Asset Management, said Caterpillar’s 9-cent EPS miss was “well within the usual plus or minus 10 percent range,” typical for the company. Caterpillar also said on Monday that it would resume a share buyback for the first time in five years. Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair & Co, said Caterpillar’s decision to resume the “mothballed” repurchase program was a “positive factor” and probably was contributing to the market’s sanguine reaction to the disappointing results and outlook. Under that plan, which was approved in 2007, Caterpillar could buy back as much as $3.7 billion of its shares before the repurchase authorization expires in December 2015. The company said it would buy $1 billion back in 2013. Oberhelman told analysts during the call that for the first time in three years the company was seeing relative stability around the world. “We don’t want to be overly optimistic but it certainly feels better than the last two springs,” he said. The decline in first-quarter sales was led by a drop in revenue from mining products, which plummeted 23 percent. Sales of construction equipment fell 17 percent and sales of gas and diesel power systems declined 12 percent, the company said. With mining orders falling, Caterpillar needed a strong rebound from other customers, including residential construction, to offset that weakness. But that increased demand from builders has not materialized fast enough, in part because some jumped the gun last spring when unseasonably warm weather, combined with signs of the nascent economic recovery in the United States, prompted many construction equipment customers to place orders for new machines. In the end, the optimism proved to be a little premature, said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Securities. Clear Harbor Asset Management’s Blanton said Oberhelman’s optimism about China seemed to be borne out by the company’s sales there, which were higher in the first quarter of 2013 than they were in the comparable quarter last year. Caterpillar shares were up 2.5 percent at $82.42 on Monday afternoon, after dipping 1.2 percent to $79.50 in the morning. The shares have a 52-week high of $108.79 and a low of $78.25.

310,CAT,"Analysis: Caterpillar cries ""uncle"" on mining; investors cry ""buy""","CHICAGO (Reuters) - An odd thing happened on Monday when Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment, posted disappointing profits and cut its full-year forecast, blaming weakness in the mining industry it bet on so heavily in recent years. Its shares rallied. When other big U.S. companies, including General Electric (GE.N), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N), have warned of slowing profit growth in recent days, the news has unnerved investors and sent their stock prices lower. So what was different about Caterpillar? Part of the answer, analysts said, was that its announcement was not a surprise. The company has warned repeatedly in recent months that demand from mining customers was deteriorating. Another factor was Caterpillar’s upbeat assessment of the outlook for the construction industry, especially in the United States and China. And a share buyback always helps - this one to the tune of $1 billion in stock this year and as much as $3.8 billion by the end of 2015. But analysts said the overly bleak assessment Caterpillar provided on Monday for its sales to the global mining industry also, ironically, helped the shares. In a nutshell, no one believes it’s really going to be quite as bad as it says, even given the recent slide in gold and copper prices on concerns about weak global growth. Rob Wertheimer, an analyst at Vertical Research partners, said the new outlook for mining implies a downturn that would put the mining industry demand back near 2009 levels, where it bottomed out in the last downturn. “We obviously didn’t expect that level of collapse in an otherwise mostly recovering global economy,” Wertheimer said. Neither does Caterpillar. The company is, after all, predicting the world economy is going to grow modestly enough to fuel demand for industrial commodities that miners wrest from the ground using Caterpillar’s yellow machines. “It’s not a great economic climate, but it is good enough to keep commodity production going,” said Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar’s corporate controller. In fact, Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chief executive and chairman, said on Monday the current drop-off in mining orders was as much a function of the changing focus of its mining customers as it was a function of concerns about global growth. “There has been quite a bit of management change with some of our big customers and...the new management is much more focused on operating costs, short-term cash flow, sweating their assets a bit,” Oberhelman said during a conference call with analysts. Caterpillar’s sales to the mining industry are more profitable than sales to construction and industrial customers. The fatter margins were one of the reasons it made mining equipment a focus of its M&A; activity in recent years, buying Bucyrus, a U.S. maker of giant excavators and shovels, for $7.6 billion in 2010 and - more notoriously - ERA Mining, a Chinese mining equipment company, for $654 million. In January, Caterpillar said it was writing off three-quarters of the money it paid for ERA after uncovering “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at a subsidiary of the Chinese firm. The ERA debacle was, in the minds of many analysts, a symbol of a rash rush to double down on the notoriously cyclical business. But even before ERA blew up, the company’s exposure to the resource industry was being questioned as many of its key mining customers, facing investor backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metal prices, slashed capital spending, slowed development on some projects, shelved others entirely and postponed — or canceled new equipment orders. Caterpillar, however, continued to hold out hope that mining orders, which began to fall during the second half of 2012, would improve as 2013 unfolded. The market was skeptical - and sent Caterpillar’s shares down as much as 30 percent from the 52-week high of $108.79 they touched last spring - as it waited to see if the trickle of bad news on the mining front became a torrent. On Monday, Caterpillar essentially gave up on mining for 2013, saying it now expects sales of traditional mining machines — large trucks, large loaders, large bulldozers and the like — to be down 50 percent from 2012, and the excavators and shovels made by its Bucyrus unit to be down 15 percent. And that was just what the market was waiting for, analysts said. “The cat’s out of the bag,” said Larry De Maria at William Blair & Co. “With Monday’s report and conference call, Caterpillar confirmed what bears have been warning about: mining will drag down EPS.” Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar agreed. Fleck said Caterpillar decision to throw in the towel on mining sales for 2013 gave investors confidence the company was no longer in denial. “Investors knew it would be bad, but wanted some quantification from the company,” he said. And it was that capitulation, ironically, that made Caterpillar one of the S&P;’s biggest gainers on the day.

312,CAT,Shares of Caterpillar look 'cheap': Barron's,"(Reuters) - Shares of the world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) look poised to rise as the economic recovery picks up, financial newspaper Barron’s said on Sunday. Caterpillar rose 2.7 percent to $86.98 on Friday following positive U.S. economic news, which may be a good entry point for investors with a 12- to 24-month horizon, the article said. The company’s stock rose to around $100 in February from $80 in November as markets felt better about the state of the global economy, but have fallen since. Barron’s said further global growth worries could take the shares back down to $80, but said Caterpillar’s 2.4 percent dividend yield “should ease the pain. Meanwhile, the stock should hit double digits again.” The stock is trading at an enterprise value - net debt plus market capitalization - of 8.5 times, which is below its historical median of 11.2 times. Barron’s said Caterpillar has made progress on cost cutting and said its inventories have been falling. It also pointed to the fact that Caterpillar made money during the 2008-2009 global recession, and said the company has a strong balance sheet and benefits from being the leader in a business with high entry barriers. “When companies like that go on sale - and Caterpillar seems cheap - their shares are usually worth a look. At these levels, the stock seems to discount a lot of bad news,” the newspaper said.

313,CAT,"Talks suspended between Caterpillar, Milwaukee workers' union","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said Thursday that a bid by the United Steelworkers Union to re-open contract talks on behalf of workers in Milwaukee who make mining machinery had not resulted in a breakthrough and that no new meetings between the two sides were scheduled. The existing contract, which covers 800 workers that Caterpillar inherited with its 2010 purchase of Bucyrus, expired on April 30. Last week, those workers rejected a proposed new contract offered by the company that, among other things, would have frozen wages for existing workers in the Milwaukee bargaining unit and created a second, lower-tier wage level for newer hires. While apparently far apart, neither side appears poised for a showdown. The workers, who make giant mining shovels and draglines that dwarf much of the other heavy equipment Caterpillar makes, have said they will continue to report for work under the existing contract. A Caterpillar spokesman said Thursday that while no new talks were scheduled, “we remain open to listening”. Caterpillar says the concessions are needed, in part, because of the downturn in its sales to the global mining industry. Last month, the company said it was laying off more than 10 percent of the workforce at a plant in Decatur, Illinois that makes mining equipment. Caterpillar said the layoffs, which affected 460 workers, were needed to “bring production in line with demand.” Caterpillar is the world’s largest maker of mining equipment. The Peoria, Illinois-based company also makes construction equipment, gas turbines and diesel engines, and railroad locomotives.

314,CAT,"China deal ends distraction, but not questions, for Caterpillar","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s (CAT.N) deal to cut the purchase price of a Chinese mining-equipment maker it bought last year ends an embarrassing episode that overshadowed the company’s effort to expand in China and distracted its executives for months. Now, analysts say, comes the hard part: Proving to investors that ERA Mining Machinery, the Chinese maker of hydraulic roof supports that Caterpillar purchased, really can help penetrate China’s huge underground mining market. In January, Caterpillar took a $580 million impairment related to the ERA deal after discovering what it characterized as a “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at Siwei, a subsidiary that handled ERA’s principal business. Late on Thursday, Caterpillar said it reached a deal with the former controlling shareholders of ERA to cut $135 million from the $886 million purchase price - a move welcomed by analysts even if the money involved was, in the words of one, “a blip” in the U.S. company’s overall finances. “Outside of the reduction in purchase price, the chief benefit of the settlement is to eliminate the management distraction caused by the issue and get on with realizing the potential that led Caterpillar to buy this company in the first place,” said Alex Blanton, a senior analyst at Clear Harbor Asset Management in New York. “Whether or not it realizes the potential is another question,” he said. The deal reduces the outstanding obligations Caterpillar has to MML, and to former ERA directors Emory Williams and John Lee, as well as MML shareholder James Thompson, to $29.5 million. Caterpillar still owed the four about $164 million. In exchange, Caterpillar agreed to end any litigation targeting the Chinese company’s former directors or auditors related to the alleged accounting misconduct. A Caterpillar spokesman declined to comment on the settlement on Friday, citing “pending litigation” - a reference to the shareholder lawsuits over the charge. Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Securities, said the dispute overshadowed ERA’s real importance to Caterpillar: giving it the product line and distribution it desperately wants in China, which produces and consumes more coal than any other country in the world. Caterpillar, long the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, has also become the world’s largest mining equipment maker in recent years. One question that remains is how Caterpillar will account for the $135 million, which - potentially - could lift its earnings as a noncash, nonrecurring item. “From an economic standpoint, for Caterpillar’s business and for Caterpillar’s shareholders, it’s rather de minimus,” said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. “But it’s real savings.” In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Caterpillar told investors it was gaining market share in China despite a slowdown in economic growth there. Sales of its distinctive yellow construction and mining machines were up in the first quarter of 2013 over the same period of 2012 even as its inventories there declined.

325,CAT,"China, U.S. companies' great hope, now a drag","NEW YORK (Reuters) - It’s official. China’s slowdown is starting to hurt corporate America. As the world’s second-largest economy - and still growing - China is seen as a primary source of revenue growth by the largest U.S. companies. But a country that once boasted double-digit growth is now growing at a more modest 7.5 percent rate, its credit markets are overheated and fears of a housing bubble remain. The slowing has occurred as major U.S. names garner more revenue from Asia. Among 18 S&P; companies with large exposure to China, 12 of them were underperforming the broader S&P; 500 .INX index year-to-date, including Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) and Intel (INTC.O), which noted the slower growth in China as a headwind. “The China impact is becoming more and more significant because the (U.S.) companies’ exposure has grown so much over the years,” said Robbert van Batenburg, director of market strategy at Newedge in New York. Those concerns have caused investors to reduce their global emerging-markets equity exposure to its lowest in 12 years, according to a Merrill Lynch survey. Industrials, luxury goods makers and companies in the commodities and consumer businesses have built up huge exposure to China. On Wednesday, hedge fund guru Jim Chanos said he was shorting Caterpillar (CAT.N), sending shares down nearly 2 percent. Chanos has long argued that China’s economy is headed for a crash, saying the company is “tied to the wrong products at the wrong part of the cycle.” About 25 percent of Caterpillar’s revenue comes from the Asia/Pacific region, though it does not break out revenues by country. A Merrill Lynch fund manager survey from June pegs China’s problems as the most worrisome factor. The survey said the prospect of a hard landing in China stands out as a major tail risk identified by fund managers, with 56 percent ranking it first on this measure, compared with just one-third of respondents giving it that ranking a month ago. “China has gone from a very difficult transition as they try to spur internal consumption. That has produced inflation and a big credit crunch,” said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Corp in San Francisco. “I think a lot of people underestimated the effect of China and Brazil. (Going forward) they will probably be very conservative on their estimates. They’re going to scale down,” Aguilar said. Yum Brands, the operator of the KFC and Taco Bell chains, reported a 15 percent drop in quarterly earnings last week as KFC sales in China, a crucial market for Yum, have been falling since December. Nearly 51 percent of Yum’s revenue is from China, up from just 34 percent two years ago. Intel, which has about 16 percent of its revenue from China, also cut its full-year revenue forecast and said it is scaling back capital spending as it adjusts to a painful contraction of personal computer sales and economic weakness in China. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N derives 58 percent of its revenue from China, up from 45 percent in 2010. The company’s quarterly loss was 9 cents a share, ahead of the forecast for a 12-cent loss. It did not mention China in its press release. Analysts content that without the People’s Bank of China injecting liquidity into its financial system, growth will keep declining. Societe Generale now projects GDP growth in the world’s second-largest economy at as low as four to five percent by the end of this decade. Some analysts say companies can withstand China’s slowdown by shifting their focus to programs funded by the central government, which are designed to lift the middle class segment of the population to 45 percent or more later this decade from about 40 to 41 percent currently. If the companies target the middle class, they can enjoy steady growth in their sales in China, but if they continue to focus on export-oriented projects funded by cash-strapped local governments, they will be disappointed, according to Nicholas Heymann, analyst at William Blair & Co in New York. He noted that United Technologies’ (UTX.N) Otis elevator unit has been successfully growing in China as demand for elevators outpaces supply in the country. Beverage companies also are counting on a growing middle class to boost sales. Coca Cola (KO.N) CEO Muhtar Kent said earlier this week that China is a great consumer market with a very robust new middle class. “We’re very bullish on the long-term prospects in China,” Kent told reporters. Still, the slowdown in China comes at an especially bad time for U.S. industrials, given persistent weakness in the Eurozone and the lackluster recovery in the U.S. “China affects all of the industrials, some more than others. Machinery names tend to be more economically sensitive, more volatile, more leveraged,” said Brian Langenberg, founder of research firm Langenberg & Co in Chicago. “Caterpillar would say inventories are coming back into line. But your outlook on a stock depends on what implicit growth rate you are expecting from China,” he said. Caterpillar’s revised outlook for 2013, which it may update next week when it reports earnings, reflects an expected 50 percent decline in sales of its traditional mining trucks and loaders as well as a 15 percent decline in sales of draglines made by Bucyrus, the Milwaukee-based company it bought in 2010. “Some of the companies that have been hit, a lot of it was in infrastructure, the Caterpillars of the world, Joy Global and some others. Is there likely to be some spillover? There could be. This probably will be the quarter where it will rear its head,” said Perry Adams, vice president at Northwestern Bank in Traverse City, Michigan.

During Wednesday’s regular session, stocks declined across the board, with nine of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sector indexes moving lower. The utilities index was the worst performer, shedding 1.6 percent, while the materials and energy indexes fell nearly 1 percent apiece. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 25.50 points, or 0.16 percent, to end at 15,542.24 - a day after closing at a record 15,567.74. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 6.45 points, or 0.38 percent, to finish at 1,685.94. But the Nasdaq Composite Index inched up 0.33 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to close at 3,579.60. Analysts said the stock market was pausing as investors booked profits after a sizable upward move over the past month. The S&P; 500 has added as much as 7.8 percent since late June, and it has set some record closing highs along the way. Tech bellwether Apple rose 5.1 percent to $440.51 a day after it reported earnings and revenues that beat Wall Street’s estimates, helping to keep the Nasdaq afloat and bolster the S&P; 500’s tech shares as well. The S&P; tech sector index  rose 0.86 percent to end at 506.92, after climbing as much as 1.4 percent earlier in the day. Caterpillar and AT&T;, on the other hand, disappointed investors after posting results. Caterpillar shares fell 2.4 percent to $83.44. AT&T; shares tumbled 1.2 percent to $35.40. Boeing, also a Dow component, posted upbeat second-quarter results, but the stock fell 0.8 percent to close at $106.95 after hitting a lifetime high of $109.48 earlier in the session. Broadcom shares tumbled 15.1 percent to $27.01 a day after the chipmaker forecast lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue. At least four brokerages cut their ratings and about 10 lowered their price targets on Broadcom’s stock. Of the 169 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported results so far this season, 65.7 percent have beaten analysts’ expectations for earnings and 53.3 percent posted revenue above forecasts. Over the past four quarters, 67 percent of companies have beaten earnings estimates. Shares of little-known uranium company USEC Inc  gained for a ninth consecutive day, extending a meteoric rise. On Wednesday, the stock leaped 7.1 percent to end at $13.35. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, slightly below the daily average of about 6.4 billion.

Poor earnings from Caterpillar and AT&T; overshadowed robust earnings from iPad and iPhone maker Apple and data showing a pick-up in U.S. manufacturing and new home sales. Still, neither the Dow nor S&P; 500 were far below the intraday record highs they set on Tuesday, while global stock prices, tracked by MSCI, lingered at a near five-year high. “The earnings season so far has been pretty good for most companies. Investors anticipated good numbers and they got them, although the forecasts haven’t been necessarily strong enough to push the market higher,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “I think the market now stands at a point where you are going to need good economic numbers to really move higher.” News of a surprise improvement in U.S. and European factory activity offset further signs China’s economy is cooling. Data showing the Chinese manufacturing sector contracting for a third straight month spurred selling in oil. Better outlooks for the United States and Europe supported the dollar and euro, while gold snapped its four-day winning streak on profit-taking. Initial estimates of manufacturing activity across the 17-nation euro zone currency bloc showed the region on course to end its 18-month old recession, led by a surge in activity in German and French factories. Across the Atlantic, Markit’s “flash” U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 53.2, a four-month high, while output also was at its strongest since March. Investor sentiment was also boosted by a U.S. government report showing that new home sales rose to a five-year high in June even in the wake of higher mortgage rates. The encouraging data from the United States and Europe offset worrisome news from China. A survey of its vast manufacturing sector showed Chinese activity slowed to an 11-month low in July, suggesting the world’s second-biggest economy was still losing momentum.

In mid-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 51.84 points, or 0.33 percent, at 15,515.90. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 8.13 points, or 0.48 percent, at 1,684.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.84 points, or 0.05 percent, at 3,577.43. Shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar fell 2.8 percent to $83.12 after it reported lower quarterly profits and reduced its outlook for full-year earnings. AT&T; stock shed 1.5 percent to $35.28 after the No. 2 U.S. mobile service provider posted quarterly profits that fell short of expectations despite better-than-expected revenues. Caterpillar and AT&T; are components of the Dow and S&P; 500. Unlike their U.S. counterparts, European shares clung to gains. Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index ended up 0.6 percent at 1,214.63. It had risen nearly 1 percent earlier due to a 0.9 percent rise in technology stocks on the back of Apple’s forecast-beating results posted after the U.S. market closed on Tuesday. Apple shares were up 6 percent at $443.86, their highest level since June 10. MSCI’s world equity index was down 0.25 percent on the day at 375.09, held back partly due to weakness in Asian shares on concerns over China’s outlook and a subsequent downturn on Wall Street from its record highs.

331,CAT,"Caterpillar slashes outlook, plans more cost cuts","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported a 43.5 percent drop in quarterly profit and cut its outlook for the year on Wednesday, blaming steeper-than-expected inventory reductions by dealers and continued weak demand from the mining industry. The world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment, which has reduced its worldwide workforce by 8 percent in the past year, said the cost-paring would continue in the second half. It did not give details. “There’s no question there’s a slowdown. But long-term ... mining is a great place to be,” Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview with CNBC. Lower metal prices have forced mining companies around the world to move dramatically to lower capital and operating costs, including putting on hold expansions and new projects, and cutting non-essential spending. Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO), the world’s largest gold producer, has canceled all new mine projects, save for its Pascua-Lama project in South America. Even there, it has slowed construction and slashed spending for the next two years. Copper miner Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc (FCX.N) said on Tuesday it cut $1.9 billion in planned capital spending, adding that more cuts, along with asset sales, will be pursued. The softness in mining was the main reason the company and its dealers slashed inventories. The company’s 200 worldwide dealers sell everything from construction and mining equipment to power systems. The company said its dealers reduced inventories by $1 billion in the quarter, while the company cut its own inventories by another $1.2 billion. Together, it said, the actions were “significantly negative to profit.” “We’re actually producing and selling to dealers far less than they’re selling to end users and their customers,” Oberhelman told CNBC. “That bodes well for the future, but it’s certainly been a drag on earnings.” (Interactive graphic on Q2 industrials: link.reuters.com/jeb89t) In the second quarter, Caterpillar reported a profit of $960 million, or $1.45 a share, down from $1.70 billion, or $2.54 a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of $1.70 per share. The company, which also makes locomotives, gas turbines and diesel engines and generators, said sales fell nearly 16 percent to $14.62 billion. Looking forward, it now expects a full-year profit of about $6.50 a share, down from its previous target of $7. The company forecast full-year sales at $56 billion to $58 billion, down from its previous forecast of $57 billion to $61 billion. In April, Caterpillar posted disappointing quarterly results and cut its full-year 2013 profit forecast, citing a drop in demand from mining customers. But some analysts worried the situation was deteriorating faster than Caterpillar was acknowledging and the emphasis in recent years on increasing its penetration in the global mining business would be a short-term problem if the slowdown in China reduced incremental demand for mined commodities. Last week, short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates said he was betting against the shares of Caterpillar because the company was “tied to the wrong products at the wrong part of the cycle.” Rising interest rates, meanwhile, have raised concerns the nascent recovery in the construction market, another key area for Caterpillar, could be derailed. But in its results on Wednesday, Caterpillar said business in China improved in the quarter and builder demand for its earth-moving machines was up, even though the overall construction equipment industry was down. Reaction on Wall Street to the news from Caterpillar was muted, with the shares down 1.3 percent to $84.43 in mid-day trading. Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair, said the earnings miss and forecast cut had been “well previewed” and already priced into the shares. Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Research, agreed. “It’s an ugly quarter,” he said. “And the drop in mining is substantial. But there are really no big surprises here.” The company has cut 10,000 employees from its full-time payroll in the last year.

Facebook Inc shares scored their biggest daily percentage gain ever - soaring 31.6 percent to a session high of $34.88 a day after the online social network company reported a huge jump in mobile advertising revenue. The stock closed at $34.36, up 29.6 percent, and topped the Nasdaq’s list of most actively traded names. Disappointing earnings in the cyclical sector limited the gains in both the Dow and the S&P; 500. Caterpillar Inc was the biggest drag on the Dow, falling 1.6 percent to $82.14. The stock slid for the second day, extending a selloff that began on Wednesday after the world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment cut its 2013 earnings forecast. General Motors and Dow Chemical reported profits that exceeded expectations, but that was not enough to help the S&P; 500 make a big push into positive territory. GM’s stock fell 0.2 percent to $37.08, after touching a two-year high of $37.70. Dow Chemical rose 1.8 percent to $34.99. Still, the market managed to advance slightly, with nine of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sector indexes ending the day higher. Material and utility shares were the best performers, after being among the weakest in Wednesday’s session. “The trend in the market is upward unless there’s some active piece of bad news. No news is good news, in that sense,” said Brian Gendreau, market strategist with Cetera Financial Group in Gainesville, Florida. “The earnings aren’t really surprising anybody. The corporate sector is strong, and the earnings sector is still pretty strong.” Shortly after the bell, Starbucks released its third-quarter results and its stock jumped 6.8 percent in extended-hours trading. Starbucks ended the regular session at $68.17, up 2.3 percent. Shares of Amazon.com Inc dropped 2.3 percent in extended-hours trading after the world’s largest Internet retailer reported second-quarter earnings and gave a cautious forecast for the third quarter. During regular trading, Amazon’s stock rose 1.5 percent to close at $303.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.37 points, or 0.09 percent, to end at 15,555.61. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 4.31 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,690.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 25.59 points, or 0.71 percent, to close at 3,605.19. The major U.S. stock indexes have advanced steadily this year. The S&P; 500 has climbed 18.5 percent in 2013 after hitting a number of record closing highs along the way. For July, the benchmark index has added 5.2 percent. With 47 percent of the S&P; 500 companies having reported earnings so far, about 68 percent have topped profit forecasts, above the historical average of 63 percent. About 56 percent have reported better-than-expected revenue, a rate that is below the historical average. TripAdvisor Inc shares vaulted 16.3 percent to $71.10 a day after the company reported a jump in quarterly profit and revenue from its travel website. The stock was the S&P; 500’s second-biggest percentage gainer. Natural gas processor Oneok Inc leaped 25.5 percent to $53.77. The stock was the S&P; 500’s best performer on the day after the company said it would separate its gas distribution business into a standalone publicly traded company called ONE Gas Inc.

341,CAT,China growth picture may dim but for Caterpillar it's a bright spot,"CHICAGO, July 24 (Reuters) - Few U.S. companies have had a harder time in recent months defending their enthusiasm for China than Caterpillar Inc. In January, executives acknowledged that accounting misconduct at a Chinese subsidiary would wipe out nearly half of Caterpillar’s expected earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012. Last week, its China exposure was criticized by a top short-seller who warned China’s economic growth was essentially a state-sponsored bubble that was about to burst. But on Wednesday, executives at the Peoria, Illinois-based maker of earth-moving equipment were unapologetic, not only defending the long-term wisdom of their China strategy but highlighting how the country had been a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing quarter. “I am not one in the camp of a China implosion - that China will implode and drag the world down into a massive black hole,”  Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman told analysts during a call to discuss the company’s earnings miss in the latest quarter. In an earlier appearance on CNBC, he was even more blunt: “We think China has bottomed” - referring to the moderation in that country’s GDP, which grew at 7.5 percent rate in the second quarter, according to the country’s National Bureau of Statistics, down from 7.7 percent in the first quarter and 7.9 percent in the last three months of 2012. Not so long ago, Caterpillar’s big exposure to China was welcomed by Wall Street, not questioned. Sales in that country, which remained largely unscathed during the recession that walloped the developed world, helped Caterpillar’s sales snap back in 2010, 2011 and 2012 - even as many other companies continued to struggle with sluggish demand in the United States and Europe. And on Wednesday, even as Caterpillar was cutting its full-year forecast, it was talking up China again. Sales in the country, excluding acquisitions, were up 20 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, Caterpillar said, driven by demand for construction equipment and power system products. Caterpillar said the gains came even as overall industry sales were down, meaning its market share is growing “We’re quite happy with that,” Oberhelman said. Not everyone thinks Caterpillar investors should be happy - or that the Chinese slowdown is over. In recent weeks, signs of a continued strain in the world’s second-largest economy have prompted some investors, including short-seller Jim Chanos, who argues China’s economic miracle is a mirage, to predict that companies with strong China ties are facing major risks. Caterpillar, which has benefited from the Chinese domestic construction boom as well as the global mining boom tied to  China’s demand for industrial commodities, is at the top of Chanos’ list of such companies. Chanos, who is perhaps best known for shorting energy giant Enron Corp before its collapse, says he believes that as China falters, it will curb the demand for raw materials that has driven demand for Caterpillar’s earthmoving equipment. Last week, Chanos announced he was betting against Caterpillar because the company was “tied to the wrong products at the wrong part of the cycle” - a reference to the big investment Caterpillar has made in mining equipment in recent years. On Wednesday, Oberhelman acknowledged - not for the first time - that the mining industry is in a slump and that this downturn is hurting Caterpillar’s business. That was a major reason Caterpillar’s profit dropped 43.5 percent in the second quarter and the company cut its outlook for the year in Wednesday’s results announcement, sending its shares down more than 2 percent. “Having been in this business 38 years and lived though cycle after cycle around the world, we’re definitely in a cycle in mining,” Oberhelman told CNBC. “There’s no question there’s a slowdown. But long term  mining is a great place to be.” The slowdown was illustrated by figures on Wednesday showing that activity in China’s vast manufacturing sector slowed to an 11-month low in July. In the conference call with analysts, Oberhelman embraced both areas that Chanos says make the company vulnerable: “Long term, China and mining, are appealing to us,” Oberhelman said. Caterpillar Controller Mike DeWalt pointed out that the country is continuing to grow despite the doomsayers and that, even at a reduced clip, that growth is impressive. “We do not expect the significant economic growth rates that China experienced over the past 10 years will continue indefinitely,” DeWalt said. “But we do believe that China will continue to grow at a much faster pace than the rest of the world.” He added that because China has grown so much over the past decade, economic growth rates of 7 to 7.5 percent have a greater impact today than a 10 percent growth rate would have had 10 years ago. “It’s a big economy that, relative to the world in total, is growing faster.” Alex Blanton, a senior analyst at Clear Harbor Asset Management in New York, says China’s stated policy of accelerated urbanization - the government plans to move more than 20 million people a year from the farm to the cities in the coming decade - will drive growth. China will continue to require massive investments in infrastructure and other kinds of construction that will drive demand for the heavy machinery and other goods made by U.S. industrial companies like Caterpillar, he said. “China’s been slowing down for a couple of years now,” Blanton said. “But it’s still growing at more than a 7 percent rate - more than double what we’re seeing in this country.”",7252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpillar-results-china/china-growth-picture-may-dim-but-for-caterpillar-its-a-bright-spot-idUSL1N0FU1U620130725
342,CAT,UPDATE 2-Whirlpool buys 51 pct stake in China appliance maker,"* To acquire majority stake in Hefei Sanyo for $552 million * Deal gives U.S. company more access to fast-growing market * Caterpillar’s ERA fiasco may not be chilling M&A; market Aug 13 (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp said on Tuesday it will buy a majority stake in China’s Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co Ltd for $552 million as the world’s largest maker of home appliances seeks to expand its sales in Asia. Hefei Sanyo, which makes washers, microwaves and refrigerators sold under the Sanyo, Rongshida/Royal Star and Diqua brand names, employs 10,000 workers at three manufacturing facilities in China. Last year, the company, which competes with larger Chinese companies such as Haier Electronics Group Co Ltd and GD Midea Holding, reported a net profit of $48 million on sales of $636 million. The deal represents the first big purchase of a Chinese company by a blue-chip U.S. buyer since Caterpillar Inc  bought ERA Mining, a maker of underground mining equipment, in 2012. Caterpillar later discovered an ERA subsidiary had engaged in accounting misconduct that inflated ERA Mining’s value. Although Caterpillar was able to significantly reduce its purchase price, the Peoria, Illinois-based company was forced to take a $580 million charge as a result of the deal, and some analysts feared the fiasco would put a chill on foreign purchases of Chinese companies. Whirlpool’s purchase of Hefei Sanyo will help the U.S. company boost its business in Asia, which contributed just 5 percent of its total sales of $4.7 billion the second quarter. Hefei Sanyo was set up in 1994 as a joint venture between Japan’s Sanyo Electric Co, now a unit of Panasonic Corp , and Hefei State-Owned Assets Holding Company Ltd, the investment arm of the local state government. “Whirlpool has a strong presence in China’s higher tier segments, this acquisition allows the company to build on, complement, and grow its position in the emerging Chinese market,” Chief Executive Jeff Fettig said in a statement. Whirlpool said its China unit would initially buy Sanyo’s 29.51 percent stake in the company through a share purchase deal. It will then acquire the remaining shares through a private placement. Whirlpool China will have to pay a break-up fee of $20 million if it fails to close the transaction.",8132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/whirlpool-china/update-2-whirlpool-buys-51-pct-stake-in-china-appliance-maker-idUSL4N0GE29T20130813
343,CAT,Analysis: Caterpillar plan illustrates risk of variable pay plans,"PEORIA, Ill (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) has put workers on notice that its short-term incentive plan, the centerpiece of a performance-based, profit-sharing program, will make its smallest payout since the recession when the payments go out next March. Like a lot of companies, the world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment has adopted what is known as a “pay-at-risk” compensation system, which ties a percentage of nearly every non-union employee’s income to Caterpillar’s financial performance. In updates to the plan’s roughly 60,000 participants, and in quarterly disclosures to investors, Caterpillar said it expects outlays related to the program to be down as much as 40 percent from last year, reflecting sharply reduced payments to employees. As U.S. workers pause this weekend to mark Labor Day, more of them than ever before are being required to participate in these alternative pay systems. The plans enable companies to have their labor costs more closely track the ups and downs of business cycles - but they also expose employees to those fluctuations. “Where I think we stand on Labor Day in 2013 is that workers are bearing more risks in their employment relationship than they have at any time in the last quarter century,” said Donald Lewin, a compensation and reward expert at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Ninety percent of companies now require employees to participate in variable pay plans, up from about 50 percent two decades ago, according to a survey of 1,100 U.S. companies by human resources consulting firm Aon Hewitt. The dollars tied up in the plans, meanwhile, have quadrupled, from about 4 percent of payrolls in the early 1990s to about 12 percent of payrolls today, according to Aon Hewitt Advocates of the plans say they allow employees to participate in the prosperity of their employers. Caterpillar, for instance, has issued checks worth nearly $2.8 billion over the last three years. But critics say the plans are also part of a broader transfer of risk from employer to employee that has in recent decades led to the demise of company-paid traditional pension plans and the rise of self-funded, self-directed 401(k)s. “Variable pay is not just for executives anymore,” said Ken Abosch, a compensation expert at Aon Hewitt. “There’s been a very strong but consistent trend to push variable pay programs deeper into organizations, and it’s become a mainstream pay-for-performance practice.” It is not clear whether ordinary workers have prospered as the plans have proliferated. In the early 1990s, when only half of U.S. companies had variable pay programs in place, workers could count on annual pay increases of 5 percent on average, according to Aon Hewitt. Two decades later, with variable compensation plans in place at 90 percent of all U.S. companies, workers are seeing their pay grow an average of 3 percent each year, Aon Hewitt said. Executive pay, meanwhile, has jumped by double-digits year after year, rising faster than average salaries, managerial pay or corporate earnings, according to Standard & Poor’s annual compensation survey. The key driver? Performance-based compensation. “Cynics say that variable pay is just a thinly disguised way to get executives more money,” said Kerry Chou, a senior practice leader with WorldatWork, a non-profit trade association for compensation professionals. The “pay-at-risk” plan at Caterpillar, like similar incentive programs at thousands of other U.S. companies, accounts for between 8 percent and 64 percent of an employee’s annual compensation, depending upon pay grade. Yet the payouts can rollercoaster in ways that seem unrelated to the company’s actual performance, and create uncertainty around what employees actually get paid for the work they do. In March 2012, shortly after Caterpillar closed out what was at the time the most profitable year since its founding, it distributed a record $1.2 billion to the roughly 50 percent of its 120,000 global workers who participate in the plan. The next year, the Peoria, Illinois, company did even better, with sales up 10 percent and earnings-per-share up 15 percent. But the payout to employees plunged 31 percent. The reason: The results, while impressive and an all-time record, fell short of internal targets set by management. Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive, was not exempted. His short-term incentive pay dropped 34 percent last year, according to securities filings. But unlike many rank-and-file employees, Oberhelman also participates in a medium-term incentive plan, which pays out cash each year based on three-year performance measures, providing a cushion from annual fluctuations. As a result, Oberhelman’s total cash incentive pay rose 2 percent last year, and his overall compensation jumped 32 percent, according to SEC filings. Caterpillar spokesman Jim Dugan said in a statement that the anticipated reduction in short-term incentive pay for 2013 would “impact Doug Oberhelman’s compensation significantly in total cash terms.” Dugan added that “the value of other compensation components will also significantly impact his total compensation” but declined to be more specific. Lewin at the UCLA Anderson School of Management said top executives often have added features in their “pay-at-risk” program that rank-and-file employees do not enjoy. That sometimes leaves ordinary workers more exposed to the ups and downs of corporate performance than executives. Lewin said he believed that disconnect was contributing to the growing income gap that President Barack Obama - in a speech this summer just down the road in Galesburg, Illinois - said was threatening to strain the country’s social fabric. “It’s a huge issue and feeds into the problem of income inequality in the United States,” said Lewin. Caterpillar will not break any profit records in 2013. Cancellations from mining customers have weighed on sales and profits, and the company has been forced to cut its forecast for full-year earnings twice, and to plan major cost cuts. Still, Caterpillar is on track to report its third-highest profit in history. If the company’s current projections hold up, when this year ends, Caterpillar’s earnings per share will have fallen 12 percent over a two-year period. But payouts under its short-term incentive plan will have plunged 60 percent. In Peoria, home to 6,000 of the workers covered by the plan, City Treasurer Patrick Nichting said that in good years, it is easy to see ripple effects of the Caterpillar payouts on the local economy. “If we just look at home rule sales tax, from 2009 to 2012, comparing it year over year and month over month, there always seems to be a spike in March,” Nichting said. This year, though, retailers noticed a dip after Caterpillar began to warn employees that payments for 2013 could drop. Some local business people say they noticed an almost immediate drop in sales activity. “We had a really strong first quarter,” said Mike Wiesehan, one of the owners of Lippmann’s Furniture, a family-owned business that has been a fixture in Peoria since 1949. “And then April 1 (came) and it was like someone put a padlock on the front door,” he said.

Despite lower closes in the past two sessions, the major stock indexes ended higher for the week. The Dow rose 0.6 percent, the S&P; gained 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent. On Wednesday, the Fed surprised economists and investors with its decision to delay scaling back its stimulus. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, interviewed by Bloomberg TV, said a reduction of the Fed’s $85 billion monthly bond purchase program beginning in October was possible. Bullard later said in a speech in New York that low inflation meant the Fed can be patient in deciding when to scale back its pace of asset purchases. But Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George sharply criticized her colleagues’ decision this week not to reduce the Fed’s bond-buying program, warning it sowed confusion and risked the U.S. central bank’s credibility, given markets conviction that the policy would be adjusted. “The fact of the matter is they (the Fed) basically had a ‘freebie.’ The markets had already adjusted for all this. They (the Fed) would be able to take the first step in doing some tapering,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. “The market will view this as a bad move on their part, and we are already seeing that today. It is also a reflection on what the Fed didn’t do and some disappointment with that.” Two companies made their stock market debuts with initial public offerings and achieved stellar results. New stock offerings by cybersecurity company FireEye Inc  and advertisement technology company Rocket Fuel Inc  managed to debut with spectacular results. FireEye shares opened 101.5 percent above the IPO at $40.30 and closed up 80 percent to $36. Rocket Fuel also more than doubled in its trading debut, and ended he session up 93.4 percent to $56.10.

345,CAT,RPT-US STOCKS-Wall St falls after comments from Fed officials,"* Caterpillar drags Dow after reporting sales * Trading volume heavier than normal on quadruple witching * FireEye, Rocket Fuel shares soar in trading debut * Dow off 0.71 pct; S&P; off 0.56 pct; Nasdaq off 0.24 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped on Friday as investors grappled with comments by Federal Reserve officials in the wake of the central bank’s decision not to trim its stimulus, but two companies made  initial public offerings with stellar results. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, interviewed by Bloomberg TV, said a reduction of the Fed’s $85 billion monthly bond purchase program beginning in October was possible. On Wednesday, the Fed surprised economists and investors with its decision to delay scaling back its stimulus. Bullard also said in a speech in New York later that low inflation meant the Fed can be patient in deciding when to scale back its pace of asset purchases. “The fact of the matter is they (the Fed) basically had a ‘freebie.’ The markets had already adjusted for all this. They (the Fed) would be able to take the first step in doing some tapering,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. “The market will view this as a bad move on their part, and we are already seeing that today. It is also a reflection on what the Fed didn’t do and some disappointment with that.” Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George told the Shadow Open Market Committee in New York that the central bank needs to move away from the bond-buying policy and called the decision not to taper disappointing. Even with the indexes declining, new stock offerings by cybersecurity company FireEye Inc and advertisement technology company Rocket Fuel Inc managed to debut with spectacular results. FireEye shares opened 101.5 percent above the initial public offering price at $40.30 and last traded up 87.8 percent to $37.56. Rocket Fuel also more than doubled in its trading debut,  and recently traded up 91.4 percent to $55.52. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 110.32 points or 0.71 percent, to 15,526.23, the S&P; 500 lost 9.61 points or 0.56 percent, to 1,712.73 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 9.017 points or 0.24 percent, to 3,780.367. Trading volume was heavier than usual as Friday marks the “quadruple witching,” when stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures all expire on the same day. Trading increases as investors replace or repurchase existing contracts. In addition to the quadruple witching, all three major U.S. stock indexes, as well as the FTSE and U.S. index trackers, will rebalance their portfolios to match revisions to index weights. This happens at the close of trading, which could push trading volume higher as transactions jump at the exact close. “Since the largest of these products which are index futures and options expire on the open, the effect is most pronounced at the open. However, with stock and ETF expirations, as well as index rebalancing, occurring at the close, there can also be significant impact on the close,” said Ana Avramovic, derivatives Strategist at Credit Suisse in New York, in a note to clients. Caterpillar Inc was the biggest drag on the Dow, down 2.5 percent to $85.59 after the maker of heavy machinery reported sales for the three-month rolling period ending in August. Apple Inc, which rose 0.6 percent to $474.91, helped curb declines on the Nasdaq as the company’s latest version of its iPhone product line hit stores around the world. The Dow industrials and the S&P; 500 index were on track to show a gain for the week, aided by a rally on Wednesday that took both indexes to record highs after the Fed’s decision.

346,CAT,Caterpillar dealer report offers little hope for 3rd-qtr earnings,"* Unaudited dealer sales show weakness almost everywhere * Asia, Latin America among the once-hot regions now suffering * But signs of a nascent rebound in North America * Report comes one day ahead of third-quarter earnings By James B. Kelleher CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc released unaudited dealer sales data on Tuesday - one day ahead of its scheduled third-quarter earnings - that showed continued weak demand for its machinery and engine products. The Peoria, Illinois-based company, the world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment, said global dealer sales of its yellow earthmoving machines were down 9 percent year-over-year in September. While negative, that represented a modest improvement over August, when dealers reported that global equipment sales were down 10 percent from a year earlier. The slowdown in equipment sales continued to be particularly acute in the Asia Pacific region, where sales tumbled 24 percent in September. But for a second month in a row, the weakness spread to Latin America, a region that had been a bright spot for the company until recently. One highlight in September was North America, where equipment sales rose for a second month in a row, a reflection of the nascent rebound in public spending on infrastructure projects as well as the wobbly but ongoing recovery in residential and nonresidential construction, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Caterpillar said global dealer sales of its gas turbines and diesel engines and generators, meanwhile, were down 2 percent year over year in September. In August, those sales of so-called power systems were down 6 percent. In July, Caterpillar reported disappointing earnings and slashed its outlook for 2013, blaming steeper-than-expected inventory reductions by dealers and a downturn in the global mining industry. At the time, the Peoria, Illinois-based company, which had already reduced its worldwide workforce by 8 percent over the past year, warned the cost-paring would continue in the second half - though it did not provide any details. Caterpillar is expected to update investors on its restructuring program when it reports early on Wednesday. Mining equipment is Caterpillar’s most profitable product category. But sales to the sector have been hurt in recent quarters because miners, facing investor backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metal prices, have slashed capital spending, slowed the development on some projects and shelved others entirely.

350,CAT,"Caterpillar posts lower results, cuts outlook yet again","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s (CAT.N) ill-timed bet on the global commodity boom came back to haunt it yet again on Wednesday, forcing the heavy equipment maker to post a lower-than-expected profit. The company also cut its full-year forecast and offered a first glimpse of 2014 sales that suggested weakness from mining customers would continued to bedevil sales in the new year. The news sent the Peoria, Illinois-based company’s shares down more than 6 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. During a conference call to discuss the results, Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said he was confident mining customers would begin ordering again, but acknowledged he did not have any idea when that would happen. But in recent discussions with mining executives, Oberhelman said they had all made one thing clear: “Any expansion in the near term is dead, it’s over, it’s not going to happen.” Mining equipment is Caterpillar’s most profitable product category and those fat margins were one of the reasons the company made mining equipment a focus of its M&A; activity in recent years, buying Bucyrus, a U.S. maker of giant excavators and shovels, for $7.6 billion in 2010, and ERA Mining, a Chinese mining equipment company, for $654 million in 2012. But the ink was barely dry on those deals before Caterpillar’s global mining customers, facing investor backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metal prices, slashed capital spending, slowed development on some projects and shelved others entirely, and postponed or canceled new equipment orders. That pullback, which caught Caterpillar by surprise, has forced the company to cut its outlook three times so far this year. On Wednesday, it forced the company to admit that sales next year are likely to be flat compared with 2013, and could be down as much as 5 percent. Caterpillar said it had temporarily shut some plants, furloughed thousands of salaried and management employees and reduced its full-time workforce by 3,000 during the third quarter. Over the past year, the company has cut more than 13,000 jobs, about 10 percent of the global total. It said additional workforce reductions and the consolidation of plants were possible. Ann Duignan, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities, said the latest cut to the company’s 2013 profit forecast suggested that layoffs, furloughs and other cost-reduction strategies were falling short of goals, and that “costs are not coming out as quickly as expected.” Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment, reported a third-quarter profit of $946 million, or $1.45 a share, down from $1.7 billion, or $2.54 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.66 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales and revenue fell 18 percent to $13.4 billion. (For a Caterpillar earnings graphic, click on link.reuters.com/fyx93v) The downturn in mining sales is not the company’s only resource-related headache. In January, Caterpillar said it was writing off three-quarters of the money it paid for ERA after uncovering “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at a subsidiary of the Chinese firm. In the minds of many analysts, the ERA debacle symbolized a rash rush by Caterpillar to double down on a notoriously cyclical business. With no uptick in orders expected, Caterpillar said it now expects a full-year 2013 profit of $5.50 a share on sales of about $55 billion, down from an earlier forecast of $6.50 a share on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion. It is the third time the company has cut its full-year forecast. There were few bright spots in Caterpillar’s latest report on its worldwide operations. It said it was seeing signs of an improvement in the U.S. construction market, and that dealer deliveries to end users were up year-over-year. That raised the possibility the inventory liquidation that has weighed on its results this year might come to an end in 2014. But even here there were signs of possible trouble. Profitability from construction sales was poor during the most recent quarter, and Caterpillar warned it could continue to be under pressure because of an, “increasingly competitive pricing environment.” “The third quarter was hideous, the fourth quarter will stink and the guidance for 2014 is very, very subdued,” said Brian Langenberg, the principal at Langenberg and Co, a research firm focused on the industrial sector. Nevertheless, Langenberg thought Wednesday’s sell-off represented a buying opportunity, in part, because of the underlying improvement in construction. In afternoon trading, Caterpillar shares were down 6.2 percent at $83.62, well below the 52-week high of $99.70, reached in February, but above their 52-week low of $79.50, touched in April, when the company issued the first of its profit warnings.

Kelleher CHICAGO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Cummins Inc, the U.S. maker of engines and other vehicle components, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and cut its full-year outlook, citing weak sales to most of the industries its serves, including mining. The news sent Cummins shares tumbling as much as 9.2 percent. The Columbus, Indiana-based company said sales of all its products had also contracted sharply in India in the most recent quarter as a result of declining business confidence and manufacturing activity there. Like many emerging markets, India has seen an exodus of foreign investment in recent months as expectations have grown that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to taper its massive stimulus program. “Of all of our markets, India is currently the most challenging,” Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger told analysts during a conference call to discuss this results. “Customers cut orders to lower working capital and preserve cash as business confidence declined in the face of weak industrial activity and rising inflation.” Truck production alone tumbled 33 percent in the third quarter in India, Linebarger said, and September’s production numbers were the lowest in a decade. Cummins now expects full-year revenue to fall 3 percent versus its previous forecast of revenue being flat in 2013. The company also cut its forecast for profit before interest and taxes to a range of 12.5 to 13 percent of total sales, down from 13 to 14 percent of sales. Cummins, which supplies the engines that run hauler trucks, loaders and excavators used in mines all over the world, said lower capital equipment spending by resource companies also caused earnings to fall short of expectations and prompted the cut in its forecast. Cummins was the latest U.S. company to blame the mining sector’s weakness for its financial woes, joining heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc and steelmaker Timken Co. Miners, facing investor backlash over unpopular takeovers and budget overruns and suffering from falling metal prices, have slashed spending on new equipment and have even begun to  cannibalize components from old mining equipment in order to avoid spending money on new spare parts. Cummins posted third-quarter net income of $355 million, or $1.90 a share, up from $352 million, or $1.86 a share, last year. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $2.11, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the quarter fell 1 percent to $2.5 billion. Cummins shares were down 7.1 percent at $125.27 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday afternoon, off an earlier low at $122.54.   (Reporting by James B.

362,CAT,"GE pushes gas power for drill rigs, Caterpillar's diesel turf","* Caterpillar has dominant position in market for rig engines * Tighter emissions rules may accelerate switch * GE says gas far cheaper for drillers than diesel By Terry Wade HOUSTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is trying to deploy more of its natural gas engines on rigs drilling for hydrocarbons in the North American energy boom - where Caterpillar Inc diesel engines have long been the industry standard. The sales push comes as GE forecasts global natural gas consumption will rise by a third through 2025 and as it makes strategic investments in the gas sector - like its 2010 purchase of U.S. engine maker Waukesha. Rigs, mammoth machines that bore holes in the earth before the extraction of crude oil and natural gas, normally rely on three engines that burn expensive diesel and operate around the clock. Engineers at energy and drilling companies consulted by Reuters - from Ensign Energy Services Inc to Patterson-UTI Energy Inc and Devon Energy Corp  - say that natural gas engines are far cheaper to run than diesel, which is often trucked in to remote drilling sites from far away. GE says potential savings are significant and that running cleaner-burning natural gas would help curb greenhouse gas emissions from rigs and reduce tanker truck traffic on overburdened local roads near drill sites. “Exploration & production (E&P;) companies can save $600,000 per engine, per year by switching to natural gas-fueled engines versus diesel. E&Ps; can realize a $1.8 million fuel savings per rig by using field gas versus diesel,” GE said in an email. There are about 1,700 oil and gas rigs actively drilling in the United States, according to Baker Hughes Inc. According to several industry experts, at least 80 percent of the diesel engines are made by Caterpillar, followed by smaller market shares for Cummins Inc and MTU Detroit Diesel. Caterpillar declined to comment on its share of the rig market, but emphasized it has a line of natural gas engines it is also selling to clients. “In the gas space, we are seeing a big opportunity,” said Steve Igoe, Caterpillar’s commercial manager. The adoption of gas engines has been slower over the past couple of years than many in the industry had predicted - in part because of infrastructure constraints. But the switch to gas rigs may start to accelerate as stricter diesel regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency take effect in 2015, more filling stations offer compressed natural gas, and newer engines are set up to burn gas from local wells. Evidence of the pace of change to gas and away from diesel is mostly anecdotal. Ensign said it has about 300 drilling rigs globally and about 20 of them can run natural gas, with four those being so-called dual fuel engines. Of some 192 rigs in operation, Patterson has four rigs running entirely on natural gas and has commitments to power five other rigs with gas engines. “How far and how quickly things will grow is unknown - but it is clear that companies are moving beyond the pilot project phase,” said Brian Murphy, engineering manager at Ensign. Competition in the market for rig engines between GE and Caterpillar is just the latest skirmish in a pitched battle between the two titans - which already compete in the lucrative market for locomotive engines and replacement parts. Both companies say their gas engines can run on gas that varies in quality and that may contain liquids. That means a rig could in theory run on gas produced at local wells. But relying on field gas can be tricky. “These wells don’t give up a steady supply of gas all the time so that means you are depending on a well for fuel that varies and that becomes a dynamic situation,” said Michael Matlock, a senior facilities engineer with Devon.",11122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-rigs-engines/ge-pushes-gas-power-for-drill-rigs-caterpillars-diesel-turf-idUSL1N0II1DA20131112
363,CAT,Caterpillar to close another mining equipment plant,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Friday that it will close another plant and lay off 240 additional workers as it continues to respond to a sharp drop in demand for its earth-moving products from customers in the mining industry. The planned shutdown of the Pulaski, Va. facility, which makes coal haulers and other equipment, is expected to be completed by mid-2014. It is the latest in a series of such closures announced by the Peoria, Ill-based heavy equipment maker. Earlier this month, Caterpillar said it would restructure a factory that makes underground mining equipment in the Australian state of Tasmania, idling 200 workers there. Last month, it said it was closing a mining equipment facility in Kilgore, Texas and laying off the 100 workers employed in it. Those closures and firings came on the heels of a number of smaller consolidations and shutdowns at plants in Beckley, W. Va., Tazewell, Va., and Sudbury, Ontario that put more than 75 employees out of work. In addition, Caterpillar has laid off 900 workers at its biggest mining equipment plants in Decatur, Ill. and South Milwaukee, Wis. Caterpillar also makes construction equipment, railroad locomotives, and a variety of reciprocating and turbine engines. But mining equipment is its most profitable product category. Those margins were one of the reasons it made mining equipment a focus of its merger and acquisition activity in recent years, buying Bucyrus, a U.S. maker of giant excavators and shovels, for $7.6 billion in 2010, and ERA Mining, a Chinese mining equipment company, for $654 million in 2012. But the ink was barely dry on those deals before Caterpillar’s global mining customers, facing investor backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metal prices, slashed capital spending, slowed development on some projects and shelved others entirely, and postponed or canceled new equipment orders. That pullback, which caught Caterpillar by surprise, has forced the company to cut its outlook three times so far this year. Last month, as it released disappointing third-quarter earnings, Caterpillar warned its 2014 sales could be down as much as 5 percent from 2013. Over the past year, the company has cut more than 13,000 jobs, about 10 percent of the global total, as the slowdown in its mining business forced it to repeatedly post lower-than-expected quarterly results and repeatedly slash its outlook.

367,CAT,Caterpillar probed for dumping train parts into sea: WSJ,"(Reuters) - A unit of Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) is being probed by federal investigators to determine if it had dumped train parts into the ocean off California as part of a scam to charge customers for parts they didn’t need, the Wall Street Journal reported. Investigators are probing whether Progress Rail Services Corp was dumping brake parts and other items into the sea near the Port of Long Beach, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. (r.reuters.com/syp84v). The dumping was part of an effort to conceal evidence that Progress was charging owners of rail equipment for replacing parts that were still in good shape, the paper said. Caterpillar said in a regulatory filing on November 1 that Progress Rail had received a subpoena from a U.S. federal court in California related to the investigation. The grand jury investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California because of suspicions that Progress was breaking environmental laws, according to a person familiar with the matter, the paper said. A spokeswoman for the world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment repeated on Friday that the company was cooperating with authorities and had no further comment. Progress Rail, acquired by Caterpillar in 2006 for about $800 million, repairs locomotives and railcars. Railroad operator Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) was one customer believed to have been affected by the alleged activities, the Journal said. Caterpillar has had trouble before with companies it has acquired.

371,CAT,Special Report: How Caterpillar got bulldozed in China,"ZHENGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Asia’s top mergers and acquisitions bankers gathered two years ago at the swanky Island Shangri La in Hong Kong to celebrate the top deals of 2012. As the transactions were being toasted, one was unraveling. Advisers on Caterpillar Inc’s $677 million purchase of ERA Mining Machinery Ltd picked up an award for cross-border deal of the year. The purchase was billed as a coup for Caterpillar, the world’s top maker of tractors and excavators. ERA was the holding company for Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical & Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Co Ltd, one of China’s biggest makers of hydraulic coal-mine roof supports. Siwei would help Caterpillar gain traction in the world’s largest coal industry. “Siwei was going to be our Chinese business card,” said a person with direct knowledge of Caterpillar’s strategy. The night of the awards on November 16 three Caterpillar lawyers were wrapping up an eight-hour grilling of Wang Fu, Siwei’s chairman. Major accounting problems had been unearthed at Siwei headquarters in the gritty Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Two months later, on January 18, 2013, Caterpillar said it had discovered “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct” at Siwei. Wang was sacked. Caterpillar took a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $580 million - 86 percent of the value of the deal. The company says it was caught unaware by the problems at Siwei and only discovered them in November 2012, five months after the deal closed. A Reuters review of hundreds of pages of public documents, as well as interviews with former employees, board members, bankers and advisers, reveals a more complex story. Accounting problems were rampant at Siwei before Caterpillar bought it. Yet at multiple junctures, Caterpillar chose to ignore existing or potential problems and push ahead with the deal. A year and a half after directors of the Peoria, Illinois-based company signed off on the deal, it has become a case study in how a foreign company with decades of experience in China can still flounder in that market. It also shows how willing some multinationals are to accept risks they might otherwise avoid to establish themselves in the world’s second-largest economy. The deal has triggered legal action against Caterpillar. In May, Caterpillar announced it had settled a dispute with Siwei’s controlling shareholder, owned by an heir to the Crown Worldwide logistics company fortune and the former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Four shareholder suits filed in the United States in Caterpillar’s home state of Illinois are continuing. Meanwhile, Siwei has foundered. Former employees told Reuters that as of September, the company had no new orders in 2013, and it had fired or furloughed about half of its workforce. Siwei’s former CEO, Wang, says his books were a mess but he committed no wrongdoing. “We were a legend in the industry,” Wang, 52, told Reuters, in his first media interview since the announcement of the write-off. Wang is now pursuing a second act: He has launched a new company with a nearly identical name in the same business. He has yet to build a factory, but says he can take Siwei’s old customers when he does. When it bought Siwei, Caterpillar had been doing business in China for more than 30 years. It had amassed 20,000 China employees, dozens of manufacturing, research, logistics and parts centers and a broad dealer network. It had nine new facilities under construction, and had just completed the $8.8 billion purchase of Bucyrus, a mining and earth-moving company with significant China operations. When former Chinese president Hu Jintao dined with a group of American businessmen in 2011, Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman was included. But the company was slow to ramp up production of construction machinery in China and lost out on market share as a result, says Anthony Farmer, a former executive at Caterpillar. It didn’t want to make the same mistake in coal mining equipment. China’s coal industry is the largest in the world, but it also insular. Local companies, particularly state-owned enterprises, prefer locally made products, said Farmer, now at construction and mining consultancy Millton Group. Siwei was attractive. It once was state-owned, but no longer. That, and the fact that it was listed in Hong Kong - under the name of ERA - made it much easier for a foreign company to buy. Moreover, the roof supports it made - spatula-like hydraulic arms that keep underground coal mines from collapsing - were lucrative, since 80 percent of China’s mines are underground. Siwei retained close ties to the government. In 2012 alone, it was visited twice by the Communist Party leader of Zhengzhou. Adding to the appeal, Siwei also had three high-profile investors with American ties. Li Rubo, an American-trained mining engineer and an early Siwei investor, had arranged mining deals in Russia and Mongolia - sensitive undertakings that would have required political connections. Emory Williams, an American business associate of Li, was a major shareholder and chairman of Siwei’s parent. He had invested in a Beijing concrete business back in the mid-1990s. The son of a former senior Sears executive, Williams had also served as chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. And along with Li, he had founded another Chinese mining company recently sold to another American mining equipment maker. The third investor was Jimmy Thompson. He was Li Rubo’s son-in-law - and the son of billionaire Jim Thompson, who founded Crown Worldwide, the transport, relocation and storage giant. Li and Williams were part of the reason Caterpillar felt comfortable with the acquisition, several people with direct knowledge of the situation said. “They provided loans, they helped finance the company,” one of those people said. Beyond that, their influence was limited. “The show was run out of Zhengzhou on a day-to-day basis. Unfortunately, they were further away from the business than I had expected,” that person said. “Our reliance on them was the blind leading the blind.” Li, Thompson and Williams declined to comment for this story. Steve Wunning, the Peoria-based president of Caterpillar’s mining equipment division, Resource Industries, and then-Chief Financial Officer, Ed Rapp, pitched the idea of buying Siwei to the company’s board of directors in October 2011. It was codenamed “Project Sequoia.” The board expressed support for the strategy, according to court documents filed in the United States. The first sign of trouble surfaced quickly. On November 7, 2011, the board received a two-page memo explaining that Siwei would need an immediate $50 million loan for working capital. Excerpts of the memo were contained in the court documents. The memo explained that Siwei’s customers weren’t paying what they owed. It also noted Siwei hadn’t made overtime payments to its workers and didn’t hold operating permits required by Chinese regulations. Fixing these and other issues, the memo said, would cost CAT as much as $30 million. The board was unfazed. That same day, the directors voted for the acquisition, authorizing the purchase of Siwei for up to $964 million. It would be the biggest foreign machinery acquisition in Hong Kong or China since the country opened up for business in 1978. The board also authorized the loan for working capital. Four months later, in March 2012, the board received another memo signaling trouble at Siwei, court documents showed. The company had missed its 2011 financial targets, and its parent company, ERA, was going to report a $2 million loss rather than a $16 million profit. Wunning also told the board that Siwei’s average receivables had grown to an extraordinary 371 days, according to filings in connection to the court case. Corporate filings show the amount owed to Siwei by customers had risen 58 percent per year since 2008, overtaking total sales in 2011. Some 90 percent of those debts were overdue when Caterpillar launched its bid. Mining equipment companies typically finance at least part of their customers’ purchases. However, once accounts are more than 90 days old, they are almost always disqualified from being counted as collateral for loans. At six months, they are widely recognized as needing to be turned over to a collection agency, or they are written off or reserved in full, according to one of the four shareholder suits filed in the United States. The complaint says the receivables issue rendered Siwei’s revenues and assets “highly suspicious and most likely wholly illusory.” Unsold goods were also a problem for Siwei. At the end of 2010, the average number of days Siwei’s products sat in storage was 414, double what it was during China’s economic slowdown in 2009. Caterpillar spokesman Jim Dugan said the company would not comment directly on matters of “pending litigation.” But he said Siwei’s accounting problems were unrelated to the profit warning and other issues the company found during its due diligence of the acquisition. “The Siwei accounting issues that led to the goodwill impairment charge involved Siwei’s falsification of its books,” Dugan said in an email. “Therefore, Siwei’s profit warning and failure to meet its 2011 targets, the $50 million working capital loan to Siwei, and other issues that came up in the course of Caterpillar’s diligence were not ‘red flags’ as to the accounting fraud.” The news release announcing Caterpillar’s tender offer went out on June 6, 2012. Documents produced for one of the Illinois court cases show that Caterpillar’s board of directors did not ask for the results of the due diligence investigation, which ran from about September 2011 until June 2012. The board also did not look into whether Siwei’s financial problems had been resolved. And it did not adjust the offer price, the documents indicate. Siwei had been focused almost entirely on gaining market share. Getting customers to actually pay their bills came to seem like an afterthought, former executives told Reuters. “They would take orders without down payments, so they had to finance the whole thing,” said a person with direct involvement with Siwei. The point “was to try to get market share.” This person added: “These were all things we felt we could fix once we were on board.” Caterpillar was so bullish on China, it may have been willing to overlook some of Siwei’s problems, former insiders say. “There was also a lot of euphoria. We were really going to dominate. Not only in mining but also in China,” the person said, and old China hands Williams, Li and Thompson would help. “Obviously it was too much, and we got burned.” At first, Wang Fu was equally exuberant about the deal. Siwei’s former CEO is a native of the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning with nearly 30 years experience in the machinery industry. His first job out of college in 1984 was with the state-owned company from which Siwei would eventually be spun out in 2003. In Siwei’s first year of operation after the spinoff, sales were less than 20 million yuan. Growth came quickly amid China’s insatiable hunger for coal. By 2011, revenue approached 2 billion yuan ($500 million). On June 8, 2012, two days after the acquisition was completed, Caterpillar executives addressed Siwei’s first post-merger board meeting in Zhengzhou. They pledged to preserve Siwei’s culture and way of doing business. Wang says he was inspired. Siwei would retain independence, but be able to draw upon the experience and expertise of its new Fortune 500 parent. The excitement faded quickly. Accounts of what went wrong, why and how, now diverge completely in Peoria and Zhengzhou. In the interview, Wang said he knew Siwei’s accounting methodology was bad, and its finance team too inexperienced to make improvements. He said as CEO, his primary concern had been chasing market share. “Better to have market share than to solve every single problem and lose the market.” But his finance team, he said, couldn’t keep up as the firm grew and orders poured in. Wang said he was proactive about the accounting problems. He raised it two or three times at Siwei board meetings, he said, hoping Caterpillar’s more experienced finance team could help. He said the board gave him half a year to resolve the issue. Caterpillar denies that. Spokesman Dugan said Wang never brought the issue up and said Siwei’s accounting problems - including the existence of a second set of books - were only discovered in November 2012, after Caterpillar found inventory discrepancies. Wang says there was no second set of accounting books. Wang said he mobilized employees in finance, sales, manufacturing and technology to dig into the accounting issues following the acquisition. At the time, Wang said, nobody knew exactly how bad things were. By October 2012, Wang found that costs were sometimes allocated to incorrect projects. Other times, the company had simply not capitalized costs, or had accounted for them improperly on Siwei’s balance sheet. Siwei had also double-booked some sales, which led to inventory discrepancies. At the same time, however, by Wang’s estimates, the company’s income had been underreported by about 170 million yuan because it had under-valued equipment made in-house. Caterpillar spokesman Dugan said this account was not accurate, but did not respond to specific questions about whether Caterpillar had written off too much. Requests to interview Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Oberhelman were declined. In the months to follow, Wang’s relationship with Caterpillar soured. Every decision, it seemed to Wang, had to go through Caterpillar’s lawyers, and Wang said he rarely interacted with senior Caterpillar executives. At the end of Wang’s marathon grilling by Caterpillar attorneys on November 16, the day of the awards ceremony in Hong Kong, the attorneys concluded there had been mismanagement but no fraud, Wang said. Two months later, Wang says he was told to drop by Caterpillar’s China headquarters in Beijing at the tail end of a business trip. Company lawyers fired him, he says, and refused to answer his questions. The written notice said: “Your misconduct and serious dereliction of duty have caused severe damage to the company. You have also seriously violated company rules.” Since Caterpillar bought Siwei, it has had no new orders for hydraulic roof supports, two former employees with knowledge of customer accounts said. The number of working employees fell to about 1,900 in September from about 4,300 at the start of the year, one former office employee said. Four other former employees corroborated the scope of the cuts. Wang feels Caterpillar never had a “comprehensive understanding” of Siwei’s financial situation and believes he was the scapegoat. “It looks like it is precisely to justify and cover up a dereliction of duty by their so-called elite teams that an easily discovered management issue is labeled as deliberate, intentional fraud,” he said. Caterpillar stands by its allegation of fraud. And it is trying to open a new era at the company it acquired. On November 8 it announced the company name had been changed to Caterpillar (Zhengzhou) Ltd. The Siwei brand, it said, would be phased out.

Company lawyers fired him, he says, and refused to answer his questions. The written notice said: “Your misconduct and serious dereliction of duty have caused severe damage to the company. You have also seriously violated company rules.” Since Caterpillar bought Siwei, it has had no new orders for hydraulic roof supports, two former employees with knowledge of customer accounts said. The number of working employees fell to about 1,900 in September from about 4,300 at the start of the year, one former office employee said. Four other former employees corroborated the scope of the cuts. Wang feels Caterpillar never had a “comprehensive understanding” of Siwei’s financial situation and believes he was the scapegoat. “It looks like it is precisely to justify and cover up a dereliction of duty by their so-called elite teams that an easily discovered management issue is labeled as deliberate, intentional fraud,” he said. Caterpillar stands by its allegation of fraud. And it is trying to open a new era at the company it acquired. On Nov. 8 it announced the company name had been changed to Caterpillar (Zhengzhou) Ltd. The Siwei brand, it said, would be phased out. ",1232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpillar-china-special-rep/special-report-how-caterpillar-got-bulldozed-in-china-idUSL3N0IT1SV20140123

375,CAT,North American machinists union slate challenges top leaders,"SEATTLE, Jan 25 (Reuters) - North American members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers on Saturday nominated challengers seeking to replace top union leaders, a move that could lead to a tougher negotiating stance toward major companies. At stake is control of about 339,000 dues-paying members at companies ranging from aerospace and defense giants Boeing Co  and Lockheed Martin Corp to United Airlines , heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc, a factory owned by furnishing retailer Ikea AB, and even Maine lobstermen. On Saturday, members at several of roughly 800 local lodges nominated candidates to challenge current IAM President R. Thomas Buffenbarger, General Secretary-Treasurer Robert Roach and eight general vice-presidents, members and union officials said. Results of the nomination are expected next week after the lodges submit results to national leaders. The nominations could spark a runoff Feb 8 to decide which nominees the lodges will endorse. If the challengers win support from at least 25 local lodges, an election would be held in April, the first contested IAM ballot in more than 50 years. If fewer than 25 lodges support the challengers, the incumbent leaders would automatically be elected. Jay Cronk, a Metro-North Railway mechanic in New Haven, Connecticut, who is challenging Buffenbarger for IAM president, said he’s opposed to what he and other members see as high spending by the current leaders. With membership declining, top leaders’ salaries should not keep rising and they should not have a private jet for travel, “We have developed a culture of privilege at the top,” said Cronk, who also served as staff member of the national union organization for 14 years. According to Department of Labor records, Buffenbarger was paid $304,000 in total compensation in 2012, the latest figure available, up from $293,000 in 2011. Roach’s total compensation was $271,000 in 2012 and $258,000 in 2011. Membership has declined to 577,000 active and retired members in 2012 from about 731,000 in 2000, according to the Department of Labor. The incumbent leaders say the challengers lack experience and skills to run a union with a $1 billion strike fund, a $9 billion health and pension fund and annual spending of more than $160 million. It was unclear whether the challengers could obtain the 25 lodge endorsements needed to trigger an election, said Richard Sloan, a spokesman for the IAM’s current leaders. “We have not had a contested election since 1961,” Sloan said. “That means no candidate except the incumbents have ever exceeded the requirement of 25 locals nominating. Much of the reason for that is the candidates that run are fools and flakes and fops and didn’t come up to the level of seriousness required of candidates.” Of the Learjet, Sloan noted IAM members make plane at Bombardier Inc and it costs less than commercial flights for the 250 days a year Buffenbarger travels. While the issues in the contest initially revolved around spending and management of the union, a leadership change also could affect the direction the union will take on pensions and other key contract elements. The IAM recently made headlines when it negotiated an eight-year extension to the IAM labor contract with Boeing that would ensure the company’s newest jetliner, the 777X, would be built in Washington state, where IAM has about 31,000 members. In exchange, workers agreed to replace their pension with a defined-contribution retirement plan. They also accepted lower raises and higher health care costs. The contract was widely rejected by Seattle-area members in November. In January, international leaders held a second vote on a revised contract, despite objections from local union leaders in the Seattle area, who said the new offer was too similar to the first one that had been rejected. The contract was approved by 51 percent of members who voted. The decision roiled the membership, exposing deep divides on pensions versus job security, and has prompted members to file unfair labor practice charges against the union and Boeing. Jason Redrup, an elected business representative of the local 751 in Seattle, who is running for one of the eight general vice president positions, said he would have tried to persuade members not to vote away their pensions. “As a leader I would not advocate that members give up so much,” he said. “If they decided to do it, that’s their right.” The IAM nominations are being rerun after a complaint filed last year prompted the U.S. Department of Labor to investigate. It found that there was insufficient notice of the nominations, and ordered the union to hold them again.",1262014,http://www.reuters.com/article/machinist-election/north-american-machinists-union-slate-challenges-top-leaders-idUSL2N0KZ0FB20140126
376,CAT,S&P; 500 drops for a third day; Apple down after the bell,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks extended recent losses on Monday, with the S&P; 500 falling for a third straight session as concern grew about the Federal Reserve’s plans for withdrawing stimulus. The losses, which picked up late in the session after the S&P; 500 briefly traded in positive territory, followed a steep selloff late last week tied to emerging market concerns. The slide gave the S&P; 500 its worst weekly percentage loss since June 2012. Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), however, limited the losses of the Dow and S&P; 500. The stock jumped 5.9 percent to $91.29 after the maker of mining and construction equipment reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit. The technology sector led the day’s decline, with the S&P; 500 technology sector index .SPLRCT falling 1 percent and the Nasdaq underperforming both the Dow and S&P; 500. Google (GOOG.O), off 2 percent at $1,101.23, and Microsoft (MSFT.O), down 2.1 percent at $36.03, were among the day’s biggest drags. After the bell, shares of Apple (AAPL.O) fell 5.7 percent to $519.38 after its results showed iPhone holiday sales lagged Wall Street’s expectations. “There’s still a lot of nervous money hanging around,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president of BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “The Fed is meeting this week, and the consensus is they’re going to proceed with the taper.” The Fed’s two-day policy meeting begins on Tuesday. Many market participants are bracing for the market to sell off if the Fed decides to keep withdrawing stimulus. In December, the U.S. central bank announced plans to begin scaling back its massive bond-buying program. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 41.23 points or 0.26 percent, to end at 15,837.88. For the Dow, Monday marked a fifth session of losses. The S&P; 500 .SPX dropped 8.73 points or 0.49 percent, to finish at 1,781.56. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC slid 44.56 points or 1.08 percent, to close at 4,083.61. Last week’s heavy selling raised some concerns that the market may be in for a major correction, especially with the S&P; 500 closing on Friday below its 50-day moving average for the first time since October 9 and falling further below that level on Monday. The Nasdaq also ended below its 50-day moving average on Monday. In another indicator of possible market direction, the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT ended down 0.8 percent after dropping 4.1 percent on Friday, its biggest decline since September 2011. Some did not consider the recent selling as cause for concern. “The slowdown in emerging markets isn’t prevalent enough to derail the deepening economic recovery that we’re seeing across developed markets,” said Steven Rees, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. “We’re not expecting a major correction in the market this year.” Another dampener on Monday’s sentiment was data showing sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell more than expected in December, even though lean inventories and steady price gains suggested sufficient strength in the housing market. But Caterpillar was the latest major company to beat on bottom-line results. Caterpillar’s cost cuts and an uptick in demand for building equipment offset weak sales to the mining industry. S&P; 500 earnings for the fourth quarter are now expected to have increased 8 percent from a year ago, with 66.7 percent of results so far beating analysts’ profit expectations, Thomson Reuters data showed.

379,CAT,"RPT-UPDATE 3-Caterpillar tops estimate, sees gains in 2014; stock up","By James B. Kelleher Jan 27 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday as cost cuts and an uptick in demand for its building equipment offset continued weak sales to the mining industry. The results, together with a better-than-estimated preliminary profit forecast for 2014 and a new $10 billion share repurchase plan, sent Caterpillar’s stock up as much as 7 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “We expected there would be a decline in mining sales in 2013, and it turned out to be worse than we anticipated,” Doug Oberhelman, the chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “As a result, we took substantial actions to reduce costs which helped mitigate the impact on profit.” Caterpillar, which cut nearly 10,000 jobs globally last year, said it was beginning to see “some signs of improvement in the world economy, which should be positive for sales” down the road. It expects construction-equipment sales, which jumped 20 percent in the most recent quarter, to rise another 5 percent in the coming year. “This is probably the quarter a lot of investors were looking for,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar. Caterpillar’s cautious optimism extended to the emerging markets, a source of investors’ concern in recent weeks. The company forecast economic growth picking up modestly in the world’s developing economies in 2014. Caterpillar’s outlook wasn’t entirely rosy. The company  expects mining customers, which have slashed orders in recent quarters, to continue to reduce their investments in new equipment this year. The mining sector had been one of the company’s most profitable in recent years and Caterpillar doubled down on the business through acquisitions. But over the past year and a half, mining customers faced investor backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metal prices, and postponed or canceled new equipment orders. Oberhelman said on Monday that Caterpillar expects those headwinds to continue in 2014, with mining equipment sales declining another 10 percent. He said that the company would “take additional actions” during the year to cut costs. He characterized the moves as “tough decisions necessary to better position us down the road when economic conditions improve and our sales rebound.” Brian Langenberg, an analyst with independent research firm Langenberg & Co, said Caterpillar’s latest results suggested the “the worst is over.” Even the continued challenges in the mining sector will get “less bad” in 2014, Langenberg said. The Peoria, Illinois-based company, which also makes locomotives and diesel and turbine engines, reported fourth-quarter profit of $1 billion, or $1.54 a share, up from $697 million, or $1.04 a share, in the same period of 2012. Revenue fell 10 percent to $14.4 billion. Analysts, on average, expected Caterpillar to post a profit of $1.28 a share on sales of $13.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.

The technology sector was the biggest loser with the Nasdaq falling more than 1 percent. The Dow industrial average was outperforming the broader market thanks to Caterpillar Inc  which reported better-than-expected results. “Earnings gave investors hope but the reality of all the moving parts of emerging markets and weak home sales made them rethink how good results from a handful of companies really are,” said Kim Forrest, analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc.

Many market participants expect another selloff if the Fed decides to keep withdrawing its stimulus, further pressuring equities already roiled by a flight from emerging markets last week.

The day’s decline followed a steep selloff last week, raising concerns that the market may be in for a major correction. The S&P; 500 fell 2.6 percent for the week, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Oct. 9, suggesting more selling may be ahead for the market that closed out 2013 with a 30-percent gain.

383,CAT,"UPDATE 3-Caterpillar tops estimate, sees gains in 2014; stock up","By James B. Kelleher Jan 27 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday as cost cuts and an uptick in demand for its building equipment offset continued weak sales to the mining industry. The results, together with a better-than-estimated preliminary profit forecast for 2014 and a new $10 billion share repurchase plan, sent Caterpillar’s stock up as much as 7 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “We expected there would be a decline in mining sales in 2013, and it turned out to be worse than we anticipated,” Doug Oberhelman, the chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “As a result, we took substantial actions to reduce costs which helped mitigate the impact on profit.” Caterpillar, which cut nearly 10,000 jobs globally last year, said it was beginning to see “some signs of improvement in the world economy, which should be positive for sales” down the road. It expects construction-equipment sales, which jumped 20 percent in the most recent quarter, to rise another 5 percent in the coming year. “This is probably the quarter a lot of investors were looking for,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar. Caterpillar’s cautious optimism extended to the emerging markets, a source of investors’ concern in recent weeks. The company forecast economic growth picking up modestly in the world’s developing economies in 2014. Caterpillar’s outlook wasn’t entirely rosy. The company  expects mining customers, which have slashed orders in recent quarters, to continue to reduce their investments in new equipment this year. The mining sector had been one of the company’s most profitable in recent years and Caterpillar doubled down on the business through acquisitions. But over the past year and a half, mining customers faced investor backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metal prices, and postponed or canceled new equipment orders. Oberhelman said on Monday that Caterpillar expects those headwinds to continue in 2014, with mining equipment sales declining another 10 percent. He said that the company would “take additional actions” during the year to cut costs. He characterized the moves as “tough decisions necessary to better position us down the road when economic conditions improve and our sales rebound.” Brian Langenberg, an analyst with independent research firm Langenberg & Co, said Caterpillar’s latest results suggested the “the worst is over.” Even the continued challenges in the mining sector will get “less bad” in 2014, Langenberg said. The Peoria, Illinois-based company, which also makes locomotives and diesel and turbine engines, reported fourth-quarter profit of $1 billion, or $1.54 a share, up from $697 million, or $1.04 a share, in the same period of 2012. Revenue fell 10 percent to $14.4 billion. Analysts, on average, expected Caterpillar to post a profit of $1.28 a share on sales of $13.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.

386,CAT,What polar vortex? Caterpillar sales to builders surge despite chill,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Thursday that sales of its construction equipment had surged in recent months, driven by an especially large jump in demand in North America, where a series of severe winter storms and arctic temperatures failed to keep builders out of dealer showrooms. The Peoria, Illinois-based company, the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment used by builders and miners, said that worldwide retail sales to end users in the construction industry rose 9 percent in the three months ended January 31, driven by a 12 percent increase in North America. Those gains came even as the much of the United States experienced its worst winter in a generation, according to meteorologists, with temperatures across a vast area of the country running 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) below normal for two-and-a-half straight months. In recent weeks, a host of U.S. companies - including McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), GNC Holdings Inc (GNC.N), La-Z-Boy Inc (LZB.N) and Panera Bread Co PNRA.O - have blamed the bad weather for disappointing results or reduced earnings outlooks. But the relentlessly cold weather, which also resulted in unexpected drops in retail sales, manufacturing output and housing starts in January, according to recent official reports, failed to put a chill into Caterpillar’s construction equipment business. The good news, however, largely ended there for the company, which also makes railroad locomotives and power-generating engines and turbines. Total worldwide sales of Caterpillar’s distinctive yellow tractors, graders, excavators and other earth-moving equipment fell 8 percent in the three months ended January 31, pulled down by continued weak demand from mining customers. Global dealer sales to the mining industry tumbled 37 percent year-over-year in the rolling three-month period, with the largest declines in the Asia-Pacific region, where weak demand in Australia and other key markets sent sales plunging 53 percent. When Caterpillar reported fourth-quarter earnings in January, it said it expected the mining business to remain tough this year as resource companies continue to come under pressure from investors to cut costs and retrench. Sales to the mining sector had been one of Caterpillar’s most profitable businesses in recent years, prompting the company to double down through acquisitions. But over the past year and a half, mining customers - facing a backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metals prices - have postponed or canceled new equipment orders. Caterpillar sells its machines through a worldwide network of more than 200 independent dealers. Each month, the company releases unaudited rolling three-month sales figures that those dealers voluntarily report to the company. The company cautions that the data may be inaccurate or incomplete because it is not subject to internal controls over financial reporting. But historically, the unaudited figures have provided a reliable glimpse of end user demand for products well ahead of the company’s official quarterly financial reports.

388,CAT,New threat to Brazil's breadbasket: a pesky caterpillar,"SAO DESIDERIO, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian farmers are battling a voracious caterpillar that likely arrived from Asia, challenging the agricultural superpower’s widely touted mastery of tropical farming just as it is on the verge of becoming the world’s top soybean producer. The caterpillar, a variety known as helicoverpa armigera that thrives in dry heat, was spotted for the first time in the Americas on cotton farms in drought-prone western Bahia in early 2012, fuelling panic among farmers who had no idea what it was. The caterpillar was soon in soybean fields thousands of kilometers away thanks to the long-distance flying power of its moths, consuming everything from tomatoes to sorghum. While crop losses have thus far been limited, Brazil is now on red alert over the nation’s third major pest outbreak in 30 years. Officials have stepped up port controls, farmers are rethinking planting patterns and the hardest hit are blaming the government’s cumbersome bureaucracy for not allowing the import of pesticides that have helped control the bug in other nations. Most importantly, the caterpillar appears to be eating away at Brazil’s proud claim to have conquered the craft of growing reliable crops in a tropical region where pests and disease can spread more quickly than for other major growers. “When you find helicoverpa armigera you have to act immediately, while they are still small,” said Rudelvi Bombarda, who farms 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) with his brother in São Desidério, a dusty farming hub in western Bahia. Bombarda found his first helicoverpa armigera in a bean plant. He knew by the way the fattened, worm-like creature had chewed its way inside the pod, beyond the reach of chemicals, that it was not one of Brazil’s usual leaf-eating pests. “If you wait and send it to a lab it will be too late,” he said. Bahia, one of Brazil’s newest farming frontiers, lost 3 million tons of soy and cotton, nearly half of its usual grains production, between the caterpillar and the drought last year, according to the National Confederation of Agriculture. Still, Brazil produced an 81.5 million ton soybean crop. To be sure, the caterpillar has not reduced forecasts for an even larger soybean harvest that could dethrone the United States as the world’s leading grower this year. But it has provided a wake-up call on the risks of farming in the bug-ridden tropics, especially as more farmland is put into use. It also shows how Brazil’s emergence as a major breadbasket has made it the fastest-growing market for biotechnology firms like Monsanto, which could benefit from the outbreak by selling its new caterpillar-resistant genetically modified soy and cotton seeds. The government’s agricultural research agency Embrapa determined helicoverpa armigera was a new species in Brazil last February, a year after farmers in Bahia had noticed it was different from other pests and seemed immune to pesticides. “No one was expecting a species like this,” said Alexandre Specht, the researcher whose microscope identified the caterpillar at a laboratory outside Brasilia. A small display case at the Embrapa Cerrados research center compares brown helicoverpa armigera moths with the nearly identical helicoverpa zea, already known in South America. The government is still studying how helicoverpa armigera arrived in Brazil. In the absence of a conclusive explanation, rumors of a bioterrorist attack occasionally surface. Most likely, the caterpillar arrived with cargo on a plane or ship from Asia, said Luis Rangel, director of the sanitation department at Brazil’s agriculture ministry. “With the intensification of this transit of goods it is natural that sooner or later one of these pests would show up,” he said in an interview. “The Chinese bring in a lot of plants, it could have come in through this transit.” China is Brazil’s No. 1 trade partner and buys most of its soybeans. In response to the outbreak, the government has added organic material detectors in its main ports and airports, technology that Argentina and Chile already had, Rangel said. Further measures will be taken in conjunction with the national intelligence agency when the World Cup starts in June, he said. Embrapa researchers said Brazil was also looking into building a pest-identification database at its main ports, like the helicoverpa armigera-free United States. The government had hoped to beat a pest cycle that has plagued Brazil once each decade since it started large-scale commercial agriculture. First there was the silverleaf whitefly in the 1990s, followed by soy rust fungus 10 years later, and both are still problems. Brazil was also the world’s top cocoa producer until Witches’ Broom disease devastated the industry in the 1990s. The country’s soy area expanded by some 40 percent in the past five years, meaning the helicoverpa armigera outbreak has had a more significant economic impact, Rangel said. The tendency of farmers to plant soy repeatedly instead of rotating crops has also made Brazil more vulnerable to pests, he said. To prevent another outbreak, the government is promoting “integrated agriculture,” which involves monitoring pests, rotating crops and seed varieties, and using biological controls and natural enemies, with chemicals as a last resort. It is a completely new approach, according to Rangel. “The helicoverpa changed everything about phytosanitary policy in Brazil,” he said. “The solution for helicoverpa is to bring in products to control the helicoverpa - immediately,” said Bombarda, an agronomist from southern Brazil who was lured by the potential to work with irrigation in western Bahia’s frontier and employs full-time bug monitors on his farm. The Bahia state government announced that Emamectin Benzoate, a substance manufactured by Swiss crop chemical maker Syngenta, would be available in March 2013, shortly after Embrapa identified the new caterpillar. Yet a year later, farmers still do not have access to it. “It turned into an unprecedented bureaucracy... the government created a bunch of rules and obstacles,” said Celito Breda, a cotton consultant in Bahia who has traveled across Brazil to discuss helicoverpa armigera and believes Emamectin Benzoate would provide the most efficient control. Syngenta said the company awaited decisions from federal and state governments on regulations and permits needed to import the product, which is sold all over the world, including the United States and parts of Latin America. Rangel said bureaucratic hurdles had been worked out and Emamectin Benzoate would be available with special approval on an emergency basis. He defended the government’s caution, saying that as a top commodities exporter, Brazil must be careful about what pesticides are used to avoid retaliation from buyers. President Dilma Rousseff’s government has authorized 36 other chemical and biological products to combat helicoverpa armigera, Rangel said. Two weeks from harvest, Bombarda’s soybean crop looks healthy. He applied pesticides 10 times, including five coats of Belt, a product he had never used before, made by Germany’s Bayer AG. Syngenta has so far lost out on what would have been a lucrative opportunity to sell Emamectin Benzoate in Brazil. But Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, had better luck. Over the past 11 years, Monsanto developed a caterpillar-resistant soybean strain specifically for South America, with an eye on Brazil’s growing pesticide reliance. “Today there is basically 12 months of continuous planting and you don’t break the pest cycle,” said Renato Carvalho, an insect control specialist at Monsanto in Sao Paulo. “Over the years pressure increases, the pests become resistant to the insecticides and increase in population.” China approved imports of the new seed, Intacta RR2 Pro, in June and it was first sold on the Brazilian market in July. The seeds accounted for some 4 percent of soybean area planted this season and are so far proving resistant to helicoverpa armigera. The company is also selling Bollgard Cotton seeds, which have helped control helicoverpa armigera in Australia. Some 90 percent of soybeans planted are genetically modified in Brazil, where international companies including Syngenta and Dow Agrosciences also sell seeds. More Intacta seeds will be available for next season, though not nearly enough to cover local demand, Monsanto said. Intacta seeds cost 115 reais per hectare, five times more than the 22 reais Brazilian farmers paid for the company’s previous technology, herbicide-resistant Roundup Ready. Jose Schreiner, a vice president at the National Agriculture Federation, said Intacta was proving resistant to helicoverpa armigera in his state of Goiás, but he hopes GMO technology will be just one of many tools used to combat the caterpillar. “I think working with biological control, natural enemies, is the road we should pursue,” Schreiner said, referring to viruses that can be applied to crops to kill caterpillars. “We won’t be able to eliminate it but we should be able to have a good level of control at a lower cost.” ",2272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-agriculture-caterpillar/new-threat-to-brazils-breadbasket-a-pesky-caterpillar-idUSBREA1Q19L20140227

Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman told ConExpo, the world’s largest construction equipment show, in Las Vegas that he remained “guardedly optimistic ... very, very guardedly optimistic” about the global economic outlook. Referring to the crisis in the Ukraine without mentioning Russia, he said it served as a reminder of the political risks, in the United States and abroad, that can still trip up the global economy. “Most of the bad of the news in Europe is behind us,” he said. “(But) we just saw a weekend event that can change things in a minute. The world’s a fragile place and the world’s economy is a fragile thing and it doesn’t take much of a disruption to cause a fairly large ripple effect.” He said China, whose once-roaring economy had been slowing as government investment declined, was showing signs of a modest rebound. But he suggested that the days of double-digit annual growth there were probably over. “I would not expect China to be the big boom that we’ve been used to,” he said. Oberhelman said that in North America, the construction equipment market was having its best March in four years, driven by both the housing recovery and decreased uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy. “Our U.S. contractors are more optimistic at this point than they have been for awhile,” Oberhelman said. The rest of the world, he said, remained a “mixed bag” with continued pockets of weakness in places like Australia and Brazil. “Overall it’s a fairly mixed bag generally with North America leading the way and a slightly stronger economic growth prospect,” he said. “If it continues it could help some of the other parts of the rest of the world.” ",3042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-ceo/caterpillar-ceo-guardedly-optimistic-about-global-economy-idUSBREA2321620140304

391,CAT,Caterpillar appeals contract loss for Illinois high-speed train,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Monday it had filed formal complaints challenging a decision by its home state of Illinois to award an important locomotive contract for a high-speed rail project to its rivals. In late 2013, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) awarded a $226 million contract to build up to 35 high-performance diesel-electric locomotives to a partnership formed by Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Cummins Inc (CMI.N). IDOT’s decision was bigger than the dollar figure might suggest because the agency is leading a multistate locomotive procurement task force and its decisions are likely to influence the choices that other key states - including California, Michigan, Washington, and Missouri - ultimately make. In February, Caterpillar filed a formal protest with IDOT, but it was denied. In a statement released on Monday, the company said it had taken the protest to the next stage by filing formal complaints with the state’s Procurement Policy Board as well as the Chancery Court in Cook County, Illinois. Caterpillar said it believed that IDOT “unfairly evaluated and scored offers and improperly relaxed the specified performance requirements when making its selection.” A spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a voicemail or e-mail seeking comment.

392,CAT,From dumb iron to Big Data: Caterpillar's dealer sales push,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc has a long tradition of proudly - and publicly - proclaiming how much it loves its dealers. In recent years, the Peoria, Illinois-based company has called the 178 independently owned businesses that distribute its earth-moving products worldwide everything from “a critical competitive differentiator” to “the foundation” of its success. Now the world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment is adopting a cooler tone with those dealers, asking them: “What have you done for us lately?” Caterpillar believes its distributors are missing out on somewhere between $9 billion and $18 billion in easy-to-capture revenue each year because they are falling down in at least three ways. They are not tapping into the wealth of real-time customer data now at their fingertips; they are not communicating with each other; and they are not providing customers across the globe with a consistent experience when it comes to everything from e-commerce to parts and services pricing. So Caterpillar, which is in a hunt for new revenue because of weakness in key markets, is giving dealers until the end of the year to come up with a three-year plan to capture those lost sales. Distributors who fail to meet their targets could have their dealership agreements terminated, though top executives insist a cull of dealers probably won’t be needed. “That would be the last resort, the last outcome and certainly not desirable,” says Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman. Like its rivals, Caterpillar has integrated all kinds of diagnostic technology into its machines that throws off a torrent of real-time information about the health of the products. The data helps owners track their equipment, optimize its utilization and manage fuel and maintenance costs. Better exploited by the dealers, the information could immediately increase part and service sales to existing customers, Caterpillar says. Dealers could anticipate problems, schedule preventive and predictive maintenance and help customers manage their equipment fleets more efficiently. The company says its best dealers already do that pretty decently and have, in the words of Stu Levenick, the group president in charge of dealer relations, “an awareness of about 90 percent of their parts demand by customer, have it very well segmented and understand where 90 percent of the opportunity exists.” Many more dealers are missing out. “The average dealer, or lower-performing dealer, he only knows 40 percent of his opportunity,” Levenick says. “And we demonstrated that if we just take the best practices of the first group and apply it to the other group, they automatically get a 6 to 8 percent aftermarket share improvement ... just by doing something obvious. But they haven’t done it because we haven’t directed them to do it or helped them to do it.” Caterpillar is the latest company to see big dollars in so-called Big Data. There are, by its reckoning, more than 3.5 million pieces of Caterpillar equipment in the field, many of them fitted with sensors that send out continual status updates about important mechanical systems and operator performance. Caterpillar believes dealers could be billing for billions of dollars more each year if they did a better job of thinking of those machines as smart digital devices, constantly pinging them with sales and service opportunities - not just dumb pieces of iron. The push, code-named Across the Table, was unveiled last month at a private meeting of distributors and made public earlier this month at an analyst meeting in Las Vegas. Company executives say dealers are missing out on additional billions in sales by not coordinating better with one another and not offering consistent e-commerce solutions to customers who, in many cases, work with more than one Caterpillar dealer across the globe. “Customer expectations have changed,” says Levenick, who is in charge of the initiative. “If they work with multiple dealers, they want to have a common experience wherever they go.” Oberhelman says cooperation and communication among Caterpillar dealers often is “disjointed,” especially when it comes to locating parts and serving customers. He cites the example of Australia, where the four dealers that have carved up the country - and Caterpillar itself, which sells a handful of specialized products directly to customers - operate dozens of supply depots whose order and inventory systems aren’t meshed. “I don’t know how many individual parts warehouses there must be among four dealers and ours,” Oberhelman says. “But it’s probably over 100. And we don’t really today … have those talk to each other. You need a part in Perth. Our warehouse in Melbourne may not have it, but it may not communicate with all the other places in Australia before we have to go overseas to get it.” A big chunk of any incremental revenue the dealers pick up with the push would flow to Caterpillar, says Levenick. “It can’t go to them without going to us.” Caterpillar is also challenging dealers to do a better job of navigating the sea change that’s taken place in the construction machine market, where sales of equipment to rental companies now outnumber sales to contractors. That creates problems because the independent dealer model, which Caterpillar embraced shortly after its founding in the 1920s, “was never designed originally to handle the financial loads or the operational capabilities of running a rental organization,” Levenick says. “If you look at a CAT dealer, they’re not structured in a way that United Rentals is.” Jason Marx, a director in the heavy-equipment practice of AlixPartners, an industry consulting group, says the rental business requires “a huge amount of working capital” and can divert money away from other parts of a dealer’s business that might require some funding for growth. Oberhelman acknowledges the strain the switch to rental is putting on the company and its dealer network. “It moves the financial pressure from the customer to the dealer and ultimately up to us,” he says. “And we just have to figure out how to deal with that.” The push is not without risk. Caterpillar has long touted its independent dealers, whose 162,000 workers more than double its global headcount, as a key competitive advantage, especially in recent years as lower-priced Asian rivals with less robust dealer support networks rose up to challenge its supremacy in the construction equipment market. Messing with that could sour the special relationship that Caterpillar says has been critical to its success in remaining the world’s No. 1 maker of construction and mining equipment. But the company is in a scramble for additional revenue. After peaking at $65.9 billion in 2012, sales plunged nearly 16 percent in 2013 as capital investment by the global mining industry tanked. The company has warned that sales could slip another 5 percent in 2014 in part because of the slow-motion recovery of the global construction market. Analysts say that hasn’t completely derailed Caterpillar’s goal of reaching $100 billion in annual revenues by 2020, but it has made the target a little harder to reach. Hence the focus on dealer performance, which Caterpillar says is a way to significantly lift sales even if construction and mining fundamentals don’t improve dramatically anytime soon. Caterpillar is focused on nine or 10 dealer metrics, most of which it refuses to discuss with analysts or the media. That has made it difficult for investors to assess the likelihood the move will deliver the promised results. Ann Duignan, an analyst at JP Morgan, is among those who say they have more questions than answers about the dealer effort and remain dubious about the effect it will have on the company’s top and bottom lines. “It’s hard to assess accurately because they didn’t give us enough detail,” Duignan says. But in conversations about the program with Reuters, top executives have made it clear that dealers need to significantly increase the performance of their parts and service departments and to boost their share of the global parts and service market. A key gauge here is something Caterpillar calls “the absorption rate,” which measures how long a dealership could keep its doors open if it never sold another piece of equipment and had to survive on the profits booked from servicing existing machines in its territory. If a dealer’s gross profit from those parts and service sales can cover its total overhead and interest expenses for a year, the dealer is said to have a 100 percent absorption rate. For years, 100 percent was considered good enough. No more. Dealers’ new absorption-rate goals will be different, but they have all been given until 2018 to improve performance. Leveraging the insights the embedded technology affords them is one way to get there. Even the best dealers in the network are being assigned new goals that Jim Parker, the owner of Carter Machinery, a Caterpillar dealership in Salem, Virginia, says “won’t be a lay-up.” Tapping into the technology already deployed on Caterpillar’s machines could make their task a little easier. For years now, Caterpillar has been installing all kinds of cameras, sensors and satellite-based positioning control and guidance systems on its machines to help customers increase their productivity and efficiency and eliminate workplace accidents. Those electronic gadgets and the remote monitoring they make possible have created a huge opportunity for dealers to move beyond the equipment and parts and services sales and into the potentially much-more lucrative fleet-management business. Dealers already offer a tiered fleet-management program, which is marketed as CAT Equipment Management Solutions (EMS). Indeed a highlight of Caterpillar’s exhibit at the recent ConExpo trade show in Las Vegas was a demonstration of how the system works for customers and dealers. Caterpillar wants dealers to move more customers into higher-levels of EMS, where dealers take over monitoring of the equipment and - at the highest level - actually take over the management of customers’ fleets. The company has tried to increase dealer buy-in to the plan by asking 20 of its top-performing distributors - including Parker in Virginia - to help design its carrots and sticks. So far, Levenick says there has been little resistance to the basic goals. But Parker says talk of raising performance measures has prompted some nervousness among dealers. “We have a common set of metrics. You know what they are, and you know they’re weighted. And that’s how Caterpillar is going to judge every dealer. It’s very, very black and white. It’s about market share,” he says. “But I know some dealers - because they’re friends of mine - are saying, ‘I got some work to do.’” ",3202014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-dealers-insight/from-dumb-iron-to-big-data-caterpillars-dealer-sales-push-idUSBREA2J0Q320140320
393,CAT,INSIGHT-From dumb iron to Big Data: Caterpillar's dealer sales push,"March 20 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc has a long tradition of proudly - and publicly - proclaiming how much it loves its dealers. In recent years, the Peoria, Illinois-based company has called the 178 independently owned businesses that distribute its earth-moving products worldwide everything from “a critical competitive differentiator” to “the foundation” of its success. Now the world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment is adopting a cooler tone with those dealers, asking them: “What have you done for us lately?” Caterpillar believes its distributors are missing out on somewhere between $9 billion and $18 billion in easy-to-capture revenue each year because they are falling down in at least three ways. They are not tapping into the wealth of real-time customer data now at their fingertips; they are not communicating with each other; and they are not providing customers across the globe with a consistent experience when it comes to everything from e-commerce to parts and services pricing. So Caterpillar, which is in a hunt for new revenue because of weakness in key markets, is giving dealers until the end of the year to come up with a three-year plan to capture those lost sales. Distributors who fail to meet their targets could have their dealership agreements terminated, though top executives insist a cull of dealers probably won’t be needed. “That would be the last resort, the last outcome and certainly not desirable,” says Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman. Like its rivals, Caterpillar has integrated all kinds of diagnostic technology into its machines that throws off a torrent of real-time information about the health of the products. The data helps owners track their equipment, optimize its utilization and manage fuel and maintenance costs. Better exploited by the dealers, the information could immediately increase part and service sales to existing customers, Caterpillar says. Dealers could anticipate problems, schedule preventive and predictive maintenance and help customers manage their equipment fleets more efficiently. The company says its best dealers already do that pretty decently and have, in the words of Stu Levenick, the group president in charge of dealer relations, “an awareness of about 90 percent of their parts demand by customer, have it very well segmented and understand where 90 percent of the opportunity exists.” Many more dealers are missing out. “The average dealer, or lower-performing dealer, he only knows 40 percent of his opportunity,” Levenick says. “And we demonstrated that if we just take the best practices of the first group and apply it to the other group, they automatically get a 6 to 8 percent aftermarket share improvement ... just by doing something obvious. But they haven’t done it because we haven’t directed them to do it or helped them to do it.” Caterpillar is the latest company to see big dollars in so-called Big Data. There are, by its reckoning, more than 3.5 million pieces of Caterpillar equipment in the field, many of them fitted with sensors that send out continual status updates about important mechanical systems and operator performance. Caterpillar believes dealers could be billing for billions of dollars more each year if they did a better job of thinking of those machines as smart digital devices, constantly pinging them with sales and service opportunities - not just dumb pieces of iron. The push, code-named Across the Table, was unveiled last month at a private meeting of distributors and made public earlier this month at an analyst meeting in Las Vegas. Company executives say dealers are missing out on additional billions in sales by not coordinating better with one another and not offering consistent e-commerce solutions to customers who, in many cases, work with more than one Caterpillar dealer across the globe. “Customer expectations have changed,” says Levenick, who is in charge of the initiative. “If they work with multiple dealers, they want to have a common experience wherever they go.” Oberhelman says cooperation and communication among Caterpillar dealers often is “disjointed,” especially when it comes to locating parts and serving customers. He cites the example of Australia, where the four dealers that have carved up the country - and Caterpillar itself, which sells a handful of  specialized products directly to customers - operate dozens of supply depots whose order and inventory systems aren’t meshed. “I don’t know how many individual parts warehouses there must be among four dealers and ours,” Oberhelman says. “But it’s probably over 100. And we don’t really today  have those talk to each other. You need a part in Perth. Our warehouse in Melbourne may not have it, but it may not communicate with all the other places in Australia before we have to go overseas to get it.” A big chunk of any incremental revenue the dealers pick up with the push would flow to Caterpillar, says Levenick. “It can’t go to them without going to us.” Caterpillar is also challenging dealers to do a better job of navigating the sea change that’s taken place in the construction machine market, where sales of equipment to rental companies now outnumber sales to contractors.

396,CAT,Caterpillar to face U.S. Senate panel on offshore taxes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s offshore tax strategies will come under scrutiny on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate hearing expected to examine dealings by the world’s largest mining and construction equipment maker in Switzerland, Bermuda and Luxembourg. With many multinationals being criticized for tax avoidance, veteran tax sleuth Senator Carl Levin will chair another session of his Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, with three current and former Caterpillar executives slated to testify. Levin’s panel dives deeper than any other on Capitol Hill into the minutia of tax law and accounting, with its Caterpillar probe expected to center on the tax aspects of Caterpillar’s corporate restructurings in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which advised Caterpillar on its tax strategies, is also sending three officers to the hearing as witnesses. A Caterpillar spokeswoman declined to answer questions about the company’s tax strategies. A spokeswoman for Levin declined to comment. PricewaterhouseCoopers also declined to comment. Levin’s panel has not detailed its findings, but a lawsuit involving the restructurings that was settled in 2012 may offer clues about the hearing’s focus, said Richard Harvey, a former Internal Revenue Service official who reviewed court records from the lawsuit that detailed some of Caterpillar’s dealings. “One would hope the IRS took a very close look at these transactions,” said Harvey, now a tax professor at Villanova University. He testified before Levin’s committee last year. Beginning in 1999, Caterpillar shifted a “replacement parts” division from the United States to Switzerland and executives said one purpose was to reduce taxes, according to the records. In 2005, Caterpillar set up units in low-tax Bermuda and Luxembourg, according to the court filings. In a memo dated November 21, 2006, Caterpillar chief tax officer Robin Beran said: “Two internal reorganizations were completed, leveraging the Bermuda/Lux structure, allowing repatriation of nearly $1.5 billion cash to the U.S. without incremental U.S. tax.” Beran is one of the Caterpillar officers set to testify. He declined to comment on Friday. Daniel Schlicksup, a former Caterpillar tax official, sued the company in 2009, alleging he was retaliated against by executives for raising concerns internally about its tax dealings. Schlicksup said Caterpillar’s offshore tax structures helped it avoid more than $2 billion in U.S. taxes, according to his complaint. A lawyer for Schlicksup declined to make his client available for comment.

397,CAT,Caterpillar's Swiss unit dodged $2.4 billion of U.S. taxes: Senate panel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc avoided paying $2.4 billion in U.S. taxes from 2000 through 2012 by moving profits from sales of replacement parts through a low-tax unit it set up in Switzerland, a congressional panel said on Monday. In the latest example of a major U.S. corporation’s offshore tax strategies going under the congressional microscope, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report focused on a complex 1999 restructuring by Caterpillar. The world’s largest mining and construction equipment maker’s restructuring negotiated a low tax rate with Switzerland for a unit it set up there to book taxable profits from sales of Caterpillar-branded replacement parts made by third parties under contract with the Peoria, Illinois-based company. “This is a prime example of a tax avoidance strategy, which is costing the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars,” said Senator Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, which has a hearing scheduled for Tuesday on the report’s findings. Caterpillar makes no replacement parts and has no warehouses in Switzerland, but 85 percent of its parts business’s profits went through the Swiss unit, where the company pays a tax rate of between 4 percent and 6 percent, the subcommittee said. The top U.S. corporate tax income rate is 35 percent. Caterpillar’s Swiss structure continues to save the company about $300 million a year in U.S. taxes, the subcommittee said. In a response to the Levin report, Caterpillar said its Swiss unit, known as Caterpillar Sarl, or CSARL, has a large marketing and sales presence in Geneva, Switzerland. “CSARL is no mere shell, but rather a major operating company employing hundreds of personnel in Geneva,” said Julie Lagacy, vice president of Caterpillar’s finance services division, according to prepared testimony released ahead of the hearing.

Executives from the world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment were hauled in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to answer to allegations made by the panel in a 99-page report. Released on Monday, it said Caterpillar avoided paying $2.4 billion in U.S. taxes from 2000 through 2012 by moving profits from sales of replacement parts through the Swiss unit, a strategy sharply criticized by the panel’s chairman. Democratic Senator Carl Levin said the Swiss arrangement had no business purpose other than to dodge taxes. “The documents couldn’t be clearer, it’s a tax deal,” Levin said at the hearing, the latest in a series on corporate tax avoidance. Caterpillar executives said its tax strategies, related to a complex corporate restructuring that began in 1999, were legal and in the best interest of its shareholders. “We remain convinced that the restructuring and subsequent transactions comply with the tax law,” said Julie Lagacy, vice president of Caterpillar’s finance services division. The Internal Revenue Service thoroughly examined the Swiss structure, called “CSARL,” but did not challenge its validity, Caterpillar said in a statement to Reuters. “Caterpillar has not paid additional taxes to settle a dispute over the CSARL structure,” the statement said. The IRS declined to comment on Caterpillar’s taxes. Shares of Caterpillar rose 44 cents on Tuesday to close at $99.81, in line with broader stock market gains. Along with three Caterpillar executives, representatives of Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, defended the tax advice it gave Caterpillar on its Swiss deal.

404,CAT,Caterpillar CEO Oberhelman's pay fell 33 pct in 2013 -SEC filing,"April 21 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman’s compensation declined 33 percent last year because of the company’s failure to meet promised profit and performance targets, according to a filing on Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Oberhelman still took home nearly $15 million in total compensation in 2013, according to the SEC filing, more than half of it in the form of stock options awards. Oberhelman was hardly the only employee at Caterpillar to take a pay cut in 2013, and like a lot of workers with the company, he knew it was coming. Last summer, the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment put workers on notice that its short-term incentive plan, the centerpiece of its performance-based, profit-sharing program, would make its smallest payout since the recession. In updates to the plan’s roughly 60,000 participants, and in quarterly disclosures to investors, Caterpillar said it expected 2013 outlays related to the program to be down as much as 40 percent from 2012, reflecting sharply reduced payments to employees. The reason: Cancellations from mining customers weighed on high-margin sales to that key sector, forcing the Peoria, Illinois-based company to cut its full-year earnings forecast several quarters in a row and to implement major cost cuts. In the end, Caterpillar’s earnings per share fell 32 percent in 2013 to $5.75. While that was way below the $7 to $9 EPS range it initially forecast, it was still one of the company’s best year’s ever.   (Reporting by James B.

405,CAT,"Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar dealer data paints mixed picture","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) released unaudited dealer sales data on Wednesday that showed a deepening deterioration in global demand for its mining equipment but a continued, albeit modest, rebound in sales of construction equipment as well as reciprocating and turbine engines. The numbers suggested the company’s first-quarter earnings, due early Thursday, will be another mixed bag, unlikely to surprise investors on the upside. The world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment said global dealer sales of its yellow earth-moving machines fell 12 percent year-over-year in March, after falling 8 percent in both January and February. Equipment demand from mining customers was especially weak, Caterpillar said, with global dealer sales of those high-margin products tumbling 46 percent in March after falling 37 percent in both January and February. That overshadowed a modest but continued recovery in global sales of machines to construction customers, which rose 9 percent year-over-year in March after growing at a similar rate in both January and February. The downturn in demand for mining equipment was especially dramatic in the Asia-Pacific region, where dealer sales slumped 65 percent in March after falling 55 percent in February and 53 percent in January. South America was another region of pronounced weakness with mining equipment sales down 60 percent year-over-year in March after falling 49 percent in February and 36 percent in January. The news was better on the engine side of Caterpillar’s business. The company said global dealer sales of its gas turbines, diesel engines and generators rose 7 percent year-over-year in March after rising 2 percent in both January and February. Double-digit increases in dealer sales of engines to industrial and power generation customers offset weakness in sales to customers in the transportation industry. Sales to oil and gas customers, which were down single-digits in January and February, stabilized in March and were unchanged year-over-year, the company said. Caterpillar sells its equipment and engines through a worldwide network of nearly 180 independent dealers. So the unaudited dealer sales figures provide a useful, though incomplete, glimpse of the company’s underlying business ahead of its official quarterly filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. After peaking at $65.9 billion in 2012, Caterpillar’s global sales plunged nearly 16 percent in 2013 as capital investment by the global mining industry tanked. The company has warned that sales could slip another 5 percent in 2014 if that weakness continues, though a pickup in the construction market could provide a positive offset.

413,CAT,"Caterpillar posts higher first-quarter profit, raises outlook","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) on Thursday posted a quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year outlook, citing a stronger-than-expected rebound in sales to the construction industry. The news sent shares in the world’s largest maker of earth-moving machinery up as much as 4 percent though the stock, which has outperformed the S&P; 500 so far this year, gave back more than half those gains by early afternoon. The results were also lifted by continued cost cuts as well as share repurchases. Caterpillar has laid off 8,295 full-time employees, or nearly 7 percent of its global workforce, over the last 12 months. It has also repurchased $3.7 billion of its shares since January 2013, which translates into a higher profit-per-share on the lower outstanding share count. The company’s success in managing costs, and translating sales gains into profits, was evident its construction equipment segment, where operating profit rose $460 million in the first quarter on a sales increase of just $840 million. Caterpillar expects its sales to builders to increase 10 percent from 2013, up from a previously forecast increase of about 5 percent. But it cautioned 2014 would be “another very tough year” for mining, another key market, and that its outlook reflected an anticipated drop of about 80 percent in sales of large mining trucks from the company’s peak year in 2012. Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar, said he was pleasantly surprised by the company’s “very solid cost control in construction in particular,” where operating margins continued to grow and “were at their highest quarterly level in several quarters”, even though they were typically more compressed than in the mining equipment category. Fleck said the weakness in mining “wasn’t terribly surprising” and added that because the once-critical business made up just 17 percent of first-quarter sales and 12 percent of operating profit, any continued weakness in the sector was “more of a headline risk than a true economic one.” Caterpillar posted a first-quarter net profit of $922 million, or $1.61 a share, compared with $880 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. With restructuring costs factored in, Caterpillar made a profit of $1.44 a share. Revenue at the company, which also makes locomotives and diesel and turbine engines, was little changed at $13.24 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.24 a share on sales of $13.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In an interview with Reuters, Brad Halverson, the company’s chief finance officer, said: “We’re very happy with the quarter, with profit being up - fairly significantly excluding restructuring - on flat sales. We’re also very happy with … how we did that: a little price, some market share improvement and good cost reduction.” Price increases played a minimal role in the first-quarter results, Halverson said. He said Caterpillar’s arch-rival Komatsu Ltd (6301.T) was “being a little bit more aggressive in their pricing structure” thanks to the weakness of the Japanese yen. That, coupled with continued uncertainty in Europe and signs of a construction slowdown in China, kept a lid on prices. “If you go back to ‘07 or ‘08, we had pretty healthy price increases in our profitability,” Halverson said. “But I would say that in the current environment, the ability to have decent-sized price increases is difficult.” The report was nonetheless tinged with caution. Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said the Peoria, Illinois-based company was watching several regions closely. Having visited China recently, he said the construction industry there was facing challenges. Caterpillar was also concerned about the situation in Ukraine and Russia, he added. “We are hoping for a peaceful resolution, but business confidence around the world could dampen, and trade and world GDP could slow should the situation deteriorate,” Oberhelman said. “The global economy remains fragile, and as such, one or two setbacks could create substantial downside risk for the global economic recovery.” Caterpillar raised its full-year earnings outlook to $6.10 per share from $5.85, citing growing demand from builders. Oberhelman warned, however, of “a range of macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties that could slow the growth of global GDP” and upend Caterpillar’s new forecast. The company kept its forecast for full-year revenue unchanged at about $56 billion, plus or minus 5 percent, and said it would continue to work to restructure its operations to cut costs. It said those efforts would be “widespread across the company” throughout 2014 and would cost the company between $400 to $500 million and negatively impact full-year earnings by 50 to 60 cents a share. In the first quarter, the company spent $149 million on restructuring efforts, Caterpillar said, primarily related to a reduction in workforce at plant in Belgium.

414,CAT,"UPDATE 3-Caterpillar posts higher first-quarter profit, raises outlook","(Adds comment from CFO and details on construction machinery performance; updates share price) By James B. Kelleher April 24 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc on Thursday posted a quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year outlook, citing a stronger-than-expected rebound in sales to the construction industry. The news sent shares in the world’s largest maker of earth-moving machinery up as much as 4 percent though the stock, which has outperformed the S&P; 500 so far this year, gave back more than half those gains by early afternoon. The results were also lifted by continued cost cuts as well as share repurchases. Caterpillar has laid off 8,295 full-time employees, or nearly 7 percent of its global workforce, over the last 12 months. It has also repurchased $3.7 billion of its shares since January 2013, which translates into a higher profit-per-share on the lower oustanding share count. The company’s success in managing costs, and translating sales gains into profits, was evident its construction equipment segment, where operating profit rose $460 million in the first quarter on a sales increase of just $840 million. Caterpillar expects its sales to builders to increase 10 percent from 2013, up from a previously forecast increase of about 5 percent. But it cautioned 2014 would be “another very tough year” for mining, another key market, and that its outlook reflected an anticipated drop of about 80 percent in sales of large mining trucks from the company’s peak year in 2012. Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar, said he was pleasantly surprised by the company’s “very solid cost control in construction in particular,” where operating margins continued to grow and “were at their highest quarterly level in several quarters”, even though they were typically more compressed than in the mining equipment category. Fleck said the weakness in mining “wasn’t terribly surprising” and added that because the once-critical business made up just 17 percent of first-quarter sales and 12 percent of operating profit, any continued weakness in the sector was “more of a headline risk than a true economic one.” Caterpillar posted a first-quarter net profit of $922 million, or $1.61 a share, compared with $880 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. With restructuring costs factored in, Caterpillar made a profit of $1.44 a share. Revenue at the company, which also makes locomotives and diesel and turbine engines, was little changed at $13.24 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.24 a share on sales of $13.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In an interview with Reuters, Brad Halverson, the company’s chief finance officer, said: “We’re very happy with the quarter, with profit being up - fairly significantly excluding restructuring - on flat sales. We’re also very happy with  how we did that: a little price, some market share improvement and good cost reduction.” Price increases played a minimal role in the first-quarter results, Halverson said. He said Caterpillar’s arch-rival Komatsu Ltd was “being a little bit more aggressive in their pricing structure” thanks to the weakness of the Japanese yen. That, coupled with continued uncertainty in Europe and signs of a construction slowdown in China, kept a lid on prices. “If you go back to ‘07 or ‘08, we had pretty healthy price increases in our profitability,” Halverson said. “But I would say that in the current environment, the ability to have decent-sized price increases is difficult.” The report was nonetheless tinged with caution. Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said the Peoria, Illinois-based company was watching several regions closely. Having visited China recently, he said the construction industry there was facing challenges. Caterpillar was also concerned about the situation in Ukraine and Russia, he added. “We are hoping for a peaceful resolution, but business confidence around the world could dampen, and trade and world GDP could slow should the situation deteriorate,” Oberhelman said. “The global economy remains fragile, and as such, one or two setbacks could create substantial downside risk for the global economic recovery.” Caterpillar raised its full-year earnings outlook to $6.10 per share from $5.85, citing growing demand from builders. Oberhelman warned, however, of “a range of macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties that could slow the growth of global GDP” and upend Caterpillar’s new forecast. The company kept its forecast for full-year revenue unchanged at about $56 billion, plus or minus 5 percent, and said it would continue to work to restructure its operations to cut costs. It said those efforts would be “widespread across the company” throughout 2014 and would cost the company between $400 to $500 million and negatively impact full-year earnings by 50 to 60 cents a share. In the first quarter, the company spent $149 million on restructuring efforts, Caterpillar said, primarily related to a reduction in workforce at plant in Belgium. In early afternoon trading, Caterpillar shares were up $1.70, or 1.6 percent, at $105.08 after earlier trading as high as $107.40. So far this year, Caterpillar shares have risen nearly 14 percent while the S&P; 500 is up less than 2 percent.       (Reporting by James B.

Markets had opened higher, with the Nasdaq especially gaining on the back of strong tech results. However, indexes turned negative in the first half-hour of trading after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia started military drills near the border with Ukraine. The issue “is a lit stick of dynamite” with remote chances of a peaceful resolution, said Todd Schoenberger, managing partner at LandColt Capital in New York. “All those geopolitical concerns warrant instability and higher commodity prices, and both of those are things Wall Street hates.” Apple Inc, the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization, rose 7.5 percent to $563.89 a day after posting revenue that far outpaced expectations, helped by strong iPhone sales. It also approved another $30 billion stock buyback plan, raised its dividend and authorized a seven-for-one stock split. “People have been critical of the cash on Apple’s balance sheet, but now it has faced up to that criticism. It’s doing all the right things, and I don’t think a move over $600 would be out of place now,” said Michael Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments LLC in Minneapolis, which owns Apple. Caterpillar Inc rose 2.5 percent to $106.01 after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its full-year profit view. On the downside, both Verizon Communications Inc and 3M Co fell after results missed expectations. Verizon dropped 1.7 percent to $46.60 and 3M fell 1.4 percent to $136.11. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 31.08 points, or 0.19 percent, at 16,470.57. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 1.87 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,873.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 7.74 points, or 0.19 percent, at 4,119.23. Social media giant Facebook Inc posted a 72 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, lifted by its mobile advertising business. After opening sharply higher, the stock pared its gains, last trading down 0.5 percent at $60.93. Strong earnings have lifted the S&P; 500 for six of the past seven sessions, though companies have largely been beating reduced forecasts. According to Thomson Reuters data, profits are seen rising 1.6 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. A number of cloud-computing stocks, which have struggled lately but rose last week, opened higher and then quickly sold off. Workday Inc fell 6.6 percent while Salesforce.com  was off 3.7 percent at $53.60. Zimmer Holdings Inc agreed to buy Biomet Inc  in a deal valued at about $13.35 billion to broaden its portfolio of products that treat bone and joint-related disorders. Zimmer rose 15.5 percent to $105.69. Sina Corp fell 7.4 percent to $49.31 after Chinese state media reported the company had been stripped of its online publication license after being targeted in a pornography crackdown.

TJX Cos Inc shares slumped 7 percent to $54.34 and ranked as the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 after the owner of off-price chain stores TJ Maxx and Marshalls reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Staples Inc tumbled 13.1 percent to $11.64 after the office supply retailer posted first-quarter earnings and forecast a decline in sales in the current quarter. The S&P; retail index fell 0.8 percent. But Home Depot shares managed to rebound from pre-market declines after the company’s chief financial officer said sales in May were “robust,” taking the sting out of its disappointing first-quarter results due to the severe winter. Home Depot rose 2.2 percent to $78.21 and was the S&P; 500’s best performer. Caterpillar shares dropped 2.8 percent to $102.48, weighing on the industrial sector after the heavy machinery company said retail statistics for the three-month rolling period ending in April were down 13 percent. “So not only is the retail sector not doing well, but neither is heavy construction. It’s a little more concerning in the larger equipment realm because to me, that says new projects aren’t being picked up either,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 142.59 points or 0.86 percent, to 16,369.27. The S&P; 500 lost 13.71 points or 0.73 percent, to 1,871.37. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 33.70 points or 0.82 percent, to 4,092.11. Dick’s Sporting Goods estimated current-quarter earnings way below analysts’ average estimate and cut its full-year 2014 adjusted earnings and same-store sales growth forecasts due to weak demand for its golf and hunting products. Its stock plunged 17.3 percent to $43.96. Equities have pulled back more than 1 percent since the Dow and the S&P; 500 hit record closing highs on May 13 as investors look for signs confirming an acceleration in the U.S. economy that many had hoped to see at this point in the year. General Motors shares lost 1.6 percent to $33.70 after the No. 1 U.S. automaker said it is recalling another 2.42 million vehicles in the United States and doubling the charge it expects to take in the second quarter to about $400 million. In contrast, Aeroflex Holding Corp shares jumped 25.6 percent to $10.44.

421,CAT,U.S. small businesses lobby for survival of embattled Ex-Im Bank,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If the battle over the U.S. Export-Import Bank is Washington’s latest political tempest, then Don Nelson from Bakersfield, California is aiming at the eye of the storm. Nelson’s small oilfield equipment company is part of new House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s district, and he wants the suddenly powerful politician to know that the Republican right’s war on what it sees as “crony capitalism” at the export credit agency could claim hometown casualties. “It would be a disaster for our company,” if the Ex-Im Bank is shuttered as McCarthy and a faction of House Republicans hope, said Nelson, president of ProGauge Technologies, Inc., who said he voted for McCarthy.  With two-thirds of his business and perhaps half of his company’s 100 jobs dependent on deals Ex-Im helps finance, “I need to meet with Kevin McCarthy and let him know, this is not a good thing for America.” The 80-year-old bank provides about $37 billion a year in direct loans to foreign buyers of U.S. products, credit guarantees to American companies and credit insurance to aid exports. Critics, including the House Tea Party caucus, say it unduly benefits insiders who know how the system works.  Ex-Im’s fate may hinge on the success Nelson and other small entrepreneurs have in convincing their lawmakers that the agency isn’t just a sink where tax money disappears into global companies like Boeing, Corp. It aids the very small businesses that Republican critics say are being put at a competitive disadvantage by the program. The bank has had mixed success on that front. It has missed its own internal targets for small business lending and much of its activity does support mega-companies like Boeing Co  and Caterpillar Inc that would arguably fare just fine on their own. But the bank reaches further than just financing airplanes and mining trucks, and hundreds of businesses and groups from across the country have been mobilized in what is probably Ex-Im’s best chance of survival. Steered by Washington’s corporate and lobbying elite, the campaign has reached far into the countryside. The 90,000 folks in Idaho’s rural Bannock County aren’t big exporters — yet. But Pocatello-Chubbuck Chamber of Commerce President Matt Hunter said they are trying to lure firms to set up operations in the county that would likely want access to the export financing that Ex-Im Bank provides.  “I have already sent the emails,” to Idaho’s all-Republican congressional delegation, Hunter said.  As Washington agencies go, the Ex-Im Bank is small potatoes. The most unfavorable interpretation of its finances is that it costs taxpayers a net of around $200 million a year, and its deals cover only 2 percent of U.S. exports. It does charge for its services — helping overseas buyers acquire U.S. exports or aiding companies like Nelson’s post collateral for deals — and by its own accounting turns a profit. While much of the lobbying is being led by movers and shakers at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Aerospace Industries Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, the Nuclear Energy Institute, and a host of other major industrial groups others are also pushing back hard. There are divisions within the Republican party over whether to allow the bank to live on. The U.S. Congress is debating whether to reauthorize it, and some congressional leaders like McCarthy want to let the authorization expire this fall.  Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger from northern Illinois said he worried about “a libertarian theology that’s really starting to creep in.” If the bank disappears, he said, it could damage U.S. competitiveness as well as small businesses in his district. “We’re for limited government, we’re not for no government.” At Price Pump, a California company that makes industrial pumps, Bob Piazza said he relies on Ex-Im bank credit insurance and could lose a million dollars a year in foreign sales. He has made sure Congress knows it.

423,CAT,"Laggardly Dow crosses 17,000 milestone","* Caterpillar ranks as best YTD performer on the Dow * Latest entries to the index are negative for the year; Alcoa, booted, soars * Dow’s performance lags S&P; 500, Nasdaq, Wilshire 5000 By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street on Thursday celebrated its love of zeros - the ones that come after commas, that is - as the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped the 17,000 mark for the first time. The natural appeal of round numbers notwithstanding, the attention to the Dow as it crosses this latest milestone highlights not only the resilience of the current bull market but also the less-than-stellar relative performance of blue chip stocks this year. The Dow is up less than 3 percent so far this year, while broader measures of U.S. stocks such as the S&P; 500 or Wilshire 5000 are up around 7 percent. As an index, the Dow is overlooked by many Wall Street insiders that consider it out of date, since its price-weighted construction has kept companies like Apple and Google  - recent engines of growth and the new all-American staples - on the sidelines. About $13 billion is benchmarked globally to the Dow compared with $1.575 trillion to the S&P; 500, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices data through 2012, the most up-to-date. But even as Wall Street looks elsewhere to measure performance, the Dow has retained a broad appeal for the occasional investor. “When we make noise at round numbers it’s for obvious reasons. It’s a milepost, it gets attention not just from the folks that watch this on a minute-to-minute basis, but also from Main Street and that’s why it’s important,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “But it is up less than half of the move the S&P; 500 or the Nasdaq have made. It’s a different kind of index so if you have two, three large-cap names that aren’t performing well, like Visa or IBM that have large stock prices, that’s going to drag it down.” Had it tracked the 7.2 percent year-to-date gain on the S&P; 500, the blue-chip index would be trading above 17,700. At the close on Wednesday only eight of the Dow’s 30 components were outperforming the S&P; 500 this year, while 11 were posting negative year-to-date readings. Three of those in the red for the year are the index’s newest additions, blue-chips since last September: Nike, Goldman Sachs and Visa. Meanwhile, Bank of America, Alcoa and Hewlett-Packard, the three stocks that were booted from the index last year, are all up for the year with HP up 21 percent and Alcoa up 40 percent. With the index at record highs, it certainly is not all bad news for the blue-chips. Caterpillar, the best performer so far this year, has gained 21 percent in 2014 and is on track for its best performance since 2010. The record “is a powerful reinforcement to people on the sidelines that this is the strongest bull market they will see in their lifetime and many have missed it,” said Craig Callahan, CEO of Icon Funds in Denver, Colorado. Three healthcare companies (Merck, Johnson & Johnson , and UnitedHealth Group ) rank among those beating the S&P; this year, helped by the higher prices in a sector that has more than $100 billion in completed and pending mergers and acquisitions in 2014 in the U.S. alone. “Healthcare is the tip of the M&A; sword of late,” said Wunderlich’s Hogan. “Large caps have been making extremely interesting acquisitions, so that’s part of it.” Intel and Microsoft are also among the Dow’s top performers in 2014, both breaking out to their highest in more than a decade, as so-called “old technology” catches up to the market rally. Intel on Thursday hit $31.36, the highest since February 2004, and Microsoft is near last week’s peak of $42.29, the highest since April 2000. But while Intel is up around 160 percent from the lows of March 2009 and Microsoft has risen about 180 percent, the S&P; 500 has gained more than 190 percent in roughly the same period. “It may give people pause to think what could go wrong. I wouldn’t be anything more than vigilant,” said John Manley,  chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. “This market is driven by fundamentals; 17,000 is a psychological thing, probably not much more.”   (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",7032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks-dow/laggardly-dow-crosses-17000-milestone-idUSL2N0PE18P20140703

The latest economic data failed to impress buyers. U.S. claims for initial jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 284,000, the lowest since mid-February 2006. New home sales declined 8.1 percent in June, the biggest drop in almost a year. The PHLX housing sector index lost 2.7 percent, marking its biggest one-day drop since February. Recent gains on Wall Street have been fueled by earnings, which have been strong this quarter. With 41 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported results so far, 68 percent have posted earnings that topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent.

426,CAT,Caterpillar posts higher second-quarter profit; sales fall,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings and raised its full-year forecast on Thursday but said sales fell as a continued slump in the global mining industry offset a rebound in the North American building sector. The stock was down 3.5 percent at $104.54 on Thursday afternoon. The company, the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment, raised its full-year profit outlook to $5.75 a share, from $5.55 a share. The outlook was lifted, in part, by a $2.5 billion stock repurchase it said it would make during the current quarter. But Caterpillar, which had forecast full-year sales in the range of $53.2 billion to $58.8 billion, adjusted its outlook lower to a range of $54 billion to $56 billion. It said the cut reflected weak construction sales in once fast-growing overseas markets including China, as well as concern about the effect rising interest rates will have on sales in Brazil. Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar’s point man for business risk management, said tensions in the former Soviet republics - often referred to as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - were also hurting activity in the region. “The CIS is not huge for us. But even though it’s not big, it’s come off a lot.”   Second-quarter sales in Latin America fell 16 percent, “primarily due to lower end-user demand for mining equipment.” Ann Duignan, analyst at J.P.Morgan, said the selloff reflected investor concerns about “growing macro headwinds” in emerging markets.  Caterpillar reported quarterly earnings of $999 million or $1.57 a share, up from $960 million, or $1.45 a share, last year. The company, which also makes railroad locomotives as well as diesel and turbine engines, said sales fell 3 percent to $14.15 billion. In North America, sales increased 6 percent, primarily due to improving demand for construction equipment in the United States.    Sales of mining equipment, which have been in a multiyear decline, fell 29 percent during the quarter, offsetting an 11 percent increase in construction equipment. Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman complained that mining customers were not only not buying new equipment but also delaying maintenance on the machines they already own, hurting part sales. Nevertheless, he said he was encouraged because Caterpillar’s mining equipment sales did not decline between the first and second quarters - the first time that metric has not experienced a quarter-over-quarter deterioration since 2012. “I fully believe, as do our customers, that the bottom is just behind us,” he said. Caterpillar said it pared its full-time payroll by more than 7,000 workers year over year – about 6 percent of its workforce. But Kwame Webb, a Morningstar analyst, pointed out the company’s temporary and contract workforce grew by nearly 400, a sign, he said, of a “strategy to make the business model more variable over time.” ",7242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-results/caterpillar-posts-higher-second-quarter-profit-sales-fall-idUSKBN0FT1G820140724

429,CAT,UPDATE 1-Obama to business: tell your lawmakers to renew Ex-Im Bank,"(Adds response from Republican congressman in paragraphs 7, 8) By Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Saturday urged business owners to press Congress to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which could halt any new financing Sept. 30 - as some conservative Republicans hope it will - if lawmakers fail to act. The little-known institution provides loans to buyers of U.S. products abroad. Obama said in his weekly radio address that if Congress lets the bank close, it would be stunting U.S. export growth and impeding economic expansion. “If Congress fails to act, thousands of businesses, large and small, that sell their products abroad will take a completely unnecessary hit,” the president said. While playing a relatively small role in the U.S. export universe, the bank has become a political flashpoint. Conservative Republicans single it out as an unnecessary and potentially risky government program, while moderates and most Democrats defend it as providing a useful boost to businesses seeking new markets. Household names such as Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc  and General Electric Co are big beneficiaries of the bank’s services. Ex-Im Bank’s critics say aiding well-established firms such as those serves little purpose and puts taxpayers at risk. Opposition to renewing the bank’s charter includes influential lawmakers such as new House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, both Republicans. Hensarling, in a statement on Saturday, said the Ex-Im Bank amounted to “foreign corporate welfare” that benefited mostly “a handful of powerful politically connected corporations.” “What would really help American manufacturers and small businesses compete on a level playing field are pro-growth tax, energy, regulatory and liability policies that the House has already passed but are being blocked by Democrats in the Senate,” he said. Fueling concerns about the bank’s role, Delta Airlines  charges that the institution provides an unfair advantage to foreign competitors of the U.S. carrier. “If left to do business as usual, the Bank has proven that it will continue to help all foreign airlines indiscriminately, including well-funded and state-supported ones that competitively threaten U.S. airlines and their employees,” Delta Senior Vice President Andrea Fischer Newman wrote to Hensarling this week. The airline wants a ban on Ex-Im Bank backing for deals to buy wide-body aircraft, such as Boeing’s 747s. Boeing says that without Ex-Im Bank financing, airlines around the world would buy Airbus planes, usually with French or German export credit subsidies. “The U.S. aerospace industry would lose sales and market share, and the jobs associated with that lost business would end up in Europe,” Boeing senior vice president Tim Keating wrote to Hensarling last week. The bank’s supporters hope that Congress will temporarily renew the bank’s charter in a stopgap government funding bill that must pass before Sept. 30. That would leave lawmakers more time to craft legislation that would provide a longer charter extension but contain reforms to the bank that would mollify critics. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012 and skeptic about the bank, said this week he thinks the bank’s charter will be kept alive with a temporary extension.

Results from Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co, both Dow components, reassured investors that companies with large overseas revenue streams can deliver solid profits despite concerns about global economic growth. Shares of Caterpillar, which raised its full-year earnings outlook, rose 5.0 percent, while 3M shares jumped 4.4 percent. The major U.S. indexes pared gains of nearly 2 percent in late afternoon trading on news that a potential Ebola patient who recently worked in West Africa with Doctors Without Borders was being tested in New York City. The stock surge put the benchmark S&P; 500 index up 3.4 percent for this week, reversing four straight weeks of decline, and on track for its biggest weekly gain since January 2013. “If we’re looking at headwinds like currency and slowing global growth, seeing multinationals like Caterpillar and 3M post solid beats gives us confidence that economic growth is holding on and probably better than the market is currently expecting,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.

Wall Street’s rally helped turn around European stocks, which initially fell on weak results from some companies, including French tire-maker Michelin, despite support from better-than-expected euro zone business activity data. Michelin closed down 4.9 percent. MSCI’s all-country world index, which gauges equity performance in 45 countries, rose 0.63 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 of leading regional companies rebounded to close up 0.65 percent at 1,317.28. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 216.58 points, or 1.32 percent, at 16,677.9. The S&P; 500 rose  23.71 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,950.82 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 69.95 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,452.79. Bond prices fell, with German government bond yields higher after an unexpected uptick in euro zone business surveys staved off fears the bloc was headed for a triple-dip recession.

Results from Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co, both Dow components, reassured investors that companies with large overseas revenue streams can deliver solid profits despite concerns about global economic growth. Shares of Caterpillar, which raised its full-year earnings outlook, rose 5.3 percent, while 3M shares jumped 5.4 percent. The surge put the benchmark S&P; 500 index up 3.9 percent for this week, reversing four straight weeks of decline, and on track for its biggest weekly gain since January 2013. “If we’re looking at headwinds like currency and slowing global growth, seeing multinationals like Caterpillar and 3M post solid beats gives us confidence that economic growth is holding on and probably better than the market is currently expecting,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. With 177 of the S&P; 500 companies having posted third-quarter results, 69.5 percent have beaten expectations, better than the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, and higher than the 20-year average of 63 percent, Thomson Reuters data show. The surge on Wall Street helped turn around European stocks, which initially fell on weak results from some companies, including French tire-maker Michelin, despite support from better-than-expected euro zone business activity data. Michelin closed down 4.9 percent. MSCI’s all-country world index, which gauges equity performance in 45 countries, rose 0.86 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 of leading regional companies rebounded to close up 0.65 percent at 1,317.28.

The S&P; 500 gained 33.03 points, or 1.71 percent, to 1,960.14 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 86.69 points, or 1.98 percent, to 4,469.54. Bond prices fell, with German government bond yields higher after the unexpected uptick in euro zone business surveys staved off fears the bloc was headed for a triple-dip recession.

The advance extended a recent bout of strength for equities. The S&P; 500 has posted a gain of 0.9 percent or more in four of the past five sessions, putting it less than 3 percent from its record close. After a four-week string of declines, the S&P; is up 3.7 percent this week, on track for its biggest weekly advance since January 2013. Shares of both Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co  rose following their results. Caterpillar, which also raised its full-year profit view, was up 4.6 percent at $98.94 while 3M added 5 percent to $145.85. The S&P; industrial sector climbed 2.7 percent as the biggest advancing sector on the day. “It’s good to see good numbers in any company, but if we’re looking at headwinds like currency and slowing global growth, seeing multinationals like Caterpillar and 3M post solid beats gives us confidence that economic growth is holding on and probably better than the market is currently expecting,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. On the downside, AT&T; Inc fell 2.7 percent to $33.58, a day after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue growth.  The results pressured the telecom sector , which lost 1.3 percent as the only one of the 10 primary S&P; 500 sectors down on the day. Yelp Inc slumped 16.2 percent to $58.83 in heavy trading a day after giving a revenue outlook that was below expectations. Many analysts cut their price targets on the stock. This season has largely been positive for companies. With 35 percent of the S&P; 500 having reported, 69.5 percent have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent. New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits held below 300,000 for a sixth straight week last week, suggesting the labor market was shrugging off jitters over a slowing global economy.

437,CAT,"Caterpillar profit beats view, raises outlook; shares surge","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) shares jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday after it reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its 2014 outlook, citing strong demand from the North American energy and construction industries. Sales to those markets offset continued weak sales of its earth-moving machines to the mining industry, a market Caterpillar bet on heavily through acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 - right before a slump in commodity prices prompted resource companies to slash their investment in new equipment.  Since then, Caterpillar has focused on cutting production costs and boosting margins, a process that has involved thousands of layoffs but permitted the Peoria, Illinois-based company to grow earnings even as sales have flat-lined.  That was the case in the most recent quarter, when the company managed to boost its net profit by more than 7 percent, on sales growth of just 1 percent.  For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Caterpillar earned $1.1 billion, or $1.63 a share, up from $946 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected it to earn $1.36 a share on sales of $13.2 billion. Excluding restructuring costs, Caterpillar said it now expects to earn $6.50 a share in 2014, against an original forecast of $5.85. “They crushed the estimates,” said Brian Langenberg, principal at the independent research firm Langenberg & Co. Overall sales rose 1 percent to $13.54 billion, lifted by a 15 percent increase in North American sales, driven by demand for equipment and diesel and gas engines from oil and gas companies and builders. Caterpillar, which also makes diesel-electric locomotives,  got a boost during the quarter as railroads raced to buy engines ahead of tough U.S. emission rules that take effect in 2015. But those sales gains were offset by a 21 percent sales slump in Latin America, a 7 percent sales drop in most of the Asia-Pacific region, and flat sales in China, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Looking toward 2015, Caterpillar said there was “a reasonable likelihood that world economic growth could improve.”      But it warned a number of “significant risks” – including tensions in the former Soviet Union and the Middle East and slowing growth in China – could hurt business confidence and weigh on sales.   As a result, the company said revenue was expected to be essentially flat in 2015.  “Caterpillar is being cautiously optimistic, which is really all they can be, given all the gremlins out there,” said Lawrence De Maria, an analyst at William Blair & Co. “But even with revenue flat, they’ve shown they can deliver solid (earnings per share) growth.” Caterpillar shares, which lagged the S&P; 500 during the third quarter, were up 5.5 percent at $99.80 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

441,CAT,GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S. stock futures tumble on reports of NY Ebola case,"* Risk sentiment hit by first Ebola case in NY * Caterpillar, 3M earnings underpin sentiment * U.S. and euro zone economic data positive * European shares seen falling 0.5-0.7 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures tumbled while safe-haven assets such as the yen and U.S. bonds gained on Friday after a doctor who returned to New York City from West Africa tested positive for Ebola. S&P; 500 mini futures fell as much as 0.7 percent, slipping from two-week highs hit the previous day on budding optimism from corporate earnings and the global economy. European shares looked set to slip, with France’s CAC 40 seen falling by as much as 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX  and Britain’s FTSE by 0.5 percent. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent, though Japan’s Nikkei share average bucked the trend rising 1.0 percent, led by gains in drug companies. “Just when markets got some relief on the world economy, we had this news. Obviously people who have just made bullish bets (on the economy) will close their positions as no one can tell exactly what is going to happen,” said the head of currency trading at a Western bank’s Tokyo branch. The first diagnosed case of Ebola in the world financial hub of New York sent investors rushing to traditional safe-haven assets. As U.S. bond prices gained, the 10-year U.S. yield fell back to 2.250 percent from Thursday’s two-week high of 2.300 percent . In the currency market, the yen gained 0.3 percent to 107.95 yen to the dollar. Risk asset prices had risen on Thursday after upbeat U.S. corporate earnings, solid U.S. economic data, and an unexpected uptick in euro zone business sentiment helped ease concerns that the global economy was losing momentum. Results from Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co  reassured investors that companies with large overseas revenue streams could deliver solid profits, despite concerns about global economic growth. The markets had ignored positive earnings earlier this month, when the world’s share prices hit multi-month lows, overwhelmed by fears that sluggishness in Europe and Asia could deal a severe blow to the U.S. economy as well. But a steady flow of solid earnings helped to ease many such concerns for now. With 177 of the S&P; 500 companies having posted third-quarter results, 69.5 percent have beaten expectations, better than the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, and higher than the 20-year average of 63 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits also held below 300,000 for a sixth straight week last week. In the euro zone, a survey showed businesses performed much better than anyone expected this month, even though it also pointed to strong deflationary pressure in the region. The euro drew some support from the surprise strength in the euro zone data, but was still near a two-week low of $1.2614 hit on Thursday. It last stood at $1.2657. Investors are turning cautious ahead of Sunday’s release of the European Central Bank’s stress test results on the euro zone’s 130 biggest banks. In addition, some focus could fall on the parliamentary election in Ukraine on Sunday. Stability could benefit the European economy, which has suffered from the fall in trade with Russia on tit-for-tat sanctions between the West and Moscow. “I suspect one often overlooked reason for the market’s rebound since the middle of this week was signs of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine,” said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Daiwa SB Investments, pointing to progress in gas talks between Russia and Ukraine last week. President Petro Poroshenko’s bloc holds a big lead, but if the populist Oleh Lyashko’s Radical party makes a very strong showing, Poroshenko may have the awkward task of seeking the support of a politician who has been sharply critical of his peace plan and his contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Sunday will also see presidential election in Brazil, where stocks and the currency have suffered on expectations that the current President Dilma Rousseff is likely to beat her rival, Aecio Neves, who is seen as more market-friendly. The Bovespa stock index hit a six-month low while the Brazilian real slumped to a 9-1/2-year low on Thursday.

442,CAT,Caterpillar gets SEC subpoena over Bucyrus accounting,"(Reuters) - Construction equipment company Caterpillar Inc on Friday said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how it accounted for its July 2011 purchase of Bucyrus International Inc. In its quarterly report, Caterpillar said the Sept. 10 subpoena from the SEC seeks information about its accounting for goodwill relating to the $7.6 billion takeover of Bucyrus, a maker of mining equipment. Caterpillar said it is cooperating with the SEC and believes the matter will not materially affect its finances or liquidity. In a separate statement, the Peoria, Illinois-based company also said it believes its accounting treatment for Bucyrus was “appropriate.” Bucyrus had been based in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Goodwill reflects intangible assets such as brand value and employee morale. It is often used as a measure of how much over book value, or the sum that a company’s assets could fetch in a liquidation, a company pays to acquire a business. Caterpillar said it had $6.8 billion of goodwill on its books as of Sept. 30, of which $3.76 billion concerned its resource industries operations, which include Bucyrus. Shares of Caterpillar, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, closed up $1.25, or 1.2 percent, at $101.41 in Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The day’s losses were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P; 500 sectors lower on the day, though tech was the biggest drag by far. The group lost 3.3 percent in its biggest one-day drop since November 2011, in the wake of results from industry bellwether Microsoft. Industrial shares fell, led by Caterpillar. The two names were the biggest decliners on the Dow, but fellow components Procter & Gable and DuPont Co  also tumbled. Microsoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning. Heavy machinery marker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, warning the recent plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Shares dropped 7.2 percent to $79.85. “There’s clearly a lot of froth baked into certain areas of tech, while Caterpillar is giving tangible evidence that things can go down more than they already have,” said Jim O’Donnell, chief investment officer at Forward in San Francisco. “People may not be aware of the sensitivities that heavy industrial guys have to the oil cycle, or what the ripple effects of oil’s weakness will be. There are a lot of companies that are going to be adversely impacted.” With 24 percent of the S&P; 500 having reported, 70.6 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations while 55.5 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue. Still, many multinational companies disappointed this quarter, with the stronger dollar a common culprit.  P&G; was one of the companies pressured by a stronger dollar, sending shares down 3.4 percent to $86.49. After the market closed, Apple Inc rose 5.4 percent to $115 after it posted better-than-expected revenue growth, along with record sales of its iPhone line. AT&T; Inc’s revenue rose more than expected in the latest quarter. Yahoo Inc reported its results and unveiled a plan for a tax-free spin-off of its 15 percent stake in China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, a first step in a highly-anticipated process to unwind the holding, valued at roughly $40 billion. Shares of AT&T; rose 1.8 percent to $33.40 after the bell, while Yahoo added 7.7 percent to $51.69.

Adding to the day’s weakness, a gauge of U.S. business investment plans unexpectedly fell in December, another sign that slowing global growth and falling crude oil prices were having an impact on the economy. On the plus side, consumer confidence posted its highest reading since August 2007. That helped indexes recover from their lows of the session; the Dow earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent.

448,CAT,Caterpillar warns of 2015 sales hit from falling oil price,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) on Tuesday cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned the plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business, sending shares tumbling as much as 8 percent. The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker also posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit. During the fourth quarter, Caterpillar’s energy business helped offset falling construction equipment sales and weakness in mining equipment orders due to lower copper, coal and iron ore prices.  Caterpillar said it expects only a modest improvement in the global economy in 2015.  The nearly 60 percent drop in oil prices since June will not only affect Caterpillar’s energy business, but will also hurt construction projects in oil-producing regions, the company said.  Caterpillar expects lower construction equipment sales in China in 2015 due to a weaker market. The stronger dollar should hit revenue from products sold overseas. Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said in a statement 2015 will be “tough” for the company. Caterpillar said it expected full-year 2015 revenues of around $50 billion, about 9 percent below the 2014 total. The company had said last October it expected 2015 revenue to be flat or slightly up versus 2014. On a conference call, company officials said around 50 percent of the expected sales decline was directly or indirectly related to low oil prices.   Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson said that with housing starts and the construction sector expected to do well in 2015 - outside the energy sector - North America is one of “few bright spots” for Caterpillar. How low oil prices will affect consumer sentiment, the economy and ultimately Caterpillar’s business is hard to tell at this point, executives said.  The Peoria, Illinois-based company reported fourth-quarter net profit of $757 million, down nearly 25 percent from $1.03 billion a year earlier.  Earnings per share were $1.23, compared with $1.54 a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.55 for the most recent quarter. Revenue totaled $14.24 billion, down from $14.4 billion a year earlier, but above estimates of $14.18 billion. Caterpillar expects full-year 2015 earnings per share of $4.60, or $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. Analysts had estimated $6.67 for the year. During the fourth quarter, energy and transportation sales rose 11 percent to $6.2 billion, but that was not enough to offset falling mining and construction equipment sales. Caterpillar shares fell as low as $79.16 before cutting losses to $79.40, down 7.7 percent.

458,CAT,"Caterpillar sees challenges in strong dollar, weak oil, unrest","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) on Thursday gave a somber outlook for the rest of 2015, facing stiffening competition thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, weak oil prices bringing a tough energy equipment market and geopolitical tensions posing risks to growth.  “We’re still very much focused on market share but ... the competition for every deal has got greater as we’ve seen the dollar strengthen,” chief executive Doug Oberhelman said in a call with analysts.  The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit despite lower sales. It maintained its 2015 forecast and raised its full-year earnings per share outlook.  Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar said the strong dollar lowered the cost of imported goods in the first quarter, especially from Japan.      The company said it expected sales and profit for the remaining three quarters of the year to be lower than the first quarter.  Caterpillar reported quarterly net income of $1.11 billion or $1.81 per share, up 20 percent from $922 million or $1.44 per share a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, earnings per share totaled $1.86. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.35.  The profit beat came despite a 4 percent decline in sales to $12.7 billion from $13.24 billion a year earlier. That also beat analyst estimates of $12.38 billion. Energy and transportation sales rose slightly, but Caterpillar said that was unlikely to continue amid low oil prices. The company’s mining equipment business has already suffered as commodity prices have fallen, while construction equipment sales in North America have remained a bright spot. The company said it expected global gross domestic product growth to hit 2.7 percent in 2015, slightly higher than the 2.6 percent growth in 2014.  But it said “risks and uncertainties” including political conflicts and social unrest in the Middle East, Africa and the former Soviet Union could temper growth.  Caterpillar also cited “ongoing uncertainty” over U.S. monetary policy actions.  Chief financial officer Brad Halverson told Reuters Caterpillar hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve takes a cautious approach to raising interest rates, as the company is concerned that raising rates too quickly could cause an economic slowdown. “It’s a question of not moving too fast,” Halverson said. Caterpillar maintained its 2015 sales outlook of $50 billion and raised its earnings per share forecast to $4.70 from its previous forecast of $4.60.

462,CAT,"UPDATE 2-U.S. House Speaker Boehner: Amtrak crash, funding cuts not linked","(Adds comments from Brookings expert, President Obama and senators Schumer, Ayotte) By David Lawder WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - The Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia revived concerns on Thursday about the crumbling infrastructure in the United States and Washington’s failure to address the problem, with U.S. House Speaker John Boehner lashing out at Democrats who linked the two. Boehner, a Republican, said Democrats were wrong to suggest that Amtrak funding cuts were partly to blame for the train crash on Tuesday that killed eight people. Dismissing a reporter’s question about Amtrak’s budget in light of the accident as “stupid,” he said the passenger service’s safety programs were adequately funded. “Obviously, it’s not about funding,” the Republican leader told a news conference. “The train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds were there, no funding has been cut from rail safety and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak and authorize a lot of these programs.” But rail experts and Democrats contend that Amtrak budget cuts have caused delays to the installation of “positive train control” technology, which can automatically slow or stop a train to prevent an accident. Although Congress in 2008 mandated it for all rail lines by the end of 2015, it was not deployed on the rail yard curve where the train derailed. “There’s a lot we don’t know, but it does appear clear that if there was this positive train control technology deployed throughout the corridor, particularly around this curve, which has been historically dangerous, that the crash could have been prevented or could have been mitigated,” said Robert Puentes, an infrastructure expert at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution in Washington. Senator Charles Schumer, the Senate’s third-ranking Democrat, called Boehner’s comments “patently false” and said insufficient funding has delayed positive train control. “To deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality,” the New York Democrat added. President Barack Obama called for more investment in infrastructure. “We are a growing country with a growing economy. We need to invest in the infrastructure that keeps us that way. And not just when something bad happens, like a bridge collapse or a train derailment, but all the time,” he said at a news conference at Camp David in Maryland. In an apparent change of heart, Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte said Congress should re-examine the timing of adoption of positive train control and asked the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to schedule a hearing on the issue. Ayotte was a co-sponsor of legislation passed by the committee that would have given the rail industry five more years, until 2020, to deploy the technology. “The committee should use this hearing to examine the circumstances of the crash in Philadelphia and revisit the issue,” Ayotte wrote in a letter to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota. The Republican-controlled House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday approved a $262 million cut in Amtrak’s capital investment programs as part of a $54 billion spending bill for transportation and housing programs. Tensions on infrastructure funding were rising as a May 31 deadline approached to renew federal Highway Trust Fund spending authority for road, bridge and rail transit projects. Boehner joined other lawmakers on Thursday in acknowledging only a short-term extension of the fund could be arranged by May 31. Some lawmakers pressed for only a two-month extension, while others want to extend transportation authority until the end of 2015.

466,CAT,"Caterpillar profit falls on weak sales in key markets, shares drop","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported a lower quarterly net profit and sales on Thursday due to weakness in mining, slower construction in Brazil and China, and declining orders for oil-related applications, sending its shares lower in premarket trading.  The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker reported second-quarter net income of $710 million, or $1.16 per share, down from $999 million, or $1.57 a share a year earlier.  Earnings per share excluding restructuring costs were  $1.27, meeting analysts’ expectations, compared with $1.69 in the same quarter a year earlier.   Lower sales volume and weakening currencies including the euro, Japanese yen and Brazilian real led to a decline in second-quarter revenue which fell to $12.3 billion, down 13 percent from $14.2 billion a year earlier. Shares were down nearly 3 percent in premarket trading. The company said the 2015 outlook for profit per share was unchanged at $4.70, or $5.00 excluding restructuring costs.  The company expects 2015 revenue of about $49 billion, down $1 billion from its previous forecast, with the downward revision pegged to unfavorable currency exchange rates.  “We originally set the $50 billion sales and revenues estimate in January, and our expectations haven’t changed much since then. However, currency impacts from a stronger U.S. dollar are causing sales in many countries to translate into fewer dollars than we initially expected,” Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement. Caterpillar plans to repurchase nearly $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter of 2015.  “We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and some of that value should be returned to shareholders,” Oberhelman said on CNBC Thursday morning.

Facing slowdowns in developing markets, a static oil industry and a strong U.S. dollar suppressing overseas earnings, Caterpillar said it was pruning operations and cutting costs to adapt. “We’re getting more efficient, we are not taking out capacity that we’ll need when the business turns around,” Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson told Reuters in an interview. He said the company had recently closed or reduced production at 20 facilities around the world.

The Peoria, Illinois-based company stuck to its full year profit forecast of $5 a share on Thursday, but cut its revenue forecast by $1 billion, signaling it intends to rely on cost-cutting to meet its goals.

The yuan fell to its lowest against the dollar in almost three years following what China’s central bank described as a “one-off depreciation”. U.S. crude hit contract lows, trading about $1 above its bottom for 2015. Brent, the global benchmark, was heading for its largest decline in a week. The currency move by the world’s top metals consumer pushed copper and aluminum to six-year lows. Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors were down, with the materials index’s 2.13 percent fall leading the decliners. The loss was index’s biggest in nearly three weeks as Freeport-McMoRan’s 13.6 percent slump dragged. The energy index was down 1.6 percent, with Exxon Mobil’s 1.8 percent drop weighing the most.

478,CAT,Caterpillar Inc plans to cut 475 more jobs amid revenue decline,"(Reuters) - Heavy machinery manufacturer Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said it plans a new round of layoffs to cut costs as declining revenues from global mining and construction activities erodes its bottom line. The Peoria, Illinois-based company said it notified workers earlier this week it will reduce staff in its customer services support division by cutting 475 jobs. The move comes after the company previously announced about 270 layoffs for Illinois employees. “The restructuring is a result of a consolidation of several divisions combined with current business conditions,” spokeswoman Lisa Miller said in a written statement.  Caterpillar has let go about 4,800 employees over the past year and has cut 20,000 full-time employees worldwide since 2012, more than 10 percent of its global workforce.      The most recent layoffs will primarily affect employees at facilities around central Illinois, including Peoria and Morton, but will also include some global positions, Miller said.  The positions were responsible for supporting after-market parts and service and handling customer and dealer support, Miller said. The layoffs are expected to take effect on various dates and some may not be effective for several months. The impacted workers are office personnel and are not union-represented employees.  In July, the company reported a drop in quarterly profit due to an expected decline in construction revenue on reduced residential building activity in China and Brazil, soft sales related to oil and gas construction in the United States and the strong U.S. dollar undercutting the value of sales in Europe.

480,CAT,"Wall Street ends lower as Caterpillar, health stocks weigh","(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday in a volatile session on uncertainty about U.S. monetary policy and global economic growth, while market heavyweight Caterpillar cut its sales forecast and healthcare investors fled for the exits. After the bell, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she expects the Fed to raise interest rates later this year. She was said to receive medical attention after her speech, though a spokesman for the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where she spoke, said she was expected to resume her schedule. S&P; 500 e-mini futures ESc1 were down at the start of the overnight session but later turned higher and were last up 0.4 percent. Investors had been cautious on Thursday ahead of the speech as they were anxious for clues regarding the timing for the first rate hike in almost a decade. Markets have been skittish since last week, when Yellen cited concerns about slowing global growth as a key reason for holding off from a hike. Several investment strategists said on Thursday that the market is on its way to retesting the lows of Aug. 24, when shares tanked due to a panic about slowing growth in China.  Six of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the health sector’s .SPXHC 1-percent fall leading the S&P; declines and the Nasdaq biotech sector .NBI down 2 percent.

485,CAT,"UPDATE 4-Caterpillar slashes revenue forecast, cutting up to 10,000 jobs","(Adds analyst comment, historical financial performance, links to Breakingviews, Buzz items) By Lisa Von Ahn Sept 24 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc slashed its 2015 revenue forecast on Thursday and said it will cut as many as 10,000 jobs through 2018, joining a list of big U.S. industrial companies grappling with the mining and energy downturn. Shares of Caterpillar tumbled as much as 8 percent to a five-year low, pulling down the sector and knocking as much as 37 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. Over the past year, miners and energy companies have chopped budgets and put expansion projects on hold as prices of raw materials such as crude oil, copper, coal and iron ore have plunged to six-year lows amid lingering worries about oversupplies and China’s slowing economic growth. As a result, orders for equipment have dried up. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, the world’s biggest construction and mining equipment maker, has also been hit by a slowdown in industrial activity in China. S&P; Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore termed the restructuring “a strong reaction” to market conditions. “The company has shown a lack of revenue growth in the last few years (and) earnings are in a decline,” he said. “That definitely puts pressure on the CEO to find a way to react to the environment, which at this time shows no near-term catalyst for improvement.” Earlier this month, mining equipment maker Joy Global Inc  issued a profit warning as it struggled to adapt to slowing demand for its services. Deere & Co, the world’s largest maker of farm equipment, announced layoffs of more than 900 plant employees in January as declining grain prices have hurt demand for agricultural machinery. Caterpillar had raised its 2015 profit forecast in April and affirmed it in July. “That they had hung in with their guidance for so long was probably the most surprising, given the ... accumulating evidence around them that things were slowing,” said Morningstar analyst Kwame Webb. Caterpillar expects revenue to fall in 2015 for the third straight year, to $48 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $48.82 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For 2016, the company forecast a 5 percent revenue decline, mainly in higher-margin products, to about $45.6 billion. Analysts had expected $47.36 billion. Caterpillar said it will update its 2015 profit forecast when it releases third-quarter results in late October. It expects to provide a 2016 earnings outlook in January. “We are facing a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors - namely in mining and energy,” Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said in a statement. Caterpillar’s announcement was no surprise to Bill Hickey, president of Chicago-based steel-mill operator Lapham-Hickey, which supplies the company’s road construction and road equipment operations. “There is way, way too much capacity worldwide, and the question is, how long will the cycle last?” he said. “Our best guess is that there is going to be oversupply on steel and other commodities until maybe late next year.” Caterpillar said it will cut 4,000 to 5,000 jobs by the end of 2016, most of them coming in 2015. It has already reduced its workforce by more than 31,000 since mid-2012. The company had 114,233 employees as of Dec. 31, 2014 according to Thomson Reuters data. Caterpillar expects to incur about $2 billion in pretax costs from the restructuring and save about $1.5 billion annually. Caterpillar said it might close or consolidate more than 20 plants around the world across its three large businesses - construction, resources, and energy and transportation. “2016 would mark the first time in Caterpillar’s 90-year history that sales and revenues have decreased four years in a row,” the company said in a statement. It last reported annual revenue growth in 2012, the first full year after it bought heavy equipment maker Bucyrus International Inc in its largest acquisition ever. Caterpillar’s 2015 revenue forecast represents a 27 percent drop from 2012. Wall Street’s net income outlook for this year is 50 percent lower than the company’s 2012 profit. Shares of Caterpillar, which already had fallen 23 percent this year, were down 6.3 percent at $65.81 in afternoon trading. The S&P; Industrials Index fell 0.7 percent. The company’s market value was about $39 billion on Thursday, down from nearly $60 billion at the end of 2012.

Caterpillar fell as much as 7.9 percent to its lowest level since 2010 after the world’s biggest mining and construction equipment maker slashed its 2015 revenue forecast and said it could cut up to 10,000 jobs. “The (Caterpillar) news is not helping matters, it’s emblematic of a weaker global economy,” said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist for U.S. Trust, in New York. People shouldn’t be surprised but when you get those big headline numbers, that subtracts from confidence obviously.” Caterpillar was the biggest drag on the Dow and pulled down shares of other industrial companies. The S&P; industrials index  fell 1.83 percent, the biggest decliner among the 10 major S&P; sectors. Mining equipment maker Joy Global fell 4.5 percent, while Dow component Boeing was down 3.3 percent and General Electric declined 1.8 percent. Concerns of slowing global economic growth was one of the reason cited by the Federal Reserve when it held off from raising rates last Thursday.

The U.S. equity market has been skittish since last Thursday, with the S&P; 500 losing 2.8 percent up to Wednesday’s close. “The Fed has a credibility problem with the market and that will be a variable that will weigh on sentiment until it’s reconciled,” said Quinlan. The CBOE Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped 11.2 percent to 24.65, above its long-term average of 20.

Investors were also apprehensive ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Caterpillar fell 7 percent to its lowest level since 2010 after the company cut its 2015 revenue forecast and said it could cut up to 10,000 jobs. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow and on the S&P; 500 materials index, which was down 1.69 percent. Investors will look for clues regarding the timing of an interest rate hike when Yellen delivers a speech on inflation at 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT). The U.S. equity market has been skittish since last Thursday, when the Fed held off from raising rates, as was expected by some. Up to Wednesday’s close, the S&P; 500 had fallen 2.8 percent since then. “There is some apprehension ahead of Yellen’s speech,” said Scott Colyer, chief executive officer of Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. “The lack of visibility regarding earnings growth is problematic right now and you’re going to see this back and forth till we get a clearer picture of economic recovery.” The earnings of S&P; 500 companies are expected to decline 3.9 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Earlier, U.S. stock futures barely moved after data showed that jobless claims rose less-than-expected last week and durable goods orders in August fell as much as economists had expected.

490,CAT,Caterpillar's global woes ripple out through supplier base,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s (CAT.N) suppliers were feeling the pain of slumping sales at the world’s largest mining and construction equipment maker long before it announced an extensive cost-cutting program. J-TEC Chief Executive Officer Gary Roling said Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, his single largest customer, had recently pushed back a big order due this month to December. “We’ve been selling to Caterpillar for a long, long time, and this year will likely be the lowest year for sales we’ve ever had,” said Roling, whose company makes tools to measure the flow of fuel, exhaust and other gases.  Combined with declining orders for a defense-related project, total sales are down 75 percent at J-TEC. The Cedar Rapids, Iowa, company’s workforce has fallen to 10 from 25 and is on a four-day week.  J-TEC is seeking new business in other sectors to boost sales. “Our hope is that things will start to get better in the first half of 2016,” Roling said. “But we have no visibility, and based on (Caterpillar’s) news, a recovery could be some way off.”  J-TEC is not alone. The problems at Caterpillar have rippled through its supplier base and will probably worsen. On Thursday, the equipment maker forecast sales declines for 2015 and 2016 and announced plans to cut up to 10,000 jobs.

491,CAT,Caterpillar's global woes ripple out through supplier base,"CHICAGO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s  suppliers were feeling the pain of slumping sales at the world’s largest mining and construction equipment maker long before it announced an extensive cost-cutting program. J-TEC Chief Executive Officer Gary Roling said Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, his single largest customer, had recently pushed back a big order due this month to December. “We’ve been selling to Caterpillar for a long, long time, and this year will likely be the lowest year for sales we’ve ever had,” said Roling, whose company makes tools to measure the flow of fuel, exhaust and other gases. Combined with declining orders for a defense-related project, total sales are down 75 percent at J-TEC. The Cedar Rapids, Iowa, company’s workforce has fallen to 10 from 25 and is on a four-day week. J-TEC is seeking new business in other sectors to boost sales. “Our hope is that things will start to get better in the first half of 2016,” Roling said. “But we have no visibility, and based on (Caterpillar’s) news, a recovery could be some way off.” J-TEC is not alone. The problems at Caterpillar have rippled through its supplier base and will probably worsen. On Thursday, the equipment maker forecast sales declines for 2015 and 2016 and announced plans to cut up to 10,000 jobs.

The world’s largest construction and mining company, which last month announced a major restructuring, said slower Chinese economic growth and Brazil’s recession dented company revenues as sales in all three of its major business segments fell.  While Caterpillar expects China to be the world’s largest construction market and is positive on opportunities there, it said its construction business is down.  “It is going to grow, we have to be there,” Caterpillar’s Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson said. “But China is soft and we don’t see any big recovery in it next year.”  Despite weaker profits and a slashed outlook, Caterpillar shares rallied after its report was largely consistent with last month’s warning and restructuring announcement. The stock rose 3 percent to $70.91.  “I think that our outlook for 2015 and our sales guidance for 2016 was pretty much in line with what the market expected. There weren’t any big surprises, and I think the market took some comfort in that,” said Mike DeWalt, vice president of finance at Caterpillar. Caterpillar cut its full-year 2015 earnings per share to $3.70 from a previous outlook of $4.70. Excluding restructuring costs, it cut its 2015 EPS forecast to $4.60 from $5.00. It forecast a 5 percent fall in sales in 2016, which would be its fourth straight year of decline. “All in, despite the anticipated $750 million in restructuring savings, operating earnings are expected to be down year over year,” Ann Duignan, analyst at J.P. Morgan said in a research note. While mining remained weak globally, the company’s interest in the cyclical industry has not declined. However, it has looked to boost its rail business and recently acquired a railroad and locomotive engine parts manufacturers.    “Replacement activity in mining equipment remains very weak, though machine utilization rates have started to improve,” Duignan added.     For the third quarter, net income slid to $368 million, or 62 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or $1.63 per share a year earlier. Earnings per share, excluding restructuring costs, were 75 cents, compared with $1.72 a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of 78 cents a share. Quarterly revenue fell to $11 billion from about $13.5 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected $11.25 billion.

496,CAT,U.S. House to start voting Monday on revival of shuttered trade bank,"WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers will begin voting on Monday on legislation to revive the shuttered Export-Import Bank, a spokeswoman for a leading Republican backer of the bank said on Friday. A so-called “discharge petition,” a procedural maneuver that has been successful only a handful of times in the past century, to renew the trade bank’s charter matures on Monday. The petition has support from 218 lawmakers, a majority of  the chamber, including 42 Republicans, effectively overruling House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a vocal critic of the bank. Representative Stephen Fincher, who circulated the petition, will start the voting process with a floor motion on Monday, his spokeswoman said. There could be several procedural votes before a vote on final House passage, possibly on Tuesday. House passage could move Congress toward reopening the bank, which offers loans, loan guarantees and trade insurance to U.S. exporters and buyers of U.S. goods such as Caterpillar Inc  heavy equipment and Boeing Co airplanes. But the effort to renew the bank’s charter faces obstacles in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is among those who oppose it. The bank’s charter expired on June 30, after Hensarling refused to move legislation to extend it, and it has been unable to conduct new business for more than three months. Several companies have announced the loss of export contracts due to the resulting lack of financing. Some conservative Republicans and political groups have targeted the bank as an example of “corporate welfare” for large, wealthy companies although supporters point out it also supports small businesses. The move to force a House vote reviving the Export-Import Bank’s charter is unusual. “This is what happens when one chairman refuses to acknowledge the desires of two-thirds of the House and Senate,” Republican Representative Mike Simpson said.

The latest job cuts bring the total to 1,900 this year, or 13 percent of the company’s global workforce.

502,CAT,UPDATE 1-Daimler to invest $375 mln to build diesel engines,"(Adds detail on announcement, expected demand, background on rivals) By Joseph White DETROIT - Nov 20 (Reuters) - The head of Daimler AG’s  commercial truck operation told Reuters Friday the company will invest $375 million at a complex near Detroit to build diesel engines for medium duty trucks, expanding a strategy of building and selling trucks, engines, transmissions and axles as a package. Daimler had previously expanded its Detroit operations to produce heavy-duty automatic transmissions, which have been “a runaway success,” Wolfgang Bernhard, head of Daimler’s global commercial truck operations, said ahead of an appearance in Detroit Friday. Bernhard said he expects demand for medium and heavy trucks will be “slightly softer” in North America next year, but should still be above relatively strong 2014 levels. European demand will be flat and Brazil will “continue to be very difficult,” he said. Earlier this week, rival truck maker AB Volvo said it planned to idle its North American factories for a total of 2.5 weeks in December and January to reduce swelling inventories. Bernhard said Daimler, which controls about 40 percent of the U.S. heavy truck market, is not cutting back. Production at its Detroit engine and transmission factories is still running around the clock, seven days a week, he said. Daimler’s latest investment in Detroit builds on a strategy Bernhard has pursued to bring engineering and manufacturing of the company’s commercial trucks under one roof. Traditionally, especially in North America, heavy truck makers such as Paccar Inc or Navistar International Corp have purchased engines, transmissions, axles and other major components from suppliers such as Cummins Inc , Eaton Corp PLC, Caterpillar Inc or Dana Holding Corp. Government demands to cut carbon dioxide emissions are putting more pressure on commercial vehicle makers. Bernhard said Daimler’s response will be to design and engineer itself more of the technology in its vehicles. “We can perfectly optimize those components to each other to get the best fuel economy and reliability,” he said. Bernhard said Daimler is also using its own technology to develop autonomous driving systems for future commercial vehicles. He said trucks that could drive themselves on open freeways could be available by 2020. Daimler is testing autonomous driving technology on heavy trucks in Germany and the United States.

The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker has been restructuring aggressively to cut costs because of slower growth in markets including China and Brazil and plunging commodity prices that have hurt customer demand. The company warned that 2016 would be another grim year, but said its focus on costs was paying off. “Cost management, restructuring actions ... are helping the company while sales and revenues remain under pressure from weak commodity prices and slowing economic growth in developing countries,” Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said. “We are benefiting now and expect to even more in the future when markets rebound.” The Peoria, Illinois-based company said its outlook for 2016 “does not anticipate improvement in world economic growth or commodity prices.” Caterpillar sees 2016 revenue within a range of $40 billion to $44 billion. The midpoint of that range, $42 billion, is around $3.5 billion below its forecast in October. Caterpillar expects full-year 2016 earnings of $4.00 per share, excluding restructuring costs, compared with the average estimate of $3.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Including restructuring costs, Caterpillar said it expects 2016 EPS of $3.50. Full-year earnings per share in 2015 were $4.64. Morningstar analyst Kwame Webb said he thought the company’s earnings estimates were too optimistic given the poor construction outlook in China and Brazil. Caterpillar said it expected its construction revenue would be down 5 to 10 percent this year. “Caterpillar will see downward pressure due to construction and they will probably have to get a little more conservative,” Webb said. “This remains a company in a very tough position.” Caterpillar said in September it would cut as many as 10,000 jobs through 2018. The company said on Thursday that 2015 restructuring costs were higher than expected at $908 million. Caterpillar  anticipates further restructuring costs of about $400 million in 2016. Total sales and revenue fell to $11.03 billion in the fourth quarter, from $14.24 billion a year earlier. Caterpillar reported a quarterly loss of $87 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with a profit of $757 million, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier.

The company, which cut 13 percent of its global workforce last year, said it would cut another 400-500 jobs by mid-2016. Finning had about 14,500 employees as of Dec. 31, 2014.

Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment, has been hit by weak mining, drilling and construction activity around the world. Finning in November shut 11 facilities in Western Canada, in addition to previously announced 16 closures, to cut costs. The company posted a net loss of C$309 million ($225.75 million), or C$1.82 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of C$107 million, or 62 Canadian cents, a year earlier.

The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker will create an Electric Power, Marine and Oil & Gas Division by consolidating the Electric Power and Marine & Petroleum Power Divisions, it said on Wednesday. Steve Niehuas, currently vice president of the Electric Power Division will retire after 27 years with the company.  “As with any organizational change, there may be opportunities for us to better collaborate and work more efficiently where processes and functions are duplicated. We’ll evaluate those in the coming months,” said spokeswoman Rachel Potts, a Caterpillar spokesperson. The company did not give details on any job cuts.  The company has closed plants and reduced its workforce in a restructuring announced last year as it copes with global weakness in construction and mining, soft commodity prices and slowed demand for heavy machinery. At the end of 2015, the global workforce totaled 105,700 employees, down nearly 11 percent from 2013. In its fourth-quarter report on Jan. 28, it said the outlook for 2016 “does not anticipate improvement in world economic growth or commodity prices.”    “If conditions stay soft, more cuts will be made. Much of the decline in mining, commodities, coal and energy have more than just cyclical weakness and the firm needs to right-size operations to the likely ‘new normal,’” said Eli Lustgarten, analyst at Longbow Research.  Caterpillar shares were down 1.2 percent at $65.      Last year Caterpillar said it would consolidate and possibly lay off up to 10,000 employees by 2018. Analysts expect more details on the restructuring and see additional cuts to office personnel.    “It is normally a high-cost area and people can be asked to do more work-related functions (for the ones let go), while the mining and construction world hopefully start to improve,” said Bill Seleksy, an analyst at Argus Research.   Caterpillar’s 2016 outlook included about $400 million in restructuring costs. Last year restructuring costs totaled $908 million, with about 75 percent coming in the fourth quarter.

Caterpillar’s mining product sales will be close to $7 billion in 2016, down from $20 billion dollars in 2012, said Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar’s vice president of finance services said at a global industrials conference in London. “In 2012, the very peak of the cycle, we shipped about 1,600 large mining trucks. In 2016, we’ll be lucky if we do about 150,” DeWalt said.  Caterpillar expects first quarter 2016 sales to be $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion. Analysts on average expected about $10.3 billion. “There has been a fundamental downward shift in the global mining sector, with the downturn being deeper and the recovery likely to take longer than previously expected,” Moody’s Investors Services said last week in a report about BHP Billiton, a global mining giant.     Caterpillar said 2016 profit for the quarter ended March 31 would be 50 to 55 cents per share, or 65 to 70 cents per share excluding restructuring costs. Analysts had expected 97 cents per share, excluding restructuring. “I would certainly characterize 2016 as, if its not the bottom, it certainly needs to be getting pretty close absent some sort of worldwide recession,” DeWalt said of the current business cycle. However, Caterpillar kept its full-year 2016 revenue outlook at about $40 billion to $44 billion. The company’s profit outlook for 2016 remained at about $3.50 per share, or $4.00 per share excluding restructuring costs.

517,CAT,UPDATE 3-Boeing CEO says sales at risk due to U.S. EXIM paralysis,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A delay in appointing U.S. Export-Import Bank board members threatens to cost Boeing Co (BA.N) sales, the company’s chief executive said on Thursday, flagging an issue that also affects General Electric (GE.N) and other U.S. companies that depend on the agency’s export financing. Boeing is on the verge of losing orders because only two of five seats on the agency’s board are filled, not enough to approve deals over $10 million, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said at EXIM’s annual conference in Washington. The appointment of a third board member would allow the agency to help finance billions of dollars in sales of U.S. aircraft, rail, power and communications equipment around the world, EXIM Chairman Fred Hochberg said.  “We’ve got about $10 billion (worth of loans and guarantees) in our pipeline right now,” that are being held up because of the short-handed board, Hochberg said in an interview.  “If exports slow in the areas that require our financing, it will also hit the supply chain” of 14,000 U.S. companies that supply Boeing, and jobs, he added.  Confirmation of a third member has been halted by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby’s moratorium on some of the 16 Obama administration financial nominees who have been awaiting panel confirmation, effectively blocking sales for Boeing, GE, Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and other companies. Muilenburg said Ethiopian Airlines [ETHA.UL] was among the customers concerned that a lack of EXIM financing could prevent it from buying more Boeing planes.  Banks have been cautious about offering loans of 10 years or more to smaller carriers or ones with higher credit risk without a government guarantee, and some experts have voiced concern that if Boeing self-financed such deals, it would drain resources from product development. Industry sources say Boeing already has had to provide or arrange bridge financing for several airlines because of the gap in EXIM funds. Last year Boeing said it lost two signed or potential satellite deals after EXIM’s charter lapsed on June 30. The charter was renewed later in the year. General Electric decided to move some production overseas to use foreign export credit. This year, global jetliner sales have slowed as an industry-wide boom in orders fades, making export credit more important.  Boeing plans to trim production of its 777 jetliner in 2017. On Thursday it said it delivered 176 airliners in the first quarter. That pace is below Boeing’s target of 740 to 745 deliveries for the year, but many deliveries are made later in the year. Muilenburg also voiced support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that has been an issue in the U.S. presidential campaigns.  He said the pact would not put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. He added that the defense industry needed a “dependable, robust” U.S. defense budget so it could invest.

Caterpillar, which has seen demand for equipment used in the energy and mining industries hit hard by a drop in commodity prices, experienced lower sales in the first quarter across all regions. To help stem the slide, Caterpillar cut about 8,600 jobs and closed nearly 15 facilities so far as part of a restructuring plan announced in 2015. Even so, Caterpillar said it is encouraged by improvement in demand for heavy machinery in China.  “Infrastructure projects are starting and for the first time in a few years, we’re seeing stronger demand from China,” said Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson.  In fact, Chinese sales of construction equipment are up slightly year-over-year, the company said.  The Peoria, Illinois company now expects 2016 earnings per share at $3.00, or $3.70 per share excluding restructuring costs. The previous forecast was $3.50 per share, or $4.00 per share, excluding restructuring costs. The company also trimmed its 2016 sales outlook range to $40 billion to $42 billion against a previous forecast $40 billion to $44 billion.  “Our sense is that investors will continue to worry that second half of the 2016 forecast are still a stretch as revenue and pricing trends will both need to improve to hit targets,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said in a note.   In the first quarter the company’s dealers said global retail machinery sales were down 13 percent, compared with the previous year. Caterpillar reported operating income of $494 million, or 67 cents per share in the first quarter, down from a revised $1.70 billion, or $2.07 a share, a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 68 cents.  Including restructuring costs, Caterpillar earned 46 cents per share, compared with a revised $2.03 a year earlier. Revenue fell to $9.46 billion from $12.7 billion a year ago. While all regions reported slumping revenue, the hardest hit was Latin America, where sales fell 43 percent, due to the area’s widespread economic weakness, a company statement said.

526,CAT,"Not the bottom yet, but Caterpillar raises hope of China rebound","BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world’s largest maker of heavy equipment, has raised hopes that China’s battered construction sector may be showing signs of life, pointing to its strongest post-holiday period in three years after a government boost. Ahead of a key week for the heavy equipment sector, with progress reports expected from rivals like Japan’s Komatsu (6301.T) to China’s Sany Heavy Industry (600031.SS), Caterpillar said late on Friday that it was seeing shipment activity holding up almost three months after the Chinese New Year holiday. “It is not a hockey stick, it is not a boom, it is not a 2010 - but it is the first time we have seen that happen and we have lifted our schedules as a result of that this year,” said Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive. “We will see how long that goes.” China’s economic growth slowed down in the first quarter to its weakest pace since 2009, but signs that the quarter ended on a stronger note have prompted some analysts to raise their forecasts for GDP in 2016. One of the strong notes is a pick up in the property sector, where investment growth quickened in March. Premier Li Keqiang, worried about pressure on the economy, has also promised new infrastructure projects will be launched in a timely manner. These factors have spurred a rally in China’s commodities markets. Rebar steel futures have shot up more than 50 percent this year. A bellwether for global industrial demand, Caterpillar has been exporting bulldozers and diggers to China for almost four decades - and since 2012 has also been one of many high profile casualties of the country’s slackening construction and mining sectors, having failed to predict the downturn. Its positive comments now, analysts said, hint at signs of life in a sector that is still debating the long-term impact of the effort to boost construction - for example, the improvement in Chinese local government’s budgets to carry out projects. Some local rivals agree with Caterpillar’s assessment and say they see signs of life, crediting state stimulus efforts, as well as tougher emissions standards, which mean buyers are advancing purchases to avoid tougher rules and pricier models. According to UBS analysts, Chinese excavator sales by non-Chinese manufacturers have increased year on year in February and March this year - the first rise in two years. But, as with Caterpillar, the jury is still out on the  sustainability of the rebound. While players like Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd (601100.SS), which feeds into the industry’s domestic supply chain, are targeting a jump in revenues - a fifth for Hengli in 2016 after a flat 2015 - others are less certain. “Even if there is a recovery, it’s still very vulnerable,” said Liu Chunyu, vice president in charge of domestic sales at Shantui Construction Machinery Co (000680.SZ). Late last week, for example, loss-making, debt-burdened Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Co (1157.HK) (000157.SZ) posted a record quarterly loss, hot on the heels of its lowest annual profit in 15 years. As for Caterpillar, Oberhelman said the worse may not be over, despite a post Chinese New Year period that has seen almost 90 days of sustained shipments. “I’m not going to declare a bottom in China,” he said. “I am cautious, but that is a better statistic than we have had.” ",4252016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-results-china/not-the-bottom-yet-but-caterpillar-raises-hope-of-china-rebound-idUSKCN0XM18K

530,CAT,Caterpillar ready to move into Cuban market once embargo lifted: CEO,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc, the world’s largest maker of heavy equipment, is ready to move swiftly into the Cuban market once the U.S. trade embargo is lifted, Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said on Wednesday after meeting with Cuban ministers in Havana. The detente between the United States and Cuba has raised hopes that full commercial ties will soon be restored between the former Cold War foes. Caterpillar (CAT.N), based in Peoria, Illinois, is one of several U.S. companies looking at ways to gain an early foothold in the Communist-ruled island, which had been largely off bounds to U.S. business for more than five decades. Oberhelman said he had been “warmly received” over the past two days by various ministers on his first trip to Cuba. “We have talked about a number of projects,” he told reporters on the sidelines of an event celebrating a donation by Caterpillar to the foundation that preserves the heritage of U.S. writer Ernest Hemingway in Cuba. “I think the most interesting one in the near term would be the Mariel harbor ... making an efficient modern harbor that competes with others around the world.” Cuba is staking much of its economic future on the Mariel port, west of Havana, seen as a potential distribution center for the Caribbean and Central and South America. Caterpillar has already named an official dealer for Cuba, the privately held Puerto Rico company Rimco. Rimco representative Caroline McConnie said the dealer was in talks with U.S. authorities about getting a license allowing it to sell certain Caterpillar products in Cuba despite the U.S. trade embargo. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed in December 2014 to end Cold War-era animosity and restore diplomatic relations, but the trade embargo remains in place because only the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress can lift it. Asked when he expected the embargo to be lifted, Oberhelman said: “For me, the answer is not soon enough.” Once it was lifted, Caterpillar could move quickly to sell products in Cuba as it is used to dealing in emerging markets, he said, speaking on the veranda of the farm just outside Havana where Hemingway lived for 21 years. “The idea is for our dealer to set up a facility here in Cuba,” he said. “We would supply most of our products from Brazil.” ",5122016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-caterpillar/caterpillar-ready-to-move-into-cuban-market-once-embargo-lifted-ceo-idUSKCN0Y301Q

536,CAT,Caterpillar global dealer machinery monthly sales slip yet again,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Monday that its global retail sales declined 12 percent for the three months ended May as a long global slowdown in the construction and mining sectors continued to weigh on the heavy equipment maker’s core markets.   The report marks 42 consecutive months of declining sales for Caterpillar. However, Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Research, said the pace of decline for the Peoria, Illinois-based manufacturer appears to be decelerating, a possible sign of stabilization. For the three-month period ending February sales fell 21 percent compared to a year ago, but declines have been less steep since then. Every month the company releases dealer’s three-month rolling sales compared with the same period of the prior year.  Caterpillar, known for its iconic yellow earth-moving equipment, said global machine sales were down 12 percent in May, 12 percent in April and 13 percent in March. “The pace of Caterpillar’s overall decline has been remarkably steady with low double digit declines for over 2 years now,” Jefferies’ analyst Stephan Volkmann wrote in a research note.  Overall, the company’s machinery sales have declined since the peak in 2012 due to the global slowdown in both mining and construction. At the end of 2015, full year global sales were down almost $20 billion from nearly $65.9 billion in 2012.  Caterpillar will report 2016 second-quarter results on July 26 and analysts on average expect earnings per share to be 97 cents on $10 billion in revenue. The company posted revenues of  $12.3 billion in the second quarter of 2015.  As of April, the company’s outlook for full year 2016 earnings per share is at $3.70, excluding restructuring costs, with $40 billion to $42 billion in revenues.  “In most industrial markets we are running along the bottom at this point,” Lustgarten said. “But the problem is we are not seeing anything that suggests improvement.” As the outlook from the first quarter reflects, Caterpillar is expecting a fourth down year of sales and revenues, a company spokesperson said on Monday.

539,CAT,Brexit adds headwinds to U.S. companies slowing spending,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. business investment, already heading for its worst slowdown since the global financial crisis, could decline further as Britain’s vote to leave the European Union creates more risks for companies, economists say. With growth tepid at home, North American companies as diverse as plane maker Boeing Co (BA.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and oil producer Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) now will find themselves trying to plan overseas spending without knowing whether Britain’s departure from the EU will upend tariff rules. “The ‘leave’ outcome has introduced substantial uncertainty that likely would dampen U.S. growth by delaying and or reducing business investment and consumption expenditures,” said William Lee, head of North America Economics at Citigroup in New York. Lee said U.S. multinational corporations face difficult strategic challenges - including assessing the U.K.’s future status as a gateway to the E.U. and London’s role as a financial center - that could crimp spending enough to reduce potential growth levels and real incomes. U.S. business spending on capital equipment dropped over the last two quarters and contracted in the first quarter at its quickest pace in seven years. A further decline in the second quarter would be the first time since the 2007-09 recession that it contracted for three straight quarters. Jim Farley, top European executive for automaker Ford, had warned a “Brexit” outcome could impact “potential future investment.” Caterpillar has voiced concern any changes in trade rules for its UK base would impact its European supply chain. While recognizing that UK exit negotiations will be complex, Caterpillar’s UK chief Mark Dorsett urged leaders in a statement to ensure “single market access issues be prioritized to lessen the negative impact on business.” And Exxon, the world’s largest-publicly traded oil company, said “the barrier-free movement of goods, people and capital across borders is important for a business like ours with operations across Europe.” After the Brexit vote, Boeing said in a statement that as a global business “we constantly manage changes in political circumstances and we will continue to do so now with the evolving situation in the UK and Europe.” Mark Grayson, a spokesman for PhRMA, the trade group representing pharmaceutical companies, said it is not yet clear whether Britain will move to set up its own agency to approve drugs, or opt to simply follow EU rules. Data from the U.S. Commerce Department on Friday showed non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell for a second straight month in May. These so-called core capital goods orders have increased in six of the last 17 months.  “Remember too that Brexit is occurring while the U.S. economy is in the later stages of its current business cycle, meaning the U.S. is more susceptible to economic shocks,” said Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York. “There is, happily, a lot less leverage in the system than there was in 2007, meaning no recession of equal magnitude is threatened,” Blitz said. Economists said heightened uncertainty over Brexit could spill into the labor market and hurt consumer sentiment headed into November’s U.S. presidential election. “Concern over another euro area crisis could slow U.S. growth in the next couple of quarters through weak financial markets and declining business and consumer confidence,” said Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He estimates Brexit could lower gross domestic product growth by an average of two-tenths of a percentage point over the next six quarters. “This could be reinforced by concern about the U.S. presidential election,” Harris added.

540,CAT,Caterpillar posts lower retail machinery sales ahead of second-quarter results,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Monday its global retail machinery sales declined 12 percent for the three months ended June 30 as demand for heavy machinery remained sluggish in all of the company’s core markets amid a slowdown in construction and mining activity.  According to Caterpillar, the largest decline in machinery sales was in Latin America, down 38 percent from a year ago. “The demand environment continues to be weak in Latin America,” Lawrence De Maria, an analyst at William Blair said in a research note. “There is limited visibility on how long the recession lasts,” De Maria said. Caterpillar, the world’s largest heavy equipment manufacturer, is scheduled to report second-quarter results on July 26 and analysts expect earnings per share to be 96 cents on $10 billion in revenue. The company posted revenues of $12.3 billion in the second quarter of 2015.  The Peoria, Illinois-based company has seen machinery sales steadily decline since posting record sales in 2012. At the end of 2015, Caterpillar’s full year global sales were $47 billion, down about 40 percent from 2012. In June, a company spokesperson said Caterpillar’s first-quarter outlook reflected expectations of 2016 as the fourth down year of sales and revenues.  Total machinery sales were also down 12 percent in North America, down 7 percent in the Asia Pacific region, and down 4 percent in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region for the rolling three month period ending in June.  All four main geographic regions, North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa, were down double digits in Caterpillar’s Resource Industries segment, which mainly sells equipment for the mining industry.  “Mining-related businesses have taken another leg down because of the depressed commodity prices, but there is some optimism that it could stabilize next year,” De Maria said. In the Construction Industries segment, sales fell 36 percent in Latin America and eight percent in North America. Meanwhile they rose 3 percent in the Europe, Middle East and African region and rose 1 percent in the Asia Pacific region.  “China’s economy seems to be improving which could provide upside to Caterpillar’s Construction and Resource businesses,” Ann Duignan said in a research note.

542,CAT,Caterpillar shares up on earnings beat; cuts 2016 outlook,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) shares rallied Tuesday on better-than-expected second quarter earnings, even as the heavy machinery maker lowered its full-year forecast amid sluggish demand in mining and other industries. Caterpillar shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, rose 4.7 percent to their highest level this year.  “They cut (full-year) guidance but they did beat this quarter. They seem to be setting themselves up for at least being able to meet or beat expectations in the future by addressing it now,” said Jim Corridore, analyst at S&P; Global Market Intelligence.  “The company controlled costs during the quarter and, given a very difficult environment, they are executing well,” Corridore said.   Caterpillar said global uncertainty persists, and the recent vote in Britain to leave the European Union and the attempted coup in Turkey have heightened risks, especially in Europe. A weakened global economy, combined with persistent political uncertainty, kept sales of new machinery sluggish. Sales fell 16 percent to $10.34 billion from a year ago. “We’re not expecting an upturn in important industries like mining, oil and gas and rail to happen this year,” Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement.      The company said commodity prices “appear to have stabilized, but at low levels.”  The company’s $1.09 in earnings per share, excluding restructuring costs, was above analysts’ expectations of 96 cents.  Despite better-than-predicted second-quarter earnings, the world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker lowered its full-year sales and profit forecast for the second time this year.

543,CAT,UPDATE 4-Caterpillar shares up on earnings beat; cuts 2016 outlook,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) shares rallied Tuesday on better-than-expected second quarter earnings, even as the heavy machinery maker lowered its full-year forecast amid sluggish demand in mining and other industries. Caterpillar shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, rose 4.7 percent to their highest level this year.  “They cut (full-year) guidance but they did beat this quarter. They seem to be setting themselves up for at least being able to meet or beat expectations in the future by addressing it now,” said Jim Corridore, analyst at S&P; Global Market Intelligence.  “The company controlled costs during the quarter and, given a very difficult environment, they are executing well,” Corridore said.   Caterpillar said global uncertainty persists, and the recent vote in Britain to leave the European Union and the attempted coup in Turkey have heightened risks, especially in Europe. A weakened global economy, combined with persistent political uncertainty, kept sales of new machinery sluggish. Sales fell 16 percent to $10.34 billion from a year ago. “We’re not expecting an upturn in important industries like mining, oil and gas and rail to happen this year,” Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement.      The company said commodity prices “appear to have stabilized, but at low levels.”  The company’s $1.09 in earnings per share, excluding restructuring costs, was above analysts’ expectations of 96 cents.  Despite better-than-predicted second-quarter earnings, the world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker lowered its full-year sales and profit forecast for the second time this year. It now expects 2016 sales between $40 billion and $40.5 billion, down from $40 billion to $42 billion. Caterpillar expects 2016 earnings of $2.75 per share, or $3.55 excluding restructuring costs, down from $3.00, or $3.70 excluding restructuring costs.

547,CAT,"Caterpillar sees more soft demand from energy, transport sectors","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) expects no significant demand growth for its energy and transportation products for the rest of 2016 as oil prices stay weak, a senior executive said on Thursday. “Oil prices, drill rig counts and our customers’ fleet utilization rates continue to remain low,” Jim Umpleby, Caterpillar’s energy and transportation group president, told analysts in an industry conference webcast. “Based on these factors we don’t see a significant increase in demand for our products for the remainder of 2016.”  Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of heavy equipment, is restructuring its businesses as demand has slowed for construction, mining, and energy and transportation products since 2012. It has slashed 13,900 jobs worldwide since mid-2015, and said last month it planned more job cuts. Caterpillar in July posted a 16 percent drop in total sales to $10.34 billion for the second quarter. Energy and transportation sales fell 20 percent to $3.750 billion as oil prices dropped. “While sales were down in almost all of our end markets, almost 80 percent of the decline was in oil and gas and transportation,” Umpleby said. Brent crude futures LCOc1, the global oil price benchmark, traded at an average of $45 a barrel during the second quarter, down from an average $62 a barrel a year earlier and $107.23 in the second quarter in 2012. The most significant impact of the oil price decline is on the sale of reciprocating engines used for gas gathering, drilling, well servicing and production, Umpleby said. “If we look at the percentage drop, it is so significant, that there isn’t that much room to fall, frankly,” he said, referring to the engine sales. Demand for energy and transportation products is not expected to recover this year, Umpleby said. He added that recovery would only come when oil prices rise and stabilize and customers work through a backlog of equipment. In China, Caterpillar expects industry sales of excavators to be “about flat, maybe up a percent to 2 percent,” Amy Campbell, Caterpillar’s investor relations director, said in the webcast.  “Total excavator sales in China are off maybe 80 percent from the peak but appeared to have maybe at least leveled out in 2016 versus 2015,” Campbell said.

569,CAT,"Caterpillar CEO to retire, successor a company veteran","CHICAGO (Reuters) - (This version of the Oct. 17 story corrects spelling of Oberhelman in paragraph 2 and Umpleby in paragraph 5) Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) insider Jim Umpleby will become chief executive of the heavy equipment maker on Jan. 1, faced with the challenge of reversing a multiyear sales decline triggered by the global commodities slump. He replaces Doug Oberhelman, who will retire as CEO on Dec. 31 but stay on as executive board chairman until March 31, the company said on Monday. Caterpillar shares were down about 0.58 percent to $87.20. Under Oberhelman the company recorded record high revenue in 2012, two years after he became CEO. However, a decline in metals and oil prices hit the company hard and its sales have fallen since 2013.   A 35-year company veteran, Umpleby must grapple with Caterpillar’s sober outlook. In July, the company said it expects no upturn this year in the mining, oil and gas and transportation industries as commodity prices have apparently stabilized at low levels. To cut costs, the company has shed nearly 14,000 employees since 2015 and more layoffs are planned. Oberhelman said on Monday the future is bright partly because of Caterpillar’s lean and agile manufacturing and industry-leading digital capabilities. Umpleby is currently group president for energy and transportation, which makes equipment for the oil, gas, power generation and rail industries.   “It is worth noting that much of the energy and transportation business is sold directly to end customers and not through dealers, so there will likely be a learning curve for him as he develops the critical relationships with CAT dealers,” JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said. CFRA Research now recommends Caterpillar stock as a “sell”  as demand for new heavy machinery will likely remain low with a “lack of any positive catalysts on the horizon,” analyst Jim Corridore said in a note.  Under its restructuring plan Caterpillar has started to move part of its mining operations from South Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Tucson, Arizona. The company said in August it was considering options, including a sale, for a portion of its underground mining equipment business. One challenge Umpleby faces is a glut of used mining machines available for rent or lease that has hit Caterpillar’s new mining equipment sales. Additionally, construction equipment sales have suffered as weak crude prices sapped building demand in oil-rich countries.

570,CAT,"REFILE-UPDATE 4-Caterpillar CEO to retire, successor a company veteran","CHICAGO (Reuters) - (This version of the Oct. 17 story corrects spelling of Oberhelman in paragraph 2 and Umpleby in paragraph 5) Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) insider Jim Umpleby will become chief executive of the heavy equipment maker on Jan. 1, faced with the challenge of reversing a multiyear sales decline triggered by the global commodities slump. He replaces Doug Oberhelman, who will retire as CEO on Dec. 31 but stay on as executive board chairman until March 31, the company said on Monday. Caterpillar shares were down about 0.58 percent to $87.20. Under Oberhelman the company recorded record high revenue in 2012, two years after he became CEO. However, a decline in metals and oil prices hit the company hard and its sales have fallen since 2013.   A 35-year company veteran, Umpleby must grapple with Caterpillar’s sober outlook. In July, the company said it expects no upturn this year in the mining, oil and gas and transportation industries as commodity prices have apparently stabilized at low levels. To cut costs, the company has shed nearly 14,000 employees since 2015 and more layoffs are planned. Oberhelman said on Monday the future is bright partly because of Caterpillar’s lean and agile manufacturing and industry-leading digital capabilities. Umpleby is currently group president for energy and transportation, which makes equipment for the oil, gas, power generation and rail industries.   “It is worth noting that much of the energy and transportation business is sold directly to end customers and not through dealers, so there will likely be a learning curve for him as he develops the critical relationships with CAT dealers,” JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said. CFRA Research now recommends Caterpillar stock as a “sell”  as demand for new heavy machinery will likely remain low with a “lack of any positive catalysts on the horizon,” analyst Jim Corridore said in a note.  Under its restructuring plan Caterpillar has started to move part of its mining operations from South Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Tucson, Arizona. The company said in August it was considering options, including a sale, for a portion of its underground mining equipment business. One challenge Umpleby faces is a glut of used mining machines available for rent or lease that has hit Caterpillar’s new mining equipment sales. Additionally, construction equipment sales have suffered as weak crude prices sapped building demand in oil-rich countries. When Oberhelman retires as the board executive chairman, board member Dave Calhoun will become non-executive chairman, Caterpillar said. Umpleby will also join the board.

571,CAT,"Caterpillar sees little change into 2017, cuts sales outlook","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) has had a slight increase in aftermarket equipment part sales and dealer quotes to rebuild large mining trucks in recent months, but not enough to call it a sales recovery, company executives said on Tuesday.  The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker  posted a third-quarter profit of $283 million, or 48 cents per share, down from a revised $559 million, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding restructuring costs, earnings per share came to 85 cents, exceeding analysts’ estimates of 76 cents.  “Really this is the first time in a long time, that’s  happened. We have not had big numbers, but a little increase,” Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson said in a telephone interview.   While the slight increase in part sales and rebuild quotes hint at a change in customer sentiment, the machinery manufacturer gave an overall downbeat forecast when it reported a lower third-quarter profit.  Revenue fell to $9.2 billion from about $11 billion. Analysts had expected $9.8 billion.  Shares of Caterpillar were down 1.7 percent at $84.53.  Caterpillar said demand for new heavy machinery has suffered because of global economic weakness and an abundance of used equipment. “When demand goes down, dealers want to hold onto less. So that has put some downward pressure on our sales (to dealers),”  Caterpillar Vice President of finance Mike DeWalt said in a telephone interview. The company also cut its full-year revenue outlook for the second time while increasing its estimate of 2016 restructuring costs. The company estimated 2016 restructuring costs at $800 million, compared with a previous forecast of $700 million. So far, it has reduced its global full-time and flexible workforce by 14,100 to 108,800 employees as part of the restructuring plan, which runs through 2018. The company said it expected construction-related equipment sales for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 to be lower than  previously anticipated.  “Many of our businesses, including mining, oil and gas, rail and construction, are currently operating well below historical replacement demand levels in many parts of the world,” Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said in a statement.  Caterpillar forecast 2016 profit at $3.25 per share, excluding restructuring costs. Analysts were expecting $3.50.   The company said it expected full-year revenue of about $39 billion, down from a prior outlook of $40.0 billion to $40.5 billion. Last week, Caterpillar said Jim Umpleby, who heads its energy and transportation division, would replace Oberhelman as CEO on Jan. 1.

Three-month rolling retail sales ending in September and August were down 17 percent and 18 percent respectively. A year ago three-month sales ended in October were down 16 percent.  While the retail sales decline rate slowed in both the North American and Europe/Africa/Middle Eastern regions, the Asia/Pacific region saw some growth.  Total retail sales in Caterpillar’s Asia/Pacific region were up 12 percent, boosted by construction machinery sales, resulting in the third consecutive month of sales growth in the region.

579,CAT,UPDATE 3-Caterpillar sees '17 profit below expectations as restructuring continues,"(Adds company comments, analyst quote) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc, the world’s largest construction and equipment maker, forecast 2017 profit sharply below analysts’ estimates, hurt by sluggish demand in the construction and energy industries. Peoria, Illinois,-based Caterpillar has already slashed its workforce by more than 16,000 to cope with a slumping economy and said it would take another $500 million in restructuring costs in 2017 at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is calling on manufacturers to expand employment. Hopes for a rebound in manufacturing have fueled a 15 percent rally in Caterpillar’s stock since Trump’s election, even as the company has sought to temper market expectations. Caterpillar’s shares were down $1.00 at $97.15 at 11:19 a.m. CST (1719 GMT) after peaking at $98.98, the highest since Dec. 5, 2014, early in the session. Caterpillar lowered the midpoint of its 2017 revenue outlook by $500 million to $37.5 billion, citing the strong U.S. dollar. It forecast adjusted 2017 earnings per share of $2.90, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $3.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The adjusted outlook excludes 60 cents of restructuring charges. “The overall economic environment remains challenging,” Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said in a statement on Thursday. Umpleby said on a conference call with analysts that he was encouraged by bipartisan talks regarding a new U.S. infrastructure bill as well as discussions about tax reform under a Trump administration. Caterpillar cut 12,300 jobs in 2016, including 7,700 in the United States. It said it was considering closing two more major production facilities, including one in Aurora, Illinois. The company said a glut of used construction equipment in North America would hamper 2017 sales, while sales in Africa and the Middle East would remain soft due to the regions’ reliance on oil revenue. Low traffic volume in its rail business and a significant number of idle locomotives were weighing on its transportation business, while weakness in shipbuilding would hurt marine-related sales. The company’s fourth-quarter loss ballooned to $1.17 billion, or $2.00 per share, from $94 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted fourth-quarter profit of 83 cents per share, which excludes $1.019 billion in restructuring costs and other charges, topped analysts’ average estimate of 66 cents. Fourth-quarter net sales fell 13.2 percent to $9.57 billion. “CAT revenues and operating losses disappoint, but we are comforted in the massive savings provided by restructuring initiatives,” Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten said in note.

584,CAT,Caterpillar to move global headquarters to Chicago area,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) will move its global headquarters to the Chicago area from its longtime home in central Illinois this year, the company said on Tuesday, as it continues to grapple with weak demand for its earth-moving equipment. The company’s decision to move its executive suite comes at a time of record-breaking crime in Chicago and a gloomy financial outlook both for the city and the state.  At the same time, Chicago has drawn in big companies such as Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N), one of the world’s largest agricultural trading houses, formerly of Decatur, Illinois, and food maker ConAgra Brands Inc (CAG.N), formerly of Omaha, that see an address in the largest city between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts as a plus for recruiting.  Caterpillar, currently based in Peoria, Illinois, cited recruiting and access to a global transportation hub as factors in the decision to move about 300 senior executives and staff to Chicago, starting this year. “They’ll be moving basically what I call the seventh floor of downtown - the senior executives and some HR people,” said Lex Akers, dean of the Caterpillar College of Engineering and Technology at Bradley University in Peoria, which is named after the company. The world’s largest construction and equipment maker did not specify the exact location of its new headquarters. It will not build a previously announced headquarters complex in Peoria, where the company was founded in 1925.   The decision marks a significant step away from the past by Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby, who took over on Jan. 1. He faces the challenge of reversing a multiyear sales decline triggered by the global commodities slump. Eli Lustgarten, senior vice president for Longbow Research, said the move to the Chicago area represents “new management looking for greater efficiency in dealing with its global business.” The company cut 12,300 jobs in 2016, including 7,700 in the United States. It is also considering closing two major production facilities, including one in Aurora, Illinois. Shares were down 1.5 percent at $95.30 in afternoon trading. Spokesmen for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel declined to address whether local tax incentives helped facilitate Caterpillar’s move.  Republican Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner’s administration had no involvement in the move and only learned of it after the company’s announcement, an administration source said. Typically, state tax credits are not offered to companies wishing to relocate if they do not commit to adding new jobs.

591,CAT,UPDATE 2-Trump to seek jobs advice from firms that offshore U.S. work,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has vowed to stop U.S. manufacturing from disappearing overseas, will seek job-creation advice on Thursday from at least five companies that are laying off thousands of workers as they shift production abroad. Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), Dana Inc (DAN.N), 3M Co (MMM.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N), are offshoring work to Mexico, China, India and other countries, according to a Reuters review of U.S. Labor Department records.  Executives from the five companies are among a group of business leaders due to meet with Trump on Thursday to discuss how to help the president deliver on his promise to increase factory employment, according to the White House. About 2,300 U.S. workers at these five companies stand to  lose their jobs within the next two years as a result of offshoring, according to the Labor Department’s Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which provides retraining benefits to workers displaced by global trade. Reuters obtained the information through a Freedom of Information Act request.  The companies confirmed the planned job cuts to Reuters. It is not clear whether the other 19 executives due to meet with Trump on Thursday are currently offshoring work, as the TAA program does not cover all workers who lose their jobs due to global trade. The lost jobs amount to a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers employed by those involved in the meeting. General Electric, for example, employs 125,000 U.S. workers, financial filings show. On the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has painted globalization as a zero-sum game that has enriched low-wage countries while leaving the United States littered with abandoned factories and underemployed workers, and he has threatened to tax companies that offshore U.S. jobs. The experience of companies on Trump’s task force, however, shows the reality is more complex in a world where they are serving customers across the globe. Several said they were creating many new U.S. factory jobs even as they move work to other countries.  It’s not clear whether Trump will opt for the carrot or the stick. Trump plans to meet business leaders to hear their reasons for “why they’re going offshore,” said a White House aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Blue-collar workers who share Trump’s skepticism of global trade say they will be watching closely to see if he will try to save their jobs.    “I don’t think he’s a typical politician, so there is hope alive for middle-class families that he will do something,” said Scott Schmidt, one of 222 workers at a GE engine plant in Waukesha, Wisconsin who are due to lose their jobs later this year when the company shifts production to Canada.  General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt is among those due to meet with Trump on Thursday. GE says it is closing its Waukesha plant because Congress has hobbled the U.S. Export-Import Bank’s ability to finance large export orders while most other industrialized nations still offer such financial support. The company says it laid off 225 workers last year at a Houston factory for the same reason, shifting production to France, the United Kingdom and Hungary.     GE says it is also closing an Ohio factory and laying off 180 workers because consumers are buying fewer of the florescent and incandescent light bulbs they make there. What production remains will be handled by a factory in Hungary. The U.S. economy lost 6 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, roughly one-third of its total, in part due to offshoring, but the sector has added 900,000 jobs since then, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Multinational companies say labor costs now are only one factor they consider when deciding where to manufacture. An auto maker, for example, may decide to build a particular model in the country where sales are strongest, prompting parts suppliers to set up there as well so they can turn around orders quickly.  The offshoring picture is also more complex than official statistics indicate as a shuttered factory in the United States does not always mean a new factory abroad. When auto-parts maker Dana Corp closes a factory later this year in Glasgow, Kentucky that is operating at 20 percent of capacity, one of its plants in Ohio will pick up the work, along with other factories in Mexico, India and China. Dana CEO James Kamsickas is among those scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday. The company plans to hire nearly 700 U.S. workers over the next three years as it expands factories in four U.S. states, spokesman Jeff Cole said.     That is little comfort to the 223 people in Kentucky who will lose their jobs.    “It seems like all these CEOs and companies have turned their backs on the American worker,” said Dana employee Tim Wells, one of those who will be laid off. The group also includes United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes, who took heat from Trump last year for planning to move jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico. The company struck a deal with the incoming president in November to preserve roughly 700 jobs in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks. United Technologies says it still plans to lay off 786 workers at a separate Indiana plant and move production to Mexico this year. The company is also moving work from a facility in Arden Hills, Minnesota, resulting in a loss of 72 jobs. Most of that work is staying in the United States but some is moving to Poland, spokeswoman Bethany Sherman said, and some of the affected workers will be offered positions elsewhere. The company is adding more than 1,000 new jobs in the United States, Sherman said. Other participants include Caterpillar Chairman Doug Oberhelman, who oversees a company that is laying off 712 workers in the American South and Midwest and moving the work to China, Mexico, Italy, France and Germany as it weathers the largest sales slump in its history. A Caterpillar spokesman said it is simultaneously creating 1,300 new manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the United States.  Also due to participate is Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M, which is eliminating 130 jobs in suburban Cincinnati and moving production to Mexico. The company says it has added more than 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs over the last five years.

592,CAT,U.S. authorities raid Caterpillar's Illinois facilities,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Federal law enforcement officials conducting a criminal probe of heavy machinery manufacturer Caterpillar Inc searched three of its facilities on Thursday, prompting a sharp sell-off in the company’s stock. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney Office for the Central District of Illinois, Sharon Paul, confirmed that federal law enforcement officials conducted searches at locations in Peoria, East Peoria and Morton, Illinois, but did not say why agents raided the three facilities. Caterpillar, in a statement issued on Thursday afternoon, said it believed the search was part of an Internal Revenue Service investigation related to profits earned by a Swiss parts subsidiary, Caterpillar SARL, or CSARL. It said that “while the warrant is broadly drafted, we believe the execution of this search warrant is regarding, among other things, export filings that relate to the CSARL matter first disclosed in Caterpillar’s Form 10-K filed on February 17, 2015, and updated in Caterpillar’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 15, 2017.” Agencies involved in the search included the IRS’ Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s Office of Export Enforcement, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Office of Inspector General, Paul said. Officials at the agencies could not be reached for comment. Caterpillar shares fell 4.3 percent to close at $94.36 on the New York Stock Exchange after trading as low as $92.84. The apparent escalation of the government’s tax dispute with Caterpillar comes as the Trump administration and leaders in Congress have said they want to launch a broad overhaul of the corporate tax code, lowering rates and designing the system to encourage companies to keep jobs and profits within the United States. Caterpillar has also had a prominent place in the Trump administration’s effort to promote U.S. manufacturing. The company’s outgoing chief executive, Douglas Oberhelman, met with President Donald Trump at the White House last week. Caterpillar is fighting an Internal Revenue Service demand that the company pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for profits assigned to its Swiss parts distribution subsidiary, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That subsidiary was also the subject of a 2014 Senate committee report that concluded Caterpillar shifted billions in profits abroad and had $2.4 billion in taxes deferred or avoided from 2012. “As a result of those licensing and servicing agreements,  over the next thirteen years from 2000 to 2012, Caterpillar shifted to CSARL in Switzerland taxable income from its non-U.S. parts sales totaling more than $8 billion, and deferred or  avoided paying U.S. taxes totaling about $2.4 billion,” the report said. It said the arrangement resulted in Caterpillar paying an effective tax rate of only 4 percent to 6 percent. Caterpillar, in its 2016 annual report, said it is “vigorously contesting” the IRS demand. “We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines,” it stated. The Senate committee report also criticized Caterpillar’s accountants, PwC, saying that the firm’s roles as auditor and tax consultant represented a conflict of interest. PwC on Thursday said it had no comment. In testimony before the Senate in 2014, PwC partner Thomas Quinn said the firm believed that its “tax advice and Caterpillar’s tax positions were correct under applicable tax laws. In sum, PwC’s provision of tax services to Caterpillar as our audit client was entirely appropriate.” Caterpillar also disclosed in its annual report that it had received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois seeking documents and information related to the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, and the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, including Caterpillar SARL. Caterpillar said it is cooperating with the investigation and did not believe it would have a material impact on its finances. The facility in Morton, according to the company’s website, is responsible for receiving and shipping replacement parts to parts facilities and Caterpillar dealers worldwide. Caterpillar reported sales fell 18 percent in 2016 to $38.5 billion and since late 2015 it has shrunk its workforce by more than 16,000 employees and consolidated or closed 30 facilities.  Caterpillar cut 12,300 jobs in 2016, including 7,700 in the United States. It said it was considering closing two more major production facilities, including one in Aurora, Illinois, and also announced it was moving its corporate headquarters from Peoria to Chicago this year. Last week in Missouri, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence toured Fabick CAT, a family-owned company that is one of the largest U.S. distributors of Caterpillar equipment. “You are the strength in the American economy, and you’re going to lead an American comeback,” he told workers there. Pence said the Trump administration wants to simplify the U.S. tax code. “I’ll guarantee there isn’t anyone here who can make sense of America’s tax code, including me. There’s an old joke that says the tax code is about 10 times the size of the Bible but with none of the good news,” he said. “Our country’s tax system these days penalizes success. It makes it far too hard for hardworking people and small businesses to achieve the American Dream.”",3022017,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpillar-probe/u-s-authorities-raid-caterpillars-illinois-facilities-idUSL2N1GF1CH

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 112.58 points, or 0.53 percent, to end at 21,002.97, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 14.04 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,381.92 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 42.81 points, or 0.73 percent, to 5,861.22. The S&P; 500 is up 11.3 percent since the Nov. 8 election. Several Fed officials this week have stoked expectations of an interest rate hike this month as the economy strengthens. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is set to speak on Friday and could provide the strongest indication about a move in coming weeks. The Fed’s next policy-setting meeting is set for March 14-15. Traders have priced in about a 74-percent chance of a rate hike this month, up from roughly 30 percent at the start of the week, according to Thomson Reuters data. Kroger (KR.N) fell 4.3 percent after reporting a surprise decline in fourth-quarter same-store sales as competition intensified in the U.S. grocery industry.

602,CAT,U.S. authorities raid Caterpillar's Illinois facilities,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Federal law enforcement officials conducting a criminal probe of heavy machinery manufacturer Caterpillar Inc searched three of its facilities on Thursday, prompting a sharp sell-off in the company’s stock. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney Office for the Central District of Illinois, Sharon Paul, confirmed that federal law enforcement officials conducted searches at locations in Peoria, East Peoria and Morton, Illinois, but did not say why agents raided the three facilities. Caterpillar, in a statement issued on Thursday afternoon, said it believed the search was part of an Internal Revenue Service investigation related to profits earned by a Swiss parts subsidiary, Caterpillar SARL, or CSARL.  It said that “while the warrant is broadly drafted, we believe the execution of this search warrant is regarding, among other things, export filings that relate to the CSARL matter first disclosed in Caterpillar’s Form 10-K filed on February 17, 2015, and updated in Caterpillar’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 15, 2017.” Agencies involved in the search included the IRS’ Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s Office of Export Enforcement, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Office of Inspector General, Paul said. Officials at the agencies could not be reached for comment. Caterpillar shares fell 4.3 percent to close at $94.36 on the New York Stock Exchange after trading as low as $92.84.  The apparent escalation of the government’s tax dispute with Caterpillar comes as the Trump administration and leaders in Congress have said they want to launch a broad overhaul of the corporate tax code, lowering rates and designing the system to encourage companies to keep jobs and profits within the United States.  Caterpillar has also had a prominent place in the Trump administration’s effort to promote U.S. manufacturing. The company’s outgoing chief executive, Douglas Oberhelman, met with President Donald Trump at the White House last week. Caterpillar is fighting an Internal Revenue Service demand that the company pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for profits assigned to its Swiss parts distribution subsidiary, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That subsidiary was also the subject of a 2014 Senate committee report that concluded Caterpillar shifted billions in profits abroad and had $2.4 billion in taxes deferred or avoided from 2012. “As a result of those licensing and servicing agreements,  over the next thirteen years from 2000 to 2012, Caterpillar shifted to CSARL in Switzerland taxable income from its non-U.S. parts sales totaling more than $8 billion, and deferred or  avoided paying U.S. taxes totaling about $2.4 billion,” the report said.  It said the arrangement resulted in Caterpillar paying an effective tax rate of only 4 percent to 6 percent. Caterpillar, in its 2016 annual report, said it is “vigorously contesting” the IRS demand. “We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines,” it stated. The Senate committee report also criticized Caterpillar’s accountants, PwC, saying that the firm’s roles as auditor and tax consultant represented a conflict of interest. PwC on Thursday said it had no comment.  In testimony before the Senate in 2014, PwC partner Thomas Quinn said the firm believed that its “tax advice and Caterpillar’s tax positions were correct under applicable tax laws. In sum, PwC’s provision of tax services to Caterpillar as our audit client was entirely appropriate.” Caterpillar also disclosed in its annual report that it had received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois seeking documents and information related to the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, and the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, including Caterpillar SARL. Caterpillar said it is cooperating with the investigation and did not believe it would have a material impact on its finances. The facility in Morton, according to the company’s website, is responsible for receiving and shipping replacement parts to parts facilities and Caterpillar dealers worldwide.       Caterpillar reported sales fell 18 percent in 2016 to $38.5 billion and since late 2015 it has shrunk its workforce by more than 16,000 employees and consolidated or closed 30 facilities.  Caterpillar cut 12,300 jobs in 2016, including 7,700 in the United States.  It said it was considering closing two more major production facilities, including one in Aurora, Illinois, and also announced it was moving its corporate headquarters from Peoria to Chicago this year. Last week in Missouri, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence toured Fabick CAT, a family-owned company that is one of the largest U.S. distributors of Caterpillar equipment. “You are the strength in the American economy, and you’re going to lead an American comeback,” he told workers there.  Pence said the Trump administration wants to simplify the U.S. tax code. “I’ll guarantee there isn’t anyone here who can make sense of America’s tax code, including me. There’s an old joke that says the tax code is about 10 times the size of the Bible but with none of the good news,” he said. “Our country’s tax system these days penalizes success. It makes it far too hard for hardworking people and small businesses to achieve the American Dream.” ",3032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-probe/u-s-authorities-raid-caterpillars-illinois-facilities-idUSKBN1692GI
603,CAT,Factbox: Findings of Senate tax probe a focus of IRS search at Caterpillar,"(Reuters) - After U.S. authorities raided Caterpillar Inc’s Peoria, Illinois, headquarters as part of a criminal investigation Thursday, the company stated the search was part of an Internal Revenue Service investigation related to profit earned by a parts subsidiary based in Switzerland.  A Senate subcommittee on investigations in 2014 claimed that Caterpillar deferred or avoided paying $2.4 billion in U.S. taxes between 2000 and 2012 by shifting more than $8 billion of parts sales to Switzerland.  Caterpillar is contesting an IRS proposal to levy taxes and penalties of approximately $2 billion arising from its assignment of profit to the Swiss operation. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which devised the plan while also serving as Caterpillar’s auditor, declined comment.  The Senate subcommittee had the following specific findings:  	- In 1999, Caterpillar adopted a strategy to use a unit in Switzerland as the place it recorded most of the profit from its lucrative business selling Caterpillar-branded replacement parts to non-U.S. customers.  - Caterpillar had earlier negotiated with Swiss authorities to pay an effective tax rate of only 4 percent to 6 percent on profits earned in the country. - Caterpillar had no parts warehouses in Switzerland, but 85 percent or more of profits from Caterpillar’s parts sales outside the United States were recorded as coming from the Swiss unit, Caterpillar SARL. - By 2008, Caterpillar had shifted 45 percent of global revenues and 43 percent of its profits to the Swiss operation, which employed less than one-half of 1 percent of Caterpillar’s 118,500 employees worldwide.  - Caterpillar built a new inventory control system that “served as a second set of inventory books” for Swiss-owned parts held in the United States. But all the parts were intermixed, none bore separate ownership labels, and Caterpillar employees could not distinguish the Swiss-owned parts in any way. - PricewaterhouseCoopers was paid $55 million by Caterpillar for devising the Swiss tax plan. The Senate committee said PricewaterhouseCoopers “raised significant conflict of interest concerns” by also serving as Caterpillar’s auditor during the time in question.  - PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants told Caterpillar the new system was designed to “migrate profits away from CAT Inc to low-tax marketing companies. … We are effectively more than doubling the profit on parts.” - As a result of the plan, Caterpillar experienced “a cash buildup in Geneva,” a company report showed. By 2002, Caterpillar needed to move as much as $70 million a year back to the United State’s to meet the company’s U.S. cash requirements. - In 2008, Caterpillar’s global tax strategy manager raised questions about whether the Swiss unit did enough substantive business in the country to qualify for taxation outside the United States. He called the situation “the pink elephant issue worth a billion dollars on the balance sheet.” ",3032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-caterpillar-probe-history/factbox-findings-of-senate-tax-probe-a-focus-of-irs-search-at-caterpillar-idUSKBN16A06L
604,CAT,Caterpillar shares rise as import practices scrutinized,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s (CAT.N) shares gained on Friday, the day after U.S. law enforcement officials raided three of the company’s Illinois facilities, as the Trump administration promised stricter scrutiny of multinationals’ import and export practices. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said on Friday that the raids at the heavy equipment manufacturer were part of an ongoing probe.  “The Commerce Department has enforcement responsibilities both on imports and on exports, so it’s an important part of our function,” Ross said on CNBC. “We’re going to be even stricter on enforcement, particularly on inbound goods that shouldn’t be.” One of the locations raided, in Morton, Illinois, is the central point for receiving and shipping after-market parts worldwide, according to Caterpillar’s website.  The company's shares, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, were up 0.8 percent at $95.12 in morning trading. They had fallen 4.3 percent on Thursday, wiping out about $2.5 billion of market value and dragging on U.S. equities. Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said in a statement to employees seen by newspaper Peoria Star that management did not have enough information to provide a full understanding of the authorities’ intent.  “This morning, a number of our colleagues in the Peoria area were surprised when federal authorities arrived to execute a search warrant,” the Thursday statement said. “I’m sorry that we had to experience this today.”  The scrutiny of the huge multinational company’s tax practices is an early test of Umpleby, who took over as CEO at the start of the year.  In January, Caterpillar said it would move about 300 senior executives and staff to Chicago, starting this year. The company cited recruiting and access to global transportation as factors in the decision. The apparent escalation of the government’s tax dispute with Caterpillar comes amid the Trump administration’s promise to reform corporate taxes and design a system that encourages companies to keep jobs and profits within the United States.  Caterpillar said it believed the search was part of an Internal Revenue Service investigation of profits earned by Swiss parts subsidiary Caterpillar SARL, or CSARL.

Caterpillar is contesting an Internal Revenue Service demand that it pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for profits assigned to the subsidiary between 2007 and 2012. Caterpillar’s current exposure could rise to $3 billion since the company has continued to file tax returns on the same basis, Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said. “We suspect the core of the matter is not ‘new’ news, but rather that it relates to the risk already disclosed in 2014-16,” said Schoonmaker, who lowered his fair value estimate on the stock to $64 from $67.

The company said it will transition its large wheel loaders and compactors to its plant in Decatur, Illinois, and medium wheel loaders to North Little Rock, Arkansas. “Out of about 800 production positions, about 500 positions would likely be added to Decatur and about 150 positions would be added in North Little Rock,” Caterpillar spokeswoman Lisa Miller told Reuters. The company has already slashed its workforce by more than 16,000 to cope with a slumping economy and had said it would take another $500 million in restructuring costs in 2017. Caterpillar said, in January, that it was considering closing two major production facilities, including the one in Aurora, Illinois, where it makes large-wheel loaders and compactors.    The plant closure is expected to be completed by the end of 2018, Caterpillar said in a statement. The company in January forecast 2017 profit sharply below analysts’ estimates, hurt by sluggish demand in the construction and energy industries.  Caterpillar had about 95,400 full-time employees of whom 54,500 persons were located outside the United States as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.

619,CAT,"Earnings, tax announcement hopes boost equities","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets rallied for a second straight day on Tuesday, as solid U.S. earnings, speculation about U.S. tax reform and reduced chances of a U.S. government shutdown this weekend boosted investor optimism. Wall Street gained as concerns about France’s election waned and investors cheered earnings from Dow components such as McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), up 5.6 percent, and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), up 7.9 percent. The Nasdaq Composite index closed above the 6,000 mark for the first time. “It’s earnings coming from the Dow companies, the largest of the large, in particular Caterpillar, really driving on the theme that U.S. corporate profitability is on track to really provide some significant year-over-year earnings growth,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. “That in and of itself is a fantastic story.”  Markets also built on the boost from the prior session in the wake of the first round of the French election, with recent opinion polls showing centrist Emmanuel Macron, who won with a comfortable lead over far-right, anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen, winning a May 7 run-off vote. Safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen retreated, while the yield gap between French and German short-term government bonds, a closely watched measure of political risk in the euro zone, hit its lowest in almost three months. DE2FR2=RR. Investor focus shifted to corporate earnings and U.S. President Donald Trump’s promise to announce “a big tax reform and tax reduction” on Wednesday. The threat of a U.S. government shutdown this weekend appeared to recede on Tuesday after Trump backed away from a demand that Congress include funding for his planned border wall with Mexico in a spending bill. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s plan will include a sharp cut in the top tax rate on pass-through businesses, including many small business partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 15 percent from 39.6 percent.

620,CAT,"US STOCKS-Nasdaq tops 6,000 as earnings boost Wall St; U.S. tax code eyed","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite hit a record high on Tuesday, while the Dow and S&P; 500 brushed against recent peaks as strong earnings underscored the health of corporate America. Caterpillar (CAT.N) closed up 7.9 percent at $104.42 after earlier hitting a multi-year high of $104.89 and McDonald’s (MCD.N) jumped 5.6 percent to $141.70, both after beating profit estimates. “It’s earnings coming from the Dow companies, the largest of the large, in particular Caterpillar, really driving on the theme that U.S. corporate profitability is on track to provide some significant year-over-year earnings growth. That in and of itself is a fantastic story,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. Overall profits of S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 11.4 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Nasdaq hit a record level of 6,036.02, breaching 6,000 for the first time, powered by gains in index heavyweights Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). The index first touched the 5,000 mark on March 2000 as tech stocks bubbled before tumbling nearly 80 percent through October 2002. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 232.23 points, or 1.12 percent, to 20,996.12, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 14.46 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,388.61 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 41.67 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,025.49. The Russell 2000  also hit an intraday record high. The S&P; 500 touched its day’s high after the Wall Street Journal reported U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax proposal, expected on Wednesday, would include a slash to 15 percent from 39.6 percent on many owner-operated companies. “(Treasury Secretary Steven) Mnuchin has to have a better-articulated answer to what the tax code changes are in a meaningful way,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said cutting taxes on partnerships and owner-operated businesses would be a strong boost to investing. Tuesday’s gains built on a day-earlier rally, which was driven by the victory of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the French presidential election. Polls showed Macron, the market’s favorite, was likely to beat his far-right rival Marine Le Pen in a deciding vote on May 7. About 7.31 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.20-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

622,CAT,Caterpillar's profit trounces estimates; shares jump,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s (CAT.N) quarterly profit crushed estimates and the company raised its sales forecast, encouraged by an improvement in its end-markets, sending its shares to their highest in more than three years. The strong outlook signaled a rebound in Caterpillar’s business, which has been battered in the past few years by a slump in oil and commodity prices as well as weakness in China and other emerging markets. “There are encouraging signs,” Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said in a statement, adding that the company was benefiting from its cost-cutting measures. To cope with the downturn, the company has cut costs, shuttered factories and reduced its workforce. Last year itself, Caterpillar cut more than 12,000 jobs. The company’s stock was up 7 percent at $103.57 in afternoon trading on Tuesday, making it the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Caterpillar’s total sales and revenue rose 3.8 percent to $9.82 billion in the first quarter, the first increase in more than two years. The increase was mainly due to an 11 percent rise in sales from the Asia-Pacific region, its third-biggest market, which is benefiting from increased government spending on infrastructure and residential construction. However, sales in North America and the Europe, Africa and Middle East region, its two biggest markets, were largely flat. Analysts cautioned that Caterpillar was not out of the woods yet despite posting stellar first-quarter results. “With the commodity recovery faltering and with Chinese support for its property and infrastructure potentially fading, the sustainability of these growth drivers may be at risk,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann wrote in a note to clients. The results come a day after Caterpillar reported its first three-month growth in global machine sales in more than four years, driven by an improvement in the Asia-Pacific region. The resource industries business, which makes mining equipment, was a bright spot, while sales growth in the construction industries business, the company’s biggest, was held back by a glut of used equipment in the North American market. But orders in the unit were “very strong” in the region, contributing to an increase in the backlog at the end of the first quarter, CFO Bradley Halverson said in a post-earnings call. “We believe business optimism, which may be contributing to elevated quoting and ordering activity in North America, is partially a reflection of the benefits of pro-business policy in regards to infrastructure and tax reform,” Halverson said. President Donald Trump has proposed massive spending on infrastructure as well as simpler tax regulations for companies. Caterpillar said it now expects 2017 adjusted earnings of $3.75 per share, up from the $2.90 it had previously forecast. It forecast sales and revenue of $38 billion-$41 billion, up from $36 billion-$39 billion. Analysts on average were expecting 2017 earnings of $3.26 per share, on revenue $38.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding restructuring costs, Caterpillar earned $1.28 per share, compared the average analyst estimate of 62 cents per share.

While Caterpillar has been boosted by a rebound in commodities prices that preceded Trump’s election victory in November, the company is seeing increased inquiries from U.S. clients heartened by “pro-business policy in regards to infrastructure and tax reform,” it said on its earnings call. Caterpillar was hard-hit by the commodities decline that began in the summer of 2014. The manufacturer had made a big bet on mining, paying $8.6 billion including debt for Bucyrus International. Declines in natural gas prices caused power companies to switch from oil to gas, crushing demand for the mining machines that were a key reason for the Bucyrus deal. Now mining is on the rebound and Caterpillar, which sold 70 mining trucks last year, could sell twice as many this year, Barron’s said, citing the most recent earnings call. Despite the positive results, Wall Street analysts remain conservative about Caterpillar’s earnings prospects, Barron’s said. But even if earnings roughly double to $8 per share as predicted by 2020, shares, which trade at 26 times estimated 2017 profit, would be at 13 times earnings.

637,CAT,"Caterpillar bulldozes expectations, raises 2017 forecast again","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s (CAT.N) results smashed expectations and the company raised its full-year forecast for the second time, underscoring strength across its businesses and a steady recovery in demand from China. Shares of the world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker rose as much as 5.4 percent on Tuesday to touch a more than five-year high. Caterpillar’s strong results are the clearest indication yet that the company is turning a corner after weak commodity prices and global economic uncertainty hit demand for its iconic yellow earth-moving equipment in the past few years. JPMorgan Securities analyst Ann Duignan called the results a solid “beat and raise” even as expectations were high coming into the quarter. Sales rose at all three of the company’s main businesses, with the resource industries unit, which makes mining equipment, reporting the biggest jump compared with a year earlier. While acknowledging that markets remain challenged, Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said “construction in China and gas compression in North America were highlights in the quarter.” Total sales rose 9.6 percent to $11.33 billion and handily beat analysts’ average estimate of $10.93 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales from Asia Pacific, Caterpillar’s third-biggest market, jumped 23 percent in the quarter, boosted by an increase in construction equipment sales in China. Demand for construction equipment in China is gaining momentum after bottoming out last year, driven by a Beijing-backed infrastructure push, a housing boom and increased investment linked to China’s modern-day “Silk Road”. Sales in North America, Caterpillar’s biggest market, were up 7 percent, largely due to improving demand from the mining and energy industries as commodity prices increase. Most of the demand in the oil and gas business came as rigs got back to work, but Caterpillar cautioned that prices would need to stabilize at “these higher levels” to drive long-term demand for equipment. The number of operational rigs in North America has more than doubled from its lows last year. But oilfield services providers such as Halliburton Co (HAL.N) have warned that growth in rig count was showing signs of plateauing.    Caterpillar said it now expects 2017 adjusted earnings of about $5 per share, up from the $3.75 it had previously forecast. The company lifted its full-year sales and revenue forecast to a range of $42 billion to $44 billion, from its previous forecast of $38 billion to $41 billion. Net income rose about 46 percent to $802 million. Excluding items, Caterpillar earned $1.49 per share, handsomely beating the average estimate of $1.26 per share. Caterpillar's shares were up 5.1 percent at $113.70. Up to Monday's close the stock had gained 16.6 percent this year, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's .DJI 9 percent rise.

638,CAT,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 jumps to record high on busy earnings day,"* Caterpillar, McDonald’s rise after well-received results * Nasdaq hits record, but Alphabet’s decline limits gains * Financials surge amid Citigroup forecast, rising yields * Eli Lilly, 3M fall after quarterly reports * Indexes up: Dow 0.6 pct, S&P; 0.41 pct, Nasdaq 0.18 pct (Updates to late afternoon) By Lewis Krauskopf July 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street extended its record-setting run on Tuesday, with major indexes posting gains on a heavy day of corporate earnings that included well-received reports from McDonald’s and Caterpillar. The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs, although the Nasdaq’s gains were crimped by declines in Google parent Alphabet after its results. Alphabet shares were down 2.4 percent. Shares of McDonald’s rose 5.2 percent, after the world’s largest fast-food chain by revenue posted its biggest jump in global sales at established restaurants in five years. Caterpillar shares surged 5.5 percent after the heavy equipment maker raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. Those stocks spurred the Dow industrials, leaving the Dow close to record territory. Data showing a jump in U.S. consumer confidence amid optimism over the labor market added to the bullish sentiment. “It feels like people are maybe getting a little more optimistic that things are, if not improving dramatically, then at least holding pretty steady in the economy and that would be pretty good for stocks,” said William Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 128.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 21,641.25, the S&P; 500 gained 10.1 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,480.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.35 points, or 0.18 percent, to 6,422.16. Sectors that perform better during positive economic cycles led the way, with energy, materials and financials all rising at least 1 percent. Sharp gains in oil prices supported energy shares. Financials were boosted by a bullish profit forecast from Citigroup, while a slightly steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve also added to positive tone for the interest-rate sensitive group. The future path of interest rates will be in focus on Wednesday with the expected statement from the Federal Reserve. Investors were also watching a U.S. Senate vote on healthcare legislation for its implications for President Donald Trump’s planned domestic agenda including tax cuts, which has helped support the stock market. The market’s run to record highs, including a 10.8 percent rise for the S&P; 500 in 2017, has left equities relatively expensive and investors counting on earnings to justify the valuations. The S&P; 500 is trading around 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, well above their long-term average of 15 times. With more than one-fourth of the S&P; 500 having reported results, earnings are now expected to have climbed 9.1 percent in the second quarter, up from a projection of an 8-percent rise at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Not all earnings news was positive, as 3M Co shares dropped 5.0 percent after the diversified manufacturer’s report. Eli Lilly shares dropped 3.6 percent after the drugmaker outlined a lengthy delay for its experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug. Freeport-McMoRan Inc shares jumped 14.8 percent, as soaring metal prices and progress in a permit dispute with Indonesia buoyed the world’s biggest publicly traded copper miner. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Shares of McDonald’s rose 3.5 percent and hit an all-time high after the fast-food giant posted the biggest rise in sales at established restaurants globally in five years. Caterpillar was up 4.7 percent, touching a more than five-year high, after the company raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. “It looks like earnings are coming in better than expected and that’s giving the market a jump this morning,” said Ken Moraif, senior adviser at Money Matters, a wealth management and investment firm. However, Alphabet fell 3.3 percent, after the tech giant warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices. The S&P; tech index has been the best performing sector this year, but there have been concerns about stretched valuations, putting earnings from big tech companies in the spotlight. The sector fell 0.3 percent on Tuesday, leading the decliners. Amazon and Facebook, part of the high-flying “FANG” stocks, report results later this week, while Apple is due to report next week. “My concern is that it seems like these companies can do no wrong and when you have so much concentrated on such a small group, eventually these stock prices are going to become unrealistic,” Moraif said. “If the rest of the market isn’t there to support them, it could impact the sector in a big way.” Earnings are expected to have climbed 8.8 percent in the second quarter, compared with an 8 percent rise estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 10:50 a.m. ET (1450 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 105.3 points, or 0.49 percent, at 21,618.47.

Advanced Micro Devices, AT&T;, Chipotle and Chubb are among the major companies that report after the closing bell. “Investors will have a lot to chew on today as earnings results include at least 12 major companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. “We look for another mixed session as the FOMC meeting begins and the health care vote comes into play.” Dow e-minis were up 96 points, or 0.45 percent, with 23,225 contracts changing hands at 8:26 a.m. ET (1226 GMT).

Markets reacted to that headline, said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut, but he said the poll “obviously doesn’t mean anything.” Also dampening the market’s mood late in the session, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake criticized Trump’s style of governing and announced he would not run for re-election next year, highlighting tensions between the president and fellow Republicans.

662,CAT,Caterpillar smashes market estimates as North America sales rebound,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) blew past Wall Street’s profit and revenue estimates for the third quarter, driven by surprisingly strong demand for its construction equipment in North America and robust sales in China. The company’s shares rose as much as 7 percent to a record high of $140.44, helping push the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-time high. The bellwether for the industrial sector posted strong growth across its key businesses, signaling a resurgence in its construction, energy and mining markets. The company also raised its full-year forecasts for sales and earnings, expecting revenue in its construction business to surge about 20 percent, and mining business to jump 30 percent. “Caterpillar continues to post results that far outpace expectations,” said Stifel analyst Stanley Elliott, adding that the recovery in the company’s business now seemed to be in full swing. Profit beat expectations for the sixth straight quarter even after analysts had raised their estimates for July-September period by nearly 30 percent in the past three months. Revenue beat estimates for the third straight quarter. The construction industry in North America is turning around after years of slow demand, fueled by a steady housing recovery, an improving labor market and higher spending by oil and gas companies. Sales in North America, Caterpillar’s biggest market, jumped 27 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30. Construction revenue in the region rose 31 percent, building upon a 3 percent rise in the second quarter after eight quarters of declines. Sales in Asia-Pacific jumped 57 percent, their seventh quarter of growth, helped by construction demand in China. While China has been the bright spot for Caterpillar, the pace of growth in the country’s property sector cooled in the third quarter, potentially hurting demand for the company’s iconic yellow earth-moving equipment in the near future. Excluding restructuring costs, Caterpillar earned $1.95 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.27 per shares, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose to $11.41 billion, ahead of market estimates of $10.65 billion. The company said it now expects 2017 sales and revenue of $44 billion, up from its previous forecast of $42 billion to $44 billion. It expects adjusted earnings of $6.25 per share, up from the $5.00. The company is coming out of a trough and will have to show earnings of $10 per share annually for any further stock price appreciation, Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said. “So far, however, it’s fair to say that CAT is providing plenty of reason to keep that dream alive.” Caterpillar's shares pared some gains to trade up 5 percent at $138.37.

The maker of Post-It Notes jumped 7.56 percent and Caterpillar 4.85 percent after the two companies reported stellar quarterly results and gave upbeat forecasts. Both stocks contributed about 160 points to the Dow’s 195- point rise. McDonald’s, another Dow component to report results on Tuesday, also notched up gains. “At these levels, only companies that have both top-line and bottom-line beats could make the market move higher,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey. The S&P; industrial sector was among the biggest S&P; gainers in the day. The sector has gained about 15 percent this year, largely in line with the broader S&P; 500 index, but lags technology and healthcare groups. “It offers some hope to investors that this rally will broaden out, which it needs to do, to sustain at these levels,” Heckler said.

Gains in both indexes were kept in check by declines in healthcare stocks. Biogen slipped 4.61 percent after reporting disappointing U.S. sales of a potential blockbuster drug, Spinraza. Centene dipped about 4 percent after saying that White House moves to cut off Obamacare subsidies would knock 7-12 cents per share off the health insurer’s fourth-quarter earnings. That along with a 1.5 percent drop in Johnson & Johnson and a 2.5 percent decline in AbbVie made the healthcare index the worst performer among the S&P; sectors. Financial stocks jumped 0.69 percent led by gains in Bank of America and JPMorgan, tracking higher Treasury yields. General Motors rose 2.50 percent after the No.1 U.S. automaker reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast and promised to slash stocks of unsold vehicles. Whirlpool tumbled 10.11 percent after the home appliances maker reported profit and sales below estimates and lowered full-year earnings guidance.

665,CAT,Caterpillar set to replace Boeing as top Dow performer,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc's (CAT.N) blowout third-quarter results could help it replace Boeing Co (BA.N) as the top performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, based on their performance in the past three months. Since reporting second-quarter results in July, Boeing’s shares have risen 23.46 percent, while Caterpillar is up 21.72 percent. In the same period, the Dow has risen 7.7 percent. Caterpillar surged 6.6 percent in early trading on Tuesday to hit a record high of $140.43, pushing the blue-chip index to an all-time high. The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker reported profit and sales that trumped Wall Street expectations on strong demand for its construction equipment in North America and China. All eyes will now turn to Boeing, which will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday. “They certainly have been good stocks to have in your portfolio and their long-term investment horizons look positive,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. Caterpillar has now topped earnings expectations for six straight quarters and revenue estimates for the third straight quarter. The company’s results show that it has turned a corner after being hit hard by falling oil and commodity prices in the last two years. Stifel analyst Stanley Elliot said the “recovery in Caterpillar’s business, now seems to be in full swing.” For Boeing, analysts expect core profit to fall 5 percent in third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

666,CAT,U.S. industrial shares hit record high as earnings shine,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. industrial sector roared to a record high on Tuesday following strong financial results from stalwarts 3M Co (MMM.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), even as shares of General Electric Co (GE.N) continued to struggle. The S&P; 500 industrials index .SPLRCI rose 0.7 percent, leading all major groups. Other sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth, such as financials .SPSY and materials .SPLRCM, also gained. Results showed a rebound for industrial companies whose shares have been under pressure the past couple of years as many of their key markets, such as energy, mining and agriculture, have struggled, said Edward Jones industrials analyst Matt Arnold. “What we are seeing in 2017 is a significant snap back in demand. It is driving higher sales at a time when these companies have done a lot to lean themselves out and tighten their belts,” Arnold said.  “What all this means is these companies are translating the sales snap-back into significant earnings growth and it is driving the stocks,” he said. Shares of diversified manufacturer 3M and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar led the sector’s gains, with both rising more than 5 percent after their results both easily topped Wall Street’s estimates for sales and earnings. The two stocks also propelled the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI to a record high. Caterpillar’s results helped boost shares of agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N), while shares of Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) climbed about 4 percent after the power tool maker’s results. General Motors Co (GM.N) shares meanwhile rose more than 1 percent after the automaker’s profit topped estimates. GM’s stock is part of the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD but its results are seen as an indicator of the health of industrial manufacturing. Tuesday’s gains for the cyclical sectors signaled a potential rotation in the stock market. Shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more resistant to economic downturns, have led this year’s market rally. Not all industrial stocks gained on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) shares fell 2 percent after the weapons supplier’s results, while United Technologies’ (UTX.N) shares were little changed after the conglomerate’s report. Notably, shares of GE, the largest publicly traded industrial company, were down 1 percent, continuing their slide after the conglomerate reported earnings that fell far short of Wall Street expectations on Friday.

The S&P; industrial sector .SPLRCI, up 0.5 percent, also hit a record intraday high. “It has been encouraging to see some of these industrial names report solid numbers and raise their guidance,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. “Looking at some the earnings we got yesterday and the ones today, you’re seeing strength domestically here in the U.S.” Stocks trimmed gains late in the day after Bloomberg reported Stanford University economist John Taylor may have won in a show of hands by Senate Republicans when asked by President Donald Trump about their support of potential nominees for Federal Reserve chair. Many market participants think Taylor, one of several names circulating for the Fed nomination, would be more hawkish than current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other potential nominees. Markets reacted to that headline, said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut, but he said the poll “obviously doesn’t mean anything.” Also dampening the market’s mood late in the session, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake criticized Trump’s style of governing and announced he would not run for re-election next year, highlighting tensions between the president and fellow Republicans. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 167.8 points, or 0.72 percent, to end at 23,441.76, a record-high close. The S&P; 500 .SPX gained 4.15 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,569.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 11.60 points, or 0.18 percent, to 6,598.43. Upbeat results also came from General Motors (GM.N), which rose 3 percent. The No.1 U.S. automaker reported stronger-than-expected earnings, reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast and promised to slash stocks of unsold vehicles. McDonald’s (MCD.N) also rose following results. The stock was last up 0.3 percent.  But the financial index .SPSY, up 0.7 percent, gave the S&P; 500 its biggest boost.  Strong earnings and optimism about Trump’s tax plans have boosted stocks in recent sessions. Offsetting some of the day’s gains, Biogen (BIIB.O) slipped 3.9 percent after disappointing U.S. sales of a potential blockbuster drug, Spinraza. Whirlpool (WHR.N) tumbled 10.5 percent after the home appliances maker reported profit and sales below estimates and lowered full-year earnings guidance. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 5.9 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

669,CAT,REFILE-Recovering global miners face fresh squeeze from rising costs,"TORONTO/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Just as global miners recover from an extended downturn and anemic metal prices, the industry faces a fresh challenge: higher costs.  Mining companies, including Newmont Mining Corp, Teck Resources and Barrick Gold Corp, reported increased costs this week in their quarterly earnings, lifted by factors including supplier inflation, firmer currencies and renewed exploration and development spending. Having just emerged from five years of belt-tightening when metal prices were weak, mining companies want to ensure that the benefits gained from that painful exercise are not lost.  Big miners said this week that they will flex their muscle with suppliers, who sell materials ranging from chemicals and trucks to steel.  “We’re going to be exercising all our purchasing power strength to drive those prices down,” Barrick’s Chief Operating Officer Richard Williams said on a conference call on Thursday, without specifying which suppliers were hiking prices. Encouraged by a rebound in prices for gold, copper and other metals that picked up steam late last year, miners are once again opening their wallets to spend on exploration and mine development, increasing competition for goods and services, and pushing up those input prices. Gold prices have climbed 11.5 percent, to $1,272.80 an ounce from $1,141.19 in mid-December 2016, while copper has soared 54 percent, to $3.23 a pound from $2.10 in late October 2016.  Since miners sell commodities, whose prices are fixed by the market, they cannot immediately pass on the costs to the end customers.   But suppliers like Caterpillar Inc, the world’s biggest maker of mining equipment, are reaping the rewards. The company, which this week reported earnings that blew past analyst estimates, expects mining revenue to jump 30 percent this year. The production costs of four of the world’s five biggest gold miners by market value - Newmont, Barrick, Newcrest Mining Ltd and Goldcorp Inc - rose by an average 7 percent in the third-quarter compared with a year ago, results this week showed. The fifth, China’s Zijin Mining Group, did not provide comparable cost figures.  When “you go from a period of very low levels of activity with vendors to an increased level, there’s going to be a price impact,” said Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the world’s No. 2 copper miner by market value, on a conference call Wednesday. Like Barrick, Freeport’s size gives it bargaining clout with suppliers, Adkerson said, which should help keep goods and services prices in check.       Stronger currencies in Canada and Australia over the past six months are also lifting costs, such as labor - the sector’s biggest minesite input cost, and squeezing margins for companies  because sales of commodities are priced in U.S. dollars.  Since May, the Canadian dollar has strengthened by 7 percent and the Australian dollar by 4 percent. While miners are starting to spend again on exploration and development, analysts expect them to be more cautious than in the 2008-2012 boom, when costs spiraled out of control on several multi-billion dollar projects, including Barrick’s Pascua-Lama venture in South America. “The lack of focus on costs during the last super cycle is still fresh in the minds of mining companies,” said Anton Ivanyi, consulting firm EY’s British Columbia mining and metals sector leader.

The deal, signed this week, came as worsening U.S.-Cuban political relations curb U.S. business interest in the Communist-run island of 11 million inhabitants in the wake of the historic 2014 detente. The United States voted against a U.N. General Assembly resolution that was passed on Wednesday calling for the lifting of the decades-old U.S. economic embargo against Cuba, reversing an abstention by Washington last year. [nL2N1N71KF] “We are going to set up a warehouse and distribution center at Mariel and we will be distributing Caterpillar equipment,” Caroline McConnie, Vice President of the privately-held Puerto Rican company Rimco, said in a news conference at Cuba’s annual trade fair. “We have a license from the commerce department and other agencies.” A license from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which handles economic and trade sanctions, was not necessary, she said. Mariel Director Ana Teresa Igarza said at the news conference that Rimco hoped to open up shop in 2018, and the deal was one of 30 projects, including 11 Mariel had signed off on this year. Cuba created the zone, just west of Havana, three years ago to attract foreign capital with tax and customs breaks to boost its anemic economy. It hopes the port there could become a hub for the Caribbean and Central and South America. It is controlled by Almacenes Universales, a company belonging to the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), which could prove problematic for U.S. companies. U.S. President Donald Trump in June ordered a ban on business dealings with the military as part of a tightening of trade and travel restrictions. The new regulations, including that ban, have yet to be unveiled. The Trump administration has said that any deals signed before then would be grandfathered in.

679,CAT,"UPDATE 1-Nestle, Cuba lay first stone for $55 mln coffee and biscuit factory","HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba and Swiss firm Nestle (NESN.S) on Tuesday laid the first stone of a $55 million coffee and biscuits factory joint venture in the Mariel special development zone, the latest major foreign investment in the Communist-run island. Nescor is Cuba’s third joint venture with Nestle and reflects President Raul Castro’s drive to attract international capital to help update the Soviet-style command economy and stimulate growth. Cuba created the zone around the Mariel port just west of Havana four years ago, offering companies significant tax and customs breaks. Its aim to replace imports with Made in Cuba goods has become all the more pressing because aid from socialist ally Venezuela is falling, resulting in a cash crunch. Nestle Vice President Laurent Freixe said in an interview after the symbolic stone-laying ceremony that negotiations with Cuban partner Coralsa and Mariel authorities had taken just 18 months, a “record speed”. The factory would be operating at the end of 2019 manufacturing coffee products, said Freixe, head of Nestle’s Americas division. Biscuits and other culinary products would come later. The company exports goods to Cuba and the other two joint ventures are one producing ice cream and the other bottled water and other beverages. Nescor goods would be destined both for the Cuban market and  tourists visiting Cuba, while it could eventually also export Cuban coffee, Freixe said. Nestle last year already exported Cuban coffee as a limited “Cafecito de Cuba” edition of Nespresso single-use brewer pods, including to the United States. “It sold at an impressive speed,” said Freixe. “Within a few days that line was sold out, which shows the potential.” Before being able to export Cuban coffee, Nestle would first need to help Cuba increase its harvest, Freixe said, which has steadily declined since the 1959 revolution. The new factory could double Nestle’s turnover in the country over the medium term from $135 million currently, he said.     So far, Cuba has approved 31 projects for the Mariel zone including nine with multinationals, Director Ana Teresa Igarza said at the ceremony. There was no longer the same flurry of business interest in the zone as when it was created but the interest that remained was more serious, she said.

683,CAT,Wall St Week Ahead-This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamonds,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017 with the market’s worst performers, including Under Armour and General Electric, may do well to remember as December draws to an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds. As investment advisors rebalance clients’ portfolios in the final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor with analysts - can be self-destructive. With the S&P; 500’s rally pushing price/earnings multiples to highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own technology and other high-growth stocks may attract bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017. “A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have a good year,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Ghriskey in recent months bought shares of General Electric (GE.N), which has slumped 45 percent this year as it struggles with a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. He believes the 125-year-old conglomerate will claw its way back to growth, or might be split into multiple companies.  Some of the worst-performing stocks of 2016 roared back to life in 2017, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX.O) and medical device maker Illumina (ILMN.O). Those two companies this year have rebounded 69 percent or more.  As he rebalances clients’ portfolios this month, Jake Dollarhide, head of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is investing more in Kroger Co (KR.N) and other supermarkets that took a beating after Amazon.com (AMZN.O) said in June it was buying Whole Food Markets.  Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year average of 27.   “Grocery is local; it’s not an internet play. And Kroger has the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,” Dollarhide said. Investors following the Dogs of the Dow investment strategy each year buy components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the highest dividend yield, betting that those stocks have been oversold. Currently, those companies include Verizon Communications (VZ.N), International Business Machines (IBM.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), all with dividend yields of 3.7 percent or more.  Those three stocks were also Dogs of the Dow at the start of this year, and they have underperformed. But an investor following that strategy last December also would have bought Boeing (BA.N), which has nearly doubled in 2017, Caterpillar (CAT.N), which is up 64 percent, and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), which has risen 28 percent.     Nike (NKE.N) in 2016 suffered a 19-percent drop, making it the worst-performing Dow component. In the past 12 months, however, it has surged back with a 25 percent rally.      Due partly to increased competition from Nike, Under Armour (UAA.N) has slumped 48 percent year to date, making it the S&P; 500’s third-worst-performing stock. Last January, most analysts recommended buying Under Armour’s shares and none recommended selling. Now, most analysts are neutral on the yoga-pant pioneer. Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P; 500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to finish 2017 with annual increases above the index’s 20-perent gain. Among them, domain name registration provider VeriSign (VRSN.O) has surged 53 percent, while Emerson Electric (EMR.N) has rallied 24 percent, with much of that gain in the past month after the industrial-automation systems maker abandoned its bid for Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N). 2017's diamonds and lumps of coal: tmsnrt.rs/2BhvwkC ",12222017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-weekahead/wall-st-week-ahead-this-years-lumps-of-coal-could-be-2018s-diamonds-idUSL1N1OE2RQ

The biggest sales increase came from North America, its biggest market, led by better demand for construction and on-shore oil & gas machinery. “Economic indicators are positive at the moment, and we expect a strong start to 2018,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby told analysts on a post-earnings conference call. The company expects further improvement in North American residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets. In Asia, it expects Chinese construction demand to remain strong at least through the first half of the new year. Meanwhile, rising gold, iron ore and copper prices are expected to improve machine utilization and the demand for aftermarket parts. A rebound in oil prices has renewed investments in the sector and boosted demand for equipment. It also said the prices it charges customers are staying ahead of material costs. The past year marked a dramatic turnaround for Caterpillar which, weighed down by weak economic conditions and commodity price volatility, saw a more than 40-percent fall in sales between 2012 and 2016. The downturn forced it to consolidate or close more than 30 facilities and reduced the total workforce by 16,000 between 2015 and 2016. The downsizing has led to some concerns that the company might not have enough muscle to meet the growing demand. “The challenge will be allocating equipment to inventory while also meeting end-market demand,” said Joe O’Dea, a machinery analyst at Vertical Research Partners.  Shares in Caterpillar, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, were last up 0.3 percent. The company’s stock has risen around 80 percent in the past year. The company forecast adjusted profit of $8.25 to $9.25 per share for 2018, above analysts’ average estimate of $8.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.      In the fourth quarter, in adjusted terms, it made a profit of $2.16 per share. On that basis, analysts had expected $1.79 per share. Caterpillar took a $2.4-billion charge related to the recent U.S. tax law, widening its net loss before adjustments to $1.30 billion, or $2.18 per share, from $1.17 billion, or $2.00 per share, a year earlier.

Biogen Inc surged 2.11 percent after the drugmaker reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on higher sales of recently launched drug Spinraza. The gains lifted the S&P; healthcare sector 0.78 percent as one of the best-performing S&P; groups. Shares of Caterpillar Inc were volatile in the wake of its quarterly earnings, falling as much as 3.5 percent and rising as much as 2.8 percent. Shares were last up 0.59 percent. “If growth continues the way we expect, we should see a rotation out of these mega cap tech companies and into more of the higher-leveraged value companies,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “And Caterpillar is it.” Robust quarterly earnings reports and economic data have helped propel major Wall Street indexes to a strong start this year, with each on track for a fourth week of gains. According to Thomson Reuters data through Thursday morning, earnings growth for the benchmark S&P; 500 is expected at 12.7 percent. Of the 118 companies in the index that have posted results, 78.8 percent have topped expectations, versus the 72 percent average over the previous four quarters. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 162.23 points, or 0.62 percent, to 26,414.35, the S&P; 500 gained 6.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,844 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.38 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,433.44. The European Central Bank kept its ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged, but weakness in the U.S. dollar accelerated as Draghi warned the surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty and said the bank might have to review strategy if U.S. comments on a weak dollar lead to a change in monetary conditions. The dollar fell 0.49 percent against a basket of major currencies and held near three-year lows. A weaker dollar tends to benefit large U.S. multinational companies. The greenback had suffered its biggest daily percentage drop in seven months on Wednesday after Mnuchin said he welcomed a weaker currency. On Thursday, Mnuchin said a weaker dollar benefited U.S. trade balances in the short term but that he believed in the long-term strength of the currency. “Essentially, he said what every previous Treasury secretary had thought, just never uttered,” said Ablin. Weekly initial jobless claims indicated the labor market continues to tighten. However, sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell more than expected in December, recording their biggest drop in nearly 1-1/2 years. Ford Motor Co shares slumped 3.28 percent after the automaker posted a lower-than-expected quarterly net profit. The company’s bottom line was hurt by rising commodity costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates, and it expected more pain to come from higher raw material prices in 2018. After the close of trading on Thursday, results are expected from Intel Corp and Starbucks Corp.

689,CAT,GLOBAL MARKETS-Euro climbs to highest in 3 years on ECB signals; bond yields gain,"* Euro hits three-year high vs dollar * Oil prices rise; Brent briefly tops $71 a barrel * U.S. stocks up in midday trading (Updates with midday U.S. markets activity, changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro rose to its highest in three years and bond yields climbed on Thursday, after the European Central Bank showed little concern about the single currency’s hottest run in nearly four years. Concerns about U.S. protectionism kept the U.S. dollar weak after its worst day in six months, but it was the absence of ECB worries over currency volatility after its first meeting of 2018 that sent the euro bulls charging again. The ECB also kept its ultra-easy monetary policy firmly on hold. ECB President Mario Draghi cited the region’s “solid and broad” growth and said inflation was likely to rise in the medium term. Draghi limited his comments to the side effects of currency volatility, rather than addressing the lofty level of the euro. Some market participants had expected Draghi to take a firmer stance to address the euro’s potentially damaging surge against the dollar. “Overall, the comments regarding the exchange rate were benign,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. “There was a lack of any forceful comments with respect to the recent euro strength.” The dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.58 percent, with the euro up 0.69 percent to $1.2492. The euro earlier jumped about 1 percent to $1.2536, its highest since mid-December 2014. U.S. Treasury debt yields for most maturities rose from earlier lows, in line with euro zone bonds following Draghi’s remarks. The yield on 10-year German government bonds, the benchmark for the bloc, hit a six-month high at 0.579 percent . U.S. benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.6448 percent, from 2.654 percent late Wednesday. In the U.S. equity market, the benchmark S&P; 500 index edged up modestly, though it was off early highs spurred by solid earnings reports and a decline in the dollar. Weighing on the index was Caterpillar Inc, whose shares turned negative as investors booked profit after an earlier jump of as much as 2.8 percent following its results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 157.42 points, or 0.6 percent, to 26,409.54, the S&P; 500 gained 5.36 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,842.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,437.18. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.64 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.16 percent. Investors awaited comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who is scheduled to speak in Davos later. “Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing, will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again!” Trump tweeted. On Wednesday in Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made a major departure from traditional U.S. currency policy, saying “obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities.” In the oil market, U.S. crude rose 0.67 percent to $66.05 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.87, up 0.48 percent on the day. Gold held near its highest since August 2016 as a weak dollar helped it extend gains. Spot gold was up 0.1 percent at $1,359 an ounce.

Biogen Inc gained 0.66 percent after the drugmaker reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on higher sales of recently-launched drug Spinraza. But the early drive higher stalled as Caterpillar Inc shares turned negative after rising as much as 2.8 percent. Shares were last down 1.03 percent as investors booked profits in a stock that was up about 8 percent heading into the week. “It opened up big and then all of a sudden it is tanking, that pulled down a lot of positive momentum in the market,” said Peter Costa, President, Empire Executions Inc in New York. “For whatever reason, it is not going (up) anymore and people just start taking profits and pulling money out.” Robust quarterly earnings reports and economic data have helped propel major Wall Street indexes to a strong start this year, with each on track for a fourth week of gains. According to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning, earnings growth for the benchmark S&P; 500 is expected at 12.4 percent. Of the 88 companies in the index that have posted results, 78.4 percent have topped expectations, while 72 percent had done so on average in the previous four quarters. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 99.44 points, or 0.38 percent, to 26,351.56, the S&P; 500 gained 1.68 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,839.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.28 points, or 0.06 percent, to 7,419.34.

691,CAT,GLOBAL MARKETS-Euro romps past $1.25 as ECB plays it cool,"* Euro hits three-year high vs dollar at $1.25 * Sterling goes to highest in six months vs euro * U.S. administration’s Ross hints at action against China * European shares flat after Tokyo’s Nikkei drops over 1 percent * Wall Street helped higher by weaker dollar, Cat earnings * Brent oil tops $71 a barrel for first time since 2014 * Dollar on course for biggest ever monthly fall vs yuan By Marc Jones LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro tore past $1.25 and its highest in three years on Thursday, after the European Central Bank showed little more than minor discomfort about the currency’s hottest run in nearly four years. Concerns about U.S. protectionism kept the dollar weak after its worst day in six months, but it was the signals - or lack of - from the ECB after it first meeting of 2018 that sent the euro bulls charging again. The currency had already broken above $1.24 for the first time since late 2014, but as ECB chief Mario Draghi kept comments restricted to the side-effects of volatility rather than the outright surge, it soared past $1.25. “No central bank likes (currency) volatility but there was no specific concern about the level of the euro,” said Marie-Anne Allier, Head of Euro Fixed Income at Amundi. “For the moment, we stick to the view of an end of (ECB) QE in September and the first rate hike in the first semester of 2019.” The euro eventually ran out of steam as Draghi then said there was little chance of an ECB rate rise this year. It sagged back to just under $1.25 though a sell-off in bond markets remained firmly in motion. The yield on 10-year German government bonds, the benchmark for the euro bloc, hit a 6-month high at 0.56 percent and Southern European bond yields unwound earlier falls. That also pushed U.S. Treasury yields to the cusp of 2.67 percent. Stock markets squirmed amid the gyrations too. Wall Street’s main markets opened higher, helped by the dollar’s broad weakness and the latest flurry of big-name company earnings. They included 3M, digger maker Caterpillar, which saw its sales surge 35 percent, and computer chip giant Intel. The euro’s strength left the pan-European STOXX 600 struggling again though as Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX went back 0.6 percent, France’s CAC slipped 0.3 percent and London’s FTSE turned red too. As well as the euro’s $1.25 milestone, sterling had hit a new post Brexit vote high against the dollar of $1.4250 and had also climbed to its highest in six months against the euro before the ECB’s shake up. “Certain movements in the exchange rates to the extent that are justified by the strengthening of the economy are a part of nature. It’s a fact of nature,” Draghi said during the central bank’s post-meeting news conference. “So the issue is whether these other movements in the exchange rate... whether that has an effect on our inflation path.” Oil prices, a major driver of inflation, added to all the speculation of higher global interest rates as Brent crude hit $71 per barrel for the first time since 2014. Asian trading overnight meanwhile had been a mixed bag, with many of the moves driven by the weakening of the dollar. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched an all-time peak for the ninth session in a row, but Tokyo’s Nikkei fell 1.1 percent, hit by the yen’s latest jump against the greenback. Wall Street’s rise though meant the MSCI ACWI , the index provider’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets, consolidated its 6.5 percent gains for the month. A Reuters poll of over 500 economists also showed the global economy is expected to grow at the fastest pace since 2010. The upbeat mood, however, has come up against renewed fears of protectionism by the United States after President Donald Trump’s decision to impose steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels earlier in the week. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross hinted at other measures against China too on Wednesday, saying at the annual Davos meeting that Washington was investigating whether there was a case for taking action over China’s infringements of intellectual property. Trump is scheduled to speak in Davos later. “Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing, will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again!” Trump tweeted. He was choppering into to the Swiss Alpine town a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made a major departure from traditional U.S. currency policy, saying “obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities”. Analysts say they cannot remember any U.S. Treasury Secretary openly embracing a cheaper dollar, at least in the last two decades or so. “I was speculating the Trump administration may roll out something with fanfare given its big delegation to Davos,” said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “I’d think the real aim of Mnuchin’s comments on the dollar is not so much engineering a weaker dollar per se as putting pressure on trading partners to do some trade deals with the administration,” he added. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to a three-year low of 88.529 in the wake of the ECB. It has fallen almost two percent so far this week. The dollar had also slipped to as far as 108.63 yen, its lowest since mid-September, and to its weakest against the Chinese yuan since November 2015. It is on course for its biggest monthly fall against the yuan. “They (the U.S. administration) can either have tariffs with the rest of the world or do it organically through a nice depreciation of the dollar,” said JP Morgan Asset Management’s chief European markets strategist Karen Ward.

Concerns about U.S. protectionism kept the dollar weak after its worst day in six months, but it was the signals from the ECB’s first meeting of 2018 after it again kept rates at record lows that were attracting attention. A boom in the euro zone economy means some of the bank’s top policymakers want an increasingly swift end to its 2.6 trillion euro stimulus programme, but they know it comes with plenty of challenges. Number one is how to address the euro’s surge - it was at a three-year high of over $1.24 ahead of a 1330 GMT ECB news conference - as this could dampen inflation and endanger the work done by years of unprecedented stimulus. Euro zone bonds were again reducing the premium offered by former debt crisis countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain compared with ultra-safe German debt, but it will be a delicate balancing act for ECB chief Mario Draghi. Oil prices, which are a major driver of inflation, hit $71 per barrel in Asian trading for the first time since 2014. “The rate of change (in the euro) might make the ECB a little uncomfortable,” said State Street’s head of EMEA macro strategy, Tim Graf. “They can’t push back too much on the fruits of their success, but you may well get comments around excessive currency volatility.” The uncertainty about the ECB made for a quiet pre-amble for share markets. Wall Street futures were pointing fractionally higher amid a flurry of earnings from heavyweight companies 3M Co, digger maker Caterpillar, which saw its sales surge 35 percent, and computer chip giant Intel. The pan-European STOXX 600 was getting going too. It had barely budged early on as Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX index fell, but it was last sitting 0.2 percent higher as Frankfurt recovered to add to small gains on London’s FTSE and France’s CAC 40. As well as the euro’s $1.24 milestone, sterling hit a new post Brexit vote high against the dollar of $1.4250 and also climbed to its highest in six months against the euro despite the euro zone currency’s broad advance.

Last year, the IRS challenged the company’s taxes for 2007-2012 and federal law enforcement officials searched three of its facilities in March in connection with an investigation related to profits earned by a Swiss parts subsidiary, Caterpillar SARL, or CSARL.

706,CAT,US STOCKS-Wall St drops more than 1 pct on Trump tariff comments,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P; 500 registered a third straight day of more than 1 percent declines on Thursday after President Donald Trump said the United States would impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum, raising concern about higher prices and a trade war. The declines put the Dow into negative territory for the year and drove the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX to its highest close since Feb. 13, denting the market’s recent recovery from deep losses in early February. Shares of auto makers and other big consumers of steel and aluminum added to their session losses after Trump said the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum next week, while shares of U.S. steel and aluminum companies jumped. On the day, General Motors Co (GM.N) shares lost 4 percent, while Ford Motor Co (F.N) was down 3.0 percent. U.S. Steel (X.N) shares rose 5.7 percent, while shares of Nucor (NUE.N) climbed 3.3 percent. Industrial heavyweights like Boeing (BA.N) and Caterpillar (CAT.N) also fell as investors worried about higher raw material costs and trade barriers elsewhere. Boeing was down 3.5 percent and Caterpillar was down 2.8 percent.  “It’s always a concern about what’s the retaliatory response to this. Underlying all of these trade issues here, when you have trade wars, is again fueling inflation, because presumably prices are going to be higher,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Rising inflation and bond yields were the main concerns as Wall Street ended a turbulent February on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P; 500 capping their worst month since January 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 420.22 points, or 1.68 percent, to 24,608.98, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 92.45 points, or 1.27 percent, to 7,180.56. The S&P; 500 is down 3.7 percent since Monday’s close. Thursday’s fall marked its third straight day of declines of at least 1 percent, the first such streak for the index since January 2016. Last month confirmed a 10-percent correction for the S&P;, which is still down more than 6 percent from its Jan. 26 record high.  Stocks had mostly traded lower before Trump’s announcement. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tried to temper remarks he made on Tuesday that raised concerns about the potential for four interest rate hikes this year rather than the Fed’s forecast of three, but New York Fed President William Dudley, speaking in Sao Paulo, Brazil, was a bit more pointed and said four rate hikes would be “gradual.” Indexes edged lower following Dudley’s remarks, but investors said it was the tariff issue that drove the afternoon selloff. “We got in and out of monetary policy concerns pretty well and this caught us by surprise,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

After a confused day of report and counter report, Trump said the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum next week. That drove shares in U.S. steel producers as much as 12 percent higher but knocked 2 percent or more off heavyweights like Boeing and Caterpillar, who investors worried would face higher raw material costs and trade barriers elsewhere. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley also added to the evidence that the U.S. central bank under new chief Jerome Powell would seek to tighten monetary policy with four interest rates rises this year, more than previously expected. By 13:09 p.m. ET, all the major sectors in the S&P; 500 were down in response along with 29 of the 30 components of the Dow Industrial Average. Overall the Dow lost 343.7 points, or 1.4 percent, the S&P; 500 29.03 points, or 1.1 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 77.10 points, or 1.1 percent. “The bombshell is the announcement about half an hour ago about the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum industries,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. “It’s helping about a dozen stocks in those industries but has raised the specter of trade wars, and trade wars don’t help the stock market.” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell had earlier given the market a boost by saying in his second round of congressional testimony that the central bank did not see strong evidence of wage inflation or signs of overheating. Rising inflation and bond yields were the main concerns as Wall Street ended a turbulent February on Wednesday, with the S&P; 500 posting its first monthly loss in 11 months.

710,CAT,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 gains for day but posts weekly losses on trade war fears,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 ended another turbulent week on an upbeat note Friday, but major indexes posted their worst week of losses since early February as President Donald Trump’s threat to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum rattled investors. The gains on Friday came as investors who had been spooked by the prospect of a global trade war backed off those concerns and noted a trade war was far from certain at this point. Trump on Thursday threatened a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum without exemptions for any countries, igniting a selloff in a market already on edge over rising U.S. interest rates and bond yields. Trump struck a defiant tone on Friday, saying trade wars were “good, and easy to win”, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appearing on CNBC, said tariffs would have a “trivial effect.”  Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York, said Trump’s announcement was made to call everyone’s attention to the U.S. trade deficit but investors decided that a full-blown global trade was not going to happen.  “For a real estate guy like that, you pound the podium, you rattle some sabers, you get everybody’s attention and then you negotiate back to some reasonable midpoint.” The tariffs could dampen profits for everything from car makers to beer companies and result in higher prices for consumers. Shares of big U.S. steel companies and manufacturers were under pressure on uncertainty over the effects of tariffs. Shares in Caterpillar (CAT.N), a buyer of raw materials and a big exporter of construction machinery products, were down 2.6 percent after falling 2.8 percent in the previous day’s session. General Motors (GM.N) was down 1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 70.92 points, or 0.29 percent, to 24,538.06, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 13.58 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,691.25 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 77.31 points, or 1.08 percent, to 7,257.87. For the week, the S&P; 500 dropped 2 percent, while the Dow was down 3 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1 percent. Wall Street had posted gains in the previous two weeks as it recovered from its steep early-February selloff. Those losses in early February pushed the S&P; 500 down more than 10 percent from a Jan. 26 record high, confirming the market was in a correction. The tariffs are unlikely to significantly hurt Corporate America’s overall earnings, according to stock market strategists, who were not immediately adjusting their profit estimates following Trump’s announcement. “The impact on total corporate earnings first would be driven by the impact on the economy,” said Keith Parker, U.S. equity strategist for UBS in New York.

Europe has drawn up a list of U.S. products from bourbon to Harley Davidson motorbikes on which to apply tariffs if Trump carries out his plan, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross played down the fears, saying “hysteria over tariffs is a lot to do over nothing.” Trump’s announcement comes at a time when the markets was already on edge over rising U.S. interest rates and bond yields, though some investors said a lot of details still need to be worked out. “If (it is) the case, this could get bad, but we’re not there yet,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “I’m personally not reacting just yet ... I wouldn’t bet on any” impact to earnings at this point. Shares in big U.S. steel companies and manufacturers were under pressure on uncertainty over the effects of tariffs. Shares in Caterpillar, a buyer of raw materials and a big exporter of construction machinery products, were down 2.6 percent after falling 2.8 percent in the previous day’s session. General Motors was down 1.9 percent.

712,CAT,U.S. steel stocks volatile on Trump tariff uncertainty,"(Reuters) - Shares in big U.S. steel companies and manufacturers were under pressure on Friday on uncertainty over the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Steel stocks were volatile and some erased part of the previous day’s gains, as investors worried threats of retaliation from overseas trading partners would halt or water down Trump’s promise of hefty import tariffs. Shares also fell in sectors that could be hurt by the tariffs - from rising prices for steel and aluminum buyers such as car and machinery makers, to the threat of possible counter-tariffs against U.S. companies such as Harley-Davidson (HOG.N), who sell their products overseas. Trump struck a defiant tone on Friday, saying trade wars were good and easy to win, after his plan to put import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent of aluminum triggered global criticism and a slide in stock markets. “The President took a dump truck and dumped a heap of uncertainty onto the market,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “We have a tailwind from tax reform and when you throw in a cross wind of tariffs the boat starts rocking. Uncertainty brings about selling.” Harley-Davidson shares fell, last down 3.0 percent, after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told German television that Europe would put tariffs on their motorbikes, as well as bourbon and jeans. Shares in Caterpillar (CAT.N), a buyer of raw materials and a big exporter of construction machinery products, were down 2.6 percent after falling 2.8 percent in the previous day’s session. General Motors, also a metal consumer and exporter, was down 1.9 percent. “Does this turn into a trade war? That’s the worst-case scenario,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. In comparison, the broader S&P; 500 .SPX fell 0.5 percent after a 1.3 percent drop on Thursday.   While steel companies soared on Thursday, investors edged away from the sector on Friday as their conviction ebbed that the tariffs would be implemented. After rising 5.7 percent in the previous session, shares in U.S. Steel (X.N) were last down 2.8 percent at $44.73 after hitting a low of $43.22 earlier in the day.  Nucor Corp (NUE.N) shares were down 0.7 percent after rising 3.3 percent the day before. “There’s clearly equity market disappointment in the Trump proposal. People are probably thinking maybe it’s not going to go through,” said JPMorgan steel analyst Michael Gambardella, adding that the lack of details in Trump’s statement made the industry impact “very hard to predict.” Two analysts also said a downgrade of U.S. Steel by a big bank could be hurting the sector, on top of weaker than expected results from Olympic Steel (ZEUS.O), which was down 8.6 percent at $21.30.    Shares in AK Steel (AKS.N) were up 0.2 percent at $5.66 after hitting a low of $5.41 earlier in the day. They rose 9.5 percent on Thursday.

713,CAT,FOCUS-Caterpillar drives sales on China's new Silk Road,"CHICAGO/NANTONG, China (Reuters) - At a Caterpillar facility in the eastern Chinese city of Nantong, an array of excavators, earth movers and road-making machinery is displayed on slopes and in mud pits. The audience is Caterpillar’s local network of dealers, who inspect the machines for the latest technological innovations to help make their sales pitches to buyers in China.  However, much of the heavy equipment could find its way to construction and mining projects in places like Pakistan or Kazakhstan, or as far away as Africa. Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China – the Nantong facility is one of 25 similar ones it has set up across the country – in the hopes of cracking the largest construction and mining equipment market in the world. Helping fuel the growth of that market, Caterpillar executives and analysts say, is China’s Belt and Road initiative, a huge infrastructure spending spree that builds on the old Silk Road trading routes. The ambitious and ever-growing $1 trillion initiative now includes projects spanning Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Belt and Road is becoming a very important driver for Caterpillar’s development,” said Chen Qihua, head of Caterpillar China, at the Nantong facility. The world’s biggest equipment maker doesn’t reveal its sales tied directly to Belt and Road projects, or break out its China revenues.  But analysts say its Asia-Pacific sales figures reflect demand for machines destined for Belt and Road projects as contractors buy most of their equipment in China to take advantage of tax rebates handed out for the initiative. Chen said contractors prefer to buy machines in China to take advantage of the rebates. Asia-Pacific sales increased 22 percent in the last quarter of 2017 over the previous year, with construction demand in China accounting for about half that increase, Caterpillar said in January. It said it expected demand to remain strong at least through the first half of 2018. (Graphic on Caterpillar's sales: tmsnrt.rs/2ExfXqr)     Once purchased in China, the equipment is shipped off to projects across the vast geography of the initiative and put to work building power plants in Pakistan, constructing highways in Belarus or developing new mines in Africa. Most of the equipment sent is made in China, Chen said. Lawrence Poh, executive director at Caterpillar’s largest dealer in China, told Reuters at his office in Kunshan, just outside Shanghai, that orders had increased due to demand from Belt and Road projects. He did not provide details.  While China has been a bright spot for Caterpillar, it is facing competition from cheaper construction equipment made by Chinese companies, particularly in China. Other Western companies such as General Electric, Honeywell and Maersk are also vying for orders, particularly in the energy and transportation segment. Joshua Yau, a Hong Kong-based Belt and Road analyst at Strategy&, an arm of the PwC consultancy, says Chinese construction equipment companies like Zoomlion and Sany Heavy Industries dominate sales inside China. But Yau said that outside China, Caterpillar’s advanced technology and global network made it a better option. “Caterpillar is mostly getting the orders where Chinese equipment suppliers are not competitive,” said Yau. He added that Chinese products were generally viewed as inferior in terms of quality and technology. Caterpillar’s sales pitch is that its machines use less fuel and help construction teams work faster. Advanced software helps track the machines’ performance, and when things go wrong it has a network of more than 170 dealers and 2,000 branches around the world to help with repairs. “In the geographies where they are newcomers, Chinese contractors can leverage CAT’s overseas network to help compete and win projects,” Yau said. In Africa, for instance, a piece of equipment sold by a China-based dealer for a project in Kenya or Algeria could be serviced by a Caterpillar dealer on the continent. “It’s very easy for us to align with other dealers,” Poh said. “Once our equipment goes abroad, they will need to provide good maintenance and upkeep for the customer in order to allow the equipment to perform at their best.” Analysts said a lack of overseas dealer networks and a perceived shortfall in quality meant Chinese rivals were struggling to expand their share of the global market. “The low-labour cost advantage associated with these Chinese companies will hold less sway as products become increasingly complex and quality standards significantly increase,” analysts at Morningstar wrote in a recent note.  Caterpillar is also deploying its financing arm to spur Belt and Road sales, company executives said. Since the launch of the initiative, the financing arm has started lending to Chinese companies, including state-owned enterprises, to help bridge their funding gaps. Caterpillar does not disclose specific data for such lending.   MULTI-YEAR BOOST Still, Belt and Road is also providing opportunities for Chinese construction companies. A study by Off-Highway Research found that countries along the Belt and Road accounted for 30 percent of Sany’s overall sales in 2016-2017. At XCMG Construction Machinery, 75 percent of overseas sales came from countries associated with the initiative. Sales figures were not provided. Analysts and Caterpillar executives say Belt and Road, on which Beijing says it wants to spend as much as $150 billion a year outside China, offers ample opportunities for all manufacturers. “As government funding for the BRI projects improves, this is expected to result in higher demand throughout the industry,” said Jeff Hardee, director of Asia-Pacific government & corporate affairs at Caterpillar in Singapore, referring to the initiative.

717,CAT,Caterpillar's latest restructuring move could cut 880 jobs,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) will close two facilities in Texas and Panama and is also considering shutting its engine manufacturing plant in Illinois as part of a strategy to boost profitability and better handle business cycles, but the move could cut 880 jobs.     The plant closures, which were announced internally over the past two months, were confirmed to Reuters by a company spokeswoman on Friday.      She said the move will affect its work tools facility in Waco, Texas, and its demonstration center in Panama. The world’s largest heavy-duty equipment maker emerged last year from the longest downturn in its history, when sales dropped more than 40 percent between 2012 and 2016. The struggle led not only to a leadership change, but also resulted in a credit rating downgrade by Moody’s.  Chastised by the sales slump, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company has embarked upon a restructuring strategy, looking to squeeze more production out of its existing factories, focusing on lean manufacturing, margin expansion and asset efficiency. Separately, Caterpillar’s Progress Rail unit is contemplating the closure of its engine manufacturing facility in LaGrange, Illinois, shifting the work to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and outside suppliers. “If the LaGrange decision is finalized, the closure would impact approximately 600 full-time positions related directly to engine manufacturing,” Caterpillar’s spokeswoman said. The plant closure news comes as some U.S. manufacturers are grappling with President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import duties on steel and aluminum imports, which is expected to inflate input costs for equipment makers like Caterpillar. The company’s shares were up 1.6 percent at $156.99 on Friday afternoon. Since 2013, Caterpillar has reduced its construction and energy and transportation assets by more than $4 billion. The full-time workforce is smaller too. Even as a recovery in key markets is driving up production at its factories, Caterpillar is relying more on workers with flexible contracts to cater to the improving demand. Caterpillar had 116,700 workers globally - including both fulltime and those with flexible contracts - at the end of last year. Instead of investing in new factories, the company is spending money on expanding its services business and enhancing e-commerce capabilities. The plan aims to eventually lift Caterpillar’s adjusted operating margin to 14-17 percent when annual sales reach $55 billion. The company had sales of $45.5 billion in 2017. Judging from recent results, the plan seems to be working. The adjusted operating margin swelled to nearly 14 percent last year, its highest level in at least 10 years, from 7 percent in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. In its focus on operating discipline, Caterpillar’s restructuring program is similar to the strategy Deere & Co (DE.N) has pursued for nearly two decades as it seeks to boost returns for shareholders. That discipline has stood the Moline, Illinois-based company in good stead, helping it sustain returns on capital and investment through varying economic cycles. Caterpillar’s director of investor relations, Amy Campbell, said earlier this week that the company would continue to look at structural costs reduction despite an improvement in sales volumes. Caterpillar’s workers were informed of the plans about the LaGrange and Panama facilities in January. The decision on the  Waco facility was announced in late February. The work at the Texas plant will be shifted to Wamego, Kansas, affecting 200 regular and contract positions, and the closure of the Panama facility will eliminate about 80 positions, the spokeswoman said.

720,CAT,UPDATE 1-Renault shares jump on new Nissan merger reports,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault (RENA.PA) shares rose sharply on Thursday following renewed media reports of merger talks between the French carmaker and its longstanding alliance partner Nissan (7201.T). Renault’s stock was up 4.6 percent at 97.41 euros as of 1057 GMT, after Bloomberg said the companies were in merger discussions, citing unidentified sources. Nissan shares had earlier closed 0.5 percent lower in Tokyo. Reuters reported earlier this month that the carmakers were discussing a deal, at Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn’s initiate, that would see Nissan acquire much of the French government’s 15 percent Renault holding, as a prelude to a merger. “We do not comment on rumors and speculation,” Renault-Nissan spokesman Jonathan Adashek said on Thursday when asked about the latest report. A French finance ministry spokesman also declined to comment. The Renault-Nissan alliance, underpinned by cross-shareholdings, has wrestled intermittently since its 1999 inception with full merger proposals that have foundered on objections from France, Renault’s biggest shareholder. Earlier studies, including one drawn up for Ghosn in a 2013 study codenamed “Project Caterpillar”, would have combined the carmakers in a Dutch-registered group with shares listed in Paris and Tokyo, sources have said previously. Renault and Nissan are now discussing a transaction that would see both shareholder groups receive stock in the new company, which could be based in London or the Netherlands while retaining headquarters in Paris and Tokyo, Bloomberg reported.  Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan but agreed to limit formal control of its larger partner in a 2015 shareholder pact that defused a boardroom standoff with the French government. Nissan currently owns a 34 percent controlling stake in Mitsubishi and 15 percent of Renault, but no voting rights. Any move by France to sell most or all of its Renault stake could prove politically risky for President Emmanuel Macron, already under fire for letting national champions such as TGV train maker Alstom fall into foreign hands.

725,CAT,Caterpillar shares slide; Trump steel tariffs may boost costs,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc’s (CAT.N) shares tumbled on Tuesday, giving up early gains on concerns that rising materials costs could squeeze profit margins for the heavy equipment manufacturer following U.S. President Donald Trump’s crackdown on steel imports. Those worries overshadowed its strong performance in the March quarter. Profits and revenues topped analysts’ estimates, while the world’s largest heavy equipment maker also upgraded its profit outlook for the full year 2018. Yet investors grew concerned about management’s comments that first-quarter performance was the “high watermark” for the year. While Caterpillar expects earnings to be strong for the rest of 2018, the company cautioned it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased material costs. Caterpillar’s shares opened higher on Tuesday and gained as much as 4.6 percent in early trade, buoyed the earnings outlook. The euphoria, however, did not even last two hours.   As soon as the company’s Chief Financial Officer Bradley M. Halverson called the first quarter profits “the high watermark for the year”, the stock began giving up the gains. And when he started talking about the company’s price versus material costs equation for the later parts of the year, the sell-off became more pronounced. Shares in Caterpillar, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, closed down 6.2 percent at $144.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. At one stage, the stock had lost 11 percent from the day's high. “It’s a negative surprise because the indications had previously been that everything was okay on that front,” said Lawrence T. De Maria, co-group head of Global Industrial Infrastructure at William Blair & Company. Caterpillar's slide exacerbated the fall in the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed the day down 424.56 points, losing 1.74 percent from its close on Monday. Tuesday’s sell-off coincided with a rise in 10-year Treasury yields which hit the highly anticipated 3 percent mark for the first time in four years, stoking concerns over higher borrowing rates for companies already facing rising costs. President Donald Trump’s crackdown on steel imports has constrained supplies in the domestic market, inflating costs of the metal. Caterpillar said steel costs for the equipment industry were up about 15 percent in the March quarter. To compensate, the company is carrying out price increases that would come into effect in the middle of the year.  Other companies also are relying on price increases to protect profit margins. Last week, Donaldson Company Inc (DCI.N), which makes filters for heavy equipment makers, announced price increases of 4-15 percent, citing higher steel costs the company said were squeezing profit margins. The Institute for Supply Management survey published this month showed a surge in the cost of raw materials and worries among manufacturers about the impact of Trump’s steel and aluminum import tariffs. The tariffs are pushing up steel prices at a time when inflation could be heating up, prompting the Federal Reserve to hike U.S. interest rates which could in turn slow economic growth and crimp domestic demand. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company now expects full-year profit to range between $9.75 to $10.75 per share, $2 above its range in January. Caterpillar, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity, has benefited as the global economy has had its best run since 2011. With the International Monetary Fund predicting robust global growth for the next two years, demand for its equipment is expected to remain strong. In the latest quarter, revenues rose 31 percent on year to $12.9 billion, above Wall Street’s expectations, as strong commodity prices and increased construction activities in North America and China drove up sales of mining and construction machines. Overall sales were also boosted by favorable currency impacts and improved price realization. “The first quarter was an exceptional quarter for performance,” said Amy Campbell, head of investor relations at Caterpillar. While she said the performance would not be repeated, the company still expected “strong” operating margins for the full-year. Caterpillar also said it expected sales volume to grow thanks to higher demand across all regions and most end markets. Caterpillar’s 2018 forecast did not include potential impact from future geopolitical risks and increased trade restrictions. But in its annual report this year, the company warned that “buy national” policies or retaliation against such policies could hurt operations. Threats of a global trade war pose the biggest risks for a company that sells more than half of its machines outside the United States. The company reported a net profit of $2.74 per share for the quarter, above analysts’ consensus forecast of $2.04 per share. Adjusted net profit was $2.82 per share.

727,CAT,RPT-US STOCKS-Wall St slides as high bond yields fan cost worries,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) * 10-yr yield hits 3 pct for first time in four years * S&P; 500, Dow post biggest declines since April 6 * Caterpillar, Alphabet, 3M pull indexes down * Dow down 1.74 pct, S&P; 500 down 1.34 pct, Nasdaq down 1.7 pct By Stephen Culp NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday as 10-year Treasury yields hit the highly anticipated 3 percent mark for the first time in four years, stoking concerns over higher borrowing rates for companies already facing rising costs, and as quarterly results failed to deliver positive outlooks. The S&P; 500 and the Dow fell the most in two-and-a-half weeks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down for a fifth day in a row. The S&P; 500 is now down 1.5 percent year-to-date. The 10-year yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, has been driven steadily higher by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs. “It makes borrowing costs more expensive for corporations. This market rally for the last nine years has been driven by low interest rates, accommodating monetary policy and excess liquidity,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist for Bruderman Asset Management in New York. Higher bond yields could also prompt portfolio managers to weigh moving money into more attractive fixed-income securities at the expense of equities. The stock market had already been spooked by a climb in bond yields earlier in the year, sliding sharply in February. . Technology and industrial stocks weighed on the major indexes on Tuesday, with Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc all falling more than 3.5 percent. Alphabet shares fell 4.7777 percent, erasing the stock’s year-to-date gains as rising expenses and shrinking margins overshadowed the company’s better-than-expected profit. Industrial bellwether Caterpillar tumbled 6.20 percent on fears of increasing steel prices, despite the company’s beating earnings estimates due to strong global demand. Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares fell 6.83 percent after the company posted in-line profits as lower taxes offset a miss in operating profits and the company lowered its 2018 earnings forecast. “We’re seeing some of the earnings numbers have come out, and after further review, (investors) realized where all this revenue was coming from,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “They didn’t see it as recurring or indicative of the core business. “I think what investors had hoped the benefit from taxes would get redeployed back into the company. That’s not happening,” Nolte said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 424.56 points, or 1.74 percent, to 24,024.13, the S&P; 500 lost 35.73 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,634.56 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 121.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,007.35. Apple Inc shares lost 1.39 percent as worries over softening demand for high-end smartphones were underscored as Corning Inc reported a drop in screen glass sales for the first time in at least four quarters. Other technology stocks in the FAANG group, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, also weighed on the Nasdaq. “They’re kind of pulling each other down,” said Nolte. “Investors are saying, ‘You know, the group has had a tremendous run over the last two to three years, maybe we should take some money off the table here.’” Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon’s largest weapons supplier, dropped 6.17 percent. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year sales and profit forecast but did not raise its 2018 cash-flow projections. So far, 24 percent of S&P; 500 companies have reported first-quarter results, with 77.1 percent coming in above the Street consensus, versus the 64 percent average since 1994. Analysts estimate 21.1 percent growth in earnings for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. On the economic front, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in April, according to the Conference Board, as short-term optimism improved and the share of consumers expecting their incomes to decline in the coming months hit its lowest level since December 2000. Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest level since November 2014, but then reversed course as U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to try to resolve U.S.-European differences on Iran, easing concerns that the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 90 new lows.

729,CAT,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks drop as U.S. 10-year yields top 3 percent,"* Oil lower after Brent tops $75 a barrel mark * U.S. 10-year note yield crosses 3 percent * Caterpillar slumps on higher material cost warning (Updates with European market close) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - A gauge of world stocks tumbled on Tuesday, relinquishing early gains after U.S. bond yields topped the 3 percent threshold for the first time in four years, while oil prices stretched above the $75 per barrel mark. Equities in Europe hit session lows before closing near the unchanged mark and U.S. stocks retreated after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield crossed the 3 percent mark to a high of 3.003 percent, its highest since January 2014. In addition, the two-year yield touched 2.5 percent for the first time since September 2008. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.9846 percent, from 2.973 percent late on Monday. The move higher in yields sapped the appetite for stocks, which had been higher on the back of a strong batch of earnings from names such as Verizon and Caterpillar. Rising bond yields provide more competition for stocks, especially those with high dividend yields. “It’s kind of one of those things where we all expected it, we talked about it, then it happens and the market is surprised by it,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “This stuff has been building the last few days, some of the reaction happened beforehand in some of the other markets and now it is catching up to stocks.” The bond market sell-off since late last week stemmed from inflation worries caused by rising commodity prices and growing Treasury debt supply, as well as bets the Federal Reserve would further raise key borrowing costs, analysts said. Higher commodity prices also pose a risk for equities, with Caterpillar shares reversing course and last trading down 6.5 percent after forecasting increases in material expenditures due to rising steel prices. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.03 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.81 percent. MSCI’s index is on track for its fourth straight decline, its longest losing streak in a month. Wall Street was also weighed down by a 5 percent drop in Google parent Alphabet as strong growth in ad sales on search and YouTube were not enough to offset a surge in costs. Google kicked off a big week for tech sector earnings, with results expected from 23 names in the group including Facebook and Microsoft. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 528.79 points, or 2.16 percent, to 23,919.9, the S&P; 500 lost 44.74 points, or 1.68 percent, to 2,625.55 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 140.38 points, or 1.97 percent, to 6,988.23. U.S. earnings thus far have gotten off to the strong start that was widely anticipated, with the expected growth rate for the quarter currently at 21.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 118 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported through Tuesday morning, 77.1 percent have topped expectations. After climbing above $75 a barrel to their highest since November 2014, Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, and U.S. crude prices were lower as concerns over the possibility that the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran faded. U.S. crude fell 1.27 percent to $67.77 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.93, down 1.04 percent.

The yield on the 10-year U.S Treasury notes hit 3 percent for the first time since 2014, due to a growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as commodity prices gained. Caterpillar, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity jumped 4 percent, while Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines-maker United Tech rose 1.3 percent. Both companies topped quarterly profit estimates and raised their full-year earnings forecasts. The results also run contrary to a 0.4 percent fall in the S&P; industrials index this year due to fears of a tit-for-tat trade war with China. “Two big-cap companies, industrials and global in nature, beating estimates, and the takeaway being that fundamentals remain strong for corporate America,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. About 18 percent of the S&P; 500 companies had reported results as of Monday, with 78 percent topping profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That has pushed up analysts’ estimates for earnings growth in the quarter to nearly 20 percent, from 18.6 percent just over than a week back, making it the strongest in seven years. One dampener was Google-parent Alphabet, which dipped 2.5 percent as investors focused on rising costs rather than the profit beat. “On balance, the numbers were pretty good and some of the issues related to spending are idiosyncratic to the business. I don’t think its going to indict the entire sector,” said Luschini.

Coca-Cola gained 2 percent after its revenue beat estimates, helped by higher demand for Coke Zero Sugar and new flavors of Diet Coke. Verizon jumped 1.3 percent after its profit beat expectations. 3M fell 6.1 percent after it managed to only match profit estimates. A drop in sales for the screen glass unit of telecoms parts producer Corning Inc may also add to growing market nerves about demand for high-end smartphones. Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest since November 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.09-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.07-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

With U.S Treasury yields easing slightly from the peaks hit on Monday, the results from industrial heavyweights helped reinforce optimism about the pace of U.S. economic growth and a first-quarter earnings season now in full swing. Shares of Caterpillar jumped 3.6 percent in premarket trading, while Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines-maker United Tech rose 2 percent after the companies topped quarterly profit estimates and raised their full-year earnings forecasts. The results also run contrary to a 0.4 percent fall in the S&P; industrials index this year due to fears of a tit-for-tat trade war with China. “Two big-cap companies, industrials and global in nature, beating estimates, and the takeaway being that fundamentals remain strong for corporate America,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. About 18 percent of the S&P; 500 companies had reported results as of Monday, with 78 percent topping profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That has pushed up analysts’ estimates for earnings growth in the quarter to nearly 20 percent, from 18.6 percent just over than a week back, making it the strongest in seven years.

I don’t think its going to indict the entire sector,” said Luschini. At 8:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 135 points, or 0.55 percent. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 13.5 points, or 0.51 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 26.75 points, or 0.4 percent. Coca-Cola gained 0.7 percent after its revenue beat estimates, helped by higher demand for Coke Zero Sugar and new flavors of Diet Coke. Verizon jumped 3.4 percent after its profit beat expectations. Still, not all results from industrial companies or Dow components were strong. 3M fell 4.5 percent after it managed to only match profit estimates. A drop in sales for the screen glass unit of telecoms parts producer Corning Inc may also add to growing market nerves about demand for high-end smartphones. Ten-year bond yields were at 2.9864 percent, still at four-year highs, but lower than the peak of 2.9980 percent hit on Monday due to a growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as commodity prices gained. Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest since November 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Shares of the world’s biggest planemaker rose 2.5 percent after its profit jumped by more than half in the first quarter and the company raised its full-year forecasts for cash flow and earnings. After Caterpillar spooked investors by warning about higher material costs on Tuesday, Boeing executives, on a post-earnings call noted that it was not seeing a material effect from raw material costs. “With earnings reports that are coming out, the focus is on the forward guidance for where the interest rate environment is going,” said William Norris, chief investment officer at CIBC Bank USA. “Investors are seeing a lot more cross-currents impacting the markets ... we knew that earnings were going to be very good and people are looking beyond the first quarter.” The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, the benchmark for global interest rates, held above 3 percent after crossing the level for the first time in four years on Tuesday, stoking concerns about higher borrowing rates for companies. Comcast rose 3.7 percent after the U.S. cable company topped Wall Street’s profit estimates and offered $30.7 billion in a bid for Sky. Twitter, initially up 10 percent after a strong set of quarterly results, flipped to a 5 percent fall on the day. Facebook which is set to report after market on Wednesday, was down 0.14 percent. Investors will watch for any update on the social network’s plan on data protection after it became embroiled in a huge scandal surrounding the misuse of its users’ data by a consultancy. “There’s pending regulation, we don’t know how exactly it’s going to play out and there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Reuters data shows that analysts are now estimating 22 percent profit growth in the first quarter among the S&P; 500 companies, compared with 18.6 percent at the start of the earnings season. At 13:08 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.18 points, or 0.11 percent, at 23,996.95, the S&P; 500 was down 0.91 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,633.65 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.34 points at 7,007.01. Financial stocks were the biggest laggards, falling 0.4 percent on the S&P; 500, after a 5 percent drop in shares of Capital One as the credit card issuer reported a drop in net interest margin. General Electric fell more than 4 percent after Moody’s changed its ratings outlook on the company. The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of short-term stock market volatility, jumped to a more than 1-week high of 18.72 points.

739,CAT,U.S. industrial shares falter on cost and trade worries,"NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial companies as a whole have been reporting strong first-quarter results, but in general that has not been enough to lure investors to their shares. Investors are focused on U.S. tariffs and trade tensions and companies’ warnings on rising costs, even as industrial companies’ profits and revenue are topping Wall Street’s estimates at a higher rate than other large companies. “It’s not the current quarter that’s the issue,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. “It’s the guidance around what they are seeing from a cost perspective and what that means for margins.” Caterpillar Inc, the world’s largest heavy equipment maker; 3M Co; and Stanley Black & Decker Inc are among companies that have pointed to higher material, commodity or other costs in their reports to investors. Since the first-quarter reporting season began in earnest in the third week in April, the S&P; 500 industrial sector has lagged the overall S&P; 500, falling 3.5 percent against a decline of 1 percent for the broader market. Industrials, which investors see collectively as a reflection of the economy’s health, touched their lowest point in more than seven months on Thursday, though the sector index closed slightly higher. The lagging share performance has come even as 81 percent of S&P; 500 industrial companies have beaten analysts’ quarterly earnings estimates and 88 percent have beaten revenue estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That compares to 78.5 percent of the overall S&P; 500 beating profit estimates and 75.3 percent beating revenue projections. The overall size of the industrial sector’s earnings beat has been the second largest of the 11 major sectors, according to Thomson Reuters, behind consumer discretionary. The share prices, however, reflect concerns over higher costs chipping away at profit margins, as well as other factors, investors say. Some manufacturers that have warned about paying higher prices for materials have cited President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. “The market is concerned a little bit about raw material cost inflation crimping margins, maybe the inability for industrial companies to raise prices,” said Andrew Meister, an equity analyst covering industrials for Thrivent Investment Management. Trump’s tariffs on metals have also stoked fears about the potential for escalating trade tensions, and investors have focused on industrial companies because of their dependence on China and other international markets. A U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Thursday for talks on tariffs, with state media saying China will stand up to U.S. bullying. “Every time it is in the headlines, investors understand that industrials are one of the sectors more exposed to trade with China,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist with Edward Jones in St. Louis. The report by Caterpillar, which serves as a proxy for global economic activity, of its quarterly results on April 24 set off the broader concerns that industrial companies’ financial results may have already reached peak levels. Caterpillar cautioned that it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased material costs and said its first-quarter profit represented the “high-water mark for the year.” Caterpillar shares tumbled 6.2 percent that day even though its quarterly profit and revenue trounced estimates. Warne called Caterpillar’s comment “almost a bellwether remark.” “Somebody says something like that and investors say, ‘Wow, it could be not just them, but everybody,’” Warne said. Despite their recent underperformance, industrial stocks still have believers, especially investors with a strong outlook for the global economy. Industrials are typically considered one of the sectors whose performance is linked to economic cycles. “As growth improves, we see these cyclical stocks, like (consumer) discretionary and industrials, performing well,” said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

740,CAT,Caterpillar taps National Grid's Andrew Bonfield as CFO,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Friday it named Andrew Bonfield of Britain’s National Grid (NG.L) as its chief financial officer, replacing Brad Halverson, who has been with the company for more than three decades. Bonfield’s appointment comes at a time when Caterpillar is fighting an IRS demand that it pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for shifting profit to its Swiss unit to lessen its U.S. tax bill. Bonfield, 54, has been National Grid’s CFO for more than eight years, during which he oversaw the company’s $7 billion stake sale in its gas grid in 2016, which was then reported as one of the biggest British infrastructure deals in recent times. He has held senior finance roles across a range of companies, including confectioner Cadbury Plc, which is now owned by Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), and drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N). In March, Bonfield was named to the board of Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L). Caterpillar said it would offer an annual base salary of $800,000 when Bonfield takes the job on Sept. 1.
