1,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Some Starbucks' workers in Chile plan strike," (Recasts with company spokesman comment)	   By Lisa Baertlein	   LOS ANGELES, July 6 (Reuters) - Some employees at Starbucks Corp in Chile are planning to walk out on Thursday over a pay and benefits dispute, but the coffee chain said the action would not result in cafe closures.	   Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said on Wednesday that unionized workers account for less than 30 percent of the company’s more than 670 employees in Chile, where Starbucks has 31 cafes, mostly in Santiago.	   “All of our stores are going to be open for business,” said Olson, who added that only union workers would be involved in the strike action.	   The union, known as the Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile, was organized two years ago and since has been trying to get the company to give hourly workers a lunch stipend, a representative told the Wall Street Journal.	   Pay for new hires at Starbucks Chile is the equivalent of $2.50 per hour and has not changed in the eight years since Starbucks opened for business in Chile, according to the representative, who said lunch costs the equivalent of two or more hours of work.	   Pay and other compensation for Starbucks employees in Chile is “above and beyond” what is offered by the coffee chain’s peers, Olson said.	   He added that both base pay and total compensation for starting hourly workers at Starbucks is roughly 30 percent higher that what is offered by comparable employers. Employees also are eligible for raises after six months, he said.	   Representatives for the union could not be immediately reached for comment.	   Union workers voted to authorize a strike on June 25. Among other things they are seeking pay increases, a $100 monthly lunch stipend and a bonus for completing labor negotiations.	   The union also is asking the company to cover 100 percent of employee health insurance costs, Olson said. Starbucks currently pays for 70 percent of the cost of an employee’s health insurance in Chile.	   The vast majority of workers at company owned and operated Starbucks cafes are not union members, but there are a few exceptions.	   Starbucks workers in Brazil and Argentina are subject to government-sanctioned industry-wide collective bargaining. One store in Regina, Canada is unionized. And in China, Starbucks works with local labor authorities at the request of the government.	   Some workers at Starbucks licensed stores in the United States and abroad belong to unions. That’s because they are employed by the grocery stores or airports where the cafes are operated.

3,SBUX,Starbucks' employees in Chile plan strike-WSJ," July 6 (Reuters) - Employees at Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) outlets in Chile plan to walk out on Thursday because, they say, their wages are so low that they can’t afford to buy lunch, the Wall Street Journal reported.   Unionized employees at 30 of Starbucks’ 31 Chilean stores plan to walk out for as many as several days the Journal reported, citing the president of the union Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile.   The starting hourly wage for Chilean Starbucks workers is the equivalent of $2.50 and has not changed in eight years the Journal said on its website, citing the union president.   The coffee chain’s employees in Chile have been pressing for a lunch stipend since they organized two years ago and in April the union presented the company with a proposal seeking a monthly lunch bonus of $100, among other requests, the Journal reported.   But because the demands have not been met the union voted to strike on June 25, the paper said.   Starbucks could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters, but the Journal cited a company spokesman as saying the company will be able to keep all of its stores open if the strike happens.

Fewer than 30 percent of Starbucks’ more than 670 employees in Chile are unionized. Two hundred of those unionized workers authorized a strike on June 25.	   Roughly 140 of those union members were scheduled to work on Thursday, said Andres Giordano, president of the Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile union.	   If 50 percent, plus one, do not show up for their shifts a strike will be called and protests will begin on Friday, he said.	   “I calculate that 25 employees haven’t shown up for work while eight have,” Giordano said on Thursday, referring to morning shifts. “Right now we’re not sure if the strike is going ahead or not.”	   The union said it will have final numbers on Friday on how many union workers skipped shifts.	   Among other things, union workers are seeking pay raises, a variety of bonuses and a lunch stipend for hourly workers. Managers in Chile receive a monthly stipend for lunch.	   Starbucks officials have told Reuters its pay and other compensation in Chile is “above and beyond” what is offered by the coffee chain’s peers, as measured against a group of 10 unidentified domestic and international companies in the food retail, apparel and tourism industries. 	   “Management already said they wouldn’t agree to any of our demands. We didn’t want to get to this point,” said Giordano. “This is our last resort.”	   Company spokesman Jim Olson said Chile’s Labor Bureau will rule tomorrow on the effectiveness of the strike.	   The Labor Bureau has to validate the participation level of the strike,” Olson said, adding it was “too close to call” for now.	   “We were very pleased with the significant numbers of our union partners who came to work for their scheduled shifts,” he added. “We look forward to having all of them back.”	   Starbucks operates roughly 17,000 cafes in more than 50 countries around the world. The vast majority of its cafes are not unionized. 	   It has 31 cafes in Chile. Most of those are in Santiago, where police have cracked down on massive student demonstrations over education standards and costs.	   “There’s no direct link” with the student protests gripping Chile, said Giordano, a 24-year-old barista and shift supervisor, who added he had to halt his university studies because he did not have enough money to pay the fees.	   Nevertheless, he did say the student protests are influential.	   “All these things are related. People are motivated to protest,” said Giordano, who has attended some of the student demonstrations.

5,SBUX,Starbucks reorganizes for international growth,"LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) unveiled a reorganization on Monday that Chief Executive Howard Schultz hopes will help the coffee chain reach its goal of one day getting half of its revenue from abroad.  Starbucks reaps roughly 20 percent of its revenue from international markets, where it has plenty of room to build new namesake cafes and Seattle’s Best Coffee shops in addition to selling packaged goods like Via instant coffee.  The company’s business currently is split between its U.S. division and Starbucks Coffee International.  Starbucks will have three divisions under the new structure: China and Asia Pacific; the Americas; and EMEA, which will include Europe, the Middle East, Russia and Africa.  Starbucks appointed a president for each of these regions. John Culver, who now heads Starbucks Coffee International, will oversee China and Asia Pacific. Cliff Burrows, the current U.S. president, will run the Americas region. Michelle Gass, now president of Seattle’s Best Coffee, will manage EMEA.  The structure will take effect by the end of September, and the executives will report to Schultz, who returned in early 2008 to restructure the company after it was hit hard by the recession and housing bust.  Starbucks, which has been reporting strong results for more than a year, will “double-down on international and put our best talent against those opportunities,” Schultz said in a telephone interview.  Under Culver, the company’s Asia unit will accelerate new store building in China. It also plans to enter India in 2012 and Vietnam in 2013, Schultz said.  The Americas will focus on Brazil, where Schultz said Starbucks does not have enough stores to capture available growth opportunities.  Schultz stressed that the executive appointments do not mean he is becoming less hands-on.  “I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “It has nothing to do with me stepping back or anything like that. It’s taking advantage of what we think is a big-time opportunity with our strongest talent.”  The company, which recently removed the text from its logo, also detailed growth plans for other brands it owns.  Responsibility for Seattle’s Best Coffee will transfer to Jeff Hansberry, who also will continue as president of Starbucks global consumer products and food service. Starbucks expects to make Seattle’s Best a $1 billion business over time.  Annie Young-Scrivner, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, will take on the additional role of president of Tazo Tea, a business the company acquired in 1999.  Hansberry and Young-Scrivner will also report to Schultz.  “As the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, tea represents an $87 billion global market opportunity and the company intends to build Tazo into a globally recognized multibillion-dollar brand,” Starbucks said.  In after-hours trading, Starbucks shares were unchanged from their close of $39.74 on the Nasdaq.

7,SBUX,Starbucks wins dismissal of worker tips lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Monday won dismissal of a lawsuit by former assistant store managers in New York who accused the world’s largest coffee chain of cheating them out of customer tips.  U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan said the plaintiffs failed to show that they had a right to share in money left in the plexiglass cube containers, known as tip boxes, that Starbucks places beside cash registers.  She also said the plaintiffs did not support their claim that Seattle-based Starbucks coerced or else required them to put tips that customers left them personally into the boxes.  According to the opinion, Starbucks’ written policy on tips lets baristas and shift supervisors, who are typically part-time hourly workers, handle and receive tip box proceeds.  In contrast, store managers and assistant store managers, who are typically salaried, full-time workers receiving other benefits such as holiday and sick pay and life insurance, do not handle tips. The policy is silent about individual tips.  Adam Klein, a lawyer for the workers, did not immediately return a request for comment. Starbucks spokesman Alan Hilowitz had no immediate comment.  The 2008 lawsuit was brought by five former assistant store managers who worked in Starbucks stores in New York City or Long Island and sought class-action status.  They said Starbucks violated state labor law by denying them tips, given that they performed similar duties to eligible workers, and forcing them to contribute to tip pools.  But Swain said the “plain language” of state labor law does not grant workers any right to share in such pools.  “Plaintiffs’ claims that Starbucks improperly retained gratuities that plaintiffs were entitled to receive fail as a matter of law,” she wrote.  The case is Winans et al v. Starbucks Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-03734.

The company, taken private in a $2.4 billion deal in 2005 by a consortium including Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, said it was offering about 22.3 million shares at a price band of $16-$18 apiece.	   “Dunkin’ Brands has been transformed quite dramatically into something new relative to the takeover. There are some very smart people directing the company,” said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com. “I think it (the IPO) will get a better-than-anticipated reaction from investors.”	   While most tech offerings, including those from LinkedIn Corp and Yandex , had strong trading debuts, companies like Vanguard Health Systems priced its IPO below its filed range, and Stewart & Stevenson LLC postponed its market debut.	   The initial public offering of Toys R US , the world’s largest toy retailer is now expected in 2012. It had filed for an IPO in May last year. 	   “The Dunkin’ brand is not time sensitive. It has developed a huge brand awareness with Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins,” said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique.	   “Consumers will travel for miles to get to Dunkin’ Donuts.”	   Dunkin’ Brands, with over 16,000 outlets in 57 countries, earned $26.9 million on revenue of $577.1 million in the year ended Dec. 25. 	   Previously part of Allied Domecq, it competes with Dairy Queen, Cold Stone Creamery and Starbucks Corp . When Pernod Ricard the world’s No.2 spirits maker, acquired Allied Domecq in 2005, it ditched the Dunkin’ Brands businesses.	   “Dunkin’ is probably recession resistant. They have a lot of growth in their business,” said BGB Securities analyst Sam Yake.	   Bain Capital, Carlyle and THL would collectively will own about three-fourths of the company after the offering. None of them are selling their shares in the IPO.	   In a regulatory filing on Monday, Dunkin’ Brands said it expects to receive net proceeds of about $348.4 million from the offering.	   Dunkin’ Brands, which expects to list on Nasdaq under the symbol “DNKN,” plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and for working capital.    	   In May, the company filed for an IPO of up to $400 million.  	   Post IPO, the company will have about 126.4 million shares outstanding excluding the over-allotment option.

11,SBUX,Analysis: Wal-Mart ruling no knock-out blow for class actions,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The end of the road for a class-action discrimination lawsuit brought by female employees of Wal-Mart Stores Inc has not spelled doom for employment lawsuits facing other big U.S. companies.  A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision last month siding with the world’s largest retailer was widely seen as a blow to many other would-be class-action plaintiffs.  But some employment class-action lawsuits, particularly those involving disputes over overtime and other wage-and-hour claims, are surviving and have even been strengthened by the ruling, as judges have issued opinions arguing the Wal-Mart decision does not apply to a given case.  The Wal-Mart case centered on whether a group of up to 1.5 million current and former workers at the retailer, who contended they were paid less than men and denied promotions, was properly certified as a class. The Supreme Court said the women could not sue jointly, finding they did not have enough in common to band together.  Plaintiffs who sue en masse have more power, because they can pool resources and combine claims into one lawsuit. Following the Supreme Court’s June 20 ruling, Wal-Mart workers will now have to sue in smaller groups or as individuals.  In the past three weeks, courts and attorneys have rushed to interpret the ruling. A day after the decision, a federal judge in New York ruled that about 600 employees of Tyco International Ltd unit SimplexGrinnell can sue jointly on their claims that they were underpaid.  On June 29, a federal judge in Florida denied Starbucks Corp’s attempt to decertify a class of more than 700 workers in a lawsuit on overtime pay, saying there were enough similarities to justify keeping class members together.  That same week, a federal judge in California denied trucking company C.R. England Inc’s attempt to decertify a class of up to 1,000 drivers in a wage-and-hour class action, and a federal judge in Ohio upheld class certification in a similar case against nursing home company HCR ManorCare.  To be sure, the plaintiff classes so far kept intact or certified are small compared with the Wal-Mart group, and their lawsuits do not involve the same type of sex bias allegations. The Wal-Mart case is expected to have more of an impact in other nationwide discrimination class actions, including pending cases against Costco Wholesale Corp, Toshiba Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Cigna Corp and Bayer.  At least one wage-and-hour case has come apart in the wake of the Wal-Mart decision. Citing the ruling, a federal judge in California on July 7 decertified a class of several hundred Dollar Tree Inc employees that accused the discount chain of denying them overtime pay.  Lawyers defending companies in other types of lawsuits, including cases accusing banks of misleading investors about complex mortgage investments, are also citing the Wal-Mart ruling as they try to block plaintiffs from linking together to sue.  NOT ABOUT WAL-MART  But plaintiffs’ attorneys contend that class actions involving alleged wage-and-hour violations should not be affected by the ruling in the Wal-Mart case, formally known as Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores. They cite legal arguments about the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor laws.  “Plaintiffs’ lawyers are looking for ways to distinguish their cases from the Wal-Mart case,” said Howard M. Erichson, a professor at Fordham Law School. “They’re using other case law to show it’s easier to establish commonality than it was in Dukes vs. Wal-Mart.”  In cases involving state labor law, plaintiffs’ lawyers argue that classes of proposed plaintiffs are much narrower than the sprawling one in the Wal-Mart case. In the SimplexGrinnell case, U.S. District Judge Steven Gold upheld class certification for about 600 workers who allege the Tyco fire and safety equipment unit violated New York labor law.  “The relevant facts and circumstances in Wal-Mart have little bearing here,” Gold concluded.  Cases brought under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act are also proceeding. Class certification for these cases do not have to satisfy the same strict requirements as discrimination cases, such as the Wal-Mart lawsuit, brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.  Both the Starbucks and the HCR ManorCare lawsuits faced the less stringent certification standard. HCR attorneys asked Ohio federal judge Jack Zouhary to consider the impact of the Wal-Mart ruling to their wage-and-hour case. “This Court concludes the concerns expressed in Dukes simply do not exist here,” Zouhary wrote in a July 1 order.  Employer-side attorneys say some judges are misinterpreting the Wal-Mart ruling, keeping alive class-actions that do not merit certification.  “A lot of the judges are reading the Dukes case narrowly,” said Allan King, an employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson. “If they were to read it more broadly, plaintiffs would have to make a much stronger case much earlier in the litigation.”  ",7122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walmart-classaction/analysis-wal-mart-ruling-no-knock-out-blow-for-class-actions-idUSTRE76B52H20110712

13,SBUX,"Yum posts profit beat, raises 2011 estimate","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - KFC parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) raised its full-year earnings forecast after China helped deliver quarterly earnings for the company that topped Wall Street’s forecast.  Yum shares rose 2.2 percent after hours.  Yum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has more than 4,000 restaurants, mostly KFC outlets, in China. It is the largest Western restaurant brand in China, with far more restaurants than rivals like McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).  Based on strength in China and other international markets, Yum raised its full-year earnings per share growth forecast to at least 12 percent from at least 10 percent previously.  Investors said the boost was a signal of confidence from Yum management.  “It shows that they believe the economic haze is clearing,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors, which owns shares in Yum rival McDonald’s.  China, the world’s fastest growing major economy, is Yum’s biggest profit driver and accounts for just over 40 percent of overall profits.  Yum, which also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, is widely regarded as one of the biggest China plays for investors in the U.S. stock market. (Graphic of Yum's stock performance: r.reuters.com/kek62s)  Closely watched sales at Yum’s established restaurants in China rose 18 percent in the second quarter. That increase came as higher wage and commodity costs caused the company’s China restaurant margins to fall 0.5 basis points to 19.7 percent.  Sales at established restaurants in Yum Restaurants International (YRI) were up 2 percent for the quarter. The YRI division includes Yum’s other non-U.S. markets such as France, India and Russia.  “China is just an awesome growth engine. YRI is another and that’s accelerating,” said Tucker Brown, a research principal at Sustainable Growth Advisors, which holds Yum in its SGA Global Growth Fund.  Yum’s overseas strength offset a 4 percent decline in U.S. same-store sales.  The United States is Yum’s most challenging market and during the second quarter that ended June 11 same-store sales fell 5 percent at Taco Bell, 2 percent at Pizza Hut and 5 percent at Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The company, which is still feeling the effects of a quickly dropped lawsuit over the contents of Taco Bell’s ground beef, expects U.S. profit performance to improve by the fourth quarter.  “For the full year, we expect strong performance from both China and YRI as well as the benefit from foreign currency translation to overcome a challenging year” in the United States, Chief Executive David Novak said in a statement.  Rising food costs are an ongoing issue for restaurants and Yum said it expects higher inflation than previously thought in China and the United States.

14,SBUX,"UPDATE 3-Yum posts profit beat, raises 2011 estimate"," * Q2 EPS $0.66 vs Street view $0.61   * Raises full-year EPS growth forecast   * Shares up 2 percent  (Adds analyst comments, inflation forecasts; updates share activity)   By Lisa Baertlein   LOS ANGELES, July 13 (Reuters) - KFC parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) raised its full-year earnings forecast after China helped deliver quarterly earnings for the company that topped Wall Street’s forecast.   Yum shares rose 2.2 percent after hours.   Yum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has more than 4,000 restaurants, mostly KFC outlets, in China. It is the largest Western restaurant brand in China, with far more restaurants than rivals like McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).   Based on strength in China and other international markets, Yum raised its full-year earnings per share growth forecast to at least 12 percent from at least 10 percent previously.   Investors said the boost was a signal of confidence from Yum management.   “It shows that they believe the economic haze is clearing,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors, which owns shares in Yum rival McDonald’s.   China, the world’s fastest growing major economy, is Yum’s biggest profit driver and accounts for just over 40 percent of overall profits.   Yum, which also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, is widely regarded as one of the biggest China plays for investors in the U.S. stock market. (Graphic of Yum's stock performance: r.reuters.com/kek62s)   Closely watched sales at Yum’s established restaurants in China rose 18 percent in the second quarter. That increase came as higher wage and commodity costs caused the company’s China restaurant margins to fall 0.5 basis points to 19.7 percent.   Sales at established restaurants in Yum Restaurants International (YRI) were up 2 percent for the quarter. The YRI division includes Yum’s other non-U.S. markets such as France, India and Russia.   “China is just an awesome growth engine. YRI is another and and that’s accelerating,” said Tucker Brown, a research principal at Sustainable Growth Advisors, which holds Yum in its SGA Global Growth Fund.   Yum’s overseas strength offset a 4 percent decline in U.S. same-store sales.   The United States is Yum’s most challenging market and during the second quarter that ended June 11 same-store sales fell 5 percent at Taco Bell, 2 percent at Pizza Hut and 5 percent at Kentucky Fried Chicken.   The company, which is still feeling the effects of a quickly dropped lawsuit over the contents of Taco Bell’s ground beef, expects U.S. profit performance to improve by the fourth quarter.   “For the full year, we expect strong performance from both China and YRI as well as the benefit from foreign currency translation to overcome a challenging year” in the United States, Chief Executive David Novak said in a statement.   Rising food costs are an ongoing issue for restaurants and Yum said it expects higher inflation than previously thought in China and the United States.   Yum now sees China commodity inflation of about 9 percent for the full year, versus about 7 percent previously.   It also ticked up its U.S. inflation forecast to about 7 percent for the full year, versus 6 percent previously.   Yum’s second-quarter net income rose to $316 million, or 65 cents per share, from $286 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier.

Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf reported on Thursday that Sara Lee also plans to list its tea brand, Pickwick.   “We still don’t know where the listing will take place, and if it is going to be in Europe or in America,” said Anton Van Dijk, Douwe Egberts spokesman in the Netherlands.    “I can only say that the listing will take place in the first half of 2012.”      Shares in the company were off nearly 4 percent at $38.47 in midday trade after falling as much as 5 percent earlier.

17,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Sara Lee to list Dutch coffee brand Douwe Egberts," * IPO expected in first half of 2012 - Douwe Egberts   * Unit has annual revenue of $3 bln - media     (Adds background)   AMSTERDAM, July 14 (Reuters) - Dutch coffee retailer and grinder Douwe Egberts, one of the brands in Sara Lee Corp’s SLE.N stable of consumer products, said on Thursday it plans an initial public offering in the first half of 2012.   Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf reported that Douwe Egberts, the best-known coffee brand in Dutch households, has annual revenue of $3 billion.   No financial details were given for the planned IPO, and the company did not say where the shares would be listed.    Hopes that Amsterdam would see a pickup in IPOs this year have been dashed because of the recent market volatility. Dutch company Agendia, which markets breast cancer tests, had hoped to raise up to 90 million euros in an IPO recently but pulled the deal last month citing difficult market conditions.   Douwe Egberts started in 1753 in the north western part of the Netherlands as a small shop selling coffee, tobacco and tea, and opened its first national branch in Utrecht in 1919.   An alliance with Sara Lee in 1978 enabled it to expand and develop new brands such as its artificial sweetener Natrena and Senseo coffee.    De Telegraaf reported that Sara Lee also plans to list its tea brand, Pickwick, and said the money raised through the IPO would be invested in developing new products.  Douwe Egberts spokesman Anton Van Dijk declined to comment on the report.   “We still don’t know where the listing will take place, and if it is going to be in Europe or in America,” Van Dijk said.  “I can only say that the listing will take place in the first half of 2012.”    Sara Lee said this week it would spin off its international beverages business which includes coffee and tea, rather than its earlier plan to spin off its North American meats business. [ID:nN14210425]   Douwe Egberts is one of the most popular brands in the Netherlands and it offers a range of products including filter coffee, coffee pads, espresso and instant coffee.   Sara Lee’s competitor Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) unveiled a reorganisation on Monday that will help the coffee chain reach its goal of getting half of its revenue from abroad compared to 20 percent currently.

18,SBUX,"UPDATE 3-In a first for Starbucks, Chile workers strike","   * First strike at a company-operated Starbucks cafe   * Company says stores will remain open   * Union workers seeking increased pay and benefits  (Adds stock price, final paragraph)   By Alexandra Ulmer and Lisa Baertlein   SANTIAGO/LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) has been hit with its first strike at a company-operated cafe in Chile, where some workers are seeking pay and benefit increases, union and company representatives told Reuters on Friday.   Starbucks was quick to say that its 31 cafes in Chile would remain open despite the absence of union workers, who account for less than one-third of its employees there.   Starbucks is seen as having some of the restaurant industry’s best pay and benefits, which has helped it fend off union organization efforts in the United States, where the coffee chain has the vast majority of its sales.   Starbucks operates roughly 17,000 cafes in more than 50 countries around the world. The vast majority of its cafes are not unionized.   Chile has seen a growing wave of protests in recent weeks, led by students, environmentalists and miners.   The company is covering the shifts of union workers in Chile with nonunion employees, said Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson.   “Our stores in Chile have remained open and they’ll continue to be open throughout the strike,” Olson said.   Meanwhile, the union claimed a win.   “It’s an incredible victory for the union, and obviously very symbolic for the company internationally,” said Andres Giordano, president of the Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile union, who has been participating in protests at Starbucks cafes around Santiago this week.   About 200 of Starbucks’ 670 employees in Chile belong to the union, which called on its members to be absent from work on July 7.   The union needed 50 percent, plus one, of its members scheduled for shifts on July 7 to participate in order for a strike to be certified.   Chile’s Labor Bureau found that 62 workers were absent that day, while 57 showed up, Starbucks and the union said.   The Labor Bureau, which found the strike effective as of July 7, was not immediately available for comment.   Starbucks keeps very accurate attendance records and disagrees with the Labor Bureau’s ruling, which it plans to appeal, Olson said.   “The numbers we provided to the Labor Bureau were different and showed that the number of partners that actually came to work as scheduled outnumbered those that participated in the strike,” said Olson, who added that Starbucks was complying with the Labor Bureau’s decision.   Starbucks workers have been protesting in front of Starbucks’ Santiago cafes since July 7. On Monday afternoon, they brandished posters with slogans that included: “Your coffee would taste better if Starbucks respected its workers”.   Among other things, the union workers are seeking pay that keeps up with inflation, a $100 monthly lunch stipend, enhanced health insurance benefits and a variety of bonuses. [ID:nN1E765230]   Starbucks says its pay and other compensation in Chile exceeds what is offered by its peers.

20,SBUX,Books-A-Million in talks on Borders stores: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Borders Group Inc BGPIQ.PK has entered talks to sell a small number of stores to retailer Books-A-Million Inc BAMM.O while hundreds of its other locations could be liquidated, according to two sources close to Borders’ bankruptcy process.  Books-A-Million expressed interest in less than 50 of the book-seller’s stores, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous because Borders’ sale process is private.  It is unclear if Books-A-Million has made an official bid or if the talks will ultimately lead to a deal, the sources said.  Borders was set to be sold to a group of liquidators led by Hilco Merchant Resources if no company offered a bid to buy its business by a Sunday deadline. No party offered a bid for the full chain, meaning the bulk of Borders’ business is still likely headed for liquidation, the sources said.  A Borders spokeswoman declined to comment on Monday, while a representative for Birmingham, Alabama-based Books-A-Million did not return a call.  Interest in some stores from Books-A-Million, which bills itself as the third-largest U.S. bookstore chain, represents hope for at least a portion of Borders’ roughly 400 stores and 11,000 employees.  Borders also has the option of accepting late bids, and could go ahead with an auction slated for Tuesday despite its current lack of participants, in hopes that a last-minute buyer emerges.  As of Monday afternoon, the auction was still scheduled.  Borders, which helped pioneer the concept of book superstores, went bankrupt in February after struggling for years to compete with larger rival Barnes & Noble Inc (BKS.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). It has already closed 226 of the 642 stores it operated before bankruptcy.  Stores not acquired by a going-concern bidder will be sold to the Hilco group, which became the default or “stalking horse” bidder after a possible Borders sale to buyout firm Najafi Cos, which owns the Book-of-the-Month Club, fell apart last week.  Borders’ fate will likely be determined by Thursday, when it is scheduled to seek U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval of what will either be a sale plan, a liquidation plan, or a combination of the two.  Books-A-Million operates about 200 superstores and 30 smaller locations in malls, according to its 2011 annual report. It employs about 5,300 people, roughly half of them full-time, according to the report.  Most of Books-A-Million’s superstores include in-store cafes, which it owns and operates under its Joe Muggs brand.  In May, Borders announced it would end a cafe partnership with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) unit Seattle’s Best Coffee, and said it would explore deals that would allow it to run its own cafes.

24,SBUX,Dunkin' Brands may raise more than $400 million in IPO,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group this week plans to raise up to $400.5 million in an initial public offering that would help fuel the U.S. expansion of its Dunkin’ Donuts coffee brand.  The Canton, Massachusetts-based company wants to double the number of Dunkin’ Donuts outlets in the United States over the coming 20 years.  Dunkin’ Donuts has an extremely loyal following in the United States, where it touts itself as a seller of coffee for the working class. The chain lags bigger rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) when it comes to U.S. store numbers, but has successfully challenged its bigger rival in the grocery aisle.  Dunkin’ Brands, which also owns the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store brand, plans to sell 22.25 million IPO shares at $16 to $18 per share, according to a regulatory filing.  Pricing will be set on Tuesday evening and shares will begin trading on Wednesday, syndicate desks involved in the deal told Reuters.  Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006 and took it private.  If the IPO price lands at the range’s midpoint of $17 per share, Dunkin’ Brands’ market value would be about $2.15 billion.  Based on those figures, the company’s shares would trade at 3.7 times 2010 sales, a richer valuation than Starbucks, which at the close of trade on Monday traded at 2.8 times calendar 2010 sales.  “It’s a fairly high valuation, but I could make a case for buying the stock,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California.  While Starbucks has built a global following selling fancy coffee drinks to relatively upscale consumers, Dunkin’ Donuts takes pride in its blue-collar clientele.  “Low-cost food products are going to do well in a more difficult economy,” said Yoshikami, who added that he prefers McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — which has been expanding coffee sales through its McCafe program — over Dunkin’ Donuts.  Dunkin’ Donuts has a devoted following in the eastern United States, where almost 6,700 of its roughly 6,800 domestic outlets are located. The chain also has more than 3,000 international stores.  Yoshikami said Dunkin’ Donuts has huge potential, particularly on the East Coast.  The chain plans to focus on markets east of the Mississippi River, including Philadelphia, Chicago and South Florida. Longer term, it sees the western United States as a significant growth opportunity. Dunkin’ Donuts has about 100 stores in the region now.  Starbucks already has blanketed the United States with cafes. More than 11,000 of its 17,000 global cafes are located in the United States. As a result, its expansion is focused mainly on overseas markets like China.  The world’s biggest coffee chain stumbled when the U.S. slipped into recession. When Starbucks was busy restructuring its global business, Dunkin’ Donuts debuted its bagged coffee in U.S. supermarkets and drained market share from Starbucks.  The smaller company also had a successful advertising campaign featuring the slogan “America Runs on Dunkin’.”  Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys Inc, a consumer and brand loyalty consulting firm, called that campaign a coup for Dunkin’ Donuts, which has ranked No. 1 for customer loyalty and engagement in coffee over the past five years.  Starbucks ranks second, McDonald’s is third and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO is fourth, Passikoff said.  During 2010, Dunkin’ Brands’ revenue was $577.1 million and its net income was $26.9 million.  Baskin-Robbins is the company’s more international brand, with just over 2,500 of its nearly 6,500 worldwide stores in the United States.  Bain Capital, Carlyle Group Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners are selling shares in the IPO, which would reduce their overall stake from about 32 percent to 26 percent.  Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt and fund operations.  Dunkin’ Brands shares will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker “DNKN”.

Based on those figures, the company’s shares would trade at 3.7 times 2010 sales, a richer valuation than Starbucks, which at the close of trade on Monday traded at 2.8 times calendar 2010 sales.   “It’s a fairly high valuation, but I could make a case for buying the stock,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California.   While Starbucks has built a global following selling fancy coffee drinks to relatively upscale consumers, Dunkin’ Donuts takes pride in its blue-collar clientele.   “Low-cost food products are going to do well in a more difficult economy,” said Yoshikami, who added that he prefers McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — which has been expanding coffee sales through its McCafe program — over Dunkin’ Donuts.   Dunkin’ Donuts has a devoted following in the eastern United States, where almost 6,700 of its roughly 6,800 domestic outlets are located. The chain also has more than 3,000 international stores.   Yoshikami said Dunkin’ Donuts has huge potential, particularly on the East Coast.   The chain plans to focus on markets east of the Mississippi River, including Philadelphia, Chicago and South Florida. Longer term, it sees the western United States as a significant growth opportunity. Dunkin’ Donuts has about 100 stores in the region now.   Starbucks already has blanketed the United States with cafes. More than 11,000 of its 17,000 global cafes are located in the United States. As a result, its expansion is focused mainly on overseas markets like China.   The world’s biggest coffee chain stumbled when the U.S. slipped into recession. When Starbucks was busy restructuring its global business, Dunkin’ Donuts debuted its bagged coffee in U.S. supermarkets and drained market share from Starbucks.   The smaller company also had a successful advertising campaign featuring the slogan “America Runs on Dunkin’.”   Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys Inc, a consumer and brand loyalty consulting firm, called that campaign a coup for Dunkin’ Donuts, which has ranked No. 1 for customer loyalty and engagement in coffee over the past five years.   Starbucks ranks second, McDonald’s is third and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO is fourth, Passikoff said.   During 2010, Dunkin’ Brands’ revenue was $577.1 million and its net income was $26.9 million.   Baskin-Robbins is the company’s more international brand, with just over 2,500 of its nearly 6,500 worldwide stores in the United States.   Bain Capital, Carlyle Group Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners are selling shares in the IPO, which would reduce their overall stake from about 32 percent to 26 percent.   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt and fund operations.   Dunkin’ Brands shares will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker “DNKN”.

26,SBUX,Calorie labels change some diners' habits: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York City’s requirement that fast-food restaurants post calorie counts on menus led one in six customers to notice the information and buy foods with fewer calories, according to new research released on Tuesday.  While overall calorie consumption for the thousands of people tracked did not change, customers of McDonald’s, Au Bon Pain and Yum Brands Inc’s KFC were shown to make significant modifications, according to the study funded by the city of New York and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  The report, published in the British Medical Journal, is one of the first to show a 2008 New York City law, requiring restaurant chains to prominently post calorie information, changed customer buying habits.  Advocates of the law see it as an important measure to help Americans lose weight, as more than two-thirds of the country’s citizens are overweight or obese, conditions linked to health problems like high blood pressure and diabetes.  “We think, overall, these initial findings are positive,” Dr. Lynn Silver, director of New York City’s Office of Science and Policy and co-author of the report, told Reuters.  “We’re optimistic, as calorie labels go national, and consumers become accustomed to using the information that chains will have a strong incentive to offer lower calorie options,” she said.  Restaurant chains have begun to include lighter fare on their menus to help customers cut down on fat, sugar and sodium intake. The report cited examples at sandwich chain Cosi, which began using low-fat mayonnaise in its sauces, while coffee chain Starbucks made low-fat milk as its default and Applebee’s introduced a menu with dishes under 550 calories.  All of these changes came after the New York calorie label law came into effect, the study said.  Separately on Tuesday, McDonald’s said it will soon cut the french fry servings in its children’s Happy Meals by more than half and add apple slices to every meal.  The New York city report surveyed the lunchtime crowd at 11 fast-food restaurant chains, looking at receipts for more than 7,300 people 12 months before the law took effect and for nearly 8,500 customers nine months after it was implemented.  For the three main restaurant chains studied, customers on average bought 44 fewer calories at McDonald’s, 80 fewer calories at Au Bon Pain and 59 fewer calories at KFC.  Subway, the popular sandwich chain, saw a significant increase during the survey because of its promotional offer for a $5, foot-long sandwich. The other chains saw little change in their customers’ purchases.  Earlier this year, a study published in the International Journal of Obesity, found New York City’s label law had little affect on the food children chose to order.  While both studies focus on New York City’s 2008 law, people across the country are keeping a close eye on the results.  President Barack Obama’s 2010 healthcare overhaul mandates a similar requirement nationwide in an effort to curb the U.S. obesity epidemic.  In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that at least 20 percent of adults in all states, except Colorado, were obese. The CDC also said medical costs related to obesity were estimated to be as high as $147 billion in 2008.

29,SBUX,Dunkin' Brands may raise more than $400 million in IPO,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group this week plans to raise up to $400.5 million in an initial public offering that would help fuel the U.S. expansion of its Dunkin’ Donuts coffee brand.  The Canton, Massachusetts-based company wants to double the number of Dunkin’ Donuts outlets in the United States over the coming 20 years.  Dunkin’ Donuts has an extremely loyal following in the United States, where it touts itself as a seller of coffee for the working class. The chain lags bigger rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) when it comes to U.S. store numbers, but has successfully challenged its bigger rival in the grocery aisle.  Dunkin’ Brands, which also owns the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store brand, plans to sell 22.25 million IPO shares at $16 to $18 per share, according to a regulatory filing.  Pricing will be set on Tuesday evening and shares will begin trading on Wednesday, syndicate desks involved in the deal told Reuters.  Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006 and took it private.  If the IPO price lands at the range’s midpoint of $17 per share, Dunkin’ Brands’ market value would be about $2.15 billion.

30,SBUX,Dunkin' Brands shares soar in stock market debut,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investors eagerly bought the shares of Dunkin’ Donuts parent Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), sending them up as much as 56 percent on their first day of trading on Wednesday.  The stock gained almost 47 percent to close at $27.85 after hitting an session high of $29.62 during its first day of Nasdaq trading.  The company’s new market value of more than $3.5 billion is still significantly smaller than rivals McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), but the Dunkin’ Donuts chain has a devoted U.S. following and plenty of room for domestic growth, particularly on the West Coast.  The chain, whose advertising slogan is “America Runs on Dunkin’,” has set a 20-year target for 15,000 U.S. stores — more than Starbucks’ 11,000 and up from about 6,800 currently.  “The market’s really going to like the growth story,” said Morningstar senior analyst Joscelyn MacKay. “Even though the Dunkin’ Donuts brand has been around for 70 years, there’s still great potential for the brand to increase its awareness around the United States.  Dunkin’ Donuts sells coffee drinks, doughnuts and other foods like bagels and sandwiches. It is the primary growth engine for Dunkin’ Brands, which gets 60 percent of its revenue from coffee.  Dunkin’ Donuts customers are the most loyal in the U.S. coffee business, ahead of fans of Starbucks, McDonald’s and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO, according to consulting firm Brand Keys Inc.  Most Dunkin’ Donuts stores are on the East Coast, and the chain sees the U.S. West, where it has just over 100 outlets, as a key growth market.  Dunkin’ Donuts plans to steadily add stores across the United States “in a contiguous and disciplined manner,” Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters.  That means it could take “some time” to get to California, the nation’s most populous state, which is already Dunkin Donuts’ biggest market for grocery sales of coffee, he said.  “When you can build another 3,000 stores relatively closer to where we already are, I think that’s the right decision to make,” said Travis.  The chain added more than 200 stores in the United States last year and plans to add 250 this year.  “We’re going to be extremely disciplined,” said Travis, who vowed that the brand would support its franchisees, who are key to profitable growth.  While Starbucks has built a global brand selling fancy coffee drinks to relatively upscale consumers, Dunkin’ Donuts takes pride in its more working-class clientele — a group also targeted by the expanded McDonald’s McCafe coffee drink lineup.  Dunkin’ Donuts also has opportunities to expand in international markets, where it now has 3,000 outlets.  Starbucks has saturated the domestic market and is focused on building more cafes overseas in markets such as China. McDonald’s, which has 14,000 restaurants in the United States, also is eyeing international growth.  The Baskin-Robbins ice cream chain is Dunkin’ Brands’ more international brand, with just over 2,500 of its nearly 6,500 worldwide stores in the United States. The chain contributes about one-fourth of company revenue, and its closely watched sales at established U.S. restaurants have been falling for some time.  Baskin-Robbins’ U.S. business is in the middle of a revival, and its same-restaurant sales are improving under new leadership, Travis said.  Canton, Massachusetts-based Dunkin’ Brands sold $422.75 million worth of stock on Tuesday in the biggest initial public offering of the week. The IPO price of $19 a share landed above the expected range of $16 to $18.  Morningstar’s MacKay said she wasn’t surprised to see the shares price above the expected range and pop in their first trading day, given that other popular restaurant chains are richly valued.  Her fair value estimate of $17 per share for Dunkin’ Brands implies a price-to-earnings ratio of around 24 times fiscal 2011 earnings. That compared with multiples of 50 for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and about 30 for both Panera Bread Co PNRA.O and Starbucks, she said.  Lawrence Levine, managing director at accounting firm RSM McGladrey, said the market is pricing Dunkin’ Brands and Starbucks nearly the same at an enterprise level — which he says is a better yardstick since Dunkin’ Brands has more debt than Starbucks and, unlike the world’s biggest cafe chain, does not own most of its stores.  Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006.

32,SBUX,Buyers exit market before House debt plan vote,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks faded in the afternoon on Thursday to end mostly lower, with investors skeptical a key vote by Congress would lead to a deal to avoid a U.S. default.  The S&P 500 fell for a fourth straight day as buyers kept to the sidelines while lawmakers tried to hash out an agreement on the deficit.  A vote on a Republican-led bill to raise the debt limit was expected in the U.S. House of Representatives after the close of trading on Thursday. The Democrat-controlled Senate is crafting a competing bill, and Democratic leaders have said the House bill, if passed, will be defeated in the Senate.  “During the course of the day, it became clear that even if (Republican House Speaker John) Boehner does get the vote, when it’s turned over to the Senate, the Senate is going to reject it. That seems to be the reason for the selling into strength,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  Analysts said dissension among the ranks of lawmakers has also made investors less certain that a deal can happen.  The wrangling over the U.S. deficit has boosted volatility as stocks have fallen. The S&P 500 is down 3.3 percent on the week, while the market’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, rose to 23.74, the highest since mid-June.  “The lack of leadership has optimism flying at a very low altitude ... It’s basically leaving investors very skittish,” said Steve Goldman, market strategist with Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.  Stocks got an early lift from a dip in jobless claims and strong pending U.S. home sales data, a day after the S&P 500 posted its biggest fall in eight weeks.  Among gainers, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters GMCR.O jumped 16.4 percent to $102.57 after the company said late Wednesday its third-quarter sales rose 18 percent. Green Mountain was the top percentage gainer on the Nasdaq, which ended slightly higher.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended down 62.44 points, or 0.51 percent, at 12,240.11. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was down 4.22 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,300.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC finished up 1.46 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,766.25.  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, however, reported results that fell short of expectations and its stock slid 2.2 percent to $81.46.  After the close, shares of Starbucks (SBUX.O) rose 2.3 percent to $40.90 after it posted a profit that topped analysts’ expectations.  During the session, shares of Internet delivery company Akamai Technologies (AKAM.O) dropped 19.1 percent to $23.84, a day after it lowered its revenue growth target.  Buoying the market early in the day, pending sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly rose 2.4 percent in June from May and were up sharply from a year ago.  New weekly claims for unemployment benefits fell below 400,000 for the first time since early April.  Some 7.93 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, above the daily average of 7.47 billion.  Declines outweighed advances on the NYSE by about 3 to 2, while on Nasdaq losers were about even with winners.  “It’s institutional selling. It may be related to mutual fund redemptions,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.

33,SBUX,Starbucks profit up on more visits,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) raised its fiscal year forecast above analysts’ estimates after its relatively well-heeled customers visited more often and shook off price increases in the latest quarter.  Shares in the world’s biggest coffee chain rose 1.6 percent on Thursday after it also reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third-quarter ended July 3.  Sales at U.S. cafes open at least 13 months jumped 8 percent in the latest quarter, more than the 5.3 percent rise analysts expected.  The world’s biggest coffee chain gets roughly 80 percent of its revenue from the United States, where traffic was up 6 percent and average spending per visit rose 2 percent.  Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters that menu price increases accounted for the bigger part of the rise in spending, but also that customers were buying more food.  Starbucks targets more affluent consumers than the typical U.S. fast-food chain.  Those customers have fared better than their lower-income counterparts as the U.S. economy sputters, and they have resumed spending on premium items like $4 lattes and organic foods — as evidenced by strong same-store sales results from chains like Starbucks, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O.  Same-restaurant sales rose 5 percent for Starbucks’ international business during the quarter.

Shares of the world’s biggest coffee chain rose 1.6 percent on Thursday after it also reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third-quarter ended July 3.   Sales at U.S. cafes open at least 13 months jumped 8 percent in the latest quarter, more than the 5.3 percent rise analysts expected.   The company gets roughly 80 percent of its revenue from the United States, where traffic was up 6 percent and average spending per visit rose 2 percent.   Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters that menu price increases accounted for the bigger part of the rise in spending, but also that customers were buying more food.   Starbucks targets more affluent consumers than the typical U.S. fast-food chain.   Those customers have fared better than their lower-income counterparts as the U.S. economy sputters, and they have resumed spending on premium items like $4 lattes and organic foods — as evidenced by strong same-store sales results from chains like Starbucks, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O. [ID:nN1E76I1KI] [ID:nN1E76P2FD]   Same-restaurant sales rose 5 percent for Starbucks’ international business during the quarter.   Starbucks shares, which also have benefited from a massive restructuring that shuttered more than 900 cafes and slashed costs, are up 60 percent from a year ago.

The S&P 500 fell for a fourth straight day as buyers kept to the sidelines while lawmakers tried to hash out an agreement on the deficit.   A vote on a Republican-led bill to raise the debt limit was expected in the U.S. House of Representatives after the close of trading on Thursday. The Democrat-controlled Senate is crafting a competing bill, and Democratic leaders have said the House bill, if passed, will be defeated in the Senate. For details, see [ID:nN1E76R004]   “During the course of the day, it became clear that even if (Republican House Speaker John) Boehner does get the vote, when it’s turned over to the Senate, the Senate is going to reject it. That seems to be the reason for the selling into strength,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.   Analysts said dissension among the ranks of lawmakers has also made investors less certain that a deal can happen.   The wrangling over the U.S. deficit has boosted volatility as stocks have fallen. The S&P 500 is down 3.3 percent on the week, while the market’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, rose to 23.74, the highest since mid-June.  “The lack of leadership has optimism flying at a very low altitude ... It’s basically leaving investors very skittish,” said Steve Goldman, market strategist with Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.   Stocks got an early lift from a dip in jobless claims and strong pending U.S. home sales data, a day after the S&P 500 posted its biggest fall in eight weeks.   Among gainers, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters GMCR.O jumped 16.4 percent to $102.57 after the company said late Wednesday its third-quarter sales rose 18 percent. Green Mountain was the top percentage gainer on the Nasdaq, which ended slightly higher.   The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended down 62.44 points, or 0.51 percent, at 12,240.11. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was down 4.22 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,300.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC finished up 1.46 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,766.25.   Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, however, reported results that fell short of expectations and its stock slid 2.2 percent to $81.46. [ID:nN1E76Q1J6]   After the close, shares of Starbucks (SBUX.O) rose 2.3 percent to $40.90 after it posted a profit that topped analysts’ expectations. [ID:nN1E76R1U9]   During the session, shares of Internet delivery company Akamai Technologies (AKAM.O) dropped 19.1 percent to $23.84, a day after it lowered its revenue growth target.   Buoying the market early in the day, pending sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly rose 2.4 percent in June from May and were up sharply from a year ago. [ID:nN1E76R0HY]   New weekly claims for unemployment benefits fell below 400,000 for the first time since early April. [ID:nN1E76Q1FC] [ID:nLLASIE70L]   Some 7.93 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, above the daily average of 7.47 billion.   Declines outweighed advances on the NYSE by about 3 to 2, while on Nasdaq losers were about even with winners.  “It’s institutional selling. It may be related to mutual fund redemptions,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.

Concerns of a possible downgrade of the U.S. credit rating have been weighing on global equities.  “While I think the odds are close to zero that the debt ceiling doesn’t get raised with a spending cut plan of some sort, I can’t say with any confidence how the markets will respond to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating — the credit rating of the largest economy in the world with its currency as the world’s biggest medium of exchange and its level of interest rates being considered the risk-free rate,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.

39,SBUX,Dunkin' Brands shares soar in stock market debut,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investors hungry for restaurant growth gobbled up shares in Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) on its Wednesday debut, betting its popular coffee-and-breakfast chain will outpace rivals like Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) in U.S. market growth.  Shares in Dunkin’ Brands jumped as much as 56 percent on their first day of trading and closed at $27.85 — a gain of 47 percent.  The company’s unpretentious Dunkin’ Donuts brand drives its growth, has devoted fans and has plenty of room for domestic expansion, particularly west of the Mississippi River.  But some analysts warn that bitter competition looms in the coffee and other beverage business that accounts for 60 percent of revenue at Dunkin’ Donuts.  “It’s soon to be a battle for share as opposed to taking advantage of a growth market,” said Bob Goldin, executive vice president at food consulting firm Technomic.  Goldin said that McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — which has boosted profits of late by selling coffee, smoothies and other new drinks — also is a “hugely formidable” foe. Beyond that, he said, convenience stores all around the United States are expanding specialty coffee sales.  When the closing bell rang on Wall Street on Wednesday, Dunkin’ Brands had a market value of more than $3.5 billion.  “It’s a very rich multiple. They’re going to have to have a solid top and bottom line growth story to justify it,” Goldin said.  Morningstar senior analyst Joscelyn MacKay said Wednesday’s share pop showed how much Wall Street likes Dunkin’ Donuts’ growth prospects .  While Starbucks built a global brand selling fancy coffee drinks to relatively upscale consumers, Dunkin’ Donuts takes pride in its more working-class clientele — a group also targeted by the expanded McDonald’s McCafe coffee lineup.  Dunkin’ Donuts sells coffee drinks and other foods like bagels and sandwiches. It has set a 20-year target for 15,000 U.S. stores — more than Starbucks’ 11,000 and up from about 6,800 currently.  Most of its stores are on the East Coast, and the chain sees the U.S. West, where it has just over 100 outlets, as a key growth market.  Dunkin’ Donuts customers already are the most loyal in the U.S. coffee business, ahead of fans of Starbucks, McDonald’s and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO, according to consulting firm Brand Keys Inc.  “Even though the Dunkin’ Donuts brand has been around for 70 years, there’s still great potential for the brand to increase its awareness around the United States,” MacKay said.  Dunkin’ Brands’ Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters that he plans to steadily add Dunkin’ Donuts stores across the United States “in a contiguous and disciplined manner”.  That means it could take “some time” to get to California, the nation’s most populous state, which already is the biggest market for grocery sales of Dunkin’ Donuts packaged coffee.  “We’re going to be extremely disciplined,” said Travis, who added that Dunkin’ Donuts plans to open 250 more U.S. restaurants this year.  Starbucks already has saturated the domestic market and is focused on building more cafes overseas in markets such as China. McDonald’s, which has 14,000 restaurants in the United States, also is eyeing international growth.  Dunkin’ Donuts has opportunities to expand in international markets, where it now has 3,000 outlets, and will certainly run into those familiar rivals in the process.  Canton, Massachusetts-based Dunkin’ Brands sold $422.8 million worth of stock on Tuesday in the biggest initial public offering of the week. The IPO price of $19 a share landed above the expected range of $16 to $18.  Morningstar’s MacKay said her fair value estimate of $17 per share for Dunkin’ Brands implied a price-to-earnings ratio of around 24 times fiscal 2011 earnings. That compared with multiples of 50 for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and about 30 for both Panera Bread Co PNRA.O and Starbucks, she said.  Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006. They have kept a large stake in the company.  JPMorgan (JPM.N), Barclays Capital (BARC.L), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) were lead underwriters on the IPO.

The IPO price of $19 a share landed above the expected range of $16 to $18.   Morningstar’s MacKay said her fair value estimate of $17 per share for Dunkin’ Brands implied a price-to-earnings ratio of around 24 times fiscal 2011 earnings. That compared with multiples of 50 for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and about 30 for both Panera Bread Co PNRA.O and Starbucks, she said.   Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group [CYL.UL] and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006. They have kept a large stake in the company.   JPMorgan (JPM.N), Barclays Capital (BARC.L), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) were lead underwriters on the IPO.

41,SBUX,"Starbucks raises outlook, pins hopes on the affluent","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) raised its fiscal year forecast above Wall Street’s estimates, banking on its relatively well-heeled customers visiting more often and shaking off price increases.  The world’s biggest coffee chain, which is coming off a years-long restructuring that involved closing poorly performing stores to rekindle growth, on Thursday reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings.  Seattle-based Starbucks joined a raft of other premium-positioned companies — including burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O — in reporting out-sized same-store sales gains.  “The higher end is alive and well,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller. Steakhouses and seafood restaurants also had strong results, he said.  “Reports of the consumer’s demise were greatly exaggerated,” said Miller, who added that McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and other restaurant chains showed surprising health during the latest quarter.  Sales at Starbucks’ U.S. cafes open at least 13 months, and which yield about four-fifths of its revenue, jumped 8 percent in its fiscal third-quarter ended July 3. Analysts expected a 5.3 percent increase.  Traffic in its home market climbed 6 percent, while average spending per visit rose 2 percent.  Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters menu price increases accounted for the bigger part of the rise in spending, but customers were also buying more food.  Starbucks targets more affluent consumers than the typical U.S. fast-food chain. Those customers have fared better than their lower-income counterparts as the U.S. economy sputters, and they have resumed spending on discretionary items like $4 lattes and organic foods.  CATERING TO THE WELL-HEELED  Starbucks shares, which have benefited from a massive restructuring that slashed costs and shut over 900 poorly performing cafes around the world, are up 60 percent from a year ago. On Thursday, it said it would be adding a net 800 stores globally in 2012.  That expansion comes despite high unemployment and the uncertain outcome of the U.S. debt ceiling debate weighing on the minds of consumers.  Upscale diners seem less wary. Chipotle, which offers naturally-raised meats and organic produce where possible, saw same-restaurant sales jump 10 percent in the most recent quarter. Whole Foods, top U.S. seller of organic food products, said its identical-store sales jumped 8.1 percent.  The gains at Starbucks, Chipotle and Whole Foods outpaced a 4.5 percent rise in U.S. same-restaurant sales at McDonald’s, one of the restaurant industry’s top performers and the leader among fast-food chains.  “Our results are a little bit in contrast to what I still believe to be an uncertain and fragile environment out there,” Alstead said.  Wall Street also was upbeat about the coffee chain’s new partnership with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O, whose popular Keurig machines control about 80 percent of the fast-growing North American single-serve brewing segment.  The companies plan to begin selling Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea for Keurig machines at wholesale clubs, drugstores and supermarkets in North America this autumn, in time for the important winter holiday season.  Alstead said the partnership would generate 3 cents to 5 cents in incremental earnings per share in fiscal 2012.  Green Mountain shares soared more than 16 percent on Thursday, one day after it said that deals with the likes of Starbucks and newly public Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) would brew up bigger profits.  Seattle-based Starbucks boosted its earnings forecast for this fiscal year to $1.50-$1.51 per share from $1.46 to $1.48 a share, previously. Analysts, on average, were expecting a fiscal 2011 profit of $1.50 per share.  It also forecast a 15 percent to 20 percent increase in earnings per share in 2012 and a 10 percent increase in revenue. The forecast is based on mid-single digit comparable store sales growth and the opening of net 800 new stores.  The 2012 forecast includes the expected contribution from the Green Mountain deal.  Starbucks’ third-quarter net income rose 34 percent to $279.1 million, or 36 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 12 percent to $2.93 billion.  Shares were up 1.3 percent to $40.50 in after-hours trade. That gain came after the shares added 2.6 percent in regular Nasdaq trade on Thursday.

43,SBUX,"Dunkin' Donuts, Baskin-Robbins eye price increases","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Wednesday its franchisees are raising prices at Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins stores to help cover the higher costs of key ingredients such as coffee and milk.  The shares of the company, which had its initial public offering last week, were down 4 percent after it also reported profits in the most recent quarter were down slightly from a year ago.  Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees raised some prices during the second quarter, largely due to the spike in coffee costs, Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin’ Brands and president of Dunkin’ Donuts, said on a conference call.  “However, many of them chose not to raise coffee prices, but to focus price increases on our more differentiated products, such as breakfast sandwiches and cold beverages,” Travis said.  “For Baskin-Robbins, we anticipate ice cream dairy ingredients will remain at current high levels,” he said.  Owners of Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops plan to raise prices in the third quarter as the parent company also works to lower commodity costs by taking steps such as using secondary suppliers and negotiating contracts.  Dunkin’ Brands’ second-quarter net income slipped to $17.2 million from $17.3 million, a year earlier, while adjusted profit fell to $24.7 million from $25.6 million.  Revenue rose more than 4 percent to $157 million.  The Canton, Massachusetts-based company said same-store sales at all of its established U.S. stores were up 3.2 percent for the quarter.  That included a 3.8 percent rise at Dunkin’ Donuts, as customers spent more per visit, and a 2.8 percent drop at Baskin-Robbins, where sales were hurt by severe winter weather.  The U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts business accounts for the lion’s share of sales at Dunkin’ Brands.  Dunkin’ Donuts customers rank as the most loyal in the U.S. coffee segment, ahead of Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO, and the chain plans to more than double its U.S. outlets from roughly 6,800 over the next 20 years.  U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts stores have begun selling so-called “K-cups” filled with the brand’s coffee for use with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s GMCR.O popular Keurig single-cup brewing machine. That product is expected to boost sales.  The K-cups will be available only at Dunkin’ Donuts stores, Travis said.  Dunkin’ Donuts, which sells coffee drinks and food such as bagels and breakfast sandwiches, also has more than 3,000 international stores.  Dunkin’ Brands made its debut as a publicly traded company last week and its shares jumped as much as 56 percent in their first day of trading.  Chief Financial Officer Neil Moses said the company used most of the proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt.  As a result, Moses said, Dunkin’ Brands reduced its debt to $1.5 billion from $1.88 billion and cut its annual interest expense by half to around $60 million.

47,SBUX,UPDATE 2-Starbucks says Chile union has ended strike," * Company says will welcome back striking workers   * Union held news conference announcing strike end  (Adds background, bylines, stock activity)   By Lisa Baertlein and Alexandra Ulmer   LOS ANGELES/SANTIAGO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said the union representing striking workers in Chile held a news conference on Friday announcing the end of their strike.   In July, the nearly 200-member strong union in Chile launched Starbucks’ first strike at company-owned stores, seeking pay that keeps up with inflation, a $100 monthly lunch stipend, as well as other benefits. [ID:nN1E76E16I]   Fewer than 30 percent of Starbucks’ more than 670 employees in Chile are unionized. Late last month, three leaders of the union began a hunger strike to force a resolution.   Starbucks’ 31 cafes have remained open during the strike, which coincided with a wave of what have become violent protests in Chile, led by students, environmentalists and miners. [ID:nN1E77328Z]   Representatives from the union were not immediately available for comment. On Thursday, Chile’s Starbucks union said on Twitter that it would end its strike without reaching any agreement with the company.   “We’re focused on welcoming back our unionized partners,” Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson told Reuters. “We are glad they announced this and are looking forward to formal notification.”   Starbucks executives previously said returning workers would receive the same compensation and have the same seniority as before. [ID:nN1E76P2FP]   Starbucks has maintained that its pay and other compensation in Chile — which includes stock awards, merit increases and comprehensive health coverage for full- and part-time workers — is “above and beyond” what is offered by the coffee chain’s peers in that market.   “We negotiated in good faith the whole way through,” Olson said.   Starbucks, which has roughly 17,000 mostly nonunion cafes around the world, plans to open 8 more cafes in Chile this year.   Shares in the company were up 1.1 percent at $37.32 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

John Tilak   TORONTO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Tim Hortons Inc’s THI.TO THI.N profit rose 1.5 percent as Canada’s largest restaurant chain benefited from strong U.S. sales and passed along higher coffee costs to its customers, sending its shares higher.   The outperformance in the United States, a smaller market for the company than Canada, was a sign that the retailer was finally making headway in the cutthroat market.   Tim Hortons has invested heavily in advertising campaigns and promotions in the United States, where consumers are only starting to get familiar with a brand that is a household name north of the border.   Investors are focused on the lucrative U.S. market as it has the potential to become bigger than Canada, where the Tim Hortons name is virtually synonymous with coffee. [ID:nN13121814]   Sales at its established stores rose 3.8 percent in Canada, where price increases helped and it introduced fruit smoothies and other new products.   In the United States, same-store sales rose 6.6 percent, helped by advertising campaigns that increased visibility.   “The performance in the United States was outstanding,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. The U.S. same-store sales growth was one of the strongest — if not the strongest — in the North American quick-service industry, he added.   Tim Hortons has in the past struggled to replicate its Canadian success in the United States, where it has had to pull back and shut stores. It is now primarily focused on nine U.S. states, including New York, Michigan and Pennsylvania.   “We plan to go about aggressively opening new stores,” Executive Chairman Paul House said of the company’s plans in the United States, which he said was a growth market.   “We’re getting more and more name recognition everyday,” he said in an interview with Reuters.   Second-quarter earnings rose to C$95.5 million ($95.5 million), or 58 Canadian cents a share, from C$94.1 million, or 54 Canadian cents a share, a year ago. The results included a 3-cent charge due to expenses related to the CEO departure.   Excluding the charge, the company would have met market estimates of 61 Canadian cents a share.   Revenue rose 10 percent to C$702.8 million, compared with the average analyst estimate of C$708.5 million.   The company is yet to announce a replacement for former Chief Executive Donald Schroeder, who left abruptly in May.   “You don’t like to go through what we went through. But we’re in good terms with Don,” said House, who is also serving as the interim CEO.   The board is in the very early stage of the CEO search but has made progress, House said, declining to offer a timeline.   International experience is a nice-to-have but not essential on the new CEO’s resume, House said.   “You want someone that can fit the culture. We don’t want someone to come in and try to fix a broken company, because it’s not (one),” he told Reuters.   “It’s highly likely that the person will have great knowledge of the U.S. market,” he said.   The business continues to chug along with little impact from Schroeder’s exit, and the company will keep passing on the price increases to its customers, Yarbrough said.   “Price increases are the nature of the beast that will continue,” he said.   Tim Hortons competes with McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Second Cup (SCU.TO), a Canadian coffee shop chain.   The company’s stock was up 1.2 percent at C$44.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and up 2.3 percent at $44.45 on the New York Stock Exchange.

50,SBUX,Starbucks CEO urges halt to U.S. political donations,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz is winning support for his call to withhold political contributions from U.S. lawmakers until they strike a “fair, bipartisan” deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending.  Schultz recently led the world’s biggest coffee chain through a painful but successful restructuring that returned it to growth. In his letter on Monday, he also challenged fellow U.S. business leaders to do their part by hiring workers to give the national economy a much-needed jolt.  NYSE Euronext NYX.N Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer and Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ.O) Group Chief Executive Robert Greifeld already have pledged their support.  “I think that Howard’s idea is a great one, and I have told him that he can count on me,” Greifeld wrote in an email to Nasdaq company leaders.  Schultz’s effort comes as wealthy business leaders step up to challenge U.S. politicians who put their partisan bickering on display during the recent debt ceiling debate. That performance helped send consumer confidence to a more than three decade low and was cited when Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating.  This weekend, New York Times columnist Joe Nocera wrote a piece about Schultz’s call to boycott campaign contributions. The paper followed that up with an editorial in which revered billionaire investor Warren Buffett called for the United States to raise taxes for mega-rich individuals — including Buffett himself.  “These are two well-respected CEOs and they’re on to something,” said Todd Morgan, founder and senior managing director of Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles, whose firm manages money for families with $20 million or more.  “I think you will get other business leaders following their lead to encourage Washington to take some bold steps, which could inspire more confidence in the economy of our country,” Morgan said.

51,SBUX,Starbucks CEO urges halt to US political donations," * Urges U.S. CEOs to boost economy by hiring workers   * Wins support from CEOs at Nasdaq and NYSE   By Lisa Baertlein   LOS ANGELES, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz is winning support for his call to withhold political contributions from U.S. lawmakers until they strike a “fair, bipartisan” deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending.   Schultz recently led the world’s biggest coffee chain through a painful but successful restructuring that returned it to growth. In his letter on Monday, he also challenged fellow U.S. business leaders to do their part by hiring workers to give the national economy a much-needed jolt.   NYSE Euronext NYX.N Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer and Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ.O) Group Chief Executive Robert Greifeld already have pledged their support.   “I think that Howard’s idea is a great one, and I have told him that he can count on me,” Greifeld wrote in an email to Nasdaq company leaders.   Schultz’s effort comes as wealthy business leaders step up to challenge U.S. politicians who put their partisan bickering on display during the recent debt ceiling debate. That performance helped send consumer confidence to a more than three decade low and was cited when Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating.   This weekend, New York Times columnist Joe Nocera wrote a piece about Schultz’s call to boycott campaign contributions. The paper followed that up with an editorial in which revered billionaire investor Warren Buffett called for the United States to raise taxes for mega-rich individuals — including Buffett himself. [ID:nN1E77E1JO]   “These are two well-respected CEOs and they’re on to something,” said Todd Morgan, founder and senior managing director of Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles, whose firm manages money for families with $20 million or more.   “I think you will get other business leaders following their lead to encourage Washington to take some bold steps, which could inspire more confidence in the economy of our country,” Morgan said.   In his letter on Monday, Schultz invited executives to join him in a “pledge to withhold any further campaign contributions to the President and all members of Congress until a fair, bipartisan deal is reached that sets our nation on stronger long-term fiscal footing.”   Schultz also urged fellow CEOs to invest in projects or new products that will perk up the economy at a time when fear and uncertainty have made businesses unwilling to invest, consumers unwilling to spend and banks unwilling to lend.   “Record levels of cash are piling up in corporate treasuries, idling,” he said. “The only way to break this cycle of fear is to break it.”   From January through August of this year, Starbucks has hired 36,000 new employees in the United States and Canada, 15 percent more than in the same period a year ago.

53,SBUX,UPDATE 3-Smucker moves first to cut Folgers coffee prices," * Smucker’s move to put pressure on rivals to cut prices  * Smucker’s first to cut prices after series of increases  (Adds futures price, Kraft comment, background, updated FACTBOX link, bylines, datelines)  By Marcy Nicholson and Mihir Dalal  NEW YORK/BANGALORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Top U.S. packaged coffee maker J M Smucker Co (SJM.N) on Tuesday cut coffee prices by 6 percent for most of its brands, including its flagship Folgers, the first major roaster to do so after 15 months of hikes, putting pressure on its rivals to follow suit.  Arabica coffee futures KCc2 trading on ICE soared to a 34-year high in May at $3.0890 per lb, more than doubling during a steady, 11-month rally. Prices soared on a combination of tight supplies of washed arabica beans and speculative buying.  The market has since dropped around 20 percent, with the December contract down 1 cent at $2.4840 per lb at 10:24 a.m. EDT (1424 GMT).  Smucker, is the trendsetter for coffee list prices, and raised its prices four times between May 2010 and May 2011, increasing its costs to shoppers by a total of 38 percent. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  FACTBOX on recent coffee price history [ID:nL3E7GO1RJ] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  Smucker’s price cut includes the Dunkin’ Donuts branded coffee it is licensed to sell in retail stores. This move comes after Dunkin Donuts (DNKN.O), which went public in July, said it planned to raise its coffee prices at its stores earlier this month.  The rising costs led companies across the board, such as Starbucks (SBUX.O), Green Mountain Coffee GMCR.O and Nestle’s NESN.VX premium portioned coffee brand Nespresso to pass on the costs to shoppers, as well as smaller roasters.  With U.S. shoppers facing high fuel costs and food prices amid recent talk of a the possibility of a “double-dip” recession, Smucker’s move will pressure rivals such as Kraft’s KFT.N Maxwell House to cut their prices.  A Kraft spokeswoman said the company did not have anything to announce on Tuesday.  Kraft, which owns famous brands including Maxwell House, most recently raised its prices in May with its fourth increase within the year, bringing its total rise in list prices during this time to a total of roughly 56 percent.  Shares of Smucker, which reports its first-quarter earnings on Thursday, were down 1.2 percent to $75.00 on Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

55,SBUX,Analysis: Company report pace frustrates accounting experts,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Author and lawyer Michael Young jokes about the days when it took more time to get some companies’ financial statements than it did for Columbus to discover America.  Alas, those days are still here.  In an age of lightning-fast stock trades and instant communications, yearly and quarterly financial reports seem stuck on an industrial-era pace that some say was obsolete decades ago.  “Financial reporting technology allows all sorts of possibilities about which we could not even fantasize back in the Great Depression when our periodic system was put in place,” said Young, a partner at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher.  Young and other accounting experts have long called for a move to real-time, online reports in lieu of quarterly earnings statements that investors now use to decide whether to buy stocks.  Cheap computing power has made real-time reports more technically feasible, but advocates still struggle to draw wide support for the idea.  The world’s six biggest audit firms — Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PwC, KPMG, BDO and Grant Thornton — advocated speedier reporting in a November 2006 report, but acknowledge there are hurdles.  “There isn’t anything imminent out there that would change the financial reporting model that we have today to make it more of a real-time model,” said Tom Omberg, head of Deloitte & Touche’s financial accounting and reporting services. “A lot of issues would have to get worked out before that could become a reality.”  Yet others say real-time reporting is worth revisiting.  “Almost any company with rational management tracks its performance daily and makes critical business decisions on the basis of data and trends that should be distilled and published for public consumption,” said Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), for example, has perfected a “virtual close,” the ability to put together a complete set of financial statements in just a few hours. Free, open-source software has allowed even much smaller companies to construct dashboard-like digital displays that continuously track sales, orders and other key figures.  That kind of data could help make the stock market much more transparent, said Paul Miller, a University of Colorado accounting professor.  “If I’m an investor, why can’t I go on the Web and see what the Wal-Mart sales are today?” Miller asked.  Instead, investors have to wait to find out what happened months ago.  “It’s a constant state of incomplete information and the consequence of that incompleteness is discounted stock prices, which means a higher cost of capital,” he added.  The SEC has been shrinking the time between financial reports since 2002. The largest companies, which once had 45 days to file quarterly reports, now have just 40 days, while their deadline for annual reports has been trimmed to 60 from 90 days. Small companies can still take 90 days to file annual reports — still longer than Columbus’s 70-day voyage.  A big hurdle in speeding things up more is figuring out how to audit real-time figures or the systems that produce them.  “If you wanted to go to a more real-time report, for example, a voluntary disclosure that companies could make to their shareholders, I don’t see how it could feasibly be done with an auditor’s report,” said Scott Whisenant, an accounting professor at the Bauer College of Business in Houston.  Some companies fear that more frequent reports would keep investors too focused on short-term performance. Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Dollar General Corp (DG.N), which once reported monthly sales, have stopped that practice.  Eventually, some companies may embrace real-time disclosures to build more trust in the capital markets, said W. David Stephenson, a homeland security expert and author of Data Dynamite, a book about data sharing.  “I do think that quarterly reporting is going to become an artifact at some point and that it’s going to start with some companies — maybe banks — that have a particular credibility problem,” he said.  One change that may pave the way to more real-time reporting is an SEC requirement that companies tag their financial data with computer codes called XBRL, or extensible business reporting language, he said.  Those tags will help streamline financial reporting and allow auditors and regulators to check it more quickly.  “It would obviously be a headache for investors to try to process financial information on a daily basis, but what a real-time system would allow investors to do is step back and say to themselves: ‘What period of analysis for this particular company makes sense?’” said Young, the lawyer at Willkie Farr.  More real-time reporting might also result in smaller gyrations in a company’s share price because investors could adjust their expectations each day, he said.  “What we could do is get beyond the one-size-fits-all torture of having everything reported during earnings season,” he added.

56,SBUX,"Insight: Will Buffett, Schultz debt plans be shunned?","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Warren Buffett and Howard Schultz want to change the conversation about how to fix the United States’ economic woes. But their solutions - more taxes on the rich and a boycott on political donations - risk falling on deaf ears among fellow business leaders.  Few high-profile decision makers have publicly supported their pleas so far, and most in their target audiences decline to even discuss it, lest they get dragged into the debate.  That isn’t the case outside the corporate elite.  More than 40,000 Twitter users shared billionaire investor Buffett’s op-ed column in Monday’s New York Times calling for the wealthy to shoulder a bigger tax burden.  CNBC’s largely corporate audience backed Starbucks Chief Executive Schultz’s call to fellow CEOs to stop sending political donations until Congress and the President come up with a long-term plan for a “fair, bipartisan” deal to curb U.S. debt, with 89 percent in favor in a poll.  But public outrage will not make their suggestions reality. That would require other tycoons and top executives to jump on board to tell the Republicans and the Democrats that they had also had enough of the rancor that brought the United States close to a debt default earlier this month and contributed to the loss of the nation’s triple-A debt rating.  “Getting Washington to do something about this, getting the GOP (Republican Party) to move off their ‘no new tax’ position, no funding of our deficit problem through raising tax revenue, I don’t see how that’s going to happen,” said Dal LaMagna, an entrepreneur and investor who has unsuccessfully run for national office.  LaMagna has a history of outspokenness, but few are joining him in debating this question.  While Schultz has managed to get NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer and Nasdaq OMX Group Chief Executive Robert Greifeld to pledge their support for his proposal, it isn’t easy to find many others.  Reuters contacted more than three dozen politicians, CEOs, investors and celebrities on Tuesday to get their views on the Buffett and Schultz positions and almost all of them either declined to comment or did not return calls.  Three of the few who did are John Allison, the former chairman and CEO of banking company BB&T, Cypress Semiconductor founder and CEO T.J. Rodgers and Eli Broad, the real estate magnate turned philanthropist.  Allison said Schultz’s call for a boycott on donating is misplaced and that people should commit themselves to giving to candidates they actually support instead of donating to both sides as insurance.  “I think it’s naive,” Allison said in an interview. “If businesses and executives stop donating, does that mean pensions and unions will stop too?”  He also disagrees with Buffett’s call to raise taxes on the wealthy. Allison’s argument is that higher taxes on the rich will merely push them to move their money elsewhere, or to find loopholes in the tax system.  Rodgers, who said that more than half of his income goes to the state of California and to federal taxes, is no fan of the Buffett plan.  The CEO, who invests his money in start-ups and other ventures, said the government would “invest” the extra tax money “in pork barrel projects of dubious merit, controlled by political rather than market forces” without added benefit.  “The fact is, the country will be less well off if they’re investing my money instead of me,” said Rodgers, who added that he has “been on the Schultz plan forever” because he doesn’t give money to political candidates.  Broad heartily agrees with the plan from the “Oracle of Omaha”.  “Those of us who have had great financial success, whether we are millionaires or billionaires, really have an obligation to pay more taxes,” Broad said.  “We’ve been coddled, as he said, long enough. We have all these tax breaks and other things that 99 percent of the public does not have and I think it’s unfair. I think we need to create a more level playing field on taxes.”  Broad said he suspects most of the people who signed Buffett’s “Giving Pledge” — his push for the wealthy to give most of their fortunes to charity — also would agree with his tax plan. (So far, most have been mum.)  “We’ve all said we’re willing to give 50 percent of our wealth away during our lifetimes. One way to do it is to pay more taxes and have that money go to create jobs, reduce the national debt, do a better job of educating our people and the like,” Broad said.  Even if Buffett and Schultz fail to get more than a handful on board with their proposals, the very fact they made them may tend to help Democrats on the campaign trail for the presidential and congressional elections in November 2012.  Republicans lawmakers have resisted Democrat proposals to raise any revenue through tax increases, insisting that the government’s budget deficit only be closed through spending cuts.  “It helps Obama to have other people making the argument on why rich people need to do their share. There are so few people in the political establishment making that argument that he needs outside allies,” said Darrell West, director of governance studies at The Brookings Institution.  West said Buffett has a certain credibility that will go far in Washington, particularly if Congress gets bogged down in a debate over the expiration of tax cuts brought in under former President George W. Bush. “Anything that makes the case for a balanced approach to deficit reduction is good for Obama,” he said.

Earlier this month, Schultz made headlines when he called for business leaders to pledge not to make campaign contributions to incumbents until they reach a debt deal. The business leaders would also agree to speed up employment.  On Wednesday, Schultz released a list of 25 business leaders who had signed on to the pledge. The list included the CEOs of media company AOL AOL.N, financial exchange operators Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ.O) Group and NYSE Euronext NYX.N, and networking equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N).  Schultz said the list included those who had already given him permission to disclose their names. Most of the biggest U.S. companies, including all of the 30 listed in the Dow Jones industrials average, were not named in the list.  Schultz said the more than 100 leaders who have signed the pledge represent start-ups to multibillion-dollar global enterprises.  He also said in a letter that he would release a more exhaustive list as he received permission from more of those who have signed up.  Schultz’s efforts came as wealthy business leaders step up to challenge U.S. politicians who put their partisan bickering on display during the recent debt ceiling debate.

66,SBUX,Starbucks CEO calls for political tele-townhall,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp chief executive Howard Schultz urged Americans on Friday to join a giant “tele-townhall” next week to discuss ways to break the partisan gridlock in Washington.  In an open letter circulated via email, the head of the world’s biggest coffee chain invited “concerned Americans” to take part in a national call-in conversation next Tuesday hosted by the nonpartisan group No Labels, dedicated to fostering cooperative and more effective government.  The group, based in Washington, hopes to draw “a couple hundred-thousand” citizens to join in the 90-minute “tele-townhall” with co-founders of the organization and Schultz, to be streamed live over the Internet, No Labels spokesman Dustin Carnevale said.  The teleconference comes ahead of a nationally televised Republican presidential debate on Wednesday, and President Barack Obama’s Thursday address to a joint session of Congress on his plan for creating more jobs.  “Like so many of you, I am deeply disappointed by the pervasive failure of leadership in Washington,” Schultz, himself a donor to mostly Democratic candidates and causes, wrote in the letter addressed: “Dear Starbucks Friend and Fellow Citizen.”  “And also like you, I am frustrated by our political leaders’ steadfast refusal to recognize that, for every day they perpetuate partisan conflict and put ideology over country, America and Americans suffer from the combined effects of paralysis and uncertainty,” he said.  The letter concludes: “Yours is the voice that can help ignite the contagious upward spiral of confidence that our country desperately needs.”  The message, sent first to customers on Starbucks’ email distribution list under the subject: “A special letter from Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz,” directed readers to a website with more information about the “No Labels” forum, at www.upwardspiral2011.org.  Last month, Schultz made headlines when he called on business leaders to pledge to withhold campaign contributions to the president and members of Congress until they reached a “fair, bipartisan deal” on the national debt, revenues and spending.  He also challenged those executives to do their part to invest in new projects or products that would help spur employment and give the national economy a much-needed jolt.  Schultz said in Friday’s letter that more than 100 U.S. business executives from companies large and small have since signed on to his pledge.  President Obama and Congressional Republicans have been at odds for months over a range of issues. They narrowly averted closing down the federal government in April in a dispute over the budget, and pushed the federal government to the brink of defaulting on debt last month in a battle over taxes and spending cuts.  Schultz and his wife together donated $183,650 to federal candidates and political committees since the 1994 election cycle, according to federal campaign finance data tabulated by the nonpartisan research group Center for Responsive Politics, which closely tracks money in politics.  That sum includes $100,000 that went to the Democratic National Committee, while only $1,000 benefited a Republican, the presidential campaign bid of Arizona Senator John McCain in the 2000 election cycle.  According to the Seattle Times, Starbucks spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on Capitol Hill, including $100,000 last year to a law firm for lobbying related to food safety and menu labeling issues.

New York Times columnist Joe Nocera wrote a piece about Schultz’s call to boycott campaign contributions, and the newspaper followed that up with an editorial in which billionaire investor Warren Buffett called for an increase in taxes for mega-rich individuals, including himself.  Schultz said in Friday’s letter that more than 100 U.S. business executives from companies large and small have since signed on to his pledge.

68,SBUX,Starbucks CEO campaigns to end Washington gridlock,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Howard Schultz called on Americans on Tuesday to deluge U.S. lawmakers with demands to end the partisan gridlock that he said is paralyzing Washington.  Schultz also urged lawmakers to focus on issues such as job creation and getting the country’s finances in order.  “This is a moment in time when all Americans can become part of the solution by being heard. Step forward, do not be a bystander,” Schultz said at an appearance in New York.  The so-called “tele-townhall” meeting was accessible by telephone and Internet, and hosted by No Labels, a nonpartisan group that presses lawmakers to put aside differences.  “We need to send a powerful message to Washington once and for all that we are not going to accept this kind of fractured leadership,” Schultz told the meeting’s more than 100,000 participants.  They identified themselves as students, school teachers, entrepreneurs and a former U.S. congressman from Texas.  Schultz, a registered Democrat whose political giving has leaned left, has no plans to run for office, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said.  The Starbucks CEO last month created political buzz when he called on business leaders to withhold campaign donations to the president and members of Congress until they strike a “fair, bipartisan” deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending.  In doing so, he tapped growing frustration with U.S. lawmakers, whom political pundits have criticized for inaction on major issues such as high unemployment, lagging global competitiveness and spiraling costs for social programs.  So far, nearly 17,000 people have pledged to withhold campaign contributions on the website upwardspiral2011.org. More than 100 current and retired business leaders are among the supporters, according to representatives for Schultz.  They include Whole Foods Market Inc co-CEO Walter Robb, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, J.C. Penney Co outgoing CEO Myron Ullman, diet drug developer Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc CEO Jack Lief and steel producer Nucor Corp CEO Daniel DiMicco.  Schultz, who recently returned the coffee chain to growth after a painful restructuring that included layoffs and cafe closures, also challenged executives to do their part to invest in new products or projects that will lower unemployment. More than 2,000 business leaders have signed on.  Schultz said U.S. lawmakers needed to “focus like a laser” on creating jobs.  The virtual townhall meeting came ahead of a nationally televised Republican presidential debate on Wednesday and President Barack Obama’s Thursday address to a joint session of Congress on his plan for creating jobs.  In the debt ceiling showdown this summer, disagreements over taxes and spending cuts pushed the United States to the brink of what would have been its first debt default. That ideological battle helped send consumer confidence to a more than three decade low, and was cited by Standard & Poor’s when it downgraded the U.S. credit rating.

71,SBUX,How to play it: Potential winners on Obama's Jobs Act plan,"* THE ISSUE: President Barack Obama called on Congress late Thursday to pass a $447 billion package of spending initiatives and tax cuts to boost economic growth and generate jobs. Here are several investment ideas based on his proposals.  By Manuela Badawy  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Obama’s American Jobs Act, which he announced to a rare joint session of Congress late Thursday, includes proposals for a $175 billion one-year extension and expansion of the employee payroll tax holiday that would halve the tax rate to 3.1 percent in 2012 as well as a $65 billion tax break to encourage small businesses to hire more workers. The Act also features $50 billion in spending to upgrade highways, transit, rail and aviation infrastructure.  Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday as the surprise resignation of a European Central Bank executive board member and skepticism over President Obama’s economic stimulus spending plans weighed on sentiment.  The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 233.93 points, or 2.07 percent, to 11,061.88. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 22.55 points, or 1.90 percent, to 1,163.35, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 36.24 points, or 1.43 percent, to 2,492.90.  Consumer discretionary stocks could be helped by the announced moves to help small business. The Obama push is expected to help families with combined incomes of $80,000, said Bernie Williams, vice president of discretionary money management for USAA.  Dollar Tree stores could gain if this stimulates hiring at this income level, added Brian Lazorishak, a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel with $1 billion in assets under management. McDonald’s and Starbucks Corp. and other restaurants could benefit as well, Lazorishak said.  Small business service providers like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax and Quicken accounting software, and those related to staffing that are directly tied to employment are likely to get a boost.  “This financial crisis was a consumer-led recession, so anything that you can do to prop up the consumer and spending is good,” said Williams of USAA. The tax cut is a direct injection to consumers’ pockets.  “That money will get spent. It will get spent more in necessities, like the Targets of the world, staples companies,” said Williams, who has direct management of $4 billion from high net worth individuals. “They will have that stimulus this year and next year if that gets passed.”  Obama’s spending allotment included a healthy dose of funding for public infrastructure, an area of focus in the 2009 ‘stimulus bill,’ and a traditional area of focus for the current administration, J.P. Morgan noted in a report Friday.  The firm said beneficiaries could include aggregate-focused companies Marietta, Vulcan Materials and Eagle Materials and infrastructure-focused firms such as URS Corp., Jacobs Engineer and Fluor Corp.  Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, with $18 billion in assets, added that capital investment in infrastructure has him bullish on shares of Caterpillar Inc., Fastenal Co. and Cummins Inc..  “Fastenal, for example, is a construction supplies company. It markets globally, experiencing a strong top-line, and is shareholder friendly via dividend growth rate. This fits into the whole infrastructure play,” he said.  Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois, shared Wirtz’s sentiments.  “Caterpillar, Navistar — the big earth-moving equipment and construction vehicles — would benefit on additional spending in construction,” Sampson said.  Government-funded projects including $30 billion to modernize at least 35,000 public schools and $27 billion for investment in the nation’s highway system is “significant” for the construction sector, said Robert Gardiner of Davy Research.  “The act in its current form would be a significant positive for CRH (highways and refurbishment projects) and Wolseley (refurbishment projects),” Gardiner said.  Overall, whatever the federal government does to help states will tend to help cash-stressed local governments, which could consequently help municipal bonds.  Munis should outperform in this environment, Morgan Stanley said in a report. But too much stimulus might boost interest rates. That would not be great news for fixed-income investments like munis, which lose value as rates go up, though the appetite for yield could negate that possibility.  Whether the Obama proposal will actually get passed in a gridlocked Congress remains a major issue. Early results from investors indicate skepticism.  Shares of Dollar Tree were down 1.12 percent while McDonald’s and Starbucks stocks were under more selling pressure in mid-day trading on Friday.

76,SBUX,"Starbucks eyes growth in U.S., Europe, Russia","PARIS (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) chief executive expressed confidence in the future of the economies of the United States and Europe on Thursday and said the group was planning to open at least 200 new stores in its home market next year.  The world’s biggest coffee chain also wants to grow in Western Europe, notably in Germany and France, and is looking at expanding in Russia, Howard Schultz told Reuters in an interview.  “I am optimistic about America and I think it would be a mistake for people to underestimate the entrepreneurial spirit there,” he said.  “We will open up at least 200 new stores in the U.S. in 2012 and remodel 1,700 stores. That is part of our commitment to investing back in America and creating jobs,” he said.  The positive trend in Starbucks’ U.S. sales is expected to last over the coming months, he added.  Shares in Starbucks were down 1.7 percent at 1435 GMT (10:35 a.m. ET), however, as a grim outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve and downbeat data in Europe and China heightened fears about a global recession.  Europe, meanwhile, is urgently looking for a solution to the euro zone debt crisis, Schultz said.  “We are all aware of the financial pressures on Western Europe and the anxiety that people are feeling,” Schultz said. “I feel these problems are complex but solvable and I think there is a renewed sense of urgency to solve them.”  Schultz said his teams had identified a number of countries where Starbucks did not have a large enough presence, such as Germany where, with 150 stores against 180 in Manhattan alone, the company planned to double or triple in size.  “With fewer than 65 stores, we are also dramatically understored in France,” Schultz said. Starbucks will unveil further French expansion plans “relatively soon,” he said.  The CEO said Starbucks was experiencing success in Russia where it also had plans to grow its business.  Starbucks, which generates about 20 percent of its revenue in international markets, announced a reorganization in July aimed at helping it generate half of its revenue outside the United States.  Schultz said the company would grow organically but that acquisitions were also possible.  “We are sitting on a very strong balance sheet and virtually no debt, so the future of the company I don’t think will only be organic, there could be other things,” he said.  Starbucks competes with chains such as Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) and Caribou Coffee CBOU.O, as well as to an extent McDonalds (MCD.N) and a variety of smaller players.  Asked about commodities prices, Schultz said coffee prices were currently “at a very high level” but said Starbucks was not planning to implement wide price increases.  “We want to be as sensitive as possible to the financial pressures our customers are facing,” he said.  ICE arabica coffee futures have fallen around 22 percent from a 34-year peak hit in May. A shortage of high quality beans after several below-average crops from key producer Colombia saw coffee prices almost double last year.  Starbucks charges 3.50 euros ($4.79) on average for a tall “Caffe Latte” in Europe.  The group reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings on July 28 and said it was forecasting a 15-20 percent increase in earnings per share in 2012 as well as a 10 percent rise in revenue.

Schultz said the company would grow organically but that acquisitions were also possible.  “We are sitting on a very strong balance sheet and virtually no debt, so the future of the company I don’t think will only be organic, there could be other things,” he said.  Starbucks competes with chains such as Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) and Caribou Coffee CBOU.O, as well as to an extent McDonalds (MCD.N) and a variety of smaller players.  Asked about commodities prices, Schultz said coffee prices were currently “at a very high level” but said Starbucks was not planning to implement wide price increases.  “We want to be as sensitive as possible to the financial pressures our customers are facing,” he said.  ICE arabica coffee futures have fallen around 22 percent from a 34-year peak hit in May. A shortage of high quality beans after several below-average crops from key producer Colombia saw coffee prices almost double last year.  Starbucks charges 3.50 euros on average for a tall “Caffe Latte” in Europe.  The group reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings on July 28 and said it was forecasting a 15-20 percent increase in earnings per share in 2012 as well as a 10 percent rise in revenue.

The number of German coffee shops will be “doubled or tripled” in coming years, he told German daily Handelsblatt. 	   Starbucks’ German presence is relatively modest although Germany is one of the world’s leading coffee drinking countries.	   Starbucks has only 150 German coffee shops against 180 in Manhattan alone and a 17,000 branch global network, the report said.	   Starbucks is considering more local purchases of bakery products and other food in Germany closer to local tastes, Schultz told the newspaper. Details would be given in the coming 12 months.	   Starbucks, which generates about 20 percent of its revenues from international markets, in July announced a reorganization to achieve its goals of generating half of revenues outside the U.S. 	   Asked by Handelsblatt about the state of Starbucks’ European business, Schultz said: “Our business in Europe is still relatively healthy. In Germany the business is running good.”	   “But we can see very well that the world is currently very fragile and we are considering very carefully where and how we expand.”	   “In the next 12 months we will largely concentrate on Asia.”	 	  (Reporting by Michael Hogan; Editing by Hans-Juergen Peters)	  ",9222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/coffee-starbucks-germany/starbucks-plans-expansion-in-germany-ceo-in-paper-idUSL5E7KM0MK20110922
80,SBUX,Dunkin' international president out after 4 months,"(Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Friday that Neal Yanofsky is leaving after just four months as its international president.  “We mutually agreed that this was not a good fit for Neal or Dunkin’ Brands, and we will not disclose any further details,” a company spokesman said.  The owner of the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins chains, which went public in July, said it was searching for a replacement.  Meanwhile, Dunkin’ Donuts International will report to Chief Executive Nigel Travis, and Baskin-Robbins International will report to Chief Financial Officer Neil Moses.  Not too long ago, CEO Travis praised Yanofsky.  “Neal is a strategic thinker with a demonstrated ability to build successful companies,” Travis said in a May 10 statement announcing Yanofsky joining the company. “His vast knowledge of operations, finance and marketing make him ideally suited to lead our international operations, drive profitable growth and enhance support for our franchisees around the world.”  Yanofsky previously was CEO of Generation Mobile, a venture-backed retailer of wireless products and services. Before that, his roles included president of Panera Bread Co PNRA.O, where Dunkin’ said he helped more than double the number of restaurants in five years, and chief marketing officer of Au Bon Pain.  “While we’re disappointed by the news given Yanofsky’s extensive retail and restaurant experience, the catalyst for the departure seems to be cultural differences rather than disappointing performance at the (international) segment,” said Barclays Capital analyst Jeffrey Bernstein.  Dunkin’ on Friday announced marketing changes designed to support its international growth efforts. It also repeated plans to add 450 to 500 net new Dunkin’ Donuts stores and Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores outside the United States this year to the almost 7,000 international spots already in existence.  There are now roughly 3,000 Dunkin’ Donuts outlets and more than 2,500 Baskin-Robbins shops outside the United States.  Dunkin’ Donuts sells coffee and other beverages as well as doughnuts, bagels, sandwiches and other foods. It competes with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — two popular and well-run chains — around the globe.  Bernstein said he did not expect Yanofsky’s departure to have a material impact on Dunkin’ Brands’ third-quarter results, which are expected to be reported in late October.  The division Yanofsky led has traditionally contributed only a fraction of company revenue.  For the second quarter ended June 25, Dunkin’ Donuts International had revenue of $3.8 million, accounting for just over 2 percent of the company’s total revenue of $157.0 million. Baskin-Robbins International, on the other hand, had revenue of $27.4 million during the quarter.  Chief Global Marketing and Innovation Officer John Costello will assume direct responsibility for worldwide marketing and product innovation for both brands.

83,SBUX,Starbucks CEO saw no summer weakness,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) business is “still very strong” despite months of economic turmoil that has weakened sales at other major restaurant chains, Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters on Thursday.  “Starbucks is having its best year and our business remains strong,” he said in a telephone interview.  The comments from the founder and CEO of the world’s biggest coffee chain came a day after Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N) said diners at its restaurants, which include Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse, ordered fewer appetizers, drinks and desserts during its fiscal first quarter ended August 28.  Darden also said it expected its diners’ more frugal behavior to continue for the balance of the company’s fiscal year, but at a slightly more moderate level.  When asked if Starbucks has seen its customers respond in similar ways, Schultz said: “We have not.”  Starbucks was hit hard by the U.S. housing crisis that dragged the economy into recession. It shuttered nearly 1,000 stores around the world and slashed costs in a painful, but successful restructuring.  Its shares, which fell below $8 in November 2008, closed at $38.17 on the New York Stock Exchange.

84,SBUX,Starbucks starts fund to spur U.S. job creation,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp CEO Howard Schultz, decrying a lack of leadership in Washington, said his chain of coffee shops is helping to launch a nationwide fund designed to stimulate U.S. job creation.  Starbucks introduced on Monday the “Create Jobs for USA” fund in partnership with Opportunity Finance Network (OFN), a group of private financial institutions that provide affordable loans to low-income people and communities.  Schultz called small business an engine for job growth that has stalled and said entrepreneurs must have access to credit so they can hire again.  “Businesses and business leaders need to do more; we can’t wait for Washington,” Schultz told Reuters in an interview, adding that Americans deserve better leadership.  The Starbucks founder and chief executive caused a political stir in August when he called on his peers to withhold campaign donations to the president and members of Congress until a “fair, bipartisan” deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending was reached.  Schultz, who recently completed a painful but successful company turnaround that involved the closure of some 600 U.S. cafes as well as significant layoffs, also has asked fellow business leaders to pledge to step up hiring.  The CEO said he has been frustrated by political dysfunction in Washington and called on people in positions of power to “put their feet in the shoes of people who are being left behind.”  Labor figures due on October 7 are likely to show the unemployment rate stuck at the September level of 9.1 percent despite near-zero interest rates. Some 30 percent of the jobless have been out of work for at least a year.  President Barack Obama, facing re-election in just over a year, has proposed a $447 billion jobs package. Fellow Democrats in the Senate are looking for ways to fund that stalled plan.  While he has inserted himself into the national political debate, Schultz said he has no political ambitions.  “I have no interest in politics or political office. I’m just doing this as a private citizen trying to make a difference,” he told Reuters.  The new jobs fund announced on Monday will be seeded with a $5 million donation from the Starbucks Foundation.  As of November 1, the fund will accept donations at CreateJobsforUSA.org and at the roughly 6,800 company-owned Starbucks cafes in the United States. Donors who give $5 or more will get a wristband inscribed with the word “Indivisible.”  Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said the fund will be helpful to small businesses having difficulty securing loans in a tough economic climate.  Starbucks, which is covering OFN’s administrative expenses and the cost of making the U.S-made wristbands, said every $5 donation to “Create Jobs for USA” will generate $35 in financing for small businesses, nonprofit groups, commercial real estate projects and affordable housing.  OFN Chief Executive Mark Pinsky said the group’s network of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) has been making as many loans as possible during the current recession, which has cost one in six American workers their jobs.  “Our hope is that this will help kick-start a whole different attitude about what’s possible,” said Pinsky, who added that his group’s CDFI loan portfolios are healthy.  Starbucks earned $945.6 million for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2010, according to financial filings. At that time, the Seattle-based company had about 107,000 U.S. employees.  Shares in Starbucks were off 1.8 percent at $36.61 in late morning trading, weighed down by concerns over Greece’s teetering finances.

But analysts say the slowdown might have accelerated this quarter.

Yum said on Tuesday it raised menu prices after the quarter ended to help offset higher costs.  Yum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has almost 4,200 restaurants, mostly KFC outlets, in China. It is the largest Western restaurant brand in China, with far more restaurants than competitors such as McDonald’s and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).  Yum’s other fast-food brands are Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  Sales at established restaurants in Yum Restaurants International (YRI) were up 3 percent during the third quarter.

88,SBUX,Corporate America seeks cover in arms of small business,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Facing talk of “class warfare” in Washington and protest marches on Wall Street, some of the biggest players in corporate America are linking arms with small business in what observers see as moves to bolster their images at a time of rising public anger.  Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz started the ball rolling on Monday with word that the world’s biggest coffee chain was donating $5 million to start a fund dedicated to lending money to small businesses and nonprofit organizations.  General Electric Co (GE.N), the largest U.S. conglomerate, will also tout the virtues of smaller businesses on Thursday when it hosts a meeting in Columbus, Ohio, to discuss how to encourage the growth of mid-sized companies.  Both companies, giants in their own industries, are throwing their weight behind beneficiaries who are generally better regarded in the public eye, in hopes of picking up some of their shine, experts contend.  “Small businesses, entrepreneurs are the corporate equivalent of dolphins. Everybody likes dolphins ... It’s a good group to associate with,” said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business.  While associating with dolphins may make corporate leviathans seem cuter, it is unlikely to do much to boost the ailing U.S. economy, where unemployment has hovered near or above 9 percent for more than two years, observers said.  “It’s mostly a show. The only thing that is going to help the employment situation in the next two years is macroeconomic policy,” said Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank.  The moves come at a time of rising tensions over the heading of the U.S. economy. Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama unveiled a plan to raise taxes on people who make more than $1 million a year — a move he called the “Buffett rule” in honor of billionaire investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), who backed the idea.  Republican House Speaker John Boehner was quick to blast the idea, saying it amounted to “class warfare.”  Over the weekend, more than 700 anti-Wall Street protesters were arrested in New York after attempting an unauthorized march across the Brooklyn Bridge.  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned in his weekly radio address that the demonstrations could lead to the sort of unrest seen during the so-called Arab Spring wave of protests in the Middle East.  “You don’t want those kinds of riots here,” Bloomberg said, according to media reports.  Amid this turmoil, both Starbucks’ Schultz, who grew up in public housing, and GE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, a Dartmouth College graduate, have stepped up their involvement on the political stage, though both deny any interest in running for office.  Immelt, a lifelong Republican, in January took the helm of a White House advisory board on the economy and job creation. He has taken flak this year for the company’s expected low tax rate, which GE attributes to losses at its finance arm.  GE, which has a hefty finance arm, did benefit from some of the federal programs set up during the credit crisis to back private debt. Starbucks, whose business is not in the financial sector, did not.  Before Schultz, a Democrat, unveiled his fund, to which Starbucks is encouraging customers to make $5 donations, he had already called on wealthy Americans and businesses to stop making campaign contributions to U.S. lawmakers until they found a “fair, bipartisan” deal on the nation’s debt, taxes and spending.  Small businesses say they are largely neglected by the nation’s largest banks, leaving many entrepreneurs to rely on personal borrowing, including credit cards and second mortgages, to fund their ventures. To that extent, they welcome attention from other sources of financing, whether they be Starbucks’ “Create Jobs for USA” fund or GE Capital.  “I don’t think the banks in the current regulatory environment have the flexibility to experiment, have the understanding of small business. Their focus is elsewhere,” said Marilyn Landis, a director and former chair of the National Small Business Association. “I don’t see the banks as being significant players any time soon.”  But even so, Landis is wary when big companies rush to embrace small businesses.  “We’re going to see lots of posturing, lots of grand opportunities,” she said. “The question is if any of them will be meaningful.”  Starbucks said its only interest in starting the fund is helping the neighborhoods where it sells its products.  “Let there be no mistake: Our concern is about the communities where we do business and where our partners, which is what we call our employees, live and work,” said Jim Olson, a spokesman for the Seattle-based chain, adding that Moody’s Analytics’ top analyst had backed the idea.  For its part, GE Capital said it is just trying to promote the interests of companies to which it lends.  “It’s our customer base,” said spokesman Russell Wilkerson. “Sure, we have a vested interest here in seeing them do well.”  While companies like GE and Starbucks focus on programs that they contend can help with social ills, it is unlikely their overall actions are going to be any different from those of any major publicly traded corporation, one observer said.",10042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-corporate-image/corporate-america-seeks-cover-in-arms-of-small-business-idUSTRE79365520111004
89,SBUX,Starbucks profit-sharing to boost U.S. non-profits,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp will share profits from two of its U.S. coffee shops with non-profit groups in New York City and Los Angeles to help offset expected government funding cuts to programs for children and education.  The pilot stores for the profit-sharing program, which Starbucks hopes to expand, are in Harlem and in Los Angeles’ Crenshaw district.  Partner non-profit groups in those neighborhoods each will receive at least $100,000 in the first year, the company said.  The announcement from the world’s biggest coffee chain comes a day after Chief Executive Howard Schultz unveiled “Create Jobs for USA,” a funding partnership that will provide affordable loans for small businesses, non-profit groups and commercial real estate and affordable housing projects in distressed communities.  Schultz caused a stir this summer, when he called on business leaders to step up hiring and to boycott political giving until the president and members of Congress reached a deal on U.S. debt, revenue and spending.  Schultz, billionaire investor Warren Buffett and GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt have joined the national political and economic dialogue. Schultz repeatedly has said he has no desire to run for office.  “We are going to have to understand that for there to be shared prosperity, there has to be shared success and shared sacrifice,” he said.  The CEO, who built one of the world’s most recognized brands, said his newest community-building project is personal: He grew up in federally subsidized housing in Brooklyn.  Abyssinian Development Corp (ADC), which offers a wide selection of community services, is Starbucks’ partner in Harlem.  “If you don’t have education and development opportunities for young people, your neighborhood is going to die within a couple of generations,” Sheena Wright, the group’s president and CEO told Reuters.  The profit-sharing program could create much-needed new revenue streams for non-profits, said Blair Hamilton Taylor, who leads the Los Angeles Urban League — Starbucks partner in Crenshaw.  Taylor began working with Schultz after Starbucks shuttered one if its Crenshaw stores during the company’s restructuring in 2008 and 2009.  “It’s not going to be a million dollars a year,” Taylor said of the new program.  “But if McDonald’s decides to do this next week, and then Wendy’s decides to do it, and Burger King decides — now all of the sudden you do have a million dollars,” he said. “My hope is that is what this triggers.”  ",10042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks/starbucks-profit-sharing-to-boost-u-s-non-profits-idUSTRE7921M320111004

96,SBUX,UPDATE 2-Starbucks adds lighter 'Blonde' roast to lineup,"* Blonde will be Starbucks lightest roast to date * Blonde roast will go on sale in January * Starbucks aims to grab more market share with addition * Starbucks shares up 2 percent By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp is going “Blonde,” expanding its coffee lineup with its lightest roast to date in a move aimed at wooing more customers and capturing a bigger share of the U.S. coffee market. The world’s biggest coffee company is known for its dark roasts, which have prompted some critics to say the chain’s coffee tastes burned. The new, lighter roast unveiled on Tuesday is milder in body and acidity than Starbucks’ traditional coffees. Executives said customers had been asking for a lighter roast and they expect Blonde to appeal to a broad audience. Mass-market competitors McDonald’s Corp and Dunkin’ Donuts offer milder brewed coffees and in recent years have added lattes, mochas and other sorts of “fancy” espresso drinks popularized by Starbucks. “This is a significant opportunity for Starbucks to gain a greater share of the brewed coffee market — both in our stores and down the coffee aisle,” Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks Americas, said in a statement. The U.S. packaged coffee category is valued at $5.6 billion. According to Starbucks research, more than 40 percent of U.S. coffee drinkers — or about 54 million consumers — prefer a lighter roast coffee, Jeff Hansberry, president of channel development for Starbucks, told Reuters. Additionally, more than 70 percent of all packaged coffee sales in the grocery aisle are either light or medium roasted coffee, Hansberry said. The company will begin selling its new Blonde blends in Starbucks cafes and supermarkets in the United States on Jan. 10. They will be available in Canada in February. Starbucks cafes also will brew a Blonde blend alongside its other daily coffees. Breakfast Blend is currently the lightest coffee available at Starbucks, while French Roast is at the darkest end of the roast spectrum. Starbucks’ last major addition to its brewed coffee lineup came in 2008, when it introduced Pike Place as an “everyday” brew. Chief Executive Howard Schultz later that year said Pike Place gave the company an incremental bump in sales. The company debuted Via instant coffee in 2009 and expects it to one day grow into a billion-dollar business. Starbucks restarted profit growth in 2010 after a two-year restructuring that involved slashing costs and shuttering almost 1,000 cafes globally. Since then, investors have enjoyed quarterly profits that often topped analysts’ views. Starbucks shares — up roughly 80 percent since the beginning of 2010 — gained 2 percent to $41.99 on Tuesday.",10182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks/update-2-starbucks-adds-lighter-blonde-roast-to-lineup-idUSN1E79H15Q20111018

98,SBUX,Starbucks profit up despite economic jitters,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) quarterly profit rose slightly more than expected after the summer’s economic jitters failed to dilute the coffee habits of customers at the world’s largest coffee chain. The stock, which closed at $41.40, rose 3 percent to $42.65 in after-hours trading. Global sales at cafes open at least 13 months jumped 9 percent, better than the 6.5 percent gain analysts, on average, expected according to Thomson Reuters data. Customers visited Starbucks cafes more often during the quarter and spent more money when they did. Same restaurant sales at U.S. cafes, which account for about four-fifths of its revenue, rose 10 percent. Sales at established international cafes were up 6 percent. While coffee prices spiked, Starbucks held the line or slightly raised prices on mainstay drinks such as brewed coffee. It saved bigger price increases for more complex drinks such as blended Frappuccinos. “They’ve done a good job of readdressing the value equation,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco, who called the pricing strategy a success. Seattle-based Starbucks and upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O, each have amped up their results by keeping prices on everyday items roughly competitive, while also maintaining a premium position versus rivals. Starbucks’ fourth-quarter net income rose almost 29 percent to $358.5 million, or 47 cents per share, including gains of 10 cents per share. Excluding the gain, earnings of 37 cents were a penny better than analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose almost 7 percent to $3.03 billion for the quarter ended October 2. Starbucks shares, which have benefited from a massive restructuring that slashed costs and shut over 900 poorly performing cafes around the world, are up more than 40 percent from a year ago. Starbucks this week began selling its coffee and Tazo tea for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s GMCR.O popular Keurig machines, which control about 80 percent of the fast-growing North American single-serve brewing segment. The company expects the partnership to generate 3 cents to 5 cents in incremental earnings per share in 2012. In January, the company will go “Blonde” — expanding its coffee lineup with its lightest roast to date in a move that takes direct aim at rivals McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O). Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s each brew lighter roasts than Starbucks. They also have gone after the Seattle company’s core business by introducing drinks such as lattes and frappes. “I think we’ll get a nice healthy share of it over time,” Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters. Analyst DiFrisco agreed, saying he expects the new Blonde blends to drive incremental traffic without cannibalizing sales of the company’s traditional dark roasts. Looking ahead, Starbucks stood by its forecast calling for a 15 percent to 20 percent increase in earnings per share for fiscal 2012, or $1.75 to $1.82, and a 10 percent increase in revenue. That forecast is based on mid-single digit comparable store sales growth and the opening of 800 net new stores.

100,SBUX,Starbucks to open U.S. juice bars in 2012,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) plans to start a chain of juice bars starting next year, venturing into territory staked out by Jamba Inc (JMBA.O), in its biggest-ever expansion beyond coffee. The world’s largest coffee chain, which has made no secret of its ambitions to expand beyond its staple business, said on Thursday it bought juice company Evolution Fresh for $30 million in cash. Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz hopes buying Evolution Fresh, whose products are sold by a handful of retailers, including Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O, will give the company a meaningful foothold in the estimated $50 billion health food market. The first juice bars will open on the U.S. West Coast around the middle of next year, but the company would not say how many were planned. The chain’s name has not been revealed and it was not clear whether Starbucks’ familiar Mermaid logo — which recently dropped the word “coffee” from its design — would be displayed in the stores, which also will sell food. The CEO said the moves announced Thursday were the first of many things the company planned for the so-called health and wellness market. Starbucks is getting into a fragmented market with intensifying competition and potentially lower margins than those enjoyed by its coffee shops. Jamba, a publicly held juice and smoothie chain, has struggled in recent years. Revenues have slid as companies such as Starbucks and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) introduced competing products. Schultz said Jamba suffered after it moved toward a more commodity business and away from what popular independents do well. He argued that some successful independent juice bar operators have annual sales of well over $1 million per outlet. Analysts said that is far higher than a typical Jamba store and a bit less than an average U.S. Starbucks cafe. “We think we can build a major business,” Schultz told reporters on a conference call. Setting up a regional or even nationwide chain could prove costly and take the company further away from its core competency, analysts said. “It has interesting potential, but I don’t know if has the broad appeal that coffee has,” said Bob Goldin, executive vice president at food service consultancy Technomic. But “Starbucks is smart enough that, if it’s something that doesn’t work, they can pull the plug pretty quickly,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said. Schultz said demand is coming from people who choose fresh fruit and vegetable drinks as meal replacements, as well as from individuals watching their weight or attempting to bolster their health with dietary “cleanses.” New York City’s Liquiteria juice bar, for example, says its pressed juices “detoxify and rejuvenate.” Seattle-based Starbucks wants to sell a broader range of branded products through its own cafes, grocery stores and other retail outlets — including juices from Evolution Fresh. Starbucks took control of its business selling packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages earlier this year and has had success getting its products in more desirable spots on grocery store shelves, Hottovy said. San Bernardino, California-based Evolution Fresh sells fruit and vegetable juices and was started by the founder of Naked Juice, which is now owned by PepsiCo Inc PEP.N. It uses a heat-free, high-pressure pasteurization process it says retains more of the nutrients in its products compared with using conventional heat pasteurization. Its products are currently sold in Whole Foods and PCC Natural Markets stores on the U.S. West Coast. Starbucks plans to expand distribution into additional retail channels and sell the products in its own retail stores. Over time, Starbucks said it plans to invest in Evolution Fresh’s facility upgrades, as well as its distribution business. Starbucks expects Evolution Fresh to operate at a modest loss in fiscal 2012 before breaking even in fiscal 2013. The company, which returned to profit growth in 2010 after a painful two-year restructuring, said its forecasts for fiscal 2012 are unchanged as a result of the acquisition. Jamba shares were unchanged at $1.66 at the close of Nasdaq trading on Thursday. Starbucks, which is up about 40 percent over the last 12 months, added 1.3 percent to finish at $43.52.

The group currently has nine drive-thru stores in Britain with the first opening in Cardiff in 2008, and it said on Thursday that the step up in the opening programme follows strong customer response and will establish the company as the market leader in this area. “I welcome Starbucks’ announcement, and I am glad to see continued investment and job creation in the private sector,” said British Prime Minister David Cameron in a statement. Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK & Ireland, said, “We are able to create quality jobs at a time when they are most needed and because half of our baristas are under 24 years-old, this will particularly benefit young job-seekers at a time of record youth unemployment.”",12012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-britain-jobs/starbucks-to-create-5000-new-uk-jobs-in-next-5-years-idUSL5E7MU6S820111201
105,SBUX,Starbucks raises prices in Northeast and Sunbelt,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) raised prices by an average of about 1 percent in the Northeast and Sunbelt regions on Tuesday, a move affecting cities such as New York, Boston, Washington, Atlanta, Dallas and Albuquerque. Shares of Starbucks, which boosted prices in some other U.S. markets in November, climbed 2.2 percent to a new high of $47.04 in early morning Nasdaq trading. Starbucks expects high costs for things like coffee, milk and fuel to cut into profits this year and — along with restaurant operators ranging from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) to McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — is raising prices to help offset some of that cost pressure. In New York City, prices for 12-ounce “tall” brewed coffees and latte drinks will go up 10 cents. Prices on about half a dozen other beverages also will increase, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson told Reuters. The world’s biggest coffee chain raised prices on some drinks in California and South Florida in November. Those regions are not affected by the Tuesday pricing action. Olson said the price for a 16-ounce “grande” brewed coffee, Starbucks’ most popular beverage, remains the same across the United States and has not changed since January 2011. The price for grande lattes is unchanged in most markets, he added. The Seattle-based chain has not made across-the-board price increases since 2007, choosing instead to adjust prices on a market-by-market basis. Starbucks said its pricing decisions are based on multiple factors, not just the price of coffee, which has eased lately. “These adjustments are the result of balancing the cost of doing business with competitive dynamics in these markets,” Olson said. Starbucks’ cost of doing business includes expenses related to distribution, store operations and commodities, including fuel and ingredients for food and beverages, he said. The company is also busy remodeling about 1,700 cafes. Starbucks caters to a somewhat higher-income customer, and recent price increases prompted no apparent pushback. In the fiscal fourth quarter, global sales at cafes open at least 13 months jumped 9 percent, better than the 6.5 percent gain analysts, on average, expected according to Thomson Reuters data. Customers visited Starbucks cafes more often during the quarter and spent more money when they did. Same-restaurant sales at U.S. cafes, which account for about four-fifths of its revenue, rose 10 percent. The company previously said it expects costs for commodities such as coffee and milk to reduce fiscal 2012 earnings by about 21 cents per share. Despite that, it has forecast a profit of $1.75 to $1.82 per share this year, which would represent profit growth of as much as 20 percent over fiscal 2011.

107,SBUX,"Starbucks lighter ""Blonde"" roasts debut in U.S.","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) is expanding beyond its dark coffee roots by offering lighter “Blonde” roasts in cafes and supermarkets as of Tuesday. Blonde puts Starbucks in head-to-head competition with mass-market brands like McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O), each of which has posted robust sales of its own milder brew. “We know we’re not serving those customers now. We’re going to bring in new customers,” Andrew Linnemann, director of coffee quality at Starbucks, said of Blonde. Starbucks’ own research suggests that 40 percent of U.S. coffee drinkers, or about 54 million people, prefer a lighter roast coffee. Blonde coffee beans spend less time in the roaster than Starbucks’ other coffees and as a result are milder in body and acidity. Lighter roasts are a cultural departure for Starbucks, which built its reputation on dark roasts that have prompted some critics to say its coffee tastes burned or bitter. Francisco Garcia, 53, of Los Angeles said he and five friends visited Starbucks to try the new brew on Tuesday morning. The group was equally split when it came to preferring the Blonde, he said. “To me it tasted like watered-down strong coffee,” said Garcia, who added that he usually orders Starbucks’ darker French roast. Informal reviews on Twitter also were mixed. Other frequent comments included corny jokes about ordering “tall Blondes” for breakfast - a reference to Starbucks’ name for its small drink size - and comparisons to Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. Starbucks expects the mellower new roasts to broaden its consumer appeal and ring up $1 billion in annual sales over time. “We believe this new product could be a needle mover,” said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Bart Glenn. Still, analysts said that teasing out the precise impact would be tricky because existing customers may abandon another Starbucks coffee for a Blonde roast. “It’s more difficult to figure out because with Blonde you have to figure out what you’re cannibalizing in the other beans,” William Blair & Co analyst Sharon Zackfia said. Starbucks had sales of $11.7 billion in its fiscal year ended October 2, so it will take a lot of sales for Blonde to stand out. “With a company as big as Starbucks you have to have an awful lot to move the needle,” Zackfia said. Starbucks’ last major addition to its brewed coffee lineup was in 2008, when it introduced Pike Place as a medium-roast, “everyday” brew. Chief Executive Howard Schultz later that year said Pike Place gave the company an incremental bump in sales. Beginning on Tuesday, Starbucks will offer a Blonde coffee in U.S. cafes daily. That will be in addition to the Pike Place, decaf and bold brews it already pours. Starbucks cafes in the United States and Canada also will sell Blonde packaged coffee as well as Via instant in Blonde. Zackfia expects Blonde to make the biggest splash in the grocery aisle, where the majority of coffee sales are in the light and medium roast categories. Starbucks will sell Blonde packaged coffee in U.S. and Canadian supermarkets. It also will sell Blonde K-Cups for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s GMCR.O popular Keurig machines in U.S. grocery stores. Blonde tasting events are scheduled for participating U.S. cafes from January 12-14. Canadian events are slated for February. Shares in Starbucks closed up 0.5 percent at $46.82 on Nasdaq.

110,SBUX,"Starbucks profit beats, Europe weakness hurts","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street’s view, but its shares fell as investors in the world’s biggest coffee chain focused on softness in Europe rather than strength in the United States. The company’s shares, up roughly 45 percent from a year ago and hovering near all-time highs, were off 2.2 percent at $47.26 in extended trading after closing at $48.34. Starbucks and other top-performing restaurant chains like McDonald’s Corp have been on a tear and their stocks often sell off on anything but absolutely pristine results. Sales from cafes open at least 13 months were up just 2 percent for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, versus the 9 percent gain for the much larger America unit, chiefly from the United States. Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said on a webcast that Starbucks has been underperforming internal targets in Europe — where debt worries and high unemployment weigh heavily on consumers — and that the company has taken steps to improve results there. Operating margin for the EMEA unit was 6.5 percent in the first quarter, down from 9.7 percent a year earlier. Starbucks said the margin contraction was primarily due to higher distribution costs related to moving to a consolidated distribution center in its UK market. Britain’s recovery from the 2008/2009 recession - the deepest since the depression-hit 1930s - has been sluggish. Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said results from Europe were weaker than expected, but that they needed to be seen in context. “A 2 percent comp is still pretty good considering what’s going on over there,” Russo said, referring to Europe’s sales at established restaurants. Based on its better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $1.78 to $1.82 per share from $1.75 to$1.82. “They’re being conservative. It’s so early in the year,” Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco said when asked about the company’s revised fiscal 2012 forecast. When asked if the company has noticed any evidence of softening consumer demand due to the still volatile economic conditions around the world, CFO Alstead said: “We haven’t seen it.” Global sales at established Starbucks cafes jumped 9 percent, helped by an increase in customer visits and spending per transaction. That beat the 7.7 percent gain analysts, on average, expected, according to Thomson Reuters data. Net income was $382.1 million, or 50 cents per share, for the quarter ended January 1. That was up from $346.6 million, or 45 cents, in the year earlier period. Analysts, on average, were looking for a profit of 49 cents per share in the latest quarter, according to Thomson Reuters Total revenue rose 16 percent to $3.4 billion. The Seattle-based company has been raising prices on some drinks to help offset higher costs for commodities like coffee and milk. Starbucks expects new products to build sales as the year progresses. In November it started selling its coffee and Tazo tea for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s popular Keurig machines, which control about 80 percent of the fast-growing North American single-serve brewing segment. It then expanded its coffee lineup in January with “Blonde,” the company’s lightest roast to date. That new coffee is widely seen as an answer to McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts, which each brew lighter roasts than Starbucks. Those chains also have gone after Starbucks’ core business by introducing drinks such as lattes and frappes. Starbucks, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread Co cater to relatively upscale consumers and have been outperforming the broader restaurant industry, whose overall sales are expected to lag population growth this decade.

The Seattle-based chain, known as much for the trendy urban lifestyle it represents as its costly cups of coffee, enters a market with a fast-growing middle class and plenty of competition in the small but fast-growing coffee segment. Starbucks had initially planned to have its first cafes in India open by mid-2011 but was delayed by difficulties in acquiring real estate and high land costs — a common problem for chain stores in a country where more than 90 percent of retail is conducted at one-off mom-and-pop shops. Whle the tie-up plans to take advantage of the Tata group’s sprawling presence by opening cafes in Tata hotels and retail outlets, it is also looking at other locations such as malls, railway stations, airports and offices. “We are in the process of looking at real estate opportunities at the moment. We are moving as quickly as possible and the expansion of stores will be based on the customer feedback we get,” John Culver, president of Starbucks for China and Asia Pacific, told reporters. India implemented new rules this month to allow foreign single-brand retailers to operate wholly owned outlets, but Starbucks said it has not considered changing the 50-50 structure of the Tata Starbucks Ltd joint venture. The first Starbucks shops will open in Mumbai and New Delhi, and the joint venture initially plans to invest 4 billion rupees ($81 million). The formal launch of the retail foray into India comes a year after it signed a deal with Tata Global Beverages , a unit of the software-to-steel Tata conglomerate and the world’s second-largest branded tea company, to buy coffee from India and open retail outlets in the country. “The timeframe essentially shows cautiousness. Starbucks has clearly wanted to make sure it gets the details right before entering a highly competitive market,” said Debashish Mukherjee, partner and vice-president at consultancy AT Kearney. While India is traditionally a nation of tea-drinkers, young urban professionals of the sort that work in modern offices and frequent the shopping malls that are sprouting around its cities have embraced western-style cafe culture — and prices. Cafe Coffee Day, a home-grown brand that is India’s largest coffee chain, has nearly 1,200 outlets and plans to open one cafe every third day. No.2 player Barista, owned by Italy’s Lavazza, has more than 200 cafes. UK-based Costa Coffee, which entered the market in 2008, has about 75 stores and is growing quickly. “Having an iconic brand is one of the parameters which ensures success but there are many iconic brands that have fallen by the wayside, so the pricing, experience and quality must match your offering,” Mukherjee said. Western-style cafes in India charge roughly 60-80 rupees ($1.22-$1.62) for a plain cup of coffee — less than in developed markets but far more than the 10 rupees a cup charged at a basic local outlet. Starbucks did not say what it will charge in India. Still, the organized coffee market in India — which reflects consumption mainly through cafes — is small, accounting for about $140 million of the country’s annual coffee sales of about $667 million. Starbucks entered China, another traditional tea-drinking country, in 1999 and now has more than 400 stores across the mainland.

The formal launch of the retail foray into India comes a year after it signed a deal with Tata Global Beverages , a unit of the software-to-steel Tata conglomerate and the world’s second-largest branded tea company, to buy coffee from India and open retail outlets in the country. “The timeframe essentially shows cautiousness. Starbucks has clearly wanted to make sure it gets the details right before entering a highly competitive market,” said Debashish Mukherjee, partner and vice-president at consultancy AT Kearney. While India is traditionally a nation of tea-drinkers, young urban professionals of the sort that work in modern offices and frequent the shopping malls that are sprouting around its cities have embraced western-style cafe culture — and prices. Cafe Coffee Day, a home-grown brand that is India’s largest coffee chain, has nearly 1,200 outlets and plans to open one cafe every third day. No.2 player Barista, owned by Italy’s Lavazza, has more than 200 cafes. UK-based Costa Coffee, which entered the market in 2008, has about 75 stores and is growing quickly. “Having an iconic brand is one of the parameters which ensures success but there are many iconic brands that have fallen by the wayside, so the pricing, experience and quality must match your offering,” Mukherjee said. Western-style cafes in India charge roughly 60-80 rupees ($1.22-$1.62) for a plain cup of coffee — less than in developed markets but far more than the 10 rupees a cup charged at a basic local outlet. Starbucks did not say what it will charge in India. Still, the organized coffee market in India — which reflects consumption mainly through cafes — is small, accounting for about $140 million of the country’s annual coffee sales of about $667 million. Starbucks entered China, another traditional tea-drinking country, in 1999 and now has more than 400 stores across the mainland. Starbucks has more than 17,000 shops, roughly one-third of which are outside the United States. Tata Coffee, a unit of Tata Global, said separately that it had signed a deal to supply coffee to the joint venture. India is the world’s fifth biggest coffee producer, but exports 70-80 percent of its output.

118,SBUX,Hopes rise for Greek deal after new budget cuts found,"ATHENS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hopes rose on Thursday that Greece has finally done enough to secure a second bailout after Athens set out extra budget savings demanded by its international lenders, but the optimism failed to ease tensions with EU paymaster Germany. Time is running out for Greece to seal the 130 billion euro ($170 billion) rescue and avoid bankruptcy, but Greek officials hope euro zone finance ministers will sign the deal off on Monday - exactly a month before Athens needs the money to repay 14.5 billion euros of debt repayments due on March 20. The optimism followed deepening acrimony between Athens and northern states in the 17-member currency union, led by Germany, and came only after one proposal to withhold part of the bailout until after Greek elections expected in April was dropped. “We are almost there,” one euro zone official said, expressing hope the deal can be done when the ministers of the Eurogroup meet in Brussels. “Unless someone really comes up with an idea to undermine the whole deal, it should be approved on Monday,” he said. In a further sign of an emerging agreement, euro zone sources said national central banks in the currency bloc would exchange holdings of Greek bonds this weekend in the run-up to a private sector debt deal to avoid taking forced losses. With a go-ahead from the Eurogroup ministers, Greece can formally launch a debt restructuring offer to its private creditors which aims to halve the face value of what Greece owes the investors, slashing its debts by 100 billion euros. “There is no certainty but there is cautious optimism,” Antonis Samaras, leader of Greece conservative New Democracy party and the favorite to win the elections, told reporters. “Greece has done what it had to do,” said Samaras, whose party is one of the two remaining in the coalition of technocrat Prime Minister Lucas Papademos. Argument over the bailout, the second for Greece since 2010, has badly strained relations with Germany. Berlin will fund a large part of the bailout and has delivered regular lectures to Athens on how it should tackle its crisis. Anger has shifted in recent days from Chancellor Angela Merkel to her finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who in Greek eyes appears to have strayed from economic matters into the political, and even electoral process. On Wednesday Schaeuble noted that Italian political parties had given technocrat Prime Minister Mario Monti a year to push through reforms. In Athens those comments were interpreted as a suggestion to delay the Greek elections, allowing Papademos - who has been in power only since November - more time to implement the promised budget cuts and reforms. This brought a tart response from government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis. “I have nothing to say in response to Mr. Schaeuble - it is absolutely up to Greece when to hold elections,” he told reporters. Frustration exploded on Wednesday as President Karolos Papoulias, an 82-year-old veteran of the resistance to Nazi occupation of Greece in World War Two, attacked Schaeuble. Schaeuble, who has likened Greece to a “a bottomless pit,” also expressed doubt on whether Athens would stick to its austerity promises adopted by parliament on Monday as rioters torched and looted buildings across the capital. “I cannot accept Mr Schaeuble insulting my country,” said Papoulias. “Who is Mr Schaeuble to insult Greece?” Kapsis confirmed that Athens expected to win approval from the Eurogroup on Monday for the debt swap deal, under which the real value of bonds held by banks and insurers will fall by about 70 percent. The euro rose, European shares recovered losses and safe haven German Bunds hit session lows in response to developments which could help allay the debt crisis. Athens has provoked rising frustration among some euro zone members at what they see as a trend of Greek political leaders doing the minimum possible at the last moment since the crisis began in 2009. Critics say exactly the same applies to the euro zone’s response over the last two years. Greek government sources said Athens had agreed with the EU and IMF on how to fill the 325-million-euro hole in a set of 3.3 billion euros in budget cuts adopted by parliament on Monday. Two sources said 100 million euros would come from defence cuts, about 90 million by bringing forward some public sector wage reductions and another 135 million would be taken from the health, labor and interior ministries. Some points remain unresolved. Kapsis said the issue of an escrow account to ringfence funds for debt payments had not been agreed, while a German coalition source said more work was needed on how to monitor Greece’s efforts to cut spending. Euro zone finance ministers must also consider on Monday a report by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund which predicts Greek debt would be around 129 percent of GDP in 2020, well above a target of 120 percent set in October. Several officials have said a target of 125 percent would be acceptable to most euro zone members - and possibly also to the IMF - but measures will be needed to get it somewhat lower. Ideas include the euro zone cutting the interest on its existing bilateral loans to Greece; increasing its current offer of 130 billion euros of government financing; and asking private investors to agree to bigger losses. A further option is for the ECB to forego profits on Greek bonds it holds in its portfolio and to re-sell them to the euro zone’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), at the same discount it bought them on the market. Earlier, faced with calls for greater scrutiny of Greece’s implementation of the deal, one Greek cabinet member lashed out at the EU for “sheer blackmail.” “Any other intervention, any new demands by our lenders, will mean they are mocking the country,” Public Order Minister and former EU commissioner Christos Papoutsis said. “Some in Europe forget that behind the numbers are people,” Papoutsis said. Union leaders called for a new rally on Sunday “to answer all those who want Greece under German occupation.” ",2162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece/hopes-rise-for-greek-deal-after-new-budget-cuts-found-idUSTRE8120HI20120216
119,SBUX,More work needed yet on elusive Greek bailout deal,"ATHENS (Reuters) - European leaders expressed optimism on Friday that Greece would secure a new rescue package worth 130 billion euros ($171 billion) though policymakers admitted urgent work was still needed to get its debt-cutting program back on track. Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who will chair a crunch meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Monday, said efforts to slash Greece’s debt from 160 percent of output to a target of 120 percent by 2020 were still “far away” from fruition. “All the discussions I will have ... until Sunday night will try to move the figure nearer to the target,” the head of the Eurogroup told reporters in his home capital. Earlier, Greek caretaker Prime Minister Lucas Papademos talked to fellow euro zone leaders to persuade Berlin and others to back bailout measures needed to stave off bankruptcy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italy’s Mario Monti and Papademos all voiced optimism about an accord during a three-way conference call, Monti’s office said in a statement. The Greek premier also spoke to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and state television said he would pursue talks with euro zone partners “to create a positive mood in view of Monday’s meeting and to dispel doubts that could thwart this agreement.” A brief message by Rutte on his Twitter account noted simply of the call with Papademos: “I have pointed out to him that the Greek people should comply with all demands to get a new program.” Rutte’s finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, indicated on Thursday that the whole deal had been close to falling apart earlier in the week, saying that if a planned meeting of the Eurogroup of finance ministers had gone ahead two days ago, he and his German and Finnish counterparts would have voted against granting Greece more aid. Mutual accusations of brinkmanship between Athens and other euro capitals have soured the atmosphere and strained ties within the single currency union as it faces its toughest challenge since euro notes and coins were introduced in 2002. Negotiations were put back on track on Thursday when Athens set out the remaining cuts in a 3.3-billion-euro austerity package whose passage through parliament triggered rioting and looting through central Athens last Sunday. World stocks hit a fresh 6-1/2 month peak on Friday and the euro gained ground as hopes Greece will seal a long-awaited bailout deal at Monday’s meeting fuelled risk appetite. But there are still question marks over whether the bailout will be enough to help Greece back on its feet after a debt crisis that has seen its economy shrink by 16 percent from a 2008 peak, triggering mass unemployment and growing poverty. “The skepticism is especially strong among the ‘AAA’ states over whether Greece will be able to make it,” Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine quoted Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter as saying of countries with top-notch credit ratings such as Germany, Finland and the Netherlands. “The risk of a Greek insolvency is not off the table.” According to an assessment by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, Greek debt will still be around 129 percent of GDP in 2020 - higher even than the 125 percent that most euro zone states would probably accept. The IMF has said that if the ratio cannot be cut to around 120 percent by 2020, it may not be able to finance the second, 130 billion euro program for Greece. The Fund’s own contribution has not yet been settled. Officials have previously said a target of 125 percent would be acceptable to most euro zone members but further measures will be required to meet even that goal. Given that, policymakers are scrambling to fill the gap. Central bank sources told Reuters the ECB was studying whether to allow Greek bonds held in national euro zone central banks’ investment portfolios to be subject to the same writedowns which private investors are due to take. Euro zone central banks hold around 20 billion euros of Greek bonds in their traditional investment portfolios. If they do take losses on those bonds it would provide an immediate lump sum for Athens of around 14 billion euros if they take the same hit as their private counterparts. One central bank source said it was “50-50” whether the deal would go ahead as an accompaniment to a debt restructuring offer which Greece will offer to private creditors as part of the wider rescue plan. The swap will mean the real value of bonds held by banks and insurers will fall by about 70 percent. Other ideas to help Athens meet its long-term debt targets include the euro zone cutting the interest rate on its existing bilateral loans to Greece; increasing the current offer of 130 billion euros of government financing; and asking private investors to agree to bigger losses. The ECB is also expected to forego profits on Greek bonds it holds as a result of its emergency bond-buying program, which could raise something like another 12 billion euros. Other outstanding issues to be hammered out on Monday include the creation of a ring-fenced escrow account that will be used to pay down Greek debt, and the potentially sensitive issue of how the European Union tightens surveillance of Greek fiscal policy. Greece needs the funds before 14.5 billion euros of debt repayments fall due on March 20. Yet mistrust is high. “The scenario which we try to achieve is that Greece complies to all necessary measures and to all demands made by the international community in order to have a deal on the total package without a split,” de Jager told reporters on Friday. “Certainly if that would not work we have to think of alternative scenarios,” he added. Greece could go to the polls as early as April, raising questions as to whether the new government will stick to the austerity terms. Conservative leader Antonis Samaras - whom polls tip as the next premier - has said he would pursue the plan while reserving the right to “modifications” if the economy needs them. The debt talks have been clouded by growing acrimony between Athens and Berlin, with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble likening Greece to a “bottomless pit.” Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis warned on Thursday that the euro zone approach amounted to “sheer blackmail.” Earlier, Greece won a public expression of moral support as French Prime Minister Francois Fillon cautioned Europe that it should not “play with the default of Greece.” “The Greeks have promised very important reforms,” he told RTL radio. “The Europeans now have to keep their commitments.” ($1 = 0.7597 euros) (Additional reporting by Michele Sinner in Luxembourg and Berlin, Frankfurt and Brussels bureaux; Writing by Mark John, editing by Mike Peacock) $INS01; Line LNY Insave:- TI line name (Map report)",2172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece/more-work-needed-yet-on-elusive-greek-bailout-deal-idUSTRE8120HI20120217

127,SBUX,Starbucks tries local touch to lift growth in Europe,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), the world’s biggest coffee chain, is hoping to boost growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa by opening so-called concept stores that tailor products and cafe interiors to local tastes, a senior manager told Reuters. Starbucks will open between five and 10 such stores in the region this year, Rich Nelsen, senior vice president for Starbucks’ Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) business, said in an interview. Those cafes will test new products, such as fresh-baked pastries, as well as exclusive coffees from small-scale farms, “If these new products and the other concepts we test here work, we will expand these to other countries,” he said. On Friday, Starbucks will open its first European concept store in Amsterdam, followed by one in Kuwait later this year. Concept stores test new Starbucks products and sales ideas while their design and interior are inspired by the particular city and country where they are located. The store in Amsterdam will be its biggest in Europe at 430 square meters. Apart from its larger size and assortment with 16 new food products that are only sold here, the new concept store stands out because of its design. Located in a former bank building, it will have locally sourced secondhand furniture and feature typical Dutch touches, such as stools resembling bike saddles and traditional Dutch blue and white tiles. “After opening this store our other stores in Amsterdam will get busier too because it creates conversation and makes more people learn about us,” Nelsen said. Starbucks chose Amsterdam as the location for its concept store because it is where both its EMEA regional office and its roasting plant for the European market are located. “The easy access to the city, its large international community and its important coffee heritage also plays a role,” Nelsen added. Dutch traders started bringing coffee to Europe in the 18th century, using Amsterdam as a distribution centre. The region has remained an important centre for coffee roasting ever since. During the latest quarter, Starbucks reported 17 percent revenue growth for the EMEA region, which accounts for a little less than 10 percent of overall revenue. But operating margin contracted, due to higher distribution costs related to moving to a consolidated distribution centre in its UK market. Starbucks said it was not meeting internal targets in Europe - where debt worries and high unemployment weigh heavily on consumers - and promised to improve results there. Starbucks hopes to reap benefits from retraining staff - an effort that helped reinvigorate the company’s U.S. operations - as well as tailoring products to local needs, Nelsen said. “In the UK we decided to make our latte coffee stronger to adjust to local taste, while we started offering two different espresso coffees in France for the same reason,” he added. Unlike in the United States, it is not planning to shut down underperforming stores in EMEA to improve performance, he said. Starbucks plans to open 100 new stores in EMEA this year and will put a special focus on Scandinavia, where it has a relatively weak presence, Nelsen said. Starbucks currently operates roughly 1,700 stores in the EMEA region. ",3072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks/starbucks-tries-local-touch-to-lift-growth-in-europe-idUSTRE8261IM20120307
128,SBUX,Starbucks to sell single-serve coffee brewers,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said it will launch its own single-cup coffee and espresso drink machine later this year, putting it in direct competition with partner Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O, seller of the popular Keurig home brewers. Shares of Green Mountain plunged as much as 24 percent in after-hours trade, but regained some ground after Starbucks said on a conference call that it would continue to supply Green Mountain with Starbucks-branded single-serve coffee pods called K-cups. Starbucks shares rose 3 percent to $51.87. “With Green Mountain’s patents expiring this fall, Starbucks’ entry is part of the competitive onslaught hitting Green Mountain,” said hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Green Mountain. Green Mountain did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Starbucks announcement. Single-portion coffee, known as cups, discs or pods, make up only 8 percent of total worldwide coffee sales, according to data supplied by Euromonitor International in January. Still, category bulls say that percentage should grow as more people take advantage of its convenience. Joshua Brown, vice president of investments at investment advisory firm Fusion Analytics, said Starbucks’ move was inevitable. “There was no way that Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) were going to see this niche coffee market take off and not want a bigger share of it,” Brown said. “A lot of people thought Starbucks was going to play nice and just sell K-Cups through the Keurig. But Starbucks doesn’t do anything where they are going to be the No. 2 or the No. 3 player,” added Brown, whose firm has no position in either stock. Single-serve brewers, which can range from about $50 to about $800, make fresh cups of coffee, or even barista-worthy espresso drinks, in seconds. Starbucks said that the “Verismo system by Starbucks” will make both brewed coffee and espresso beverages such as lattes. The system will be sold online at select Starbucks shops and at specialty retailers in the United States, Canada and some other international markets, it said. Pricing on the machine will not be announced until closer to launch, Starbucks said. “This is a positive for Starbucks, it gives them better penetration into the at-home market,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco, adding that the move leverages Starbucks’ strength in the espresso and latte category. Green Mountain controls more than three-quarters of the U.S. market for single-cup coffee. That dominance has been fueled by the large network of coffee brands that provide coffee cups compatible with Keurig machines, including Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O), Newman’s Own, Caribou Coffee Co CBOU.O and Folgers, made by J.M. Smucker (SJM.N). Despite the introduction of Verismo, Starbucks plans to continue its partnership with Green Mountain. “We will support both systems and we will continue to support and honor the relationship we have with Green Mountain,” Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ co-founder and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. Single-serve coffee is most popular in Western Europe and the United States. The global leader is Nestle SA NESN.VX, whose Nespresso system holds a 35 percent share, according to Euromonitor. Other popular single-cup brewing systems include Tassimo by Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, Senseo by Sara Lee SLE.N, and Flavia by Mars. At the end of this month, Senseo will be discontinued in the United States, except on select websites. A spokesmen for Sara Lee and Kraft declined to comment on Starbucks’ move. A spokeswoman for Nespresso was not immediately available. Consumer Edge Research analyst Robert Dickerson has estimated that a cup of coffee made at home by a one-cup brewer costs on average about 5 times more than traditionally brewed coffee.

Starbucks plans to open 100 new stores in EMEA this year and will put a special focus on Scandinavia, where it has a relatively weak presence, Nelsen said. Starbucks currently operates roughly 1,700 stores in the EMEA region. ",3082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-starbucks/starbucks-tries-local-touch-to-lift-growth-in-europe-idUSLNE82700T20120308

131,SBUX,Green Mountain falls as Starbucks takes on Keurig,"(Reuters) - Shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O tumbled 14 percent on Friday, on fears that it may lose its near monopoly in the U.S. single-cup coffee market after partner Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) outlined plans to launch a rival coffee and espresso machine. Analysts, however, said Starbucks’ new coffee and espresso machine would not be a meaningful threat to Green Mountain, as it would cater to different types of customers. Starbucks already sells coffee packs under its own label for Green Mountain’s Keurig machines, and said on Thursday that it plans to continue that partnership. “There is (also an) opportunity for complementary high-pressure espresso-based systems,” Green Mountain Chief Executive Lawrence Blanford said in a statement on Friday. Starbucks said its new Verismo single-cup system will make both brewed coffee and espresso beverages such as lattes. “Verisimo is being positioned primarily as an espresso machine similar to the highly popular, Nespresso machine from Nestle,” SunTrust Robinson analyst William Chappell wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. “While actual prices for Verisimo were not disclosed we would expect it to start around the $250-$300 range, similar to Nespresso and twice that of Keurig ($89-$178 range),” he added. With the launch of Verismo later this year, Starbucks will become the latest player to beef up its presence in the fast-growing single-serve coffee market dominated by Green Mountain in the United States and Nestle SA NESN.VX around the world. Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said he was encouraged by Starbucks’ long-term commitment to the Keurig tie up and that the combination of Via instant coffee, K-Cup refills and Verismo would help the company take share in the nearly $8 billion global single serve market. Green Mountain controls more than three-quarters of the U.S. market for single-cup coffee. That dominance has been helped by the large network of coffee brands that provide coffee cups compatible with Keurig machines, including Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) and Folgers, made by J.M. Smucker (SJM.N). “Starbucks is a much more popular coffee brand. So Green Mountain will have to reach out to other premium brands like Peet’s PEET.O and say, hey: let’s do a licensing deal,” Greg Harmon, president of Dragonfly Capital Management, told Reuters on Thursday. Green mountain, which had expected increasing competition in the single-coffee market, launched a premium line of Keurig brewers, called the Vue, in February. “The news of Verismo is not entirely unexpected, given Starbucks was noticeably left off the list of participating brands in Green Mountain’s new Vue platform,” analyst Barish said. Green Mountain shares were down at $53.90, while those of Starbucks were up 3 percent in premarket trading. Green Mountain’s stock closed at $62.40, while Starbucks shares closed at $50.37 on Thursday on the Nasdaq.

132,SBUX,Former Starbucks executive to be Best Buy digital chief,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Best Buy Co (BBY.N) named former Starbucks (SBUX.O) Chief Information Officer Stephen Gillett as the head of its digital and global business services, effective March 14. The news comes as the world’s largest consumer electronics chain looks to find better ways to woo mobile and online shoppers, and tries to fend off rivals like Amazon.com (AMZN.O). In this newly created position, Gillett, 36, will oversee Best Buy’s ecommerce businesses, information technologies and global shared services. Gillett will also be in charge of Best Buy’s digital strategy and marketing efforts, and finding new ways to “make technology a bigger part of the customer experience while enhancing operations and processes,” the company said on Friday. Gillett will report directly to Best Buy Chief Executive Brian Dunn.

134,SBUX,Starbucks to sell single-serve coffee brewers,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said it will launch its own single-cup coffee and espresso drink machine later this year, putting it in direct competition with partner Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O, seller of the popular Keurig home brewers. Shares of Green Mountain plunged as much as 24 percent in after-hours trade, but regained some ground after Starbucks said on a conference call that it would continue to supply Green Mountain with Starbucks-branded single-serve coffee pods called K-cups. Starbucks shares rose 3 percent to $51.87. The world’s biggest coffee chain, whose “Verismo system by Starbucks” will make both brewed coffee and espresso beverages such as lattes, is the latest player to beef up its presence in the fast-growing single-serve coffee market dominated by Green Mountain’s Keurig brewer in the United States and Nestle SA NESN.VX around the world. “With Green Mountain’s patents expiring this fall, Starbucks’ entry is part of the competitive onslaught hitting Green Mountain,” said hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Green Mountain. Green Mountain did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Starbucks announcement. Companies like Sara Lee SLE.N and Nestle NESN.VX have recently indicated they are ready to ramp up their presence in single-cup coffee. Even the world’s largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said it would add the relatively unknown Esio Beverage System to its shelves. The increased competition comes during a year when Green Mountain’s patents covering its coffee packs called K-Cup are due to expire. The patent expiry may allow other companies to sell coffee on the Keurig machines without paying royalty to Green Mountain. Last month, Green Mountain said it would sell a premium line of Keurig brewers called the “Vue” to help fend off increased competition. Starbucks’ proposed premium line of machines may be a direct rival to the Vue which is priced at about $250. Joshua Brown, vice president of investments at investment advisory firm Fusion Analytics, said Starbucks’ move was inevitable. “There was no way that Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) were going to see this niche coffee market take off and not want a bigger share of it,” Brown said. “A lot of people thought Starbucks was going to play nice and just sell K-Cups through the Keurig. But Starbucks doesn’t do anything where they are going to be the No. 2 or the No. 3 player,” added Brown, whose firm has no position in either stock. Single-portion coffee, known as cups, discs or pods, make up only 8 percent of total worldwide coffee sales, according to data supplied by Euromonitor International in January. Still, category bulls say that percentage should grow as more people take advantage of its convenience. Single-serve brewers, which can range from about $50 to about $800, make fresh cups of coffee, or even barista-worthy espresso drinks, in seconds. Starbucks said that the “Verismo system by Starbucks” will make both brewed coffee and espresso beverages such as lattes. The system will be sold online at select Starbucks shops and at specialty retailers in the United States, Canada and some other international markets, it said. Pricing on the machine will not be announced until closer to launch, Starbucks said. “This is a positive for Starbucks, it gives them better penetration into the at-home market,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco, adding that the move leverages Starbucks’ strength in the espresso and latte category. Green Mountain controls more than three-quarters of the U.S. market for single-cup coffee. That dominance has been fueled by the large network of coffee brands that provide coffee cups compatible with Keurig machines, including Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O), Newman’s Own, Caribou Coffee Co CBOU.O and Folgers, made by J.M. Smucker (SJM.N). Despite the introduction of Verismo, Starbucks plans to continue its partnership with Green Mountain. “We will support both systems and we will continue to support and honor the relationship we have with Green Mountain,” Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ co-founder and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. Single-serve coffee is most popular in Western Europe and the United States. The global leader is Nestle SA NESN.VX, whose Nespresso system holds a 35 percent share, according to Euromonitor. Other popular single-cup brewing systems include Tassimo by Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, Senseo by Sara Lee SLE.N, and Flavia by Mars. At the end of this month, Senseo will be discontinued in the United States, except on select websites. A spokesmen for Sara Lee and Kraft declined to comment on Starbucks’ move. A spokeswoman for Nespresso was not immediately available. Consumer Edge Research analyst Robert Dickerson has estimated that a cup of coffee made at home by a one-cup brewer costs on average about 5 times more than traditionally brewed coffee.

135,SBUX,Starbucks' coffee maker may drain Nespresso's growth,"* Starbucks’ new coffee maker seen bad news for Nespresso * Seen as first major competitor for Nestle’s system * Nespresso’s U.S. growth plans may be affected * Starbucks’ machine due for launch later this year By David Jones LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Plans by Starbucks  to launch a rival coffee machine to Nespresso may derail owner Nestle’s hopes for growth in the United States after the George Clooney-marketed system has proved a hit with espresso coffee lovers across Europe. Starbucks’ news last week sent shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roaster tumbling as the seller of Keurig machines controls more than three-quarters of the U.S. single-cup coffee market. But analysts see Starbucks’ move as more likely to hit Nestle’s fastest-growing big brand. Seattle-based Starbucks said it will beef up its presence in the rapidly-growing $8 billion single-serve coffee market with its new Verismo machine due out later this year in North America and selected international markets. The single-portion coffee market, using refills known as cups, discs or pods, makes up around 8 percent of worldwide coffee sales, with half coming from “brewed” coffee systems such as Keurig, Senseo, Tassimo, and Dolce Gusto, and the other half from espresso which is largely dominated by Nespresso. Starbucks hopes to bridge this gap with its high-pressure  coffee machine able to make both brewed and espresso coffee and heighten competition between the world’s biggest coffee houses, although it has given few details on pricing and availability. “The launch of Verismo by Starbucks is bad news for both of Nestle’s single serve coffee platforms, the Nespresso and Nescafe Dolce Gusto,” said Liberum Capital analyst Pablo Zuanic. He added the bulk of Nespresso’s growth in 2011 came from the United States as take-up in Western Europe has slowed, and he argues if Verismo halts the march of Nespresso then it could slice a fifth off Nestle’s overall annual profits growth. The rapid rise of upmarket coffee makers is likely to have taken trade away from coffee chains such as Starbucks itself and Whitbread’s Costa chain, as they offer quality coffee at around a fifth of the price, analysts said. “These machines are the future of coffee, and Starbucks as an exciting young brand must see this as a massive opportunity,” said Jonny Forsyth, senior drinks analyst at market research group Mintel. Nespresso has made big inroads into western continental European markets with their espresso coffee shop cultures, but has found it more difficult in Britain and the United States due to its high price, Forsyth added. The brand is very important to Nestle, accounting for over 4 percent of group sales and, with underlying sales growth of 20-40 percent a year, contributing some 10-15 percent of the group’s underlying sales growth. It boosts profit margins as well and so is a key focus for investors, analysts said. Starbucks chairman and founder Howard Schultz said the premium single-cup segment was the fastest-growing business in the coffee industry and this was why it had linked with German  coffee machine maker Krueger to launch its new system. Since the Starbucks machine is based on a high-pressure espresso system to produce a more intense taste than Keurig’s low pressure filtered-coffee profile, analysts see the Starbucks move as squarely aimed at Nestle and its Nespresso system. “In our opinion, this is a very positive development from Starbucks and is clearly directed at competing on a global scale with Nespresso,” said Marc Riddick, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. The success of Green Mountain’s Keurig machine has been fueled by the large network of coffee brands that provide cups compatible with Keurig machines such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Folgers and even Starbucks, but analysts said Starbucks  wanted to be a major player itself with its own system. Others in the coffee industry say these machine systems do not offer fresh coffee as newly-ground coffee gives off carbon dioxide and needs to rest before being put in a capsule. “There is no doubt machines like these have their place, but we don’t like them. We offer freshly roasted green beans and dispatch our coffee overnight. There is a huge difference,” said Tabitha Wilson, sales director at the Roast & Post Coffee Co. Analysts say the success of Keurig and Nestle has led competitors, such as Tassimo by Kraft and Senseo by Sara Lee, to struggle. Switzerland-based Nestle is by far the world’s biggest coffee maker with a 22 percent share helped by its half share of the instant market. Within that, Nespresso grew sales 20 percent to 3.5 billion Swiss francs in 2011 and although 85 percent of its sales are in Europe, it has singled out international expansion for the future with the United States a key focus. Analyst Michael Steib at Morgan Stanley says 30 percent of the overall group’s underlying sales growth in future will come from its coffee business, but Nespresso will face a bigger challenge in the United States than in Europe for three reasons. First is the dominant position of Keurig in the single-serve market and potentially more competition from Starbucks; second espresso is not a common form of coffee in the United States; and finally Nespresso pods are priced as a mid-market brand and do not have the premium image as in Europe.",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/nestle-starbucks-coffee/starbucks-coffee-maker-may-drain-nespressos-growth-idUSL5E8EF27Z20120315
136,SBUX,Travel Postcard: 48 hours in Seattle,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Set between two major mountain ranges, the Olympics and the Cascades, with the Puget Sound’s fjord-like waters to the west and massive Lake Washington to the east, Seattle has one of the most dramatic settings of any city in the country. The frequent moody cloud cover can hide those jagged mountains but on clear days 14,411-foot (4297 meter) Mount Rainier can be seen from the city. Reuters correspondents with local knowledge help visitors get the most out of a short stay in the northwestern U.S. city. Friday 6 p.m. - If the clouds have lifted even a bit, there’s no better place to watch the sunset over Elliott Bay than from the Seattle Art Museum’s nine-acre Olympic Sculpture Park on the downtown waterfront. Besides wandering about the 20 sculptures from major artists like Alexander Calder, Louise Nevelson and Richard Serra, you can enjoy further views of the changeable bay by strolling along the paved trail through nearby Myrtle Edwards Park. 7 p.m. - Head up to the Capitol Hill neighbourhood and start the weekend with cocktails at Tavern Law, named by GQ Magazine as one of the 25 best bars in America. There are plenty of handcrafted cocktails to enjoy in the Prohibition-era surroundings, but celebrate the start of your getaway with a custom champagne cocktail. Peruse the menu. The oxtail banh mi sandwich, based on Vietnamese tradition, will give you a taste of the Pacific Rim influence that figures in so many Seattle menus. 9 p.m. - Seattle takes its jazz seriously and there’s no better spot than Dimitriou’s Jazz Alley downtown to hear it. With any luck, a musician like Grammy Award-winning Arturo Sandoval will be holding court. Or maybe you’ll catch the funky horn-driven Tower of Power. Saturday 9 a.m. - Fortify yourself for the day ahead with one of the best Mexican breakfasts anywhere at Senior Moose in the lively Ballard neighbourhood. The crowded restaurant offers breakfast specialties culled from regions throughout Mexico. Try the outstanding huevos motuleños with black beans inspired by the Yucatan breakfast staple. Even though it’s early, go ahead and get an order of the flawless guacamole and chips. It’s surprisingly good with a cup of Senior Moose’s strong coffee. 11 a.m. - Get a sense of Ballard’s historic status as Seattle’s Scandinavian neighbourhood at the Nordic Heritage Museum and at stops such as the shop Scandinavian Specialties, where you can pick up house-made cured meats, homemade Swedish meatballs and a bowl of traditional yellow split pea soup. Ballard also has a lively shopping scene. KAVU, a local Seattle clothing and gear company, offers the quintessential Northwest look, with hip interpretations of outdoorsy style clothes. Stop at The Secret Garden Bookshop which has a carefully chosen selection of books for children and adults. For lunch, head to the nearby Ray’s Boathouse Cafe with views for which Seattle is famous, along with the seafood. 3 p.m. - Spend the next two hours absorbing more of Asia’s influence on Seattle at the Seattle Asian Art Museum. The museum, which is situated in lovely Volunteer Park, showcases exquisite art from various centuries and numerous counties in Asia. 5 p.m. - Continue your exploration of Seattle’s hot cocktail scene at the Zig Zag Cafe tucked away behind the Pike Place Market. Try the One Legged Duck, a blend of Rye Whiskey, Dubonnet, Mandarine Napoleon and Fernet Branca. Order a plate of marinated olives to go with it, or try the cheese plate. Much of the food on the menu is sourced at the Pike Place Market. 7 p.m. - Since you’re already at Pike Place, head to Matt’s in the Market on the third floor of the Corner Market Building, where the food matches the view. Meat lovers can try the Pork Belly Confit with kimchi broth. For those who prefer seafood try the clams with chorizo and cava or order anything with Dungeness crab or perhaps some oysters on the half shell. For a larger plate try the seafood stew. 9 p.m. - For a great evening head to the Triple Door in the heart of downtown Seattle, which offers music ranging from pop chanteuse crooners to Apple Jam, a group presenting a critically praised tribute to the Beatles. A great wine list is available, along with excellent cocktails and Southeast Asian inspired plates. The satays are a perennial favourite. Sunday 10 a.m. - For brunch try Salty’s at Alki in West Seattle. It can be crowded, but the views and lavish assortment of Northwest foods on offer more than make up for it, including piles of Dungeness crab and smoked salmon, along with brunch staples like Eggs Benedict and Belgian waffles. Afterwards walk for miles along the waterfront through Alki, Seattle’s premiere people watching neighbourhood and beach scene. Seals often pop their heads up here, and you’ll see ferries chugging off to local islands. 1 p.m. - Seattle is a book lover’s town, and readers have many fine bookstores to visit. Seattle Mystery Bookshop in historic Pioneer Square is one of the best and offers both new and used books. Passionate, friendly staff can help you find the perfect read. For an excellent general selection, Elliott Bay Book Company on Capitol Hill has the goods, many with staff recommendations, plus a great selection of unique cards. It’s easy to lose yourself in the stacks, so keep an eye on the clock if you need catch a flight.

137,SBUX,Starbucks goes beyond coffee with first juice bar,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp opened the first store in its new Evolution Fresh juice bar chain on Monday, its biggest move outside coffee aimed at boosting the company’s position in the $50 billion health food sector. The juice bar business is, however, fragmented and intensely competitive and some analysts say the Evolution Fresh shops could have lower margins than Starbucks’ coffee shops. With Starbucks yet to detail how many juice bars it plans to open, the popularity of its first shop, located in an upscale shopping area in Bellevue, Washington, an affluent city just east of Seattle, will be closely watched. “Mixologists” at the new shop dispense a variety of juices - including apple, coconut water, carrot and beet - from taps to create “hand crafted” concoctions with names like “sweet burn” and “field of greens”. The 8-ounce drinks sell for $4.99 and the 16-ounce drinks are priced at $7.99. The juice bar also sells bottled Evolution Fresh fruit and vegetable juices, smoothies and food, such as oatmeal, wraps, salads and soups. The menu includes vegan and vegetarian options and so-called super foods like kale and quinoa are well represented. Fresh fruit and vegetable juices have gained in popularity in the United States with some health-conscious consumers using them as meal replacements, while others drink them as part of “cleansing” diets. The world’s biggest coffee chain bought Evolution Fresh for $30 million in cash in November to get a piece of that business. At the time of the purchase, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said successful independent juice bars have annual sales of well over $1 million per unit. Analysts have said that is a bit less than an average U.S. Starbucks cafe but more than a typical store for rival Jamba Inc, a publicly held juice and smoothie chain that recently introduced new squeezed-to-order juice blends. That move from Jamba came months after Starbucks and McDonald’s Corp introduced their own smoothies. “Starbucks is one of the savviest companies in terms of what they do, of probably any company,” said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. While Starbucks ranks among the nation’s best companies at marketing and Americans are willing to spend money on healthy beverages, he declined to predict whether consumers would embrace the concept. Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore noted that some of Starbucks’ recent roll-outs - particularly its Via instant coffee and K-cups coffee refills for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s popular Keurig one-cup brewers - have far exceeded analysts’ expectations. “The lesson from those is not to underestimate Starbucks’ ability to execute a concept very, very well,” Senatore said. The Evolution Fresh store opening comes just ahead of Starbucks’ annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Investors in Seattle-based Starbucks have seen shares in the company soar since it restructured by slashing costs and closing nearly 1,000 stores around the world. The stock, which was trading at just under $10 in February 2009, was trading above $53 on Monday. Starbucks’ purchase of Evolution Fresh was in line with its strategy to sell a broader range of products through its own cafes, grocery stores and other retail outlets. Since purchasing the company, Starbucks has expanded distribution of its bottled juices beyond a handful of retailers that included Whole Foods Market Inc to more grocery sellers. Evolution Fresh bottled juices will be sold in Starbucks’ company-owned stores this year, replacing Naked Juice products from PepsiCo Inc. Pepsi and Coca-Cola Co, owner of Odwalla, are big players in the $5 billion packaged juice category where Evolution Fresh competes. San Bernardino, California-based Evolution Fresh was started by the founder of Naked Juice. It uses a heat-free, high-pressure pasteurization process. The company says that process retains more of the nutrients in the juice, compared with the conventional heat pasteurization used by some rivals in the refrigerated juice category.

Investors in Seattle-based Starbucks have seen shares in the company soar since it restructured by slashing costs and closing nearly 1,000 stores around the world.

141,SBUX,Starbucks goes beyond coffee with first juice bar,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp opened the first store in its new Evolution Fresh juice bar chain on Monday, its biggest move outside coffee aimed at boosting the company’s position in the $50 billion health food sector. The juice bar business is, however, fragmented and intensely competitive and some analysts say the Evolution Fresh shops could have lower margins than Starbucks’ coffee shops. With Starbucks yet to detail how many juice bars it plans to open, the popularity of its first shop, located in an upscale shopping area in Bellevue, Washington, an affluent city just east of Seattle, will be closely watched. “Mixologists” at the new shop dispense a variety of juices - including apple, coconut water, carrot and beet - from taps to create “hand crafted” concoctions with names like “sweet burn” and “field of greens”. The 8-ounce drinks sell for $4.99 and the 16-ounce drinks are priced at $7.99. The juice bar also sells bottled Evolution Fresh fruit and vegetable juices, smoothies and food, such as oatmeal, wraps, salads and soups. The menu includes vegan and vegetarian options and so-called super foods like kale and quinoa are well represented. Fresh fruit and vegetable juices have gained in popularity in the United States with some health-conscious consumers using them as meal replacements, while others drink them as part of “cleansing” diets. The world’s biggest coffee chain bought Evolution Fresh for $30 million in cash in November to get a piece of that business. At the time of the purchase, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said successful independent juice bars have annual sales of well over $1 million per unit. Analysts have said that is a bit less than an average U.S. Starbucks cafe but more than a typical store for rival Jamba Inc, a publicly held juice and smoothie chain that recently introduced new squeezed-to-order juice blends. That move from Jamba came months after Starbucks and McDonald’s Corp introduced their own smoothies. “Starbucks is one of the savviest companies in terms of what they do, of probably any company,” said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. While Starbucks ranks among the nation’s best companies at marketing and Americans are willing to spend money on healthy beverages, he declined to predict whether consumers would embrace the concept. Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore noted that some of Starbucks’ recent roll-outs - particularly its Via instant coffee and K-cups coffee refills for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s popular Keurig one-cup brewers - have far exceeded analysts’ expectations. “The lesson from those is not to underestimate Starbucks’ ability to execute a concept very, very well,” Senatore said. The Evolution Fresh store opening comes just ahead of Starbucks’ annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Investors in Seattle-based Starbucks have seen shares in the company soar since it restructured by slashing costs and closing nearly 1,000 stores around the world. The stock, which was trading at just under $10 in February 2009, was trading above $53 on Monday. Starbucks’ purchase of Evolution Fresh was in line with its strategy to sell a broader range of products through its own cafes, grocery stores and other retail outlets. Since purchasing the company, Starbucks has expanded distribution of its bottled juices beyond a handful of retailers that included Whole Foods Market Inc to more grocery sellers. Evolution Fresh bottled juices will be sold in Starbucks’ company-owned stores this year, replacing Naked Juice products from PepsiCo Inc. Pepsi and Coca-Cola Co, owner of Odwalla, are big players in the $5 billion packaged juice category where Evolution Fresh competes. San Bernardino, California-based Evolution Fresh was started by the founder of Naked Juice. It uses a heat-free, high-pressure pasteurization process. The company says that process retains more of the nutrients in the juice, compared with the conventional heat pasteurization used by some rivals in the refrigerated juice category. Many independent juice bars do not pasteurize their made-to-order juices.

142,SBUX,Starbucks factory investments to create 150 jobs,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp said on Wednesday it would spend $180 million on U.S. factories, creating 150 manufacturing jobs, and that it would get into the $8 billion U.S. energy drink market with a new product. The company also said that this summer it would begin selling coffee mugs made at a once-dormant factory in Ohio. The world’s largest coffee chain, which recently started a fund to spur U.S. job creation, said it would build a factory in Augusta, Georgia, and expand an existing roasting plant in Sandy Run, South Carolina, to include packaging facilities. The new plant will be Starbucks’ first company-owned and -operated facility to produce VIA instant coffee and ingredients for Frappuccino. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz has in the past year urged other CEOs to take a bigger role in the United States’ economic revival and commit to creating jobs. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, Schultz said Starbucks had decided to make the investment in the United States, even though it could have saved money by doing it in low-cost overseas markets. “Delivering long-term shareholder value is essential. But today’s increasingly complex world requires companies, including Starbucks, to hold ourselves to higher standards,” he said. Starbucks said the Ohio-made mugs were the first product in an ongoing relationship with that manufacturer. It sells mugs and other products made in China. The actions prompted one shareholder to tell fellow investors that Schultz should be President of the United States. Starbucks resumed profit growth in 2010 after a two-year restructuring that involved slashing costs and closing nearly 1,000 cafes around the world. Now 40-years-old, the company is reporting record revenue and profit. Its shares rose just over 0.1 percent to close at $53.81 on Nasdaq on Wednesday. The stock has climbed more than 50 percent over the last year. The company plans to keep growing by introducing new products that will put it one step ahead of rivals like Dunkin’ Donuts Group Inc and McDonald’s Corp. It also wants to sell more products outside its cafes. “We’re just getting started,” Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told investors. Starbucks has introduced a line of “Refreshers” beverages to compete with energy drinks like Red Bull and Rockstar. The fruit-flavored drinks are made with a flavorless extract made from unroasted green coffee and pack less caffeine kick than coffee drinks made from roasted beans. Earlier this month Starbucks announced plans to roll out its own single-cup home brewer called Verismo, ending more than a year of speculation that it would jump into the $8 billion global business with both feet. Executives on Wednesday introduced shareholders to the espresso and latte maker, which will be in stores in time for the winter holidays.

The fruit-flavored drinks are made with a virtually flavorless extract of green, unroasted coffee, and pack less caffeine kick than coffee drinks made from roasted beans. Starbucks — which has started a fund to spur U.S. job creation — also announced plans to create roughly 150 jobs by   investing nearly $180 million to build a new factory in Augusta, Georgia, and to expand an existing roasting plant in Sandy Run, South Carolina, to add packaging capability.

Shares of Green Mountain GMCR.O, which controls more than three quarters of the U.S. single-cup coffee market with its Keurig brewers, soared 14 percent to $57.57 on more than twice the previous 10-day average volume. The stock took a hit earlier this month when Starbucks (SBUX.O) outlined plans to launch its own single-cup coffee and espresso drink machine called the Verismo — a move some feared may threaten Green Mountain’s share of the market and end their existing partnership. Green Mountain unveiled plans to sell a premium line of coffee machines called the “Vue” in February to battle increased competition, ahead of the expiry of key patents that cover its coffee refills called K-Cups. “There were a lot of fears that Green Mountain and Starbucks might end their relationship, but we think that Verismo is designed to compete with Nestle’s NESN.VX Nespresso,” Williams Capital Group analyst Marc Riddick said. Companies like Nestle NESN.VX have shown increased interest in the fast-growing single-cup coffee market. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) has also announced plans to add the relatively unknown Esio Beverage System to its lineup of coffee machines. Riddick, who has a “perform” rating on Green Mountain, expects competition to increase sharply in single-cup coffee but said the Waterbury, Vermont-based company was in a “good shape to deal with it.” Green Mountain and Starbucks expect to distribute Starbucks-branded “Vue” packs in grocery stores and other retailers in the United States and on Green Mountain’s website by fall, the companies said in a joint statement, without disclosing the financial terms. Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, already sells coffee and Tazo branded tea for the Keurig brewers. The companies also clarified that Keurig is the exclusive “low-pressure,” single-cup brewer offering Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea.

The world’s biggest coffee chain has been quietly rolling out canned “refreshers” energy drinks to U.S. grocery stores and also plans to sell made-to-order versions of low-calorie, fruit-flavored drinks later this year in U.S. cafes, as well as 15 international markets. The introduction is part of Starbucks’ strategy to increase sales and profits by introducing new products that set it apart from rivals such as McDonald’s Corp. That plan also includes expanding into new drink categories - such as instant coffee and refrigerated fruit and vegetable juices - as well as increasing product distribution to an ever-growing web of retail outlets. “We believe this is another coffee innovation that will differentiate us,” Annie Young-Scrivner, Starbucks’ global chief marketing officer, told Reuters. She said refreshers target the “light energy” portion of the $8 billion U.S. energy drink market. The drinks have about one-third less caffeine than brewed coffee and she expects that they will bolster business in the afternoon, when traffic to many coffee chains is slow. Canned refreshers will sell for $1.99, while the price of an 8-ounce “tall” refresher drink made in a cafes will range from $2.75 to $3.25. The drinks are sweetened with stevia. The 12-ounce canned refreshers have 60 calories. They are lightly sparkling and come in three flavors: raspberry pomegranate, strawberry-lemonade and orange melon.",3212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-energy/starbucks-new-refreshers-are-a-bet-on-energy-drinks-idUSL1E8ELD5E20120321

According to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Stiller sold roughly $33 million each in Green Mountain shares in two transactions on Feb. 15 and Feb. 24. Stiller, who founded the company in 1981 and took it public in September 1993, now owns about 8.4 percent of Green Mountain’s stock.

The stock sales came days before Green Mountain shares plunged 16 percent on March 9, as Starbucks Corp  announced plans to launch its own single-cup coffee and espresso drink machine, putting it in direct competition with Green Mountain’s Keurig brewers. In a regulatory filing on March 9, Green Mountain said the company had “recently learned of Starbucks’ planned initiative in the espresso-based single-cup category.” It is unclear as to when exactly Starbucks told Green Mountain about its plans of launching a new brewer.

152,SBUX,Starbucks focuses on Europe after U.S. turnaround,"* Eyeing European suburbs, more profitable drive-thrus * Targeting EMEA operating margin of 15 pct over time By Lisa Baertlein SEATTLE, March 27 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp hopes to brew up a European business renaissance after reviving its operations at home. The world’s biggest coffee shop chain dominates in the United States but has been just another player in Europe’s famed cafe culture. It wants to change that. The United States accounts for most of Starbucks’ revenue and operating profit; the region that includes Europe, the Middle East and Asia (EMEA) kicks in about 10 percent of revenue and just 2 percent of operating profit. And though EMEA brings in about twice as much revenue as Asia, it lags that region in operating profit because rent, labor and other costs are higher. Starbucks recently said it had fallen short of its targets in Europe, where austerity measures aimed at reducing government debt are weighing on consumer demand in some countries. The company said it had taken steps to improve results in that market, which executives say has suffered from a lack of investment. Starbucks is stealing a page from its successful U.S. “transformation agenda” as it works toward a long-term goal of delivering EMEA operating margin of 15 percent, versus 6.5 percent in the latest quarter. Leading the charge is Michelle Gass, a veteran Starbucks executive who was a leader in the U.S. turnaround and is known for championing the company’s blockbuster Frappuccino drinks. “Our business in Europe today is quite reminiscent of what we went through in the U.S. back in 2008 — a tough economy, record unemployment, fierce competition and our own self-induced mistakes,” Gass, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa, said at the company’s shareholder meeting last week. When Gass arrived in London about six months ago, she got an earful — from everyone from cabbies to her dentist — about weak coffee and too-milky lattes. “Europe is espresso territory. To compete, we must absolutely deliver the best latte on the High Street,” she said, referring to the European equivalent of Main Street. Starbucks has retrained its European employees and is finding ways to squeeze out unnecessary costs like wasted milk, as it did in the United States. It is also making market-by-market adjustments aimed at boosting results and paying for further improvements. A little over a week ago it changed the recipe of its small lattes in the UK to include two shots of espresso rather than one, which is the norm at Starbucks cafes elsewhere. Gass told Reuters that selling more lattes will more than offset the cost of adding the extra espresso shot. Starbucks also has introduced a second espresso roast in France, another company first. Food is a big part of the plan, and localized menu options include “bacon buttie” sandwiches in the UK and foie gras sandwiches in France. “At Starbucks, when we take care of our own issues, the external environment doesn’t matter,” Gass told Reuters. “We’ve broken the cycle in the U.S. and I’m convinced we’ll break the cycle as well” in Europe. FROM VALUE TO DRIVE-THRUS In the quarter ended Jan. 1, Starbucks’ EMEA region reported a sales gain of 2 percent at coffee shops open at least 13 months — respectable considering the fallout from Europe’s debt crisis, but tepid compared with Starbucks’ U.S. gain of 9 percent. Gass declined to give a country-by-country breakdown but said sales at established shops in the UK — Starbucks’ largest market in Europe with 700 cafes — were up during the latest quarter. Starbucks opened its first UK cafe in 1998. Its top competitors there are Whitbread’s Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero, and a host of independent operators, according to market research firm Mintel. Consumers in Germany, Starbucks’ second-biggest European market, are sensitive to economic jitters, but countries like Russia and Turkey are posting strong results, she said. In the depths of the U.S. recession, Starbucks offered discounted coffee-and-food combos for the first time in its history. It also introduced Starbucks Rewards, a loyalty program that gives customers a free drink with every 15 purchased. It rolled out Starbucks Rewards in the UK in January and plans to introduce the program in Germany this year. The company, which is reporting record sales and earnings, has temporarily cut the price of small lattes in Germany and has permanently slashed the price of small cappuccinos in Greece by 1 euro to 2.5 euros. The turnaround strategy worked in the United States and “it can work (in the EMEA region) as well,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco. Starbucks closed nearly 1,000 cafes around the globe as part of its restructuring. Gass said there are no plans for more shutdowns. Instead, the company’s Europe strategy involves renovations and expanding beyond High Street and its expensive rents. After giving its cafe at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate a makeover, Starbucks plans to spruce up 100 stores in the UK — 70 of them high-profile cafes in London that will be ready in time for the summer Olympics. The company is also eyeing Europe’s busy suburbs, where rents are less pricey. Plans there include building American-style drive-thrus, which boast healthy profits. Over the next five years, Starbucks plans to add 200 drive-thrus to the dozen or so it now has in the UK. About 40 percent of Starbucks’ U.S. cafes are drive-thrus.",3272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-europe/starbucks-focuses-on-europe-after-u-s-turnaround-idUSL1E8ELY2020120327
153,SBUX,NZ's Restaurant Brands year profit falls,"WELLINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - New Zealand fast food operator Restaurant Brands Ltd reported a 30 percent fall in full year profit on Tuesday as sales fell, and said it was looking to hold its profitability in a tight market. The company, which operates the KFC, Starbucks and Pizza Hut franchises, reported a net profit of NZ$16.9 million ($14 million) for the year to Feb 27 compared with NZ$24.3 million a year earlier. Last month the group said same store sales were down 2.5 percent on a year ago, with KFC sales flat, lower Pizza Hut revenue, and a slight rise for Starbucks. Group revenue fell nearly 5 percent to NZ$308.9 million, mainly because of the impact of the Christchurch earthquake on sales and the sale of some Pizza Hut stores to franchisees. Shares in Restaurant Brands closed on Monday at NZ$1.86, down around 10 percent so far this year, and just above the two-year low struck last week. The company, which declared a dividend of 9.5 cents a share against last year’s 10 cents, said the retail climate was tough, but it regarded the profit as satisfactory after last year’s strong result. “The company is expected to produce a result of at least the same level in the year ahead,” it said in a statement. It said it was on track to open three or four stores of its fourth franchise chain, Carl’s Jr burgers, in the second half of the year.

154,SBUX,Starbucks' job creation fund finds first partners,"(Reuters) - Google Offers and Banana Republic are the first businesses to join Starbucks Corp in raising money for a U.S. job creation fund started by the world’s biggest coffee chain late last year. Starbucks and the Opportunity Finance Network, a group of private financial institutions that make affordable loans to individuals and communities, introduced the “Create Jobs for USA” fund in October. Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said the fund would help compensate for a lack of national political leadership on unemployment. “We can’t wait for Washington,” he said. “We need to do more on our own. Schultz said he was in discussions with other potential partners about expanding Create Jobs for USA. The fund already has raised more than $7.5 million and the two new partnerships could bring in another $4 million. The total amount would support about $80 million in lending — enough to help create or sustain more than 3,800 jobs, Starbucks said. The U.S. unemployment rate has been above 8 percent since February 2009 and touched a high of 10 percent that October. Google Offers, a Google Inc business that competes with daily deals company Groupon Inc, will raise up to $3 million on Wednesday by selling $10 Starbucks vouchers at the discounted price of $5 each. It will donate $3 from each voucher sale to the job creation fund. Gap Inc unit Banana Republic will donate up to $1 million from purchases made during two four-day sales events planned for later this year. The first sale to benefit the fund is slated to begin on April 19. Money from the fund already is being put to work, and Josh Davis, owner of the Gelato Fiasco in Brunswick, Maine, is among the business owners who have benefited. Davis had a problem last year when his bank pulled a verbal financing commitment after he had signed a 10-year lease for a second gelato store in Portland, Maine. A lender with funding from Create Jobs For USA stepped up with a loan of more than $100,000, enabling Davis to open the store in January. It now has six employees and is preparing to hire more for the busy summer season. “It was absolutely critical,” said Davis, who faced the prospect of trying to borrow from family and friends or arranging alternative financing that would have cost more and taken longer. “Who knows whether (the second store) would be up and running right now?” Davis is donating $1 from the sale of pints of a limited-edition gelato flavor to support the fund. Starbucks CEO Schultz created a political buzz last year when he called on his peers to withhold campaign donations to the president and members of Congress until the government reached a deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending. Schultz, who returned Starbucks to growth after slashing costs and closing nearly 1,000 cafes around the globe, also asked fellow business leaders to pledge to step up hiring. For its part, Starbucks this summer will begin selling coffee mugs made at a once-dormant factory in Northern Ohio. Many of the mugs and other products the company now sells are made in China. The company, whose shares have risen more than 70 percent in the past year, also plans to build a factory in Augusta, Georgia, to produce VIA instant coffee and ingredients for its Frappuccino drinks. It expects that project to create 140 U.S. jobs in manufacturing, plus more than 100 in construction. Starbucks is committed to putting the new plant in the United States, Schultz said, even though it would have been “significantly more attractive” to build it in a lower-cost country. “If we believe in this, this is what we have to do,” said Schultz, who repeatedly has said that he has no interest in a government job — elected or otherwise. “I feel like I can do a lot from the position I’m in,” he said. “I have no plans to be anywhere else.” ",4032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks/starbucks-job-creation-fund-finds-first-partners-idUSBRE8320EO20120403

157,SBUX,"Starbucks aims to woo China workers, parents","LOS ANGELES/BEIJING (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) wants to make its mainland China expansion a family affair. The world’s biggest coffee chain is opening cafes in China at a rate of one every four days in its quest to expand from about 570 shops today to more than 1,500 by 2015. To get there, it will need to recruit thousands of employees, many of whom have extraordinarily close ties to their parents, due to the country’s one-child rule. So this week, Starbucks is hosting China store managers and their parents — about 1,100 in all — at getting-to-know-you events in Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese parents are known for doing anything they can to help their children succeed, whether at work or in love, and in doing so give America’s hands-on “helicopter parents” a run for their money. In his pitch to Chinese parents in Beijing on Wednesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said: “As we expand our footprint across China, we are committed to sharing our success and continue to grow together with them and their families.” Schultz, a well-known U.S. executive, is no stranger to recruiting and makes frequent appearances at China universities as part of the company’s ongoing hiring efforts. Still, he said the China events are a first for Starbucks. “This is about showing respect” to Chinese families and demonstrating “why we are a different type of company,” Schultz told Reuters in an interview leading up to the events. Finding the right managers and staff in China is “very, very difficult,” said Paul French, chief China analyst at market research firm Mintel. The Seattle-based Starbucks currently has about 10,000 employees in China and is competing with numerous chains for those skilled workers. The company’s rivals in China include Britain’s Costa Coffee (WTB.L), South Korean-owned bakery chains Paris Baguette and Tous Les Jours, and Pacific Coffee, which is majority-owned by Hong Kong-listed China Resources Enterprise Ltd (0291.HK). McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) sells coffee in the market, where it also is growing rapidly, and U.S. coffee chains Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf also have China expansion plans. Starbucks appears to have an edge over some rivals in China, some experts said. It invests in training and its employees are efficient, consistent, cheerful and often speak some English. It has the additional advantage of being a well-known international company in a nation where parents care about brand recognition, said James Roy, senior analyst at China Market Research, a Shanghai-based consultancy. “Parents are a good stakeholder to get onboard in terms of employee happiness,” said Roy, who added that many young Chinese workers live with parents, who may want them home for dinner and not working too hard.

159,SBUX,Lingering customers just one hurdle for Starbucks China growth,"LOS ANGELES/BEIJING (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has ambitious expansion plans in China, but like any big new emerging market there are teething problems, not least of which is that customers love it so much they stay for hours and hours and sometimes don’t even buy a drink. Chief executive Howard Schultz expects mainland China to overtake Canada as Starbucks’ second-largest market by 2014 and some analysts believe it could one day rival the United States as the company’s biggest market. “The No. 1 opportunity for the entire company is China,” Schultz told about 300 Starbucks employees and their family members at a company forum in Beijing. “This is where we want to invest, where we want to grow.” Starbucks has reorganized decision-making to transfer more responsibility to its China unit from its headquarters in Seattle. “We now have a design team here, a real estate team here,” Schultz said. “We recognize that the size of the opportunity and the size of the prize in China is the most significant opportunity we have as a company.” The world’s biggest coffee chain is a symbol of Western affluence in a nation of tea drinkers. But the tendency for Chinese visitors to linger in cafes and their lower income levels means sales volumes are much smaller than the United States and other markets where taking drinks to go is the norm. “For a decade the core business was expats and tourists. Without question, the core business today is Chinese nationals,” Schultz told Reuters ahead of his trip to Beijing and Shanghai where he is also meeting store managers. Xu Baoli, a 51-year-old stock trader in Beijing, said he visits Starbucks at least 10 times a month, but doesn’t go for the coffee. He is taking a break, surfing the Internet and meeting with clients. Observers note that Chinese customers will sometimes bring their own food to Starbucks and Xu admits that every so often he doesn’t bother to buy anything at all. “I like the concept,” said Xu. “Chinese people used to think you needed a spoon and saucer to drink coffee. Now, walking around with a Starbucks cup in your hand has become a fashion statement for Chinese.” With the U.S. market maturing, few prizes are as enticing as China and its population of more than 1.3 billion. Starbucks entered China in 1999 and now has more than 570 stores in 48 cities. By 2015, it plans more than 1,500 stores in 70-plus cities, though that would still only account for about half of China’s major cities and would be just a fraction of the 10,800 stores in the United States. “It could very well be exactly what’s happening with Yum,” Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management, referring to KFC parent Yum Brands Inc. The U.S. fast-food company got an early foothold in China and now gets more revenue from that market than any other. And while Starbucks’ China cafes contribute less than 5 percent of company revenue, their store operating profit margins, at around 22 percent, are higher than U.S. cafes because they charge essentially U.S. prices in a market famed for its low labor costs. But even with that big silver lining, there are big impediments to growth including low incomes, rising costs and the fact that most Chinese don’t have a coffee habit. The market is still small, with specialist coffee shops such as Starbucks booking sales of $358 million from mainland China in 2010. That was up from $104 million in 2005, according to Euromonitor International. By comparison, the United States accounts for $8 billion in revenue for Starbucks. Consumers in China drink an average of just three cups of coffee per year, according to an industry study, and for many Starbucks prices are simply out of reach. Based on average wages in China, it would take 1.3 hours of work in the more affluent east of China to buy a Starbucks tall (12-ounce) caramel macchiato. That goes up to 1.6 hours in the west and 1.9 hours in central China, says Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore. Affordability remains a top concern for analysts, who worry that as Starbucks’ expansion progresses beyond the country’s biggest cities, it will be less able raise prices to protect margins. But CEO Schultz said income levels had not been a barrier to growth, adding that Starbucks’ shops in non-core markets perform “as well or better” than stores in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, helped by pent-up demand. Attracting quality employees when competition for skilled workers is intensifying as other chains also expand, is difficult, says Paul French, chief China analyst for market research firm, Mintel. To that end, Starbucks announced plans to launch a training program called Starbucks China University next year. It also unveiled a 1 million yuan ($158,700) fund that will provide emergency financial assistance for Starbucks employees.

162,SBUX,Lingering customers just one hurdle as Starbucks eyes China growth,"* Starbucks sees 1,500 China stores by 2015 vs about 570 now * Chinese nationals are now the core customers in China-CEO * U.S.-level prices, low costs boost China margins * Low incomes, low coffee consumption are also hurdles By Lisa Baertlein and Terril Yue Jones LOS ANGELES/BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp  is on the rise in China with ambitious expansion plans but like any big new emerging market there are teething problems, not least of which is that customers love it so much, they stay for hours and hours and sometimes don’t even buy a drink. Chief Executive Howard Schultz expects mainland China to overtake Canada as Starbucks’ second-largest market by 2014 and some analysts believe it could one day rival the United States as the company’s biggest market. “For a decade the core business was expats and tourists. Without question, the core business today is Chinese nationals,” Schultz told Reuters ahead of a trip to Beijing and Shanghai to meet store managers. The world’s biggest coffee chain is a symbol of Western affluence in a nation of tea drinkers. But the tendency for Chinese visitors to linger in cafes and their lower income levels means sales volumes are much smaller than the United States and other markets where taking drinks to go is the norm. Xu Baoli, a 51-year-old stock trader in Beijing, said he visits Starbucks at least 10 times a month but doesn’t go for the coffee. He is taking a break, surfing the Internet and meeting with clients. Observers note that Chinese customers will bring sometimes their own food to Starbucks and Xu admits that every so often he  doesn’t bother to buy anything at all. “I like the concept,” said Xu. “Chinese people used to think you needed a spoon and saucer to drink coffee. Now, walking around with a Starbucks cup in your hand has become a fashion statement for Chinese.” With the U.S. market maturing, few prizes are as enticing as China and its population of more than 1.3 billion. Starbucks entered China in 1999 and now has more than 570 stores in 48 cities. By 2015, it plans over 1,500 stores in 70-plus cities, though that would still only account for about half of China’s major cities and would be just a fraction of the 10,800 cafes in the United States. “It could very well be exactly what’s happening with Yum,” Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management, referring to KFC parent Yum Brands Inc. The U.S. fast-food company got an early foothold in China and now gets more revenue from that market than any other. And while Starbucks’ China cafes contribute less than 5 percent of company revenue, their store operating profit margins, at around 22 percent, are higher than U.S. cafes because they charge essentially U.S. prices in a market famed for its low labor and other costs. But even with that big silver lining, there are big impediments to growth including low incomes, rising costs and the fact that most Chinese don’t have a coffee habit. The market is still small, with specialist coffee shops such as Starbucks booking sales of $358 million from mainland China in 2010, although that was up from $104 million in 2005, according to Euromonitor International. By comparison, the United States accounts for $8 billion in revenue for Starbucks. Consumers in China drink an average of just three cups of coffee per year, according to an industry study, while for many Starbucks prices are simply out of reach. Based on average wages in China, it would take 1.3 hours of work in the more affluent east of China to buy a Starbucks tall (12-ounce) caramel macchiato. That goes up to 1.6 hours in the west and 1.9 hours in central China, says Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore. Affordability remains a top concern for analysts, who worry that as Starbucks’ expansion progresses beyond the country’s biggest cities it will be less able raise prices to protect margins. But CEO Schultz said income has not been a barrier to growth, adding that Starbucks’ shops in non-core markets perform “as well or better” than stores in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, helped by pent-up demand.

163,SBUX,"Starbucks aims to woo China workers, parents","LOS ANGELES/BEIJING (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp wants to make its mainland China expansion a family affair. The world’s biggest coffee chain is opening cafes in China at a rate of one every four days in its quest to expand from about 570 shops today to more than 1,500 by 2015. To get there, it will need to recruit thousands of employees, many of whom have extraordinarily close ties to their parents, due to the country’s one-child rule. So this week, Starbucks (SBUX.O) is hosting China store managers and their parents — about 1,100 in all — at getting-to-know-you events in Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese parents are known for doing anything they can to help their children succeed, whether at work or in love, and in doing so give America’s hands-on “helicopter parents” a run for their money. In his pitch to Chinese parents in Beijing on Wednesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said: “As we expand our footprint across China, we are committed to sharing our success and continue to grow together with them and their families.” Schultz, a well-known U.S. executive, is no stranger to recruiting and makes frequent appearances at China universities as part of the company’s ongoing hiring efforts. Still, he said the China events are a first for Starbucks. “This is about showing respect” to Chinese families and demonstrating “why we are a different type of company,” Schultz told Reuters in an interview leading up to the events. Finding the right managers and staff in China is “very, very difficult,” said Paul French, chief China analyst at market research firm Mintel. The Seattle-based Starbucks currently has about 10,000 employees in China and is competing with numerous chains for those skilled workers. The company’s rivals in China include Britain’s Costa Coffee (WTB.L), South Korean-owned bakery chains Paris Baguette and Tous Les Jours, and Pacific Coffee, which is majority-owned by Hong Kong-listed China Resources Enterprise Ltd (0291.HK). McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) sells coffee in the market, where it also is growing rapidly, and U.S. coffee chains Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf also have China expansion plans. Starbucks appears to have an edge over some rivals in China, some experts said. It invests in training and its employees are efficient, consistent, cheerful and often speak some English. It has the additional advantage of being a well-known international company in a nation where parents care about brand recognition, said James Roy, senior analyst at China Market Research, a Shanghai-based consultancy. “Parents are a good stakeholder to get onboard in terms of employee happiness,” said Roy, who added that many young Chinese workers live with parents, who may want them home for dinner and not working too hard.

164,SBUX,REFILE-Starbucks to phase out coloring from crushed beetles,"April 19 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp said on its blog on Thursday that it will stop using a natural, government-approved coloring made from crushed beetles in its strawberry flavoring by late June, bowing to pressure from some vegetarian customers. Starbucks has been using the extract in its strawberry frappuccinos and smoothies, as well as some desserts like raspberry swirl cake. “After a thorough, yet fastidious, evaluation, I am pleased to report that we are reformulating the affected products to assure the highest quality possible,” Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks U.S., wrote in a blog post. Instead, the coffeehouse chain said it plans to use lycopene, a natural, tomato-based extract. Burrows said Starbucks “fell short” of customer expectations. One blogger in March began an online petition to pressure Starbucks to stop the practice.

166,SBUX,"Starbucks profit up, but Europe is a challenge","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly profit but global sales at established coffee shops fell short of analysts’ estimates due to weakness in Europe, sending its shares down five percent in after-hours trade on Thursday. Sales from cafes open at least 13 months fell 1 percent in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region during the latest quarter. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a 2.2 percent rise in EMEA same-store sales. Executives attributed the drop to weakness in Europe, which suffered its first decline in same-store sales since 2009. Sales fell in Ireland and Germany during the fiscal second quarter and were up just slightly in France and the United Kingdom, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said. Europe has been a weak spot for the world’s biggest coffee chain. The region is grappling with debt woes and austerity measures and, earlier this week, Britain said its economy had fallen into its second recession since the financial crisis. “The situation is very, very tough,” Chief Executive Howard Schultz said of Europe’s economy. “We will turn the Europe business around in the same way we turned the U.S. business around,” Schultz told analysts on a conference call. Starbucks has tasked Michelle Gass, a veteran Starbucks executive who was a leader in the U.S. turnaround, with reviving the Europe business. While the Americas region accounts for most of Starbucks’ revenue and operating profit, EMEA contributes roughly 10 percent of company revenue and in the latest quarter posted an operating loss of $5.5 million. Starbucks shares were down 4.9 percent at $57.67 in extended trading. While investors focused on Europe, results from the United States — which brews up most of the company’s business — remained on track. “The U.S. consumer has been very strong for us,” Alstead told Reuters. Net income at the world’s biggest coffee chain was up almost 19 percent to $309.9 million, or 40 cents per share, for the second quarter ended April 1 — a penny better than analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 15 percent to $3.2 billion. Same-store sales were up 8 percent in the Americas and 18 percent in the China/Asia Pacific region — roughly in line with analysts’ estimates. On the heels of its second-quarter profit beat, Starbucks raised its 2012 forecast for earnings of $1.81 to $1.84 per share, up from $1.78 to $1.82 per share, previously. That forecast calls for third-quarter earnings of 45 cents to 46 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expect a third-quarter profit of 46 cents per share, excluding items, and full-year profit of $1.86, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Although it raised its forecast, Starbucks — which has locked in prices for its coffee for this year and most of next year — said it does not expect to benefit from lower commodity costs until next year. “It’s not the earnings tailwind that a lot of us thought. That’s not going to be well-received given where estimates are,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller said. Starbucks returned to profit growth in 2010 after a two-year restructuring that involved slashing costs and closing nearly 1,000 cafes around the world. Investors of Starbucks have seen shares of the company soar since the restructuring, rising from just under $10 in February 2009 to a close above $60 on Thursday.

Sales from cafes open at least 13 months fell 1 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) during the quarter, but were up 8 percent in the Americas and 18 percent in the China/Asia Pacific region. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix were expecting same-stores sales to rise 2.2 percent in EMEA, 8.1 percent in the Americas, and 18.3 percent in China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said the economy in Europe is “challenging”. Shares of Seattle-based Starbucks fell 4.9 percent to $57.68 in extended trading. Same-store sales were down in Germany, which tends to be very sensitive to economic events, and rose just slightly in France and the United Kingdom, Alstead told Reuters in an interview. Europe has been a weak spot for the world’s biggest coffee chain. The region is grappling with debt woes and austerity measures and earlier this week, Britain said its economy had fallen into its second recession since the financial crisis. Starbucks has dispatched an executive who was instrumental in its U.S. turnaround to revive its business in Europe. The Americas account for most of Starbucks’ revenue and operating profit, while the EMEA region contributes about 10 percent of company revenue and just 2 percent of operating profit. Although EMEA brings in about twice as much revenue as Asia, it lags that region in operating profit because rent, labor and other costs are higher.

171,SBUX,Starbucks baristas can't be union billboards: court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks baristas were out of line sticking Industrial Workers of the World pins all over their clothing in support of attempts to be part of a labor union, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday. The court said a Starbucks Corp policy limiting employees to displaying only one pro-union button or pin on their work uniforms was not an unfair labor practice. One employee at a Starbucks location in New York had tried to display eight union pins on her clothing, according to court papers. The case, a dispute between the National Labor Relations Board and the company, arose out of unionization efforts at several Starbucks coffee shops in Manhattan between 2004 and 2007. None of Starbucks’s 7,000 stores in the United States are unionized. Starbucks argued that a NLRB ruling allowing employees to wear an unlimited number of buttons would convert them into “personal message boards” for the union. “We conclude that the Board has gone too far in invalidating Starbucks’s one button limitation,” the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling. It said the company was entitled “to avoid the distraction” that numerous union buttons would create from messages on Starbucks-issued pins. A spokeswoman for the NLRB declined to comment on the ruling. Starbucks’ one-button policy was carried out following an informal settlement with the NLRB in March 2006. The prohibited pins were less than 1 inch in diameter and bore the initials “IWW” for Industrial Workers of the World in white letters against a red background. Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson said the decision was an “affirmation of the progressive and positive workplace that we strive to create” for baristas and shift supervisors. The case is the National Labor Relations Board v Starbucks Corp in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 10-3511.

177,SBUX,Starbucks buying San Francisco bakery chain,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Monday it is buying La Boulange Bakery owner Bay Bread LLC in a deal that takes aim at what long has been seen as its biggest weakness: food. The $100 million cash deal is also Starbucks’ biggest move yet outside of coffee. The world’s largest coffee chain said its first priority is to roll out La Boulange-branded croissants, pastries, muffins and other food in its own stores, starting in the San Francisco Bay Area where the bakery is based. Chief Executive Howard Schultz called the deal a “significant opportunity and catalyst,” saying La Boulange’s artisan bakery goods will attract more customers and bolster both food and beverage sales. In a conference call with analysts, he said customers would see food presented in a different way at Starbucks cafes. Starbucks also plans to expand La Boulange from 19 cafes into a national chain. The bakery will continue to supply its existing restaurant, hotel and specialty grocery store customers. Over time, Starbucks plans to expand such sales. La Boulange will be the second business Starbucks has acquired in less than a year. It bought juice seller Evolution Fresh for $30 million in cash in November and opened the first in a planned collection of Evolution Fresh juice bars in a swanky Seattle suburb in March. Starbucks’ acquisition of Bay Bread from majority investor Next World Group, is scheduled to close in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept 30. The deal is expected to reduce Starbucks’ earnings per share in the second half of fiscal 2012 by a total of 2 cents. Investments will continue into fiscal 2013, when earnings-per-share dilution will moderate, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said on a conference call with analysts. The company is also working on potential food investments in Europe, Schultz said. Shares in Starbucks slipped 2.3 percent to $52.65 in extended trading following the announcement, even as some analysts gave the deal a thumbs-up. Just one-third of transactions at Starbucks’ U.S. cafes include food, executives said. Food now accounts for about 19 percent of Starbucks U.S. store business, or about $1.5 billion in annual revenue at domestic, company-operated stores, they said. Indeed, it is not uncommon to see office workers carrying a drink from Starbucks and a bag of food from rivals like McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) or Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O). “Their food has always been the thing that people have complained about,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said. “The question investors will ask is: ‘Is this the best way to do it?’” While many U.S. Starbucks cafes have food warming ovens, none have kitchens. That has allowed the company to focus on cranking out high-profit drinks, but has restricted efforts to make its food more appealing.

It also intends to build the 19-cafe San Francisco Bay Area operator into a national chain. La Boulange will be the second retail business Starbucks has acquired in less than a year. It bought juice seller Evolution Fresh for $30 million in cash in November and opened the first in a planned collection of Evolution Fresh juice bars in a swanky Seattle suburb in March. Starbucks’ acquisition of Bay Bread is scheduled to close in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept 30. It is expected to reduce earnings per share in the second half of the fiscal year by a total of 2 cents, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters. Food now accounts for about 19 percent of Starbucks U.S. store business, or about $1.5 billion in annual revenue at domestic, company-operated stores. Despite the fact that two-thirds of transactions at U.S. Starbucks cafes do not include a food purchase, the category has grown by double-digit percentage rates in each of the last two fiscal years within the company, Alstead said. “There’s still a huge opportunity for us to do more,” Alstead said. The CFO expects that offering higher quality and more variety in the food department will perk up sales overall. “As more traffic comes in to our stores, we know that if they’re buying food, there’s an opportunity for them to buy a beverage,” Alstead said. While many U.S. Starbucks cafe have food warming ovens, none have kitchens. That has allowed the company to focus on cranking out high-profit drinks, but has restricted efforts to make its food more appealing.",6042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-laboulange-acquisition/starbucks-buying-san-francisco-bakery-idUSL1E8H4FIR20120604
180,SBUX,UPDATE 1-US Starbucks shops to start K-Cup sales next week,"* Sales to start Tuesday, June 12 * Starbucks expects K-cups to boost FY12 EPS by 3-5 cents * Shares in Starbucks, Green Mountain up modestly By Lisa Baertlein June 7 (Reuters) - U.S. Starbucks Corp stores will begin selling single-serve K-Cup coffee pods for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s popular Keurig brewers on June 12, the company told Reuters on Thursday. The move, which comes months earlier than some on Wall Street had expected, will expand points of sale to most of the company’s roughly 11,000 U.S. shops and should help boost results at both Starbucks and Green Mountain. Single-cup brewers make fresh cups of coffee, or even  espresso drinks, in seconds. The single-cup category is small compared with the overall coffee sector, but growing rapidly. Due to strong sales through grocery stores, retailers like Target Corp and Starbucks own online store, executives from the world’s biggest coffee chain in April said the contribution from K-Cups to this fiscal year’s profit could come in at the top end of the forecasted range of 3 to 5 cents. “From Starbucks’ perspective, we view the earlier-than-expected roll out as a positive,” Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a client note. “That said, keep in mind that marketing spend by Starbucks regarding K-Cups could be heavy, and as such, this could place a lid on the ultimate EPS upside potential from K-Cups both for the remainder of fiscal 2012 and for fiscal 2013 as a whole,” he said. The move also should benefit Green Mountain during a typically slower seasonal period for coffee, Kalinowski said. Green Mountain gets the bulk of its profits from K-Cup sales. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.4 percent to $54.23, while  Green Mountain was up 0.3 percent to $24.59.",6072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-greenmountain-kcups/update-1-us-starbucks-shops-to-start-k-cup-sales-next-week-idUSL1E8H7AYK20120607

182,SBUX,Starbucks brews a few U.S. factory jobs,"LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Tuesday will debut the first products in a line of U.S.-made mugs and other merchandise that will be sold in its roughly 7,000 U.S. cafes to support domestic manufacturing and raise money for its Create Jobs for USA fund. The move from the world’s biggest coffee chain follows Chief Executive Howard Schultz’s call to fellow executives to step up hiring and take a bigger role in the country’s economic revival. Domestic manufacturing, once a pillar of the economy, has been hard-hit by globalization. The industry now employs about 12 million people, down from a peak of nearly 20 million around 1980, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. The new line of U.S.-made merchandise includes a 16-ounce acrylic tumbler made in Chicago, whole bean coffee that is blended, roasted and packaged in the United States and a 16-ounce ceramic mug made with domestically sourced raw materials at the American Mug & Stein factory in East Liverpool, Ohio. That formerly struggling factory in what was once known as the pottery capital of the United States expanded its workforce from 14 to 22 after the Starbucks order, the coffee chain said. While that does little to offset the jobs lost when Starbucks closed roughly 600 U.S. cafes during its ultimately successful turnaround in 2008 and 2009, the move signals growing corporate interest in bringing back U.S. factory jobs. The company partnered with the Opportunity Finance Network, a group of private lenders, to start Create Jobs for USA late last year. Starbucks will make a donation to the fund for each U.S.-made product sold. The U.S. employment market as a whole has been stumbling. In May, nonfarm payroll added only 69,000 jobs, the smallest gain in a year.",6122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-manufacturing/starbucks-brews-a-few-u-s-factory-jobs-idUSL1E8HB4L920120612

190,SBUX,"Starbucks cuts view, U.S. slows; shares sink","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) cut its outlook for the current quarter, citing global economic weakness and a recent slowdown in visits in the United States, its biggest market for sales and profits, sending shares tumbling more than 9 percent. The stunning news from one of the food industry’s top performers followed disappointing results from restaurant chains Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and added to worries that U.S. consumers were cutting discretionary spending. The world’s biggest coffee chain began seeing U.S. traffic slow in June, Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in an interview. The company, which also missed Wall Street’s estimate for earnings in the latest quarter, has been struggling in Europe for some time. “We’re dealing with significant global economic and consumer challenges,” Schultz said of the company. “Traffic trends are noticeably down in many areas across the U.S. and ... have continued in July,” Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said on a conference call with analysts. Up until recently, the relatively affluent U.S. consumers who frequent chains like Starbucks and Chipotle had continued spending despite negative economic headlines at home and around the globe. “The economic environment is definitely getting tougher,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. “Coffee’s an everyday product, but it is a premium product and people can trade down or consumer less,” he said. Starbucks now expects earnings for the current fiscal fourth quarter to be 44 cents to 45 cents a share, below the average analyst forecast of 48 cents a share. Shares in the company had brewed up a year-to-date gain of almost 14 percent prior to Thursday’s financial report, based on strong growth and Starbucks’ seeming ability to deflect whatever shock the global economy could throw its way. Expectations had been very high, Russo said: “It was still a good quarter ... there just wasn’t any margin for a miss.” Shares in Starbucks dropped 9.4 percent to $47.46 in extended trading. Net income for the fiscal third-quarter ended July 1 grew a healthy 19 percent to $333.1 million, or 43 cents per share, but still missed analysts’ average forecast by 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 6 percent, just shy of what analysts expected, according to both Thomson Reuters and Consensus Metrix. That included a 7 percent gain for the Americas region and a 12 percent jump for the China-Asia Pacific unit. In Europe, same-store sales were flat. Starbucks long has fought to make its mark on the well-established cafe culture in that region, where government belt-tightening has dented consumer spending. The company’s forecast for earnings of $2.04 to $2.14 per share next year also was significantly below analysts’ average estimate of $2.28 per share. Still, its expectation for same-restaurant sales growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range next year is “significantly positive,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matt DiFrisco, who counts Starbucks and Panera Bread Co PNRA.O as his top picks in the restaurant category.

The world’s largest coffee chain said on Thursday that store traffic was “noticeably down” in many areas across the United States in a sluggish pattern that began in June and continued in July. The company missed Wall Street’s quarterly profit estimate by 2 cents a share, a rarity for one of the food industry’s top performers that, along with disappointing results from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), has stoked fears about a revision of growth expectations for the sector. “I’d be cautious right now,” Investment Technology Group Inc research analyst Steve West said. “They’re all high-valuation stocks.

195,SBUX,Starbucks embraces mobile payments with start-up Square,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) deal to use Square Inc to process payments at its U.S. coffee shops is a big win for a 2-year-old startup that is beginning to threaten established payment processors and shake up retailing. As part of the deal announced on Wednesday, the world’s biggest coffee chain will also invest $25 million in Square, the San Francisco-based company led by Jack Dorsey, co-founder of social media company Twitter Inc. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will also join Square’s board Starbucks acquired its stake as a participant in Square’s recent $200 million funding round that valued the company at $3.25 billion - sharply up from its $1.6 billion valuation just a year ago - a person familiar with the matter said. For Square, “the Starbucks deal will bring millions and millions of consumers to their application,” said Dana Stalder, a partner at venture-capital firm Matrix Partners and former chief operating officer at PayPal. The alliance comes as Square faces increasingly stiff competition from rivals such as eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and Intuit Inc (INTU.O) as everyone rushes to offer mobile payment processing tools. The swift rise of these tools in recent years has led some observers to predict a future in which consumers leave wallets at home. That could transform retailing, but also create security headaches for existing payment processing businesses. News of the deal sent the shares of VeriFone Systems Inc (PAY.N) - a company that produces a widely used credit card processing machine - tumbling about 12 percent to $34.18 by the close of trading on Wednesday. Earlier this year, VeriFone launched a product called Sail that competes with Square. Currently, Starbucks uses the payment-processing services of a bank, a person familiar with the situation said, while declining to name the bank. Processing services from major banks include Bank of America Merchant Services (BAC.N) and JP Morgan Chase & Co’s Chase Paymentech. Starbucks declined to comment on its existing processor. At least initially, the Starbucks partnership will only rewire the way lattes and frappucinos are charged. Square technology will be integrated into Starbucks’ existing point-of-sale hardware and consumers will not notice anything different as a barista swipes their credit cards. But in the future, Starbucks said it plans to roll out certain cutting-edge Square products, including one that allows stores to use proximity sensors to pick up when a user carrying a smartphone loaded with Square’s app has walked in the door. Clerks could accept payments simply by taking that user’s name and charging their account. “The level of innovation was so compelling,” Schultz said in an interview on Tuesday. But the proliferation of such technology has also raised concerns. “There are a number of problems there - from somebody stealing your device to the problem of the drive-by download,” said Chris Hoofnagle, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley Law School. “On the other hand, maybe presenting your name and face could reduce skimming risk - of somebody taking your card and copying the information.” Credit card issuers, meanwhile, welcomed the deal, saying it helps spread the use of their consumer credit offerings. “Square is enabling transactions to flow electronically. That’s always good,” Visa Inc (V.N) CEO Joe Saunders said in an interview on Wednesday on CNBC. Visa made an investment in Square last year. But in the long run, getting consumers to download the app, rather than simply handing over their credit cards, is important for building up the more profitable aspects of Square’s business, such as potentially getting consumers to link bank accounts to the service, analysts said. “Square has done an incredible job on the merchant side of its business,” said Stalder. “The piece of the equation they’ve had less success with is the consumer side.” Stalder said that to further cement consumer loyalty, Square should target other types of stores that attract frequent repeat business, such as quick-serve restaurants. If Square catches on broadly, it will also likely impact providers of back-end services known as merchant acquisition — basically, providing the bridge between the merchant and the big payment networks such as MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa. Competitors in this area include Intuit, First Data Corp and Total Merchant Services. Some of them shrugged off the deal. “Anything that generates awareness of mobile payments is beneficial for everybody involved,” said Chris Hylan, general manager of mobile-payments at Intuit, which focuses on small businesses. Starbucks has been a successful early adopter of technology ranging from mobile payment options to social media marketing tools such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter. In early 2011, it released a mobile phone app that lets users load money onto smartphones, which are then scanned at the cash register to pay for drinks. It now boasts more than 1 million mobile transactions a week in the United States. Schultz said the tie-up would lower payment processing fees at the coffee chain’s almost 7,000 company-owned shops in the United States, but he did not say by how much. In its quest for small business clients who do not currently accept credit cards, Square typically touts its flat 2.75 percent per transaction fee as a simple alternative to the various fees some payment processors charge. The company has grown swiftly, saying in June that it was processing more than $6 billion a year in payments. Dorsey declined to disclose the rate that Square extended to Starbucks, which rang up more than $8 billion in U.S. sales through its 6,705 company-operated and 4,082 licensed shops in fiscal 2011. “Obviously as you scale up, you do see reductions in cost and Starbucks is a very significant scale compared to a lot of other merchants in the world,” Dorsey said. It is likely Square cut the rate it typically charges merchants to match or beat the one Starbucks was paying its processor, perhaps in the low 2 percent range, Stalder said. “I suspect this is not about making money,” he said. “This is about consumer adoption of their platform.” Schultz has a soft spot for start-ups, co-founding Maveron LLC, a Seattle-based venture-capital firm, and investing in daily-deals site Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) while it was still a private company.

For Square, “the Starbucks deal will bring millions and millions of consumers to their application,” said Dana Stalder, a partner at venture-capital firm Matrix Partners and former chief operating officer at PayPal. The alliance comes as Square faces increasingly stiff competition from rivals such as eBay Inc and Intuit Inc  as everyone rushes to offer mobile payment processing tools. The swift rise of these tools in recent years has led some observers to predict a future in which consumers leave wallets at home. That could transform retailing, but also create security headaches for existing payment processing businesses. News of the deal sent the shares of VeriFone Systems Inc  - a company that produces a widely used credit card processing machine - tumbling about 12 percent to $34.18 by the close of trading on Wednesday. Earlier this year, VeriFone launched a product called Sail that competes with Square. Currently, Starbucks uses the payment-processing services of a bank, a person familiar with the situation said, while declining to name the bank. Processing services from major banks include Bank of America Merchant Services and JP Morgan Chase & Co’s Chase Paymentech. Starbucks declined to comment on its existing processor. At least initially, the Starbucks partnership will only rewire the way lattes and frappucinos are charged. Square technology will be integrated into Starbucks’ existing point-of-sale hardware and consumers will not notice anything different as a barista swipes their credit cards. But in the future, Starbucks said it plans to roll out certain cutting-edge Square products, including one that allows stores to use proximity sensors to pick up when a user carrying a smartphone loaded with Square’s app has walked in the door. Clerks could accept payments simply by taking that user’s name and charging their account. “The level of innovation was so compelling,” Schultz said in an interview on Tuesday. But the proliferation of such technology has also raised concerns. “There are a number of problems there - from somebody stealing your device to the problem of the drive-by download,” said Chris Hoofnagle, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley Law School. “On the other hand, maybe presenting your name and face could reduce skimming risk - of somebody taking your card and copying the information.” Credit card issuers, meanwhile, welcomed the deal, saying  it helps spread the use of their consumer credit offerings. “Square is enabling transactions to flow electronically. That’s always good,” Visa Inc CEO Joe Saunders said in an interview on Wednesday on CNBC. Visa made an investment in Square last year. But in the long run, getting consumers to download the app, rather than simply handing over their credit cards, is important for building up the more profitable aspects of Square’s business, such as potentially getting consumers to link bank accounts to the service, analysts said. “Square has done an incredible job on the merchant side of its business,” said Stalder. “The piece of the equation they’ve had less success with is the consumer side.” Stalder said that to further cement consumer loyalty, Square should target other types of stores that attract frequent repeat business, such as quick-serve restaurants. If Square catches on broadly, it will also likely impact providers of back-end services known as merchant acquisition - basically, providing the bridge between the merchant and the big payment networks such as MasterCard Inc and Visa. Competitors in this area include Intuit, First Data Corp and Total Merchant Services. Some of them shrugged off the deal. “Anything that generates awareness of mobile payments is beneficial for everybody involved,” said Chris Hylan, general manager of mobile-payments at Intuit, which focuses on small businesses. Starbucks has been a successful early adopter of technology ranging from mobile payment options to social media marketing tools such as Facebook Inc and Twitter. In early 2011, it released a mobile phone app that lets users load money onto smartphones, which are then scanned at the cash register to pay for drinks. It now boasts more than 1 million mobile transactions a week in the United States. Schultz said the tie-up would lower payment processing fees at the coffee chain’s almost 7,000 company-owned shops in the United States, but he did not say by how much. In its quest for small business clients who do not currently accept credit cards, Square typically touts its flat 2.75 percent per transaction fee as a simple alternative to the various fees some payment processors charge. The company has grown swiftly, saying in June that it was processing more than $6 billion a year in payments. Dorsey declined to disclose the rate that Square extended to Starbucks, which rang up more than $8 billion in U.S. sales through its 6,705 company-operated and 4,082 licensed shops in fiscal 2011. “Obviously as you scale up, you do see reductions in cost and Starbucks is a very significant scale compared to a lot of other merchants in the world,” Dorsey said. It is likely Square cut the rate it typically charges merchants to match or beat the one Starbucks was paying its processor, perhaps in the low 2 percent range, Stalder said. “I suspect this is not about making money,” he said. “This is about consumer adoption of their platform.” Schultz has a soft spot for start-ups, co-founding Maveron LLC, a Seattle-based venture-capital firm, and investing in daily-deals site Groupon Inc while it was still a private company.",8082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-square/update-2-starbucks-embraces-mobile-payments-with-start-up-square-idUSL2E8J8FPR20120808

The world’s biggest coffee chain bought Evolution Fresh for $30 million in cash in November. Starbucks plans to sell Evolution Fresh juices in its shops and through other retail outlets. The latest move should help the company complete the roll-out of Evolution Fresh products on the U.S. West Coast and support a planned eastward expansion, Jeff Hansberry, Starbucks’ president of channel development, said. “This will allow us to go further, faster with Evolution Fresh juices,” Hansberry said. Starbucks is moving Evolution Fresh juice production from a roughly 72,000-square-foot  facility in San Bernardino to a 260,000-square-foot building in Rancho Cucamonga.

203,SBUX,Korean coffee craze may be hit by curbs,"SEOUL (Reuters) - These days, a stroll on the streets of southern Seoul is just as likely to bring the fragrance of fresh-brewed coffee as that of kimchi or more traditional Korean foods. Nearly one in every two buildings boasts a coffee shop, from Starbucks to local brands such as Caffe Bene and Angel-in-us Coffee. Despite the existence of shops a mere 70 metres (yards) apart, it can still be hard to find a seat on some evenings even though a cup can cost more than a meal. In short, South Korea, home to the world’s third largest number of Starbucks stores after the United States and Japan, has become a major battleground for coffee chains - so much so that government restrictions may lie ahead. “There are few places where I can meet my friends comfortably. So I go to coffee shops,” said Ko Sun-bee, a high school teacher in Seoul. Though coffee was once a luxury drink, the market in South Korea has grown at a dizzying rate. The number of coffee shops jumped nearly ten-fold to 12,381 during the five years from 2006 to 2011. South Korean adults consumed an average 338 cups of coffee last year, and coffee imports jumped 44 percent to 130,000 tonnes over the past four years, said the Korea Customs service. The value of the market overall has climbed 17 times to 2.48 trillion Korean won during the same time, according to a think tank affiliated with KB Financial Group. The spark was lit by Starbucks, which entered the market in 1999, analysts said. “Without Starbucks, there would be no coffee boom here,” said Lee Taek-gwang, a culture commentator and professor at Kyung-hee University in Seoul. “Starbucks is the symbol of U.S. culture and gained widespread popularity among young Koreans who admire it.” The number of Starbucks stores more than doubled to 367 over the past five years. The company said last year that it plans to raise that number to 700 by 2016. The market for espressos and lattes turned out to be big enough to help boost the fortunes of other coffee chains and individual shops. “I am very grateful to Starbucks,” said Yeo Seon-koo, who runs Yeondoo, a coffee shop known to aficionados for the quality of its brew and its beans. “Koreans were previously used to spending 300 won for a cup of coffee, but Starbucks has made them willing to pay nearly 5,000 won, whether they like it or not.” Asia’s fourth-biggest economy, in fact, now has so many coffee shops that regulators are considering whether or not to impose a “distance” between new franchises to protect them from cut-throat competition. “A franchise operator allows one store to open very close to another under the same brand, which reduces sales at the existing store significantly. This puts a lot of damage on the existing store,” said an official at the antitrust watchdog Fair Trade Commission. The FTC will start talks with coffee franchise operators on whether to impose distance and other rules, with the aim of announcing guidelines by September. It took a similar step in April with bakeries, mandating that there can be no more than one franchise shop every 500 meters when opening a new store. The move came amid criticism of bakeries linked to large industrial conglomerates, which critics said were hurting smaller-scale outlets. But whatever the result, the coffee fever is unlikely to cool any time soon. Yeo, of Yeondoo, said that while the metropolitan Seoul market for coffee franchises is currently saturated, coffee consumption remains low compared to the national income level, meaning further growth is still possible. “The market is still at an early mature stage here,” he said.

South Korean adults consumed an average 338 cups of coffee last year, and coffee imports jumped 44 percent to 130,000 tonnes over the past four years, said the Korea Customs service. The value of the market overall has climbed 17 times to 2.48 trillion Korean won ($2.19 billion) during the same time, according to a think tank affiliated with KB Financial Group. The spark was lit by Starbucks, which entered the market in 1999, analysts said. “Without Starbucks, there would be no coffee boom here,” said Lee Taek-gwang, a culture commentator and professor at Kyung-hee University in Seoul. “Starbucks is the symbol of U.S. culture and gained widespread popularity among young Koreans who admire it.” The number of Starbucks stores more than doubled to 367 over the past five years. The company said last year that it plans to raise that number to 700 by 2016. The market for espressos and lattes turned out to be big enough to help boost the fortunes of other coffee chains and individual shops. “I am very grateful to Starbucks,” said Yeo Seon-koo, who runs Yeondoo, a coffee shop known to aficionados for the quality of its brew and its beans. “Koreans were previously used to spending 300 won for a cup of coffee, but Starbucks has made them willing to pay nearly 5,000 won, whether they like it or not.” Asia’s fourth-biggest economy, in fact, now has so many coffee shops that regulators are considering whether or not to impose a “distance” between new franchises to protect them from cut-throat competition. “A franchise operator allows one store to open very close to another under the same brand, which reduces sales at the existing store significantly. This puts a lot of damage on the existing store,” said an official at the antitrust watchdog Fair Trade Commission. The FTC will start talks with coffee franchise operators on whether to impose distance and other rules, with the aim of announcing guidelines by September. It took a similar step in April with bakeries, mandating that there can be no more than one franchise shop every 500 meters when opening a new store. The move came amid criticism of bakeries linked to large industrial conglomerates, which critics said were hurting smaller-scale outlets. But whatever the result, the coffee fever is unlikely to cool any time soon. Yeo, of Yeondoo, said that while the metropolitan Seoul market for coffee franchises is currently saturated, coffee consumption remains low compared to the national income level,  meaning further growth is still possible. “The market is still at an early mature stage here,” he said.

206,SBUX,Starbucks to offer deal through LivingSocial,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp, the world’s largest coffee chain, is offering consumers a deal this week through daily-deal company LivingSocial, a vote of confidence in Groupon Inc’s main rival. LivingSocial, part owned by Amazon.com Inc, will offer a $10 Starbucks gift card for $5 on Wednesday. Customers have six months to claim the card, which can be used across the United States, according to company executives. Starbucks plans to offer the deal to members of its rewards program, via email, Tuesday evening, giving loyal customers the first chance to buy. The companies plan to sell at least one million deals, they said. Shares of Groupon, the world’s largest daily deal company, have slumped since its IPO last year. That has cast doubt about the viability of the daily deal business. Groupon stock hit a record low of $4 on Tuesday. It was unchanged at $4.15 in afternoon trade. Before the IPO, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz was on Groupon’s board of directors and his Maveron investment firm was an investor in Groupon. Schultz stepped down from the board in May. Adam Brotman, Starbucks’ chief digital officer, said the company’s decision to work with LivingSocial shows that daily deals still work for some merchants. “It’s an evolving space,” Brotman said. “The type of deal, the type of merchant and the implementation of offers are going to be different from circumstance to circumstance.” It is the coffee chain’s first nationwide deal with LivingSocial. Earlier this year, Starbucks ran a similar deal with Google Offers, the daily deal business owned by Google Inc. “This was a great opportunity to work with LivingSocial,” Brotman said. “It wasn’t about anybody else in the space.” ",9042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-livingsocial/starbucks-to-offer-deal-through-livingsocial-idUSBRE8830V620120904

212,SBUX,U.S. Starbucks stores get Square mobile pay in November,"(Reuters) - Smartphone-wielding Starbucks customers in the United States will get a new way to pay in early November when the world’s biggest coffee chain begins accepting Square Wallet mobile payments at its roughly 7,000 company-operated U.S. stores. Starbucks (SBUX.O), which has embraced new technology ranging from social media to mobile payments, on Thursday said it also plans to add digital tipping next summer - something sure to thrill its baristas. Details of the roll-out follow two months after the announcement of the high-profile partnership between Starbucks and Square, a hot start-up led by Twitter Inc co-founder Jack Dorsey. The deal is expected to help boost the nascent mobile payments industry because Square will process all of Starbucks’ credit and debit card payments. Starting next month, Square users will show Starbucks cashiers a bar code on their phones. That code will be scanned for payment. That process eventually will change to one where Square’s global positioning system, or GPS, technology detects the customer’s phone in the store. The customer then will “pay” by giving his or her name to the cashier, who will verify it with a name and photo displayed on the register’s screen. Starbucks debuted its own payment apps for mobile phones in January 2011. Since then, its customers have conducted 70 million mobile transactions, Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks’ Americas region, told Reuters. “Many of our customers are early adopters,” Burrows said when asked what has driven the company to invest in mobile payments. Users of Square and Starbucks’ own mobile payment app in the summer of 2013 will get the option to add a tip to their check, Burrows said. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz, who joined Square’s board after the coffee chain invested $25 million in the San Francisco-based company, in August said the agreement with Square would lower the coffee chain’s payment processing fees, but he declined to elaborate. Debit and credit card swipe fees can amount to significant costs for merchants, especially those that make a lot of small sales. Square will handle Starbucks’ debit and credit card transactions, which have a fee attached to each sale. Starbucks’ own payment application allows customers to load money into an account with a credit or debit card and then work off that balance as purchases are made. Starbucks only pays payment processing fees when the money is loaded into the account. Starbucks rang up more than $8 billion in U.S. sales in fiscal 2011. Globally, transactions paid for with mobile technology are forecast to increase nearly fourfold to more than $1.3 trillion annually by 2017, according to a recent report from Juniper Research. Well-known restaurant chains like Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s are helping to drive that increase. Dunkin’ Donuts in August released its own mobile app with a payment feature that is similar to Starbucks’. Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin’ Brands (DNKN.O), said the doughnut and coffee chain’s payment app would save franchisees “a considerable amount of processing fees” because it also reduces the number of credit card transactions. Elsewhere, fast-food giant McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is testing mobile payments with provider PayPal (EBAY.O) at 30 of its restaurants in France. Earlier this year, McDonald’s ran demonstrations of a broader PayPal mobile payments service at its franchisee conference in Orlando, Florida. Competition in the mobile payments arena is fierce.

214,SBUX,Chilean court upholds Starbucks labor practices fine,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s Supreme Court has upheld a fine of about $50,000 slapped on Starbucks Corp over its labor practices after unionized workers claimed the coffee shop chain threatened layoffs, benefit cuts and illegally replaced workers during a strike. Last year, Starbucks was hit by its first strike at a company-owned store, with workers in Chile seeking pay that kept up with inflation, a $100 monthly lunch stipend, as well as other benefits. “We hope the Chilean justice’s punishment of Starbucks allows for a change of mentality,” Andres Giordano, a Starbucks union president in Santiago, said in a statement on Monday. The union represents less than 10 percent of Starbucks’ workforce in Chile, the firm said. Starbucks is seen as having some of the restaurant industry’s best pay and benefits, which has helped it fend off union organization efforts in the United States, where the chain makes the vast majority of its sales. “While we disagree with this latest ruling we respect the court’s decision,” Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said. “We have always recognized and respected our partners’ right to affiliate with a union and to voice their opinions.” Santiago’s court of appeals had issued the fine.

218,SBUX,"Alsea to invest $110 mln in Mexico, Argentina Starbucks cafes","MEXICO CITY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Latin America’s biggest restaurant operator Alsea will invest $110 million over the next three years in 220 new  Starbucks cafes in Mexico and Argentina, Alsea’s CEO Fabian Gosselin said on Monday. Around $75 million of the three-year investment would be plowed into 170 new stores in Mexico, Starbucks’ fastest-growing Latin American market, with the balance going to No.2 regional market Argentina, the company told Reuters. Starbucks’ franchises in Mexico are operated by Alsea, which also runs Domino’s Pizza and Burger King chains within the country. Seattle-based Starbucks Corp, the world’s largest coffee chain, currently has 360 cafes in Mexico, but sales accounted for just a small fraction of the company’s overall 2011 global net revenue of $11.7 billion. “I think the best is yet to come in terms of the number of stores, and how big this market can be,” Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told a news conference on a visit to Mexico City to mark the chain’s 10th anniversary in its fastest growing Latin American market. While the majority of Starbucks’ some 18,000 stores are located in the United States, the company has seen much more success in Mexico than the company’s next biggest markets in the region; both Argentina and Brazil host about 50 stores each. Starbucks top executive in Mexico, Federico Tejado, says the company’s local growth over the past decade tracked a roughly 240 percent increase in per capita coffee consumption during the same time. In an interview, Tejado also confirmed that Starbucks is planning to launch its Via brand of instant coffee in Mexico, but declined to say when, adding the company would reveal more details in November. In September, Leticia Sainz, Starbucks’ technical coordinator in Mexico, told Reuters the company expects to begin offering Via “very soon.” Although consumption of fresh coffee in Mexico is growing faster, instant, or soluble, coffee is still the country’s dominant brew. According to a study released earlier this year by market analysis group Euromonitor, Mexico’s domestic coffee market is valued at $1.4 billion a year. The country has long been a major coffee exporter, and is currently the world’s No. 7 producer of high-end Arabica beans.",10152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-starbucks/alsea-to-invest-110-mln-in-mexico-argentina-starbucks-cafes-idUSL1E8LFGCP20121015

221,SBUX,UK committees to examine Starbucks tax strategies,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two British parliamentary committees are due to quiz tax officials about how Starbucks was able to avoid paying tax on 1.2 billion pounds ($1.93 billion) of sales since 2009. Lawmakers said a Reuters report that showed Starbucks had been telling investors its British unit was highly profitable while telling authorities the unit was loss-making, and thereby not liable for tax, undermined public trust in the tax system. The Seattle-based group, with a market capitalization of $40 billion, is the second-largest restaurant or cafe chain globally after McDonald’s. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee and a member of parliament for the centre-left opposition Labour party, is among several lawmakers who said they wanted Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the tax authority, to launch an investigation into the company’s tax affairs. Hodge said the head of HMRC and other officials would be testifying to the committee, whose duty it is to see the government gets value for money in its financial affairs, next month and that HMRC had “questions to answer” about the practices of Starbucks. None of the lawmakers suggested Starbucks had been engaged in any kind of wrongdoing and the company said it paid its tax in Britain to the letter of the law. The Treasury Subcommittee, which oversees HMRC, is also due to question HMRC officials and its chairman, lawmaker George Mudie, said he planned to question them about Starbucks. He said he also hoped the committee could hear from executives from the company, although he noted he would need broader committee support to call them to testify. Labour member of parliament John Mann, who sits on the subcommittee, said he would like it to hold an investigation focusing on Starbucks but Mudie said this was unlikely. HMRC does not comment on individual taxpayers and rejected any challenge to its efficacy. “We make sure that multinationals pay the right tax to the UK in accordance with UK tax law,” it said in a statement. Steve Baker, a member of parliament for the centre-right Conservative party that rules in coalition, also called for an inquiry. “I am a highly free-market person but what I want is simple transparent tax law that is actually obeyed ... there are some serious questions to answer here,” he said. Taxpayer confidentiality means HMRC would not be able to confirm a probe if it launched one. Baker and Hodge said the government could get around this, and reassure the public the matter was not being ignored, by confirming in parliament that an HMRC probe was taking place. Labour member of parliament Michael Meacher said he planned to table a motion asking the government to launch its own investigation into Starbucks and potentially other big companies that are paying minimal taxes on big British revenues. The legislators said such investigations should also lead to recommendations on how to change tax law to prevent companies from shifting profits overseas. Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks Coffee UK, told Sky News television that HMRC had not contacted the company to say it was under investigation. He added that Starbucks had no plans to change its UK accounting practices. In a blog on the company’s website, he said: “Starbucks pays and will continue to pay our share of taxes in the UK to the letter of the law.” He went on to note the contribution Starbucks makes to the British economy as an employer and as a customer for farmers and cake makers. Unions said the Reuters story on Starbucks showed the government needed to do more to close loopholes that allowed companies to avoid taxes. “Hardworking families are being forced to pay off the deficit while companies like Starbucks laugh all the way to the bank,” Len McCluskey, General-Secretary of Unite, Britain’s largest union, said. The Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions called for a boycott of the cafe chain, a call echoed by some members of parliament. “Support local cafes and bars, and send Starbucks and other tax dodgers a clear message - Unless you contribute to society, this society has no cash for your coffee,” ICTU Assistant General-Secretary Peter Bunting said.

The Treasury Subcommittee, which oversees HMRC, is also due to question HMRC officials and its chairman, lawmaker George Mudie, said he planned to question them about Starbucks. He said he also hoped the committee could hear from executives from the company, although he noted he would need broader committee support to call them to testify. Labour member of parliament John Mann, who sits on the subcommittee, said he would like it to hold an investigation focusing on Starbucks but Mudie said this was unlikely.

Taxpayer confidentiality means HMRC would not be able to confirm a probe if it launched one. Baker and Hodge said the government could get around this, and reassure the public the matter was not being ignored, by confirming in parliament that an HMRC probe was taking place. Labour member of parliament Michael Meacher said he planned to table a motion asking the government to launch its own investigation into Starbucks and potentially other big companies that are paying minimal taxes on big British revenues. The legislators said such investigations should also lead to recommendations on how to change tax law to prevent companies from shifting profits overseas. Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks Coffee UK,  told Sky News television that HMRC had not contacted the company to say it was under investigation. He added that Starbucks had no plans to change its UK accounting practices. In a blog on the company’s website, he said: “Starbucks pays and will continue to pay our share of taxes in the UK to the letter of the law.” He went on to note the contribution Starbucks makes to the British economy as an employer and as a customer for farmers and cake makers.

230,SBUX,UK lawmakers slam Starbucks tax deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers have criticized a deal the tax man made with Starbucks (SBUX.O) that allowed the coffee chain to almost eliminate its UK tax bill by deducting royalties the group paid itself for the use of its own brand. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters the UK tax authority had questioned its practice of paying 6 percent of turnover as royalties to a Dutch subsidiary and that the two parties had agreed to lower it to 4.7 percent. Royalty payments - in this case paying a related company for the use of the Starbucks brand - are deductible against UK tax. “This illustrates why we need much greater transparency. We have no way of knowing whether this was a fair settlement or whether it represents another ‘sweetheart deal’ for big business,” said Margaret Hodge who chairs the parliamentary Public Affairs Committee, which is looking at tax avoidance. The committee has previously criticized deals the tax office HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs), made with investment bank Goldman Sachs GS.L and phone group Vodafone (VOD.L). The latest criticism comes as U.S.-based Starbucks faces media and political pressure in Britain following a Reuters report that showed the company had paid just 8.6 million pounds of income tax since 1998 despite racking up 3 billion pounds in sales. Starbucks, the second-largest restaurant or cafe chain globally after McDonald’s (MCD.N), cut its tax bill by reporting losses to the authorities while telling investors the UK was profitable. On Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron faced questions in parliament about the tax practices of a number of multinationals including Starbucks. He said he was unhappy with the level of tax avoidance by big corporations working in Britain and urged HMRC to make sure all companies paid their fair share. In a telephone interview, Starbucks CFO Alstead told Reuters HMRC had questioned the UK unit’s practice of paying 6 percent of its turnover to an associated company in the Netherlands. Starbucks first disclosed the HMRC probe into royalties in its 2009 accounts but did not disclose the cut until this week. Alstead said paying brand royalties was common practice in the restaurant chain industry. Tax experts say a company would be expected to show the benefit from royalties for licenses or trademark use was critical to its profitability to enjoy the tax deduction. HMRC quizzed Starbucks after it reported a decade of losses. Alstead said that after discussion, the two agreed that the level of royalty fee that could be deducted for tax purposes would be cut to 4.7 percent of turnover. That is still higher than the 4.3 percent the UK unit of hamburger chain McDonald’s paid in the last three years for the use of its brand. Unlike Starbucks, McDonald’s UK made an average 149 million pound pretax annual profit over that period. Starbucks’ royalty payments reduced its UK earnings by 150 million pounds, cutting tax payments and building up taxable losses which can be used to offset future taxes. At current tax rates, the deduction could end up saving Starbucks around 36 million pounds in taxes. John Hemming, a member of parliament with the Liberal Democrat party, the junior member of the coalition government, said the Starbucks fee approved by HMRC appeared high. “There needs to be a detailed review of such payments,” he said. He proposed the government look at introducing withholding taxes on inter-company royalty payments or limit the amount that can be deducted from tax.

234,SBUX,"Starbucks raises 2013 forecast, defies industry trend","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) raised its profit forecast for the current fiscal year after sales in its top market of the United States topped expectations, giving the company optimism that has eluded much of the U.S. restaurant industry in recent months. Shares of the world’s biggest coffee chain jumped 7 percent to $49.90 in extended trading on Thursday. The better-than-expected quarterly results from the company known for its lattes and frappuccinos followed a string of earnings disappointments and downsized forecasts from some of the sector’s top performers, who are grappling with the still weak economy and increasing competition from resurgent rivals. Two weeks ago McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) posted its worst quarterly restaurant sales growth performance in nine years and investor darling Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) said the pace of its restaurant sales growth could cool in 2013. “Starbucks’ solid Q4 performance has ideally positioned us to go into the holiday with strong momentum,” Chief Executive Howard Schultz said on a conference call with analysts. The Seattle-based chain set its new earnings per share forecast for fiscal 2013 at $2.06 to $2.15, up from $2.04 to $2.14 per share, previously. It also raised its target for global net new stores to 1,300 from 1,200 on accelerated development plans for China. Net income for the fourth quarter ended September 30 inched up 0.1 percent to $359 million, or 46 cents per share, topping analysts’ average forecast by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall revenue rose 11 percent to $3.36 billion. Global sales at stores open at least 13 months were up 6 percent, helped by a 5 percent increase in traffic and a 1 percent rise in average spending per visit. That topped the 4.97 percent rise analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected. Same-store sales rose 7 percent in the U.S.-dominated Americas region, topping analysts’ estimate of 5.10 percent. “Those Americas comps were stronger than their Komodo dark roast. A big surprise to everyone, especially given the slowdown at Chipotle and many others in last part of September,” Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West said. In the coming months, Starbucks is counting on newer products like Evolution Fresh juices and lightly caffeinated, low calorie fruit-flavored Refreshers drinks to keep boosting sales. The company has also recently begun selling its Verismo single-serving brewer and coffee and milk pods to be used in the machine. Starbucks’ current holiday quarter is its most important for sales. Asked if those results would be hurt by Hurricane Sandy, Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said: “Over the course of the quarter no, it will not be a meaningful impact to us.” Starbucks has reopened most of the 1,000 stores that it shuttered as the super storm approached, Alstead said. Separately, Starbucks defended its tax strategy in the UK and other parts of Europe. In October, Reuters revealed that Starbucks had paid only 8.6 million pounds of income taxes on 3.1 billion pounds of sales since 1998, by reporting consistent losses, even as it told investors the UK was a profitable market. And, in a new report on Thursday, Reuters found the company’s German and French units employed a similar tax strategy. There is no evidence that Starbucks has broken tax rules in any of the countries where it operates. “We feel 100 percent assured that we are well within the law, and we feel once we’re able to tell our story, all of this will be rectified,” Schultz told CNBC.

Two weeks ago McDonald’s Corp posted its worst quarterly restaurant sales growth performance in nine years and  investor darling Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc said the pace of its restaurant sales growth could cool in 2013. “Starbucks’ solid Q4 performance has ideally positioned us to go into the holiday with strong momentum,” Chief Executive Howard Schultz said on a conference call with analysts. The Seattle-based chain set its new earnings per share forecast for fiscal 2013 at $2.06 to $2.15, up from $2.04 to $2.14 per share, previously. It also raised its target for global net new stores to 1,300 from 1,200 on accelerated development plans for China. Net income for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 inched up 0.1 percent to $359 million, or 46 cents per share, topping analysts’ average forecast by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall revenue rose 11 percent to $3.36 billion. Global sales at stores open at least 13 months were up 6 percent, helped by a 5 percent increase in traffic and a 1 percent rise in average spending per visit. That topped the 4.97 percent rise analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected. Same-store sales rose 7 percent in the U.S.-dominated Americas region, topping analysts’ estimate of 5.10 percent. “Those Americas comps were stronger than their Komodo dark roast. A big surprise to everyone, especially given the slowdown at Chipotle and many others in last part of September,” Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West said. In the coming months, Starbucks is counting on newer products like Evolution Fresh juices and lightly caffeinated, low calorie fruit-flavored Refreshers drinks to keep boosting sales. The company has also recently begun selling its Verismo single-serving brewer and coffee and milk pods to be used in the machine. Starbucks’ current holiday quarter is its most important for sales. Asked if those results would be hurt by Hurricane Sandy, Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said: “Over the course of the quarter no, it will not be a meaningful impact to us.” Starbucks has reopened most of the 1,000 stores that it shuttered as the super storm approached, Alstead said. Separately, Starbucks defended its tax strategy in the UK and other parts of Europe. In October, Reuters revealed that Starbucks had paid only 8.6 million pounds of income taxes on 3.1 billion pounds of sales since 1998, by reporting consistent losses, even as it told investors the UK was a profitable market. And, in a new report on Thursday, Reuters found the company’s German and French units employed a similar tax strategy. There is no evidence that Starbucks has broken tax rules in any of the countries where it operates. “We feel 100 percent assured that we are well within the law, and we feel once we’re able to tell our story, all of this will be rectified,” Schultz told CNBC.

238,SBUX,British lawmakers roast taxman over Starbucks tax bill,"LONDON (Reuters) - UK lawmakers tore into the chief of the tax authority on Monday for allowing coffee chain Starbucks to pay almost no corporation tax despite selling coffee and snacks worth billions of pounds to British customers. Members of parliament on the Public Accounts Committee, which is tasked with ensuring value in government financial affairs, said Starbucks’s low tax payments had undermined public trust in the whole tax system. The low tax payments from Starbucks have become a political issue in Britain since they were revealed in a Reuters investigation last month. “It just smells and it doesn’t smell of coffee. It smells bad,” Richard Bacon, member of parliament with the governing Conservative party, told Lin Homer, Chief Executive of the tax authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). “It beggars belief that such a large entity with so much underlying activity here can pay so little in corporation tax,” he added. Reuters reported last month that Starbucks had paid no corporation, or income, tax in the past three years and had paid only 8.6 million pounds ($13.74 million) in total over 13 years during which it recorded sales of 3.1 billion pounds. The company avoided UK taxes by reporting losses to HMRC, even as it told investors its UK operation was profitable. Homer declined to comment on Starbucks, citing taxpayer confidentiality, but said the agency ensured that businesses paid the taxes they should. Starbucks was not available for comment. The coffee giant, which has a market capitalization of about $39 billion, has previously said it sought to pay its fair share of taxes in every country where it operates. One of the ways that Starbucks minimizes its British profits and therefore its UK tax liability, as revealed in the Reuters investigation, is by having the UK unit pay large royalties to its subsidiaries in other countries for use of its brand. Starbucks pays a larger share of British sales as royalties to subsidiaries outside Britain than rivals such as McDonald’s. Margaret Hodge, head of the committee, said that showed that the tax office’s procedures were lacking. “Either the skills of your individuals aren’t good enough or you’re not getting underneath it,” she told Homer. The lawmakers also challenged Homer’s assertion that existing rules designed to stop companies shifting profits out of the countries where they originate worked well. Hodge cited other companies including Google and Apple which have racked up billions of pounds in UK sales but paid almost no tax in the country. By channeling sales through low tax countries such as Ireland, Google managed to reduce the tax rate on $7.6 billion of non-U.S. profits to just 3.2 percent last year.

240,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Green Mountain unveils Keurig Rivo cappuccino maker,"* Keurig Rivo to sell at select Bloomingdales stores * Machine uses fresh milk; Starbucks’ Vue uses pods * Green Mountain shares up more than 2 percent By Martinne Geller Nov 8 (Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc  announced the launch of Keurig Rivo, its long-awaited, single-cup espresso machine, on Thursday, sending its shares up more than 2 percent. The Rivo, developed in partnership with Italy’s Luigi Lavazza SpA, will be able to make cappuccinos and lattes at home and go head-to-head with the Verismo system, which Starbucks Corp launched last month. The Rivo will have a suggested retail price of $229.99 and will be available exclusively at select Bloomingdales stores starting in mid-November, becoming more widely available by the spring. The Rivo uses fresh milk for its barista-worthy drinks, whereas the Verismo uses milk pods. The basic Verismo sells for $199, while a larger version, with temperature controls and self-cleaning is priced at $399. Starbucks is also selling a separate machine that heats and froths milk or dairy alternatives such as soy milk for about $60. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bill Chappell said milk appeared to be the biggest difference. “From what we have learned about the Verismo, the use of milk pods versus fresh milk seems to be its biggest drawback,” Chappell said. Green Mountain has been facing increased competition since certain patents governing the design of its K-Cups expired, leading to the emergence of a host of lower-cost competitors, including private-label brands that are producing Keurig-compatible cups without a licensing agreement with Green Mountain. Green Mountain shares were up 60 cents, or 2.4 percent, at $25.34 in morning trading.",11082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/greenmountain-machine/update-1-green-mountain-unveils-keurig-rivo-cappuccino-maker-idUSL3E8M85FL20121108
241,SBUX,"UK lawmakers slam Starbucks, Amazon and Google on tax","LONDON (Reuters) - UK lawmakers criticized executives of Starbucks, Google and Amazon on Monday for not paying more tax in Britain, and Amazon said it had received a $252 million demand for back taxes from France. Britain’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which is charged with monitoring government financial affairs, invited the companies to give evidence amid mounting public and political concern about tax avoidance by big international companies. Britain and Germany last week announced plans to push the Group of 20 economic powers to make multinational companies pay their “fair share” of taxes following reports of large firms exploiting loopholes to avoid taxes. Amazon received a $252 million back tax claim from the French tax authority in September, related to its practice of channeling European sales through Luxembourg. The company said it was fighting the claim, referred to by an Amazon official at the hearing. Members of Parliament (MPs) on the committee quizzed Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead about how the group’s UK unit managed to report 13 years of losses. “You’re either running the business badly, or there’s some fiddle going on,” Austin Mitchell MP said. A Reuters report last month showed that Starbucks had paid no corporation, or income, tax in Britain in the past three years and had paid only 8.6 million pounds since 1998. Over this period it sold 3.1 billion pounds worth of coffee, prompting criticism from politicians and media commentators. Alstead denied Starbucks was shifting profits out of Britain and blamed high rents for contributing to the company’s troubled record in the UK. He said the UK business only made a profit in Britain once, in 2006, despite his having told analysts on a conference call in 2009 that the UK unit was profitable and his predecessor listing the British operation in 2008, when asked about the foreign markets with the best margins. Alstead also told the committee the company had an agreement with the Dutch authorities that allowed it pay a “very low tax rate” on its operation there. Starbucks UK has an agreement to remit 6 percent of its turnover to the Dutch unit - its regional headquarters - in respect to the use of the Starbucks brand. Alstead also told the committee that Starbucks’s Swiss coffee trading unit charged group companies a 20 percent mark-up on coffee beans. A company spokeswoman said the Lausanne-based unit bought 428 million pounds of coffee beans for an average $2.38 per pound in 2011, suggesting a total coffee bill of over $1 billion and income of more than $200 million for the Swiss unit, which employs 30 people. Switzerland charges effective tax rates as low as 5 percent for trading in commodities such as coffee, tax lawyers say. The spokeswoman said the Swiss unit used some of its income to fund farmer support centers and cooperatives in coffee-growing countries to ensure coffee is sourced ethically, although she would not say how much was spent on this. Alstead denied the world’s largest coffee chain channeled profits through tax havens and said it followed the law in every country where it operated. Members of the committee repeatedly criticized Andrew Cecil, Brussels-based Director of Public Policy for internet retailer Amazon, for failing to answer questions about the group’s operations. Cecil declined several times to tell the committee the level of Amazon’s sales in the UK. “We have not disclosed those figures ever publicly,” he said. However, Amazon’s annual reports do disclose this figure. The most recent regulatory filing gave UK revenues as 11-15 percent of total sales in 2011, an amount equal to $5.3 to $7.2 billion. Amazon did not respond to emails or calls asking for explanations about the discrepancy. “It’s just not acceptable .. It’s outrageous,” the committee’s chairman, Margaret Hodge MP, said of Cecil’s inability to answer questions about Amazon’s UK sales and corporate structure. Amazon’s main UK unit paid less than 1 million pounds in income tax last year. Amazon avoids UK taxes by reporting European sales through a Luxembourg-based unit. This structure allowed it to pay a tax rate of 11 percent on foreign profits last year - less than half the average corporate income tax rate in its major markets. Matt Brittin, Google Vice President for Sales and Operations, Northern and Central Europe, acknowledged the company did cut its tax bill by channeling profits from European sales through Bermuda but said this was perfectly legal. Google’s filings show it had $4 billion of sales in the UK last year, but despite having a group-wide profit margin of 33 percent, its main UK unit reported a loss in 2011 and 2010. It had a tax charge of just 3.4 million pounds in 2011. The search engine provider books European sales via an Irish unit, an arrangement that allowed it to pay taxes at a rate of 3.2 percent on non-U.S. profits last year. Google is under audit by the French tax authority regarding its structure. The company denied a newspaper report last month that it had received a back tax claim for 1 billion euros.

This structure allowed it to pay a tax rate of 11 percent on foreign profits last year - less than half the average corporate income tax rate in its major markets. Google declined to comment. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. Hodge and former financial services minister Paul Myners told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that the government should consider a new revenue-based tax to ensure profits from UK sales didn’t go offshore.

246,SBUX,"Burnished by Starbucks, upstart Square battles payment giants","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two years ago, employees from the start-up Square Inc descended on farmers markets in San Francisco to hand out a new type of credit-card reader that let small, independent merchants accept plastic via their smartphones or tablets. But this month, when Starbucks Inc and Square announced that 7,000 coffee shops across the country would begin accepting payment through Square’s smartphone app, the small white cubes that were Square’s original calling card didn’t merit a mention. The subtle shift in Square’s business focus, from card readers to nifty software, comes as one of Silicon Valley’s most highly-touted startups encounters the brutal realities of the arcane but lucrative electronic payments business. Now on track to process $10 billion in payments a year, Square has attracted a furious response from established or deep-pocketed rivals who are determined to crush the San Francisco-based upstart. In recent months, eBay Inc’s PayPal and Intuit have both released their own card readers, while retail giants including Wal-Mart and Target have announced a joint venture to develop their own mobile payment offering. Visa Inc and AT&T; also boast of their own projects as does Google Inc, which continues to put muscle behind its Google Wallet product. Square must now show that it can compete not just for food trucks and taxi drivers, but for large brick-and-mortar businesses and chain stores too. “Our path is to have every single business in the U.S. use Square,” said Keith Rabois, chief operating officer and a former PayPal executive who heads Square’s day-to-day operations. “It won’t happen tomorrow, but it will happen.” The bold talk belies the many hurdles facing the company, which is valued at $3.5 billion by private investors. Square makes money by taking a 2.75 percent cut for every transaction it processes. But more than half of that is immediately paid out to other companies, including the card’s issuing bank, card networks like Visa, and also JP Morgan Chase Paymentech, which manages funds on Square’s behalf. With no cost advantage on the basic payment services, Square is marketing itself to merchants primarily as a software provider that can replace the bewildering array of intermediaries in credit card networks. Its Square Register app lets merchants take cards on an iPad, and also allows them to design customizable menus and loyalty programs that can be pushed out to customers’ phones. Meanwhile, Square is hoping that as more and more shoppers download its consumer-facing Square Wallet app, they will begin using it not only as their main means of paying for goods, but also as a tool for finding nearby businesses and special deals, and eventually eliminating physical credit cards altogether. In the case of the Starbucks tie-up, tellingly, Square actually does not play a part in the behind-the-scenes payment processing itself. Rather, it lets users order and pay for drinks on their smartphone before they arrive at the store with the payments themselves running through Starbucks’ existing system. For Square, the Starbucks partnership was about encouraging consumers to download its app. With five locations in Washington, D.C., Noah Dan, the owner of Pitango Gelato, is the type of convert that has helped drive Square’s growth. Square’s flat 2.75 percent rate was slightly better than his existing credit-card payment deal, which came with monthly costs and a dizzying, tiered fee-structure, Dan said. Mostly, though, Dan was swayed by Square’s free software and the easily generated spreadsheets that tracked how many creamy gianduja gelatos or fresh pomegranate sorbets he sold. This March, Dan threw out his old card readers, purchased a stack of iPads, and began using Square as his check-out register at all five branches. “I was always thinking, ‘We have so much efficiency in business but why does point-of-sale have to be so painfully stupid?” Dan said. “Square was like answering a quick prayer.” But going after bigger businesses presents a different set of challenges. Large retailers can negotiate their own credit card processing fees, and pay much less than 2.75 percent. Plus, they already have sophisticated sales-tracking software and loyalty programs. Rabois disputed that Square could not be competitive for large retailers as it expands. “I don’t think our rates are actually higher; our rates are more transparent,” he said. Because Square acts like an aggregator for its thousands of merchants, Rabois added, Square will be able to negotiate better rates with banks and credit card companies and improve its margins. Square’s daily transaction volume already makes it the equivalent of the 20th largest retailer in the United States, larger than, say, Trader Joe’s or the Gap. Perhaps its biggest rival is PayPal, which released its “PayPal Here” card reader in March. PayPal likes to advertise its per-transaction fee, which is 0.05 percent lower than Square’s, and says it already accepts payments at more than 7,000 physical locations in the United States, including Jamba Juice and Abercrombie & Fitch stores. PayPal, which came of age 10 years ago when it established itself as a popular method of paying online, is already hooked to bank accounts for its 117 million active users, said Hill Ferguson, a PayPal vice president. Now, PayPal simply needs to prod those users to use PayPal at physical store locations as well, he said. “We have a really good headstart,” Ferguson said. “Paypal essentially created this category.” In recent weeks, payments industry analysts have also been buzzing about Merchant Customer Exchange, a consortium of major retailers, led by Wal-Mart and Target, that was formed in August to develop mobile payment solutions. As competition heats up, industry experts wonder how Square, which has yet to hire a substantial sales force, will make its pitch to millions of small and medium-sized businesses. “Small business owners are tough to reach because they’re working in their stores all day, every day,” said Logan LaHive, the founder of Belly, a digital loyalty card service that has been flooding the streets of U.S. cities with sales people. Under CEO Jack Dorsey, who gained fame as the inventor of Twitter, Square has adhered religiously to a design-first philosophy that prizes simplicity and aesthetics. The powerful undercurrent runs even to office decor: At the entrance to the company’s office, a security guard and a receptionist work on plastic white Macbook laptops, a discontinued model that nevertheless matches the office’s monochromatic color scheme. For small business owners, at least, the slickness of Square’s software design has proved to be alluring. In Houston, Matt Jeffryes, who started Crescent Moon Coffee with his mother, said salesmen from other card processors have pitched him with better rates after he converted to Square, and he has also seriously considered switching to PayPal Here. But he stuck with Square because he found its software interface to be useful and intuitive, and his customers paid him occasional compliments on the payment method. “If you look purely at the cost factor, they weren’t very competitive,” Jeffryes said. “But having that whole package was more important than saving a fraction of a cent in a transaction.” That allowed his mother to focus on what she was best at, Jeffryes said: “Making a great cup of coffee.” ",11132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-square-payments/burnished-by-starbucks-upstart-square-battles-payment-giants-idUSBRE8AC06L20121113

By Lisa Baertlein and Martinne Geller Nov 14 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Wednesday announced plans to buy Teavana Holdings Inc for $620 million in cash, with the goal of replicating the success it has had with its namesake coffee shops. Teavana has about 300 shopping mall stores that sell loose-leaf, exotic teas. In addition to opening stand-alone Teavana stores in the United States and abroad, Starbucks will add tea bars that serve prepared drinks in existing Teavana stores, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters. Starbucks opened its first coffee bar inside a store in 1987, when it had 11 stores selling only whole bean coffee. “We will do something very similar over time with Teavana,” said Schultz, who now oversees about 18,000 Starbucks stores around the world. “We will do for tea what we did for coffee.” The world’s largest coffee shop operator said it will pay $15.50 per share in cash for Teavana, a 54 percent premium to the company’s closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Shares of Atlanta-based Teavana jumped 52.5 percent to close at $15.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. This is not the first tea venture for Starbucks, which also has made a handful of complementary acquisitions this year. Starbucks bought Tazo tea for $8.1 million in 1999. That business now brings in more than $1 billion in annual sales of products such as tea bags and bottled tea drinks through its own shops and the grocery aisles of many retailers. On Friday, Starbucks will open its first Tazo tea store in Seattle. That store will act as a “laboratory” for Teavana, Schultz said. “The two brands will co-exist,” Schultz said of Tazo and Teavana. He said Starbucks will develop a line of Teavana branded packaged goods, but declined to say how he would position each brand. Schultz said the acquisition takes advantage of Starbucks’ existing strengths and assets. “There’s no incremental expense other than building new stores and new tea bars,” he said. The Teavana deal comes on the heels of the company’s acquisitions of juice company Evolution Fresh and sandwich maker La Boulange Bakery. Starbucks bought Evolution Fresh for $30 million in November 2011, and announced a deal for the bakery in June. “It’s a natural fit with Starbucks’ evolving brand portfolio,” Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy said. News of the Teavana deal was first reported by the Atlanta Business Chronicle. Teavana investors holding about 70 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock have approved the merger agreement, Starbucks and Teavana said in a statement. Starbucks said it expects the deal to close by the end of the year and to add 1 cent per share in earnings in fiscal 2013. Starbucks shares fell 2.9 percent to $48.84 on Nasdaq.

In recent months, eBay Inc’s PayPal and Intuit have both released their own card readers, while retail giants including Wal-Mart and Target have announced a joint venture to develop their own mobile payment offering. Visa Inc and AT&T; also boast of their own projects as does Google Inc, which continues to put muscle behind its Google Wallet product. Square must now show that it can compete not just for food trucks and taxi drivers, but for large brick-and-mortar businesses and chain stores too. “Our path is to have every single business in the U.S. use Square,” said Keith Rabois, chief operating officer and a former PayPal executive who heads Square’s day-to-day operations. “It won’t happen tomorrow, but it will happen.” The bold talk belies the many hurdles facing the company, which is valued at $3.5 billion by private investors. Square makes money by taking a 2.75 percent cut for every transaction it processes. But more than half of that is immediately paid out to other companies, including the card’s issuing bank, card networks like Visa, and also JP Morgan Chase Paymentech, which manages funds on Square’s behalf. With no cost advantage on the basic payment services, Square is marketing itself to merchants primarily as a software provider that can replace the bewildering array of intermediaries in credit card networks. Its Square Register app lets merchants take cards on an iPad, and also allows them to design customizable menus and loyalty programs that can be pushed out to customers’ phones. Meanwhile, Square is hoping that as more and more shoppers download its consumer-facing Square Wallet app, they will begin using it not only as their main means of paying for goods, but also as a tool for finding nearby businesses and special deals, and eventually eliminating physical credit cards altogether. In the case of the Starbucks tie-up, tellingly, Square is registered as the “agent of record” that processes Starbucks’ credit and debit card transactions, but the nuts-and-bolts of fetching and depositing money in every sale is actually handled by its partner, Chase Paymentech. For Square, the Starbucks partnership was about encouraging consumers to download its app, which lets users order and pay for drinks on their smartphone. With five locations in Washington, D.C., Noah Dan, the owner of Pitango Gelato, is the type of convert that has helped drive Square’s growth. Square’s flat 2.75 percent rate was slightly better than his existing credit-card payment deal, which came with monthly costs and a dizzying, tiered fee-structure, Dan said. Mostly, though, Dan was swayed by Square’s free software and the easily generated spreadsheets that tracked how many creamy gianduja gelatos or fresh pomegranate sorbets he sold. This March, Dan threw out his old card readers, purchased a stack of iPads, and began using Square as his check-out register at all five branches. “I was always thinking, ‘We have so much efficiency in business but why does point-of-sale have to be so painfully stupid?” Dan said. “Square was like answering a quick prayer.” But going after bigger businesses presents a different set of challenges. Large retailers can negotiate their own credit card processing fees, and pay much less than 2.75 percent. Plus, they already have sophisticated sales-tracking software and loyalty programs. Rabois disputed that Square could not be competitive for large retailers as it expands. “I don’t think our rates are actually higher; our rates are more transparent,” he said. Because Square acts like an aggregator for its thousands of merchants, Rabois added, Square will be able to negotiate better rates with banks and credit card companies and improve its margins. Square’s daily transaction volume already makes it the equivalent of the 20th largest retailer in the United States, larger than, say, Trader Joe’s or the Gap. Perhaps its biggest rival is PayPal, which released its “PayPal Here” card reader in March. PayPal likes to advertise its per-transaction fee, which is 0.05 percent lower than Square’s, and says it already accepts payments at more than 7,000 physical locations in the United States, including Jamba Juice and Abercrombie & Fitch stores. PayPal, which came of age 10 years ago when it established itself as a popular method of paying online, is already hooked to bank accounts for its 117 million active users, said Hill Ferguson, a PayPal vice president. Now, PayPal simply needs to prod those users to use PayPal at physical store locations as well, he said. “We have a really good head start,” Ferguson said. “Paypal essentially created this category.” In recent weeks, payments industry analysts have also been buzzing about Merchant Customer Exchange, a consortium of major retailers, led by Wal-Mart and Target, that was formed in August to develop mobile payment solutions. As competition heats up, industry experts wonder how Square, which has yet to hire a substantial sales force, will make its pitch to millions of small and medium-sized businesses. “Small business owners are tough to reach because they’re working in their stores all day, every day,” said Logan LaHive, the founder of Belly, a digital loyalty card service that has been flooding the streets of U.S. cities with sales people. Under CEO Jack Dorsey, who gained fame as the inventor of Twitter, Square has adhered religiously to a design-first philosophy that prizes simplicity and aesthetics. The powerful undercurrent runs even to office decor: At the entrance to the company’s office, a security guard and a receptionist work on plastic white Macbook laptops, a discontinued model that nevertheless matches the office’s monochromatic color scheme. For small business owners, at least, the slickness of Square’s software design has proved to be alluring. In Houston, Matt Jeffryes, who started Crescent Moon Coffee with his mother, said salesmen from other card processors have pitched him with better rates after he converted to Square, and he has also seriously considered switching to PayPal Here. But he stuck with Square because he found its software interface to be useful and intuitive, and his customers paid him occasional compliments on the payment method. “If you look purely at the cost factor, they weren’t very competitive,” Jeffryes said. “But having that whole package was more important than saving a fraction of a cent in a transaction.” That allowed his mother to focus on what she was best at, Jeffryes said: “Making a great cup of coffee.” (The story corrects role of Square, Paymentech in Starbucks’ payment processing in 11th paragraph) ",11142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-square-payments/burnished-by-starbucks-upstart-square-battles-payment-giants-idUSBRE8AC06L20121114

256,SBUX,"Starbucks buying Teavana, eyes repeat of coffee success","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Wednesday it plans to buy tea store chain Teavana Holdings Inc TEA.N for $620 million, aiming to replicate the success it has had with its namesake coffee shops. Teavana has about 300 shopping mall stores that sell loose-leaf, exotic teas. In addition to opening stand-alone Teavana stores in the United States and abroad, Starbucks will add tea bars that serve prepared drinks in existing Teavana stores, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters. Starbucks opened its first espresso bar inside a store in 1987, when it had 11 stores selling only whole bean coffee. “We will do something very similar over time with Teavana,” said Schultz, who now oversees about 18,000 Starbucks stores around the world. “We will do for tea what we did for coffee.” The deal marks the third complementary acquisition over the past year from Starbucks, which is looking for new avenues of growth beyond its core coffee business. On a conference call, Schultz called tea “the opportunity of a lifetime”. Teavana Chief Executive Andy Mack is forecasting 500 total Teavana stores by 2015. The world’s largest coffee shop operator will pay $15.50 per share in cash for Teavana, a 54 percent premium to the company’s closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Shares of Atlanta-based Teavana, which has stores in the United States, Mexico, Canada and Kuwait, jumped 52.5 percent to close at $15.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. “This could be one of the smartest acquisitions that Starbucks has done yet,” said William Blair & Co analyst Sharon Zackfia, who covers both Starbucks and Teavana. “The valuation was great for this kind of fast-growing retailer,” she said, adding that the unit economics at Teavana are “exceptional” and proven across every geography in the United States. “That’s rare for an early-stage retailer” and signals that Teavana is addressing unmet demand, she said. This is not Starbucks’ first venture into the $40 billion-plus global tea market. Starbucks bought Tazo tea for $8.1 million in 1999. That business now brings in more than $1 billion in annual sales of products such as tea bags and bottled tea drinks through its own shops and the grocery aisles of many retailers. On Friday, Starbucks will open its first Tazo tea store in Seattle. That store will act as a “laboratory” for Teavana, Schultz said. “The two brands will co-exist,” Schultz said, who added that Starbucks will develop a line of “super premium” Teavana branded products for retail sale. The acquisition will take advantage of Starbucks’ existing infrastructure and skills, Schultz said. “There’s no incremental expense other than building new stores and new tea bars,” said Schultz. The Teavana deal comes on the heels of the company’s acquisitions of juice company Evolution Fresh and La Boulange Bakery. Starbucks bought Evolution Fresh for $30 million in November 2011. It announced the $100 million deal for the bakery in June. Teavana “is a natural fit with Starbucks’ evolving brand portfolio,” Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy said. News of the Teavana deal was first reported by the Atlanta Business Chronicle. Teavana investors holding about 70 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock have approved the merger agreement, Starbucks and Teavana said in a statement. Starbucks said it expects the deal to close by the end of the year and to add 1 cent per share in earnings in fiscal 2013. Shares of Starbucks fell 2.9 percent to $48.84 on Nasdaq.

On a conference call, Schultz called tea “the opportunity of a lifetime”. Teavana Chief Executive Andy Mack is forecasting 500 total Teavana stores by 2015. The world’s largest coffee shop operator will pay $15.50 per share in cash for Teavana, a 54 percent premium to the company’s closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Shares of Atlanta-based Teavana, which has stores in the United States, Mexico, Canada and Kuwait, jumped 52.5 percent to close at $15.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. “This could be one of the smartest acquisitions that Starbucks has done yet,” said William Blair & Co analyst Sharon Zackfia, who covers both Starbucks and Teavana. “The valuation was great for this kind of fast-growing retailer,” she said, adding that the unit economics at Teavana are “exceptional” and proven across every geography in the United States. “That’s rare for an early-stage retailer” and signals that Teavana is addressing unmet demand, she said. This is not Starbucks’ first venture into the $40 billion-plus global tea market. Starbucks bought Tazo tea for $8.1 million in 1999. That business now brings in more than $1 billion in annual sales of products such as tea bags and bottled tea drinks through its own shops and the grocery aisles of many retailers. On Friday, Starbucks will open its first Tazo tea store in Seattle. That store will act as a “laboratory” for Teavana, Schultz said. “The two brands will co-exist,” Schultz said, who added that Starbucks will develop a line of “super premium” Teavana branded products for retail sale. The acquisition will take advantage of Starbucks’ existing infrastructure and skills, Schultz said. “There’s no incremental expense other than building new stores and new tea bars,” said Schultz. The Teavana deal comes on the heels of the company’s acquisitions of juice company Evolution Fresh and La Boulange Bakery. Starbucks bought Evolution Fresh for $30 million in November 2011. It announced the $100 million deal for the bakery in June. Teavana “is a natural fit with Starbucks’ evolving brand portfolio,” Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy said. News of the Teavana deal was first reported by the Atlanta Business Chronicle. Teavana investors holding about 70 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock have approved the merger agreement, Starbucks and Teavana said in a statement. Starbucks said it expects the deal to close by the end of the year and to add 1 cent per share in earnings in fiscal 2013. Shares of Starbucks fell 2.9 percent to $48.84 on Nasdaq.

258,SBUX,"Teavana says teas meet guidelines, rejects research report","Nov 20 (Reuters) - Teavana Holdings Inc, which is set to be acquired by Starbucks Corp, issued a statement on Tuesday rebutting a research report from a short seller that said its teas have pesticides in amounts that exceed regulatory limits. The report, issued on Tuesday by investment firm Glaucus Research Group California LLC, said Glaucus had Teavana teas independently tested and that they contained pesticides that exceeded United States and European Union regulatory limits. Teavana shares fell 76 cents, or 5 percent, to $14.67 on the New York Stock Exchange. Starbucks shares were up 0.3 percent at $49.91 on the Nasdaq. Teavana, which sells loose-leaf teas and tea-related merchandise, said its teas undergo rigorous testing based on international food safety standards. It pointed out that Glaucus was a short-seller that may benefit from the allegations made in its report. Glaucus made no secret of its bias. “We are biased ... obviously we will make money if the price of Teavana stock declines,” the company said in its report. “Just because we are biased does not mean we are wrong.” Glaucus said it thought lawsuits would be forthcoming and Starbucks would eventually abandon its agreement to acquire what it called a “tarnished consumer brand”. Starbucks spokeswoman Lisa Passe said the company was acting in accordance with its merger agreement. “We will assess developments that occur as warranted but beyond that I am not going to speculate,” Passe said.",11202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/teavana-report/teavana-says-teas-meet-guidelines-rejects-research-report-idUSL1E8MK8JA20121120

A Reuters examination of Starbucks accounts published in October showed the company had reported 13 years of losses at its UK unit, even as it told investors the operation was profitable and among the best performing of its overseas markets. The chain’s UK unit paid no corporation tax - a tax on a company’s income - in the last three years for which figures are available and has only paid 8.6 million pounds income tax since 1998, despite racking up 3 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) of sales. The revelations led to calls for a boycott of the store and protests at its branches, and the company’s Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead was called to give evidence to a parliamentary committee. Starbucks repeated on Sunday that it had always complied with British tax laws and blamed its low tax payments on a tough operating environment in the UK. However, a spokeswoman added in an emailed statement that the public mood had caused the company to reconsider its tax arrangements, which include intercompany royalty and interest payments that reduce the UK unit’s taxable profit. “We have listened to feedback from our customers and employees, and understand that to maintain and further build public trust we need to do more,” she said. “As part of this we are looking at our tax approach in the UK.

262,SBUX,Starbucks CEO says in talks on UK tax payment,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz on Wednesday said the coffee chain is in talks about paying income taxes in the UK, despite the fact the company has not made a profit in that market for many years. “We are engaged in discussions to make a contribution - despite the fact that we have not made a profit - that would legally put us in a position to pay income taxes,” Schultz said in an interview with Reuters. The Independent newspaper on Wednesday reported that Starbucks is close to a deal with HM Revenue & Customs that could see it pay between 5 million and 6 million pounds ($8.05 to $9.66 million) in corporate tax this year. Starbucks repeatedly has said that it has been in compliance with UK tax laws. “We’ve always played by the rules. This is not about the rules. This is about what is the right thing to try and do given the circumstances within Europe,” Schultz told Reuters after the company investor meeting in New York City. Starbucks is expected to make an announcement on the agreement on Thursday. A Reuters examination of Starbucks accounts published in October showed the company had reported 13 years of losses at its UK unit, even as it told investors the operation was profitable and among the best performing of its overseas markets. The chain’s UK unit paid no corporation tax - a tax on a company’s income - in the last three years for which figures are available and has only paid 8.6 million pounds income tax since 1998, despite racking up 3 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) of sales. The revelations led to calls for a boycott of the store and protests at its branches. With governments across Europe running big budget deficits due to the financial crisis and global economic slowdown, tax avoidance has moved to the top of the political agenda. Tax campaigners and groups opposed to austerity measures have pushed the UK government to lean more heavily on big businesses to close the budget gap. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead recently gave evidence to a parliamentary committee on the issue and was joined by representatives from Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which also pay little in taxes in Britain despite reaping substantial sales.

264,SBUX,"Starbucks back on expansion path in Americas, China","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp plans to increase the number of its cafes in the Americas by more than 20 percent by opening more than 3,000 new shops there in the next five years as it looks to rely on tea and juice as much as coffee, it said on Wednesday. The world’s largest coffee chain is also finished with acquisitions for the time being, after buying juice seller Evolution Fresh for $30 million and Bay Bread LLC’s La Boulange Bakery for $100 million over the last 13 months. Starbucks also has an agreement to purchase tea store chain Teavana Holdings Inc for $620 million. “We’re pretty full up at this time in terms of our resources and capabilities,” Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said at Starbucks’ investor conference in New York on Wednesday. “At this moment in time, we have enough to handle.” Food long has been a weak link at Starbucks, which plans to roll out sweet and savory La Boulange pastries and other goodies at 2,500 of its company-operated U.S. shops by the end of next year. Starbucks also expects to have Evolution Fresh juices in more than 5,000 U.S. stores by the end of 2013. The company is also expanding and experimenting with new retail concepts. It has opened four Evolution Fresh juice stores and one Tazo tea shop in the United States, and it plans to add “tea bars” to existing Teavana stores. The goal at Teavana is to replicate the success the company had adding coffee drinks at its early Starbucks stores, which sold whole bean coffee. “There is always a risk when you take on all these brands,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said, but she added that Starbucks had mitigated that risk by making deals that fit with its long-term growth plans, which focus on increasing its reach beyond coffee and the four walls of its cafes. Schultz admitted that Starbucks’ growth in 2007 and 2008 - the years before its business plunged with the financial crisis - was “undisciplined.” The company is not returning to that prior strategy of “growth for growth’s sake,” he said. Starbucks’ consumer packaged goods business, which sells such items as whole bean coffee and bottled drinks through grocery stores and other retailers, could one day be as large as the cafe chain, Schultz said. Investment Technology Group analyst Steve West said he was encouraged that the company is building a “tiered strategy” for those packaged goods. Based on the company’s moves thus far, it appears that Starbucks coffee and Teavana teas are in the core/premium categories, while Seattle’s Best Coffee and potentially Tazo tea are more mainstream brands. When Starbucks’ fiscal year ended on September 30, the company had 18,066 shops around the world, with just over 12,900 in the Americas. The United States dominates that region and will get more than half of the 3,000 planned new stores that the company announced on Wednesday. Starbucks expects China to overtake Canada as its second-largest market in 2014. The fast-growing China and Asia-Pacific region will have nearly 4,000 cafes by the end of 2013, including 1,000 in mainland China, where Starbucks said it was on track to have 1,500 cafes in 70 cities in 2015. John Culver, president of Starbucks’ China/Asia Pacific business, said sales at established stores in the region held up in October and November, following a 10 percent increase in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended September 30. “We have seen the momentum we had in the fourth quarter carry over,” Culver said. Investors are closely tracking Starbucks’ new at-home Verismo coffee and espresso brewer, which the company is using to grab a piece of the fast-growing single-serve market dominated by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc and Nestle SA. The machine sells for $199 or $399 depending on size and functions. Over time, Starbucks expects to get significant revenues from sales of the coffee and milk pods used with Verismo. Early reviews on Verismo have been mixed - with the main complaint being the unappealing taste of the milk from the shelf-stable milk pods that have been held up as selling point for Starbucks’ machine. Jeff Hansberry, Starbucks’ president of channel development and emerging brands, said Verismo sales are “in line with our expectations” but he did not answer an analyst’s question about the machine’s strengths and weaknesses. Separately, Starbucks has said it would announce changes to its UK tax policies this week, following criticism from lawmakers and the media over strategies that let it minimize payments.

The company could also announce changes to its UK tax policies, after criticism from lawmakers and the media over strategies that let it minimize payments. Seattle-based Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain, aims to expand its reach beyond coffee and the four walls of its own cafes. Its purchases of Evolution Fresh, for $30 million in November 2011, and Bay Bread LLC’s La Boulange Bakery, for $100 million in July, are part of that plan. Analysts expect executives to lay out their strategy for expanding sales of Evolution Fresh bottled juices via Starbucks cafes and other retailers.

Food has long been a weak link at Starbucks, which previously said it would have La Boulange products in 2,500 of its company-operated U.S. shops beginning this spring.

272,SBUX,Starbucks bows to pressure on UK tax,"LONDON (Reuters) - Coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O) said it could pay about 20 million pounds in corporation tax in Britain over the next two years, surrendering to widespread public criticism over allegations of tax avoidance. “We are making a commitment that we will propose to pay a significant amount of corporation tax during 2013 and 2014 regardless of whether our company is profitable during these years,” Starbucks UK managing director Kris Engskov said in a speech. The announcement follows weeks of public attacks in the media and parliament after a Reuters report in October which said that over the past three years Starbucks has paid no corporation tax in Britain despite telling investors that the local business was highly profitable, while reporting an actual loss. One of the tax-deductible costs weighing on Starbucks’ British business has been the royalties paid to an Amsterdam-based Starbucks company for the use of intellectual property, such as the brand. “In 2013 and 2014 Starbucks will not claim tax deductions for royalties or payments related to our inter-company charges,” he told an audience at the London Chamber of Commerce. In doing so, Starbucks would contribute about 10 million pounds in tax each year, he said, meaning that the company would pay more than is required under British tax law. Engskov said again on Thursday that the group has always acted according to the letter of the law, saying that the company, which opened for business in Britain in 1998, was not hiding big profits from the tax authorities. He said Starbucks served 2 million British customers a week but it had not seen the same success in terms of generating profits due to the high rents it paid to secure the best locations and the costs of its rapid expansion. Recent store openings had put the company on track for sustained profitability, he said, but its customers expected it to do more on tax sooner. He said he had not yet discussed the proposal with the tax authorities. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said corporation tax was not a voluntary tax and Parliament set out the rules and rates for businesses to follow. “The public expects businesses to pay their fair share and HMRC will challenge, through the courts if necessary, any structures or tax payments that do not comply with the UK tax law,” a spokesman said. The coffee chain’s units in Germany and France also fail to report profits due to inter-company royalty payments, the Reuters investigation of the company’s accounts showed last month. Engskov told Reuters there was no plan to extend the proposal on tax payments in Britain to other markets where Starbucks operates. The UK Uncut activist group, which has been protesting against companies and wealthy individuals which are accused of avoiding paying taxes which they say would obviate the government spending cuts, said it would continue to target Starbucks, and is planning protests at 40 stores across the country this weekend. “Offering to pay some tax if and when it suits you doesn’t stop you being a tax dodger,” spokeswoman Hannah Pearce said. “Today’s announcement is just a desperate attempt to deflect public pressure.” Earlier this week Starbucks along with Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google (GOOG.O) were accused by British lawmakers of being ‘immoral’ in seeking to avoid paying taxes.

273,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Starbucks bows to pressure on UK tax,"* Coffee chain to pay about 10 mln stg in tax in 2013, 2014 * Climbdown follows customer pressure By Christine Murray LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Coffee chain Starbucks  said it could pay about 20 million pounds in corporation tax in Britain over the next two years, surrendering to widespread public criticism over allegations of tax avoidance. “We are making a commitment that we will propose to pay a significant amount of corporation tax during 2013 and 2014 regardless of whether our company is profitable during these years,” Starbucks UK managing director Kris Engskov said in a speech. The announcement follows weeks of public attacks in the media and parliament after a Reuters report in October which said that over the past three years Starbucks has paid no corporation tax in Britain despite telling investors that the local business was highly profitable, while reporting an actual loss. One of the tax-deductible costs weighing on Starbucks’ British business has been the royalties paid to an Amsterdam-based Starbucks company for the use of intellectual property, such as the brand. “In 2013 and 2014 Starbucks will not claim tax deductions for royalties or payments related to our inter-company charges,” he told an audience at the London Chamber of Commerce. In doing so, Starbucks would contribute about 10 million pounds in tax each year, he said, meaning that the company would pay more than is required under British tax law. Engskov said again on Thursday that the group has always acted according to the letter of the law, saying that the company, which opened for business in Britain in 1998, was not hiding big profits from the tax authorities. He said Starbucks served 2 million British customers a week  but it had not seen the same success in terms of generating profits due to the high rents it paid to secure the best locations and the costs of its rapid expansion. Recent store openings had put the company on track for sustained profitability, he said, but its customers expected it to do more on tax sooner. He said he had not yet discussed the proposal with the tax authorities. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said corporation tax was not a voluntary tax and Parliament set out the rules and rates for businesses to follow. “The public expects businesses to pay their fair share and HMRC will challenge, through the courts if necessary, any structures or tax payments that do not comply with the UK tax law,” a spokesman said. The coffee chain’s units in Germany and France also fail to report profits due to inter-company royalty payments, the Reuters investigation of the company’s accounts showed last month. Engskov told Reuters there was no plan to extend the proposal on tax payments in Britain to other markets where Starbucks operates. The UK Uncut activist group, which has been protesting against companies and wealthy individuals which are accused of avoiding paying taxes which they say would obviate the government spending cuts, said it would continue to target Starbucks, and is planning protests at 40 stores across the country this weekend. “Offering to pay some tax if and when it suits you doesn’t stop you being a tax dodger,” spokeswoman Hannah Pearce said. “Today’s announcement is just a desperate attempt to deflect public pressure.” Earlier this week Starbucks along with Amazon and Google were accused by British lawmakers of being ‘immoral’ in seeking to avoid paying taxes.",12062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks/update-1-starbucks-bows-to-pressure-on-uk-tax-idUSL5E8N6EN420121206
274,SBUX,Europe needs joint effort to tackle tax avoidance - EU,"* EU Commission presents tax avoidance action plan * Reuters investigations show how Starbucks, Amazon saved tax * EU reserves particular criticism for Switzerland By John O’Donnell BRUSSELS, Dec 6 (Reuters) - European governments should coordinate their efforts to root out tax avoidance costing them around 1 trillion euros ($1.31 trillion) every year, the European Union’s executive body said on Thursday. The European Commission said member states need to share information better, introduce an EU-wide tax identification number and devise common criteria for blacklisting tax havens. The proposals were part of an action plan detailed by EU taxation policy commissioner Algirdas Semeta on Thursday to deal with inventive and increasingly common tactics used by big companies and others to reduce their tax bills. “Tax competition must not open the door to fraudulent or abusive tax practices,” Semeta said. A new framework would result in profits being taxed in the state where the “actual economic activity takes place”. The Commission intends to present its action plan to EU finance ministers next year but is not aiming to persuade member states to pass binding legislation. The impetus to deal with the problem has grown as several European countries try to increase tax revenues and cut spending to rein in heavy debts. A number of high-profile examples have hit headlines in recent months, including one involving coffee chain Starbucks . A recent examination by Reuters of Starbucks’ accounts showed that the company had reported 13 years of losses at its UK unit, even as it told investors the operation was profitable and among the best performing of its overseas markets. The chain’s UK unit paid no corporation tax on its income in the last three years for which figures were available. Starbucks said on Thursday it could pay up to 20 million pounds ($32.18 million) more in tax as it announced plans to change its accounting practices, surrendering to criticism from lawmakers, campaigners and the media. A Reuters examination of Amazon’s accounts showed how the world’s biggest online retailer had minimised corporate taxes by setting up in Luxembourg, and channelling sales through its units there. In effect, Amazon used inter-company payments to form a tax shield for the group, behind which it has accumulated $2 billion to help finance its expansion. Amazon declined to answer questions from Reuters about its tax affairs. BusinessEurope, the lobby group that represents companies, said it supported the Commission’s initiative, but also called for a simplification of the tax system across European Union. Semeta suggested part of the blame lay on tax regimes “artificially designed to steal tax bases or encourage aggressive tax planning”. He rounded on non-EU state Switzerland as one country whose policies encourage aggressive tax avoidance. “I can openly say that we consider that several tax regimes in Switzerland, according to our estimations, do not meet criteria of the code of conduct on business taxation,” he said.",12062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-tax/europe-needs-joint-effort-to-tackle-tax-avoidance-eu-idUSL5E8N67E220121206

278,SBUX,PRESS DIGEST - Financial Times - Dec 6,"Financial Times Headlines Overview Britain’s triple-A credit rating was under threat on Wednesday night after George Osborne conceded one of his key public finance targets would be missed and official forecasts dashed his hopes of fighting the election on the back of a revived economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility on Wednesday took a scythe to its growth forecasts and ruled out all hope of a sharp upturn in the UK’s economic fortunes over the next five years. Five eye-watering austerity budgets in five years have elicited little more than weary resignation from Irish taxpayers forced to live under an international bailout following the bursting of a housing bubble. Deutsche Bank failed to recognise up to $12 billion of paper losses during the financial crisis, helping the bank avoid a government bail-out, three former bank employees have alleged in complaints to US regulators. EADS on Wednesday outlined the biggest shake-up to its corporate governance since the company’s creation in 2000, in changes aimed at providing Berlin with equivalent influence to Paris at the aerospace and defence group. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold has engineered a dramatic re-entry to the oil business with two deals worth a total of about $20 billion, buying Plains Exploration and Production and McMoRan Exploration. Citigroup’s new chief executive has wasted little time putting his stamp on the US bank by axing 11,000 jobs, adding to a wave of staff reductions across the financial services industry. Grain and petrochemicals worth billions of dollars risk being marooned far from market, barge operators and grain exporters have warned, as falling Mississippi water levels threaten to close the river to navigation.

279,SBUX,"Starbucks back on expansion path in Americas, China","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) plans to increase the number of its cafes in the Americas by more than 20 percent by opening more than 3,000 new shops there in the next five years as it looks to rely on tea and juice as much as coffee, it said on Wednesday. The world’s largest coffee chain is also finished with acquisitions for now, after buying juice seller Evolution Fresh for $30 million and Bay Bread LLC’s La Boulange Bakery for $100 million over the last 13 months. Starbucks also plans to close its $620 million purchase of tea store chain Teavana Holdings Inc TEA.N by year-end. The company also announced expansion plans for the China/Asia Pacific region for the next three years. “We’re pretty full up at this time in terms of our resources and capabilities,” Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said at Starbucks’ investor conference in New York on Wednesday. “At this moment in time, we have enough to handle.” Food has long been a weak link at Starbucks, which plans to roll out sweet and savory La Boulange pastries and other goodies at 2,500 of its company-operated U.S. shops by the end of next year. Starbucks also expects to have Evolution Fresh juices in more than 5,000 U.S. stores by then. Evolution Fresh should be slightly accretive in fiscal 2013 and La Boulange will follow in fiscal 2014, Starbucks’ Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said. The company also is experimenting with new retail concepts. It has opened four Evolution Fresh juice stores and one Tazo tea shop in the United States, and it plans to add “tea bars” to existing Teavana stores. The goal at Teavana is to replicate the success the company had adding coffee drinks at its early Starbucks stores, which sold whole bean coffee. “There is always a risk when you take on all these brands,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said, but she added that Starbucks had mitigated that risk by making deals that fit with its long-term growth plans. Schultz admitted that Starbucks’ growth in 2007 and 2008 - the years before its business plunged with the financial crisis - was “undisciplined.” The company is not returning to that prior strategy of “growth for growth’s sake,” he said. Starbucks’ consumer packaged goods business, which sells such items as whole bean coffee and bottled drinks through grocery stores and other retailers, could one day be as large as the cafe chain, Schultz said. Investment Technology Group analyst Steve West said he was encouraged that the company is building a “tiered strategy” for those packaged goods, which will broaden their consumer appeal. Investors are closely tracking Starbucks’ new at-home Verismo coffee and espresso brewer, which the company is using to grab a piece of the fast-growing single-serve market dominated by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O and Nestle SA NESN.VX. Verismo sells for $199 or $399 depending on size and function. It will create a $30 million loss this year but should add to profits in 2015. Starbucks expects to get significant revenue from sales of the coffee and milk pods used with Verismo, which should bolster the packaged goods business. Jeff Hansberry, Starbucks’ president of channel development and emerging brands, said Verismo sales are “in line with our expectations.” When Starbucks’ fiscal year ended on September 30, the company had 18,066 shops around the world, with just over 12,900 in the Americas. The United States dominates that region and will get more than half of the 3,000 planned new stores that the company announced on Wednesday. Starbucks expects China to overtake Canada as its second-largest market in 2014. The fast-growing China/Asia Pacific region will have nearly 4,000 cafes by the end of 2013, including 1,000 in mainland China, where Starbucks said it was on track to have 1,500 cafes in 70 cities in 2015. John Culver, president of Starbucks’ China/Asia Pacific business, said sales at established stores in the region remain robust in October and November, following a 10 percent increase in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended September 30. “We have seen the momentum we had in the fourth quarter carry over,” Culver said. CEO Schultz told Reuters that Starbucks is in talks about paying income taxes in the UK, even though the company has not made a profit in that market for many years. The move following criticism from lawmakers and the media over strategies that let it minimize payments. The company is expected to make a statement about a deal on Thursday. Starbucks shares closed down 0.6 percent at $50.79 on Nasdaq. ",12062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-growth/starbucks-back-on-expansion-path-in-americas-china-idUSBRE8B503020121206

281,SBUX,UK anti-austerity protestors target Starbucks cafes,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators protested at Starbucks (SBUX.O) cafes across Britain on Saturday accusing the U.S. coffee chain of avoiding paying corporation tax at a time when the government was cutting essential services because of a fall in revenues. At one central London outlet activists from the anti-austerity UK Uncut movement staged a sit-in, chanting “Starbucks pay your taxes” and briefly setting up a children’s crèche before police moved them on. Protests were held at more than 40 of the multinational’s cafes, including in Liverpool, Birmingham and Cardiff, UK Uncut said. The demonstrations were held two days after Starbucks said it would pay around 20 million pounds ($32 million) in British corporation tax over the next two years. Its announcement came after weeks of criticism in the media and parliament following a Reuters report which said Starbucks had paid no corporation tax in Britain over the past three years while telling investors the local business was highly profitable. Starbucks’ tax offer was just a “massive PR stunt”, said Rosie Rogers, a 26-year-old UK Uncut activist, outside one of the chain’s London restaurants. “If Starbucks, if all the tax avoiders, paid their fair share, 25 billion pounds could be put back into public services and enrich our economy,” she said. At a nearby Starbucks cafe protesting women lay down in sleeping bags in a symbolic transformation of the outlet into a women’s refuge, a service they say has been hit by state spending cuts. Finance minister George Osborne said on Wednesday his plan to rid Britain of a record deficit would take even longer than expected, extending the shrinking of state spending another year to 2018. Ahead of the protests Starbucks appealed directly to its customers in newspapers adverts reprinting its pledge to pay corporation tax in Britain. “We know we are not perfect. But we have listened ... We hope that over time, through our actions and our contribution, you will give us an opportunity to build on your trust and custom,” UK managing director Kris Engskov said in the adverts.

283,SBUX,Costa hits record sales as Starbucks tax woes rumble on,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Whitbread Plc (WTB.L) has hit record sales at its expanding Costa Coffee business, serving almost 4 million customers in the same week that rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) bowed to public criticism and agreed to pay more tax. “Costa’s been the UK’s favorite coffee shop for quite some time and we remain the taxman’s favorite coffee shop too,” Whitbread Chief Executive Andy Harrison said on Tuesday, as he revealed a 3.3 percent rise in third-quarter group like-for-like sales. Shares in the group, which have gained 50 percent on a year ago, were up 3.8 percent to 2,506 pence by 4:05 a.m. EDT, pushing it to the top of the FTSE 100 .FTSE risers. “Costa’s performance is likely to have received a boost from the negative publicity around Starbucks’ tax affairs, although it has consistently reported this level of like for-like-sales growth over the past 18 months,” analysts at brokerage Panmure wrote. Whitbread, which also runs Premier Inn hotels and the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains, said underlying sales at Costa were up 7.1 percent in the 13 weeks to November 29, up from 6.8 percent in the first half. Sales at the Costa Coffee chain, which has expanded rapidly to over 1,200 UK stores, were boosted by new advertising and by food and Christmas ranges, it said, with sales hitting a record 10 million pounds last week as 3.8 million customers flocked through its doors. It said this was a record but gave no previous figures. While Harrison said it would be difficult to single out any benefit it was getting from Starbucks’ woes, he did note brand preference data had showed the U.S. firm “had taken a knock”. Last week Starbucks said it could pay 20 million pounds in corporation tax in Britain over the next two years, responding to public criticism over allegations of tax avoidance. Whitbread’s overall 3.3 percent growth marked a slowdown from the first half’s 4.3 percent rise in underlying sales, but this had been expected as the first six months were boosted by Britain’s wet weather and the Olympic Games. Across the group, underlying sales at its larger Premier Inn unit grew 2.5 percent in the quarter, as it benefited from a growing market share, particularly in London, and cost-conscious customers remaining loyal to its affordable rooms. Whitbread said overseas sales at Costa, which is aiming to double in size to 3,500 stores worldwide by 2015/16, were also up, with solid trading in the Middle East and China. Underlying growth in the latter market had slowed slightly from 19 percent in the first half, however, while central and southern Europe remained difficult, it added. Total Costa sales for the first 39 weeks of the year were up 22 percent to 734 million pounds. Like-for-like sales at its restaurants in the quarter rose 1.9 percent. Whitbread said it remained on target to meet market expectations for the full year. On average it is expected to post a pretax profit of 347.90 million pounds for 2012/13, according to a Reuters poll of 22 banks and brokerages, up from 320.1 million in 2011/12.

285,SBUX,"Starbucks to use cups for ""fiscal cliff"" message to lawmakers","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) will use its ubiquitous coffee cups to tell U.S. lawmakers to come up with a deal to avoid going over the “fiscal cliff” of automatic tax hikes and government spending cuts. Chief Executive Howard Schultz is urging workers in Starbucks’ roughly 120 Washington-area shops to write “come together” on customers’ cups on Thursday and Friday, as President Barack Obama and lawmakers return to work and attempt to revive fiscal cliff negotiations that collapsed before the Christmas holiday. Whether members of Congress actually drink in the message is another matter. While the concentration of Starbucks cafes is high in the vicinity of the White House, it’s relatively low near the U.S. Capitol. Members of the House and Senate enjoy private dining facilities and many of their offices have coffee machines. Starbucks’ cup campaign aims to send a message to sharply divided politicians and serve as a rallying cry for the public in the days leading up to the January 1 deadline to avert harsh across-the-board government spending reductions and tax increases that could send the United States back into recession. “We’re paying attention, we’re greatly disappointed in what’s going on and we deserve better,” Schultz told Reuters in a telephone interview. The CEO said he has joined a growing list of high-powered business leaders, politicians and financial experts in endorsing the Campaign to Fix the Debt, (www.fixthedebt.org) a well-funded non-partisan group that is leaning on lawmakers to put the United States’ financial house in order. Starbucks plans to amplify its “come together” message via new and old media, including Twitter and Facebook posts, coverage on AOL’s local news websites and advertisements in The Washington Post and The New York Times. “If (the talks) do not progress, we will make this much bigger,” Schultz said of the messaging campaign, which he said is voluntary for cafe employees. Given the number of Starbucks cafes in the Washington area and the number of workers on Capitol Hill, “I wouldn’t be surprised if a cup of ‘come together’ finds its way into the White House and into the speaker’s house,” Schultz said in reference to Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner, who are at the center of the fiscal cliff talks. “Our political system is not functioning in a way that is representative of what the country needs,” he said. “This is the one time where politics should be put aside and what we’re witness to is the exact opposite.” Schultz recently led the world’s biggest coffee chain through a painful but successful restructuring that returned it to growth. He is no stranger to using Starbucks as a platform to advocate for an end to the political stalemate in Washington. During the debt ceiling debate in August 2011, he made a splash by calling for a boycott of political contributions to U.S. lawmakers until they struck a fair and bipartisan deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending. “We are facing such dysfunction, irresponsibility and lack of leadership” less than two years after the debt ceiling crisis, Schultz said. Washington narrowly avoided a U.S. government default, but not before down-to-the-wire wrangling prompted the country’s first-ever debt rating downgrade. “There is something so wrong that we can be here again and not have the ability to put party aside for the betterment of the country,” said Schultz. “We have the same language and rhetoric. Unfortunately we aren’t learning much.” ",12262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-fiscalcliff/starbucks-to-use-cups-for-fiscal-cliff-message-to-lawmakers-idUSBRE8BP06U20121226

Starbucks’ cup campaign aims to send a message to sharply divided politicians and serve as a rallying cry for the public in the days leading up to the Jan. 1 deadline to avert harsh across-the-board government spending reductions and tax increases that could send the United States back into recession. “We’re paying attention, we’re greatly disappointed in what’s going on and we deserve better,” Schultz told Reuters in a telephone interview. The CEO said he has joined a growing list of high-powered business leaders, politicians and financial experts in endorsing the Campaign to Fix the Debt, (www.fixthedebt.org) a well-funded non-partisan group that is leaning on lawmakers to put the United States’ financial house in order. Starbucks plans to amplify its “come together” message via new and old media, including Twitter and Facebook posts, coverage on AOL’s local news websites and advertisements in The Washington Post and The New York Times. “If (the talks) do not progress, we will make this much bigger,” Schultz said of the messaging campaign, which he said is voluntary for cafe employees. Given the number of Starbucks cafes in the Washington area and the number of workers on Capitol Hill, “I wouldn’t be surprised if a cup of ‘come together’ finds its way into the White House and into the speaker’s house,” Schultz said in reference to Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner, who are at the center of the fiscal cliff talks. “Our political system is not functioning in a way that is representative of what the country needs,” he said. “This is the one time where politics should be put aside and what we’re witness to is the exact opposite.” Schultz recently led the world’s biggest coffee chain through a painful but successful restructuring that returned it to growth. He is no stranger to using Starbucks as a platform to advocate for an end to the political stalemate in Washington. During the debt ceiling debate in August 2011, he made a splash by calling for a boycott of political contributions to U.S. lawmakers until they struck a fair and bipartisan deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending. “We are facing such dysfunction, irresponsibility and lack of leadership” less than two years after the debt ceiling crisis, Schultz said. Washington narrowly avoided a U.S. government default, but not before down-to-the-wire wrangling prompted the country’s first-ever debt rating downgrade. “There is something so wrong that we can be here again and not have the ability to put party aside for the betterment of the country,” said Schultz. “We have the same language and rhetoric. Unfortunately we aren’t learning much.”",12262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-fiscalcliff/update-1-starbucks-to-use-cups-for-fiscal-cliff-message-to-us-lawmakers-idUSL1E8NQ10320121226
287,SBUX,Starbucks to use cups to send 'fiscal cliff' message to lawmakers,"Dec 26 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp will use its ubiquitous coffee cups to    tell U.S. lawmakers to come up with a deal to avoid going over the “fiscal cliff” and triggering automatic tax hikes and spending cuts.

The world’s biggest coffee chain reported net earnings of $432.2 million, or 57 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter that ended December 30, matching the average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Those sales were helped by a 4 percent increase in traffic and a 2 percent increase in average spending per visit. Same-store sales rose 7 percent in the U.S.-dominated Americas region, topping analysts’ estimate of 5.9 percent.

305,SBUX,Starbucks shareholders to vote on political spending ban,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz jumped into the political arena two years ago, organizing a hundred of his fellow CEOs in a pledge to forswear campaign contributions till Washington came up with a plan to fix the nation’s debt. Now, a Starbucks investor wants Schultz to go one better by prohibiting the world’s biggest coffee chain from making any political contributions, or forming a political action committee. Shareholders of the Seattle-based company will vote at its March 20 annual meeting on a proposal by John Harrington, who owns 800 shares, to “adopt a policy prohibiting the use of corporate funds for any political election or campaign.” “It compromises your fiduciary responsibility because you don’t know how people are going to vote once they are elected,” Harrington, chief executive of Napa, California-based Harrington Investments, said in an interview with Reuters. Starbucks is one of 125 companies that have faced shareholder proposals over the last two years related to political spending, according to a March 7 report by the Sustainable Investments Institute, which tracks political spending and corporate governance issues. In votes held this year, 37 percent of VISA’s (V.N) voting shareholders and 31 percent of those of Accenture (ACN.N) supported proposals to disclose contributions for lobbying, according to filings from both companies. “The problem is that the closer your contributions get to someone who can help your company, the closer they look like bribery,” said University of Delaware professor Charles Elson, director of its John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “It’s probably best for companies to just get out of it altogether. Over the last three years, Starbucks (SBUX.O) made no direct political contributions, or operated a political action committee, according to the annual report to shareholders on its activity, though it paid dues to trade organizations that lobbied, it said. Its corporate policy, however, allows contributions to state or local candidates, political action committees or state ballot measures. “We rarely make contributions and when we do we’re committed to doing so transparently,” said Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson. “We believe that we have a responsibility to advocate for public policies that support our business, our partners and the communities we serve.” Starbucks’ board recommended its shareholders vote against the ban, saying it would impact the company’s ability to educate elected officials about its business, promote public policies “critical to delivering long-term value for our shareholders,” and “potentially put us at a marked disadvantage relative to our competitors who are able to participate in the political process.” The coffee chain made contributions in the past, the board added, and “may consider doing so in the future if it is in the best interests of the company, our shareholders, our partners and the communities we serve.” Delaware professor Elson agrees with the Starbucks approach. “Let’s say someone decides to outlaw caffeine,” he said. “Starbucks’ shareholders would expect the company to represent their interests.” ",3152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-shareholder/starbucks-shareholders-to-vote-on-political-spending-ban-idUSBRE92E0YQ20130315

Starbucks is one of 125 companies that have faced shareholder proposals over the last two years related to political spending, according to a March 7 report by the Sustainable Investments Institute, which tracks political spending and corporate governance issues. In votes held this year, 37 percent of VISA’s voting shareholders and 31 percent of those of Accenture  supported proposals to disclose contributions for lobbying, according to filings from both companies. “The problem is that the closer your contributions get to someone who can help your company, the closer they look like bribery,” said University of Delaware professor Charles Elson, director of its John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “It’s probably best for companies to just get out of it altogether. Over the last three years, Starbucks made no direct political contributions, or operated a political action committee, according to the annual report to shareholders on its activity, though it paid dues to trade organizations that lobbied, it said. Its corporate policy, however, allows contributions to state or local candidates, political action committees or state ballot measures. “We rarely make contributions and when we do we’re committed to doing so transparently,” said Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson. “We believe that we have a responsibility to advocate for public policies that support our business, our partners and the communities we serve.” Starbucks’ board recommended its shareholders vote against the ban, saying it would impact the company’s ability to educate elected officials about its business, promote public policies “critical to delivering long-term value for our shareholders,” and “potentially put us at a marked disadvantage relative to our competitors who are able to participate in the political process.” The coffee chain made contributions in the past, the board added, and “may consider doing so in the future if it is in the best interests of the company, our shareholders, our partners and the communities we serve.” Delaware professor Elson agrees with the Starbucks approach. “Let’s say someone decides to outlaw caffeine,” he said. “Starbucks’ shareholders would expect the company to represent their interests.”",3152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-shareholder/starbucks-shareholders-to-vote-on-political-spending-ban-idUSL1N0C7BTL20130315

308,SBUX,"Starbucks buys first coffee farm, will research devastating leaf rust","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), the world’s biggest coffee chain, said on Tuesday that it bought its first coffee farm, where it will research the leaf rust that is devastating Central American crops as well as harvest its own beans. Starbucks, known for its trendy coffee shops around the world, has purchased an active farm on roughly 600 acres in Costa Rica, which it will convert to a global agronomy research and development center. Financial details were not disclosed. With the farm’s relatively low elevation that ranges from 1,100 to 1,600 feet, the center will research the roya fungus, also known as leaf rust, which kills coffee leaves by sapping them of nutrients and lowering bean yields. This year, the blight has surprised farmers by climbing to altitudes above 3,400 feet for the first time in Central America and Peru. The fungus has also reached Mexico. Coffee trees growing at such high altitudes had never before been exposed to the disease, which is spread by the wind, and farmers were unprepared for the decimation it has brought. So severe is the problem that Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla last week unveiled a proposal for a $40 million fund to help up to 40,000 farmers in the tiny Central American country who have been affected by the outbreak. Central America and Mexico account for more than one-fifth of global output of arabica beans. The International Coffee Organization (ICO) recently estimated that some 2.5 million 60-kg bags of crop could be lost in the 2012/13 global coffee output due to the disease, with losses possibly rising to around 4 million bags in 2013/14. Based on ICO data, those forecasts would equate to between 18 percent and almost 30 percent of Central America’s crop in 2011/12. Starbucks’ arabica coffee farm, which currently employs about 70 workers, will continue to harvest beans, to be roasted and sold by the company, a Starbucks spokeswoman said. The center also aims to help coffee farmers mitigate climate change and support long-term crop stability, programs that are part of Starbucks’ goal to source 100 percent of its coffee ethically by 2015. The investment is an extension of Starbucks’ $70 million ethical sourcing program. Starbucks defines ethical sourcing as a process that uses “responsible purchasing practices, farmer loans and forest conservation programs.” Starbucks will also look at innovating with proprietary coffee varietals that could lead to the development of future blends, Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz said in a news release.

Two years ago, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz organized scores of fellow CEOs to boycott campaign contributions until lawmakers came up with a plan to fix the nation’s financial woes.

But over the last three years, Starbucks made no direct political contributions and did not operate a political action committee, according to the annual report to shareholders. The company did pay dues to trade organizations that lobbied lawmakers. During the shareholder meeting, Starbucks reiterated its 2013 revenue and earnings growth targets.

315,SBUX,"Starbucks to cut grocery coffee prices, join Kraft and Smucker","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) on Friday said it would cut grocery list prices on its namesake and Seattle’s Best packaged coffee by 10 percent or more on May 10, as coffee costs fall and it fights for more sales through supermarkets and other retailers. Competition in the coffee grocery aisle is intense and Starbucks’ move follows price reductions by rival packaged coffee sellers earlier this year. Starting next month, the suggested retail price on 12-ounce packages of Starbucks coffee will fall to $8.99 from $9.99 and Seattle’s Best will go to $6.99 from $7.99. Starbucks’ price cuts apply only to packaged coffee sales through other retailers. They do not apply to packaged coffee and prepared drinks sold in the company’s own shops, spokeswoman Lisa Passe said. In February, top U.S. packaged coffee maker J.M. Smucker Co (SJM.N) reduced suggested retail prices on poplar brands such as Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts by an average of 6 percent. Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O quickly followed with a similar price cut for its Maxwell House and Yuban brands. Arabica coffee futures hit the lowest level in nearly three years in mid-March at $1.3405 per lb, down more than 55 percent from the 34-year high above $3 per lb, reached in May 2011. The price drop has been so dramatic that some makers of instant coffee, which is often made from the typically cheaper and more bitter-tasting robusta bean, have begun to buy arabica beans for their blends. <ID: nL2N0CF0A3> The benchmark July arabica coffee futures contract trading on ICE Futures U.S. closed up 0.80 cent, or 0.6 percent, at $1.3915 per lb on Thursday.

317,SBUX,"Starbucks, under fire in UK, seeks U.S. tax breaks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Coffee chain Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), which has faced criticism for its low tax rate in Britain, has sought new tax breaks in the United States in comments to a congressional committee. As U.S. lawmakers move closer to possibly overhauling the tax code for the first time since 1986, scores of companies and interest groups have submitted comments to the tax law-writing Ways and Means Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, a Republican, has vowed to introduce tax code overhaul legislation this year. Like other companies with substantial foreign profits, Starbucks wants profits made outside U.S. borders to be spared, in whole or in part, from the U.S. corporate income tax. Starbucks expressed support in its comment letter for a territorial tax system that would permit this. More particular to Starbucks itself, the company also asked for expanded tax breaks for the royalties it pays to entities that operate many of its stores outside the United States Tax economist Martin Sullivan, a former Treasury Department official who has testified in hearings for Democrats, said the Starbucks proposal would move policy in the wrong direction. “In a principled territorial system, all royalties would be subject to tax because they are deductible in a foreign jurisdiction,” Sullivan said. “Otherwise that income is not taxed anywhere.” Tax treatment of royalties for the use of intellectual property, such as the brand, were a part of the controversy in Britain. Starbucks spokesman Corey duBrowa said in an email: “We are simply seeking a level playing field and fair treatment of income from royalties for U.S. tax purposes regardless of business structure.” Starbucks said it pays a high effective U.S. tax rate of 32 percent, near the statutory rate of 35 percent. Many U.S. companies, by taking advantage of the many tax breaks available in the code, pay far lower effective rates. Starbucks has faced months of controversy in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, over reports that it has paid little or nothing in corporation tax in some EU countries.

319,SBUX,Starbucks raises outlook but shares fall,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) reported higher quarterly profit on Thursday that matched Wall Street estimates and it raised its full-year earnings forecast. The world’s biggest coffee chain cited increased sales in the United States, its top market, despite an industry-wide spending downturn in February due to a U.S. payroll tax increase that lowered take-home pay. Revenue was slightly below analysts’ estimates and the company’s shares fell nearly 3 percent in afterhours trading. They had gained nearly 3 percent in the last five days and nearly 12 percent year to date, fueled by expectations of strong performance. “While there’s been some choppiness that others have been reporting out there, I think what’s remarkable about our results is the steadiness of our (same-store sales) growth in the U.S. for example,” Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said in an interview. Sales at stores open at least 13 months, or same-store sales, rose 6 percent globally. In the U.S.-dominated Americas region, which contributes about 75 percent of Starbucks’ revenue, same-store sales rose 6 percent. That included gains of 5 percent in the number of transactions and 2 percent in the amount spent per visit. The components add up to 7 due to rounding. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix were expecting increases of 6.2 percent for the Americas and 6.1 percent overall for Starbucks’ company-owned stores. Same-store sales rose 8 percent for China and Asia Pacific and fell 2 percent for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Seattle-based Starbucks is a destination for relatively affluent consumers with extra money to spend on premium drinks such as lattes and mochas. As a result, it has been more resilient to dips in consumer spending such as the February pullback prompted by the increase in U.S. payroll taxes. ITG restaurant analyst Steve West said Starbucks is almost a victim of its own success. “The expectation bar keeps getting higher and higher until, finally, you can’t beat it,” he said. Starbucks said net earnings rose to $390.4 million, or 51 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter that ended on March 31 from $309.9 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a 3 cent-per-share gain on the sale of its stake in a Mexican venture, earnings were 48 cents per share, matching analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 11 percent to $3.56 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.59 billion. The company said it expects earnings of $2.12 to $2.18 per share this year, up from a prior target range of $2.06 to $2.15. Starbucks shares fell to $59 in afterhours trading from their close at $60.50.

320,SBUX,California woman accused of planting poisoned juice at Starbucks,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A northern California woman has been arrested on suspicion of spiking orange juice bottles with a deadly dose of rubbing alcohol and stocking the bottles at a Starbucks coffee shop, law enforcement officials said on Tuesday. Ramineh Behbehanian, 50, was arrested at her San Jose home on Monday night and booked into the Santa Clara County Jail on charges of attempted murder and poisoning, San Jose Police Sergeant Jason Dwyer said. Behbehanian is accused of carrying two bottles of tainted juice into a Starbucks outlet in San Jose on Monday, pulling them from her bag and placing them in the display case of a cooler stocked with various beverages. A customer saw the woman and what appeared to be her suspicious behavior and alerted the store’s employees, but police say Behbehanian fled the shop when she overheard the conversation between the customer and employees. Another Starbucks patron followed Behbehanian outside and recorded the woman’s license plate as she drove away, Dwyer said. San Jose police and firefighters were called to the coffee shop, which was quickly evacuated. Hazardous materials inspectors tested the contents of the two bottles in question and found they contained a mixture of orange juice and isopropyl alcohol, or rubbing alcohol. “According to the fire department, both of the bottles contained a lethal dose of alcohol,” Dwyer said. The store closed early to aid in the investigation, and all of the bottled drinks in the display case were destroyed, Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson said. All nearby Starbucks stores also were directed to check the seals on beverage bottles in their inventory as a precaution, but no evidence of additional tampering was found, he added. “We’re immensely grateful to the vigilant customer who did the right thing by immediately alerting our store partners after witnessing the suspicious behavior,” Hutson said. Dwyer said a motive for the alleged tampering was under investigation. He said he could not release additional details about the case.

The world’s biggest coffee chain, which sees China overtaking Canada as its second-largest market in 2014, promoted John Culver to group president of its China and Asia Pacific region, with Jeff Hansberry taking on Culver’s former position of president of Starbucks’ China and Asia Pacific region. Hansberry was previously in charge of channel development for consumer packaged goods and emerging brands, responsibility for which will switch to Culver. Jinlong Wang will become chairman of Starbucks China and senior vice president of business development. Nearly 3,300 of Starbucks’ roughly 18,100 global cafes were in the China and Asia Pacific region when its fiscal year ended on September 30. Elsewhere, the company promoted Cliff Burrows to group president for the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as its newly acquired Teavana tea retail chain. Burrows previously was president of the Americas region, which includes all Starbucks operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Latin America. Long-time executive Michelle Gass will return to the United States from Europe this summer to work directly with Chief Executive Howard Schultz. Gass, who was instrumental in the Seattle-based company’s U.S. turnaround several years ago, had been president for Starbucks Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Kris Engskov will be promoted to the role of senior vice president and president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He was previously managing director of Starbucks’ UK business, which was caught up in a consumer backlash against legal techniques used by companies to cut their tax bills after Reuters revealed it had booked no profit and paid no tax in Britain for three years, despite telling investors its British arm was profitable. Starbucks has since bowed to public pressure and is expected to pay about 20 million pounds in British corporation tax over the next two years.

323,SBUX,"Green Mountain ups outlook, expands Starbucks partnership","(Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O, maker of Keurig single-serve brewers and K-Cups, raised its full-year earnings outlook on Wednesday after a better-than-expected second quarter and said it had expanded its relationship with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), sending its shares up almost 16 percent after hours. The new 5-year agreement, which supplants one first signed in 2011, triples the number of Starbucks drinks to be sold in K-Cups with the addition of Seattle’s Best and Torrefazione Italia coffees, Teavana teas and Starbucks cocoa. It also ends speculation that Starbucks might walk away from their partnership following the expiration of certain Green Mountain patents and the launch of Starbucks’ own single-serve brewer. “The Starbucks deal changes the conversation to longer-term opportunities,” said Marc Riddick, an analyst with The Williams Capital Group. “It further confirms our belief that K-Cups are a growth driver for many strong companies, not just Green Mountain.” Starbucks shares rose nearly 1 percent after hours. Net income was $132.4 million, or 87 cents per share, in Green Mountain’s fiscal second quarter ended on March 30, up from $93.0 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain costs, earnings were 93 cents per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, had been expecting 74 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 14 percent to $1.00 billion, as a 21 percent increase in K-Cups offset a 10 percent decline in sales of brewers and accessories. Green Mountain sells its brewers virtually at cost to fuel adoption of its system. It makes the vast majority of its profits from the K-Cups. Last year, certain of the company’s design patents expired, inviting a host of private-label competitors and raising concerns among investors that an erosion of its dominant market share would hurt its pricing power and margins.

329,SBUX,Lavazza expanding into U.S. grocery store specialty coffee,"* Four new retail blends not expected to boost Lavazza’s bean volume * Lavazza will face strong competition in U.S. grocery stores * Lavazza’s Rivo Keurig System still in infancy By Marcy Nicholson NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Italy’s Lavazza is joining the ranks of Starbucks and Gevalia in the highly competitive specialty coffee section on grocery store shelves as the nearly 120-year-old roaster makes another push into the U.S. and Canadian consumer markets. The family run business, a brand little-known by North American consumers that has been supplying its Italian-roasted brews primarily to U.S. restaurants for years, will launch four specialty blends of bagged coffee in September as a part of its international expansion. The company aims to boost international sales to 50 percent of its total, up from the current 46 percent, said Ennio Ranaboldo, chief executive of Lavazza North America. While the move is unlikely to boost Lavazza’s coffee volumes significantly in the near term, the United States could in time become its second-biggest market after Italy, its flagship market. Currently, the U.S market ranks fifth or sixth, Ranablodo said, and France is its second-biggest market. “The U.S. and Canada are a priority for Lavazza. The U.S. ... is still the richest, most dynamic coffee market in the world,” he said. Lavazza buys around 2.3 million bags of green coffee annually. Going head to head with U.S. household brands such as Starbucks Corp, the new blends Gran Aroma, Classico, Gran Selezione and Perfetto will be on U.S. and Canadian shelves in time for the holiday season at the end of the year. Lavazza sees opportunities for its new blends as American coffee connoisseurs are increasingly looking for sophisticated brews. Competition in the coffee grocery aisle is intense, dominated by premium brands owned by Starbucks and Kraft Foods Inc. Starbucks cut its grocery list prices on its Seattle’s Best packaged coffee by 10 percent this month as coffee costs fell and it fought for more sales through supermarkets and other retailers. Kraft later announced it lowered the price if its premium Gevalia brand by 6 percent, marking the second price cut in a year, as green coffee prices fell. The company has been selling its more established blends in the less-visible ethnic aisles for years. Last week, the Turin-based company increased its stake to 8 percent in U.S.-based Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc , which makes Keurig single-serve brewers and K-Cups. Lavazza made its first move into the mainstream North American consumer market late last year when it launched the new Keurig Rivo System, a single cup machine that makes cappuccinos and espressos, with Green Mountain in the U.S. market. Lavazza has been selling its own single-serve espresso machines in Europe since 1989. Single-serve machines are a fast-growing sector in the coffee industry and allow consumers to make one fresh cup at a time, typically at home or in the office, with individual pods of brewed coffee. Ranaboldo declined to share Keurig Rivo sales figures, saying it is still in its infancy, but he said Lavazza expects single-serve will play a key role in its U.S. growth plan. The move is not likely to boost Lavazza’s coffee volumes significantly, however, in the near term. “It still stays in the ballpark of what Lavazza has been planning for its regular growth, which still is an organic growth,” he said.",5142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/coffee-lavazza-northamerica/lavazza-expanding-into-u-s-grocery-store-specialty-coffee-idUSL2N0DV35H20130514

334,SBUX,Starbucks to post calorie labels in stores nationwide,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp will display calorie counts for coffees and snacks at all its U.S. locations starting June 25, ahead of a federal requirement that large American food chains prominently disclose nutrition information. The company said on Tuesday the labels were meant to encourage health-conscious consumers to further customize orders by opting for sugar-free syrups or nonfat milk over more calorie heavy alternatives. “People are already customizing their drinks,” said Lisa Passe, a Starbucks spokeswoman. She added that the coffee company’s pastries will also come with a calorie count. Starbucks’ decision follows moves by Panera Bread Co, the first national restaurant chain to voluntarily post calorie counts, and sandwich chain Subway, which has used the disclosures to position itself as a healthier alternative to its fast-food rivals. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to require chains with 20 locations or more to make similar disclosures nationwide by the end of the year. Food chains in New York City and California already post nutritional statistics to comply with local health regulations. Researchers are split over the effectiveness of the labels in improving public health. One study in New York City, which has mandated the labels for several years, found that calorie postings led one in six customers to notice the information and buy foods with fewer calories. But researchers at Tufts University found that labels at fast-food restaurants under-reported calories by 7 percent and that 20 percent of the foods surveyed had at least 100 calories more than claimed.

The partnership comes as Starbucks pushes into the “health and wellness” category and as Danone, owner of the Dannon brand, and other yogurt makers seek to conquer the U.S. market, where yogurt consumption per capita lags Europe. Financial terms were not disclosed. Their first product will be ready-to-eat Greek yogurt parfaits, to be sold in U.S. Starbucks stores in spring 2014. Distribution to food retailers is planned for 2015, with global expansion to follow, the companies said. Yogurt is one of the hottest products in U.S. grocery stores and there appears to be plenty of room to grow, given that Americans eat far less yogurt than Europeans. The U.S. retail market for yogurt has grown an average 8.5 percent per year over the last five years, according to Euromonitor International, a sales tracking firm. Euromonitor forecasts the growth rate slowing to 5.9 percent per year for the next five years, double the expected growth of packaged food overall. Greek-style yogurt now makes up more than 40 percent of the market, though the top-selling brand remains General Mills Inc’s (GIS.N) Yoplait, which has a nearly 24 percent share, according to Euromonitor. Privately held Chobani is second, though France’s Danone has a greater overall share between its Dannon, Activia, Stonyfield Farm and Danimals brands, which together account for 30 percent of the market. PepsiCo Inc PEP.N has also jumped into the fray, selling Muller yogurt in the United States through a joint venture with German dairy company Theo Muller Group. The Starbucks/Danone yogurt products will be sold under the Evolution Fresh name. Starbucks bought Evolution Fresh, a bottled juice maker, for $30 million in November 2011. The coffee giant sells Evolution Fresh juice products through some U.S. grocery stores and Starbucks cafes and has opened four Evolution Fresh stand-alone juice shops.

Expectations were high ahead of the report and the company delivered on forecasts that it would modestly raise its full-year profit outlook.

351,SBUX,COLUMN- Starbucks' customer appreciation day may backfire,"By Rob Cox Aug 9 (Reuters) - For most companies, the prospect of thousands of customers thronging its stores to celebrate its corporate policies would be regarded as ambrosia from the retail gods. But it’s hard to imagine that Starbucks sees this week’s spontaneous “Customer Appreciation Day” by gun-toting Second Amendment absolutists as quite such a blessing. The Seattle-based caffeine chain has been the target of gun safety advocates for some time over its refusal to adopt a corporate policy that would ban patrons from carrying loaded guns into its stores. That’s why gun rights groups exhorted their supporters to holster up and pop into their local Starbucks on Friday to order frappuccinos. Thus far, everyone seems to be acting within their obvious constitutional rights. Starbucks is following applicable state gun laws - including “open carry” regulations - which permit customers to bring weapons into stores. Opponents of the idea of sipping lattes next to folks carrying Bushmaster AR-15’s also have the right to voice their dissent. Still, the economic downside for Starbucks may be much greater than the company has let on. The current furor could explode into a nationwide call for a boycott - something that many gun control organizations are now publicly embracing, particularly following an insensitive, though legal, call by one gun rights group for its members to parade their weapons at the Starbucks in Newtown, Connecticut - where 20 children and six educators were massacred in an elementary school last December by a gunman wielding an assault weapon with high-capacity magazines. The truth is, Starbucks and its shareholders may have more to lose than gain by resisting the adoption of a policy like the one it has for its own corporate headquarters that asks gun owners to check them at the door. Corporate embargoes are a common business risk. The classic modern example was a consumer movement against Nike products in the late 1990s over the sweatshop conditions at its suppliers’ factories. Fearing this would damage its reputation and brand - and thereby the bottom line - Nike helped create the Fair Labor Association to help protect workers’ rights. Similar fears guided Apple’s decision two years ago to allow the FLA to conduct special audits of its suppliers’ factories in China. Northwestern University Professor Brayden G. King studied boycotts like the one that prompted Nike’s change of policy. In a 2011 paper on the subject he concluded that the “increasing importance of reputation and positive media coverage appears to have changed the mechanism of a boycott’s greatest influence, thus making it an attractive tactic.” Social media, he noted, may “further enable movement disruption.” So how does this apply to Starbucks? It’s not clear what a shift in its policy, towards asking customers to leave their weapons behind, would do to its business. We can, however, take a guess by analyzing its customer base. Starbucks declined to detail how many of its stores are located in rural communities as compared to urban and suburban ones, where national polls show Americans to be more favorably disposed to increased regulation of firearms. However, according to the company’s website, Starbucks has a far larger share of its stores in those states that have recently passed more stringent firearm laws than it does in states that have taken the opposite tack. That stands to reason given population differences. But the numbers illustrate the potential harm a nationwide boycott might inflict. Last year, Starbucks had 504 company-operated and licensed stores in New Jersey - whose Republican Governor Chris Christie signed into law a raft of gun reforms this week - Maryland and Connecticut, both of which also strengthened firearms rules since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. By contrast, Starbucks listed 100 stores in Montana, Utah and Wyoming, where some legislators have pushed for rules that would encumber the ability of the federal government and police to enforce certain restrictions on gun owners. The point is, Starbucks appears to make more of its money from states where certain restrictions on guns - which do not infringe upon the Supreme Court’s reading of the Second Amendment of the Constitution - are favored by a majority of its customers. In the end, whatever Chief Executive Howard Schultz decides to do about guns, it will almost certainly be a matter of business, not politics.

354,SBUX,"Starbucks to get more Colombians drinking coffee, rival hopes","BOGOTA (Reuters) - The Juan Valdez cafe chain, owned by farmers and beloved by Colombians, expects the imminent arrival of Starbucks Corp to help it boost surprisingly low consumption of the beverage in a nation that grows much of the world’s tastiest arabica. The Seattle-based coffee chain will open about 50 stores serving Colombian-only coffee in the Andean country in five years starting in 2014, it announced this week. The company is already the single-biggest exporter of coffee from Colombia. Hernan Mendez, head of the 10-year-old Juan Valdez chain, said the novelty of Starbucks could help turn more Colombians into coffee drinkers given meager per capita consumption below 2 kg (4.4 lbs) a year - about a fifth of what Nordic nations drink. “It’s ironic that in a country that produces such good coffee, that consumption is so low,” Mendez told Reuters in an interview in Colombia’s capital, Bogota, two days after the Starbucks announcement. “There’s good economic growth and ... even though we are a coffee producing country, consumption per capita in Colombia is very low so I think there is room to have Colombians drink more coffee and Starbucks can help achieve that,” he said. Despite new competition, Mendez expected strong patriotic loyalty to the Juan Valdez chain which sports a beige and burgundy color scheme and ubiquitous sketched images of Valdez, a fictitious coffee farmer standing beside his mule, Conchita. “Of course they will want to try the Starbucks experience because it’s something new but ... we are very comfortable that our model is much more in tune with Colombian preferences,” Mendez said. The Juan Valdez character, conceived in the 1950s as a marketing emblem for Colombian coffee has gained the affection of Colombians, as a wholesome icon representing the work ethic and love of nature in a country whose image has been blighted by decades of guerrilla warfare and cocaine trafficking. The chain, which open its first store in December 2002 and has 170 stores across Colombia and 64 abroad, including New York and Miami, pays royalties of 3 to 5 percent on the coffee it sells, funding programs that benefit growers. Despite the exotic menu typical of premium coffee stores including cappuccinos, macchiatos and frappes, about half of the coffee sold in Juan Valdez stores is the simple “tinto” or brewed strong, black coffee, Mendez said. He said iced and other cold coffees had proven a popular among young people who previously were not regular coffee consumers. The fact that Colombia’s coffee landscapes are so diverse in terms of climate and altitude makes it possible to serve 100 percent Colombian coffee without having to blend in beans from other countries to achieve desired flavors, Mendez said. Colombia and the world’s biggest coffee producer, neighboring Brazil, have for years tended to export their good quality beans and drink remaining lower quality produce but consumers have grown more demanding as chain stores and in-vogue home espresso makers introduce palettes to gourmet brews. “The thing about Juan Valdez cafes is that we created premium coffee in Colombia. Today, if you look in the supermarkets, you will always find premium coffees ... that you wouldn’t find years ago,” Mendez said.

356,SBUX,"COLUMN-Starbucks policy shift is small win for gun safety, big one for economic boycotts","By Rob Cox Sept 18 (Reuters) - Starbucks’ decision this week to ask customers to leave their guns at the door will please many of its loyal customers. Gun safety advocates are also claiming the move as a major victory and are promising to move on to other retailers that allow guns in their outlets. Nobody, however, should be as charged up as Elliot Fineman. Ever since his son Michael was randomly murdered seven years ago by a paranoid schizophrenic while dining with his wife in a San Diego restaurant, Fineman has been on a crusade urging Americans who favor safe gun laws to make their presence known economically. Fineman, who founded the National Gun Victims Action Council, contends that political pressure alone will not shift the debate in favor of measures like universal background checks. There must be an economic impact as well. Starbucks’ move is a big, tangible example of Fineman’s strategy coming to fruition. In an open letter published today, the coffee-chain’s chairman and chief executive Howard Schultz made “a respectful request that customers no longer bring firearms into our stores or outdoor seating areas.” Previously, the company’s policy was to simply follow local “open carry” laws, though guns were prohibited from its corporate headquarters. It is not a complete about-face for Starbucks. For starters, it is a request, not an outright ban. This is because the company says it doesn’t want its baristas to confront armed customers. Additionally, according to Schultz, “we know we cannot satisfy everyone. For those who oppose ‘open carry,’ we believe the legislative and policy-making process is the proper arena for this debate, not our stores.” So while it may not be a perfect case study, it will do for Fineman. He first raised awareness of Starbucks’ permissive gun-carry policy back in February 2012 - before the mass shootings in an Aurora, Colorado cinema, a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school and now the Washington Navy Yard reignited the gun debate. On Valentine’s Day of that year, his group partnered with a couple of clergy organizations to launch a nationwide boycott of Starbucks stores and its products. By Fineman’s calculation, since the boycott began some 10,700 Starbucks customers had stopped dropping in for their lattes and cappuccinos, denying the company around $11 million a year in sales as of this April. But a decision by some gun-rights groups to stage events designed to create a media sensation, called “Starbucks Appreciation Days,” in which they openly carried their weapons into the company’s stores as a protest against gun control measures, gave new impetus to Fineman’s campaign. In early August, when a group of these activists descended on the Starbucks in Newtown, located next to St. Rose of Lima, the Catholic church that buried a half-dozen of its young parishioners barely seven months before, Fineman’s economic embargo took off. It was embraced by gun-safety advocates like Moms Demand Action and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence - who between them have hundreds of thousands of followers, as well as many parent and religious organizations across the nation. Just over a month since, and Starbucks has caved. “We’ve seen the ‘open carry’ debate become increasingly uncivil and, in some cases, even threatening,” wrote Schultz, referring to the pro-gun protests. “To be clear: we do not want these events in our stores.” While the Starbucks decision wasn’t perfect, it was enough for Fineman to call off his organization’s boycott. “Right now, many of the Pro-Gunners’ feelings are hurt and they are talking about boycotting Starbucks,” he wrote in an email this morning. That, too, would backfire as it might embolden the chain to consider an outright ban. Fineman is also encouraged by the company’s decision to take out ads this week in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and other papers explaining its change in policy. Starbucks might have been a relatively soft target. For one, it has far more stores in cities and suburban areas - where support for more restrictive gun regulations is highest - than it does in rural areas, where gun-rights arguments tend to prevail. Moreover, Schultz and Starbucks have in the past endorsed liberal causes such as marriage equality. But Fineman is emboldened by the outcome. By his reckoning, there are nine million Americans who have seen loved ones lost to gun violence, and another five million who have survived shootings.

358,SBUX,UPDATE 2-Starbucks asks U.S. customers to leave guns at home,"By Lisa Baertlein Sept 18 (Reuters) - Coffee chain Starbucks Corp has asked U.S. customers to  leave their guns at home after being dragged into an increasingly fractious debate over U.S. gun rights in the wake of multiple mass shootings. While many U.S. restaurant chains and retailers do not allow firearms on their properties, Starbucks’ policy had been to default to local gun laws, including “open carry” regulations in many U.S. states that allow people to bring guns into stores. In August, this led gun-rights advocates to hold a national “Starbucks Appreciation Day” to thank the firm for its stance, pulling the company deeper into the fierce political fight. Locations for Starbucks Appreciation Day events included Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were shot dead in an elementary school in December. Starbucks closed that shop before the event was scheduled to begin. Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in an open letter to customers late Tuesday that Starbucks Appreciation Day events “disingenuously portray Starbucks as a champion of ‘open carry.’ To be clear: we do not want these events in our stores.” The letter will appear in major U.S. newspapers on Thursday, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. The coffee chain did not, however, issue an outright ban on guns in its nearly 7,000 company-owned cafes, saying this would potentially require staff to confront armed customers. The Seattle-based company hoped to give “responsible gun owners a chance to respect its request,” Schultz said. The National Rifle Association, a powerful pro-gun lobbying group, did not have an immediate comment on the Starbucks letter and made no mention of it on its Twitter or Facebook pages. But one gun rights advocate said he would stop getting coffee at Starbucks. “It’s their choice and we support their right as a private business to make that choice. Gun owners will choose on their own if they want to patronize them or not,” said Rob Harris, media director for Michigan Open Carry, a group that took part in Starbucks Appreciation Day events this summer. A gun control advocacy group formed days after Newtown, killings, “Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America”, predicted other large companies would follow Starbucks’ lead. “This policy change represents a sea change in American culture, which is finally shifting away from allowing guns in public places,” Shannon Watts, the group’s founder, said in a statement. The Starbucks CEO told Reuters the policy change was not the result of the Newtown Starbucks Appreciation Day event, which prompted the Newtown Action Alliance to call on the company to ban guns at all of its U.S. stores. Nor was it in response to the mass shooting this week at the Washington Navy Yard. “We’ve seen the ‘open carry’ debate become increasingly uncivil and, in some cases, even threatening,” Schultz wrote, noting that “some anti-gun activists have also played a role in ratcheting up the rhetoric and friction,” at times soliciting and confronting employees and patrons. “We found ourselves in a position where advocates on both sides of the issue were using Starbucks as a staging ground for their own political position,” said Schultz, who in the past has willingly waded into the public debate over the U.S. national debt and gay marriage. Schultz said more people had been bringing guns into Starbucks shops over the last six months, prompting confusion and dismay among some customers and employees. “I’m not worried we’re going to lose customers over this,” he told Reuters. “I feel like I’ve made the best decision in the interest of our company.” Starbucks’ request does not apply to authorized law enforcement personnel.

It has nearly 7,000 company-operated U.S. stores. That policy had frustrated U.S. gun-control advocates, who have persuaded many other restaurants and retailers to ban weapons in their stores and worked hard to get Starbucks to follow suit. Schultz underscored that Starbucks’ new policy is not a ban - employees will continue to serve patrons with guns. The request also does not apply to authorized law enforcement personnel. “I don’t want to put our people in a position of having to confront or enforce a policy (when) someone is holding a gun,”  Schultz told Reuters. The Seattle-based company’s request that customers not bring visible or concealed guns into stores and outdoor seating areas likely will anger guns-rights advocates, who in August held a national “Starbucks Appreciation Day” to thank the company for its stance at that time.

363,SBUX,UPDATE 2-Sandwich chain Potbelly's shares double in debut,"* Company backed by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz * Raises about $105 million from IPO * Shares touch high of $33.78, valuing Potbelly at about $946 mln   (Adds valuation and updates share movement) By Avik Das Oct 4 (Reuters) - Potbelly Corp’s shares more than doubled in their debut as investors rushed to grab a piece of the sandwich maker whose low-priced menus have appealed to consumers in a tough economy. The company, which counts Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Howard Schultz as its largest investor, is the second restaurant chain to go public this year after Noodles & Co . Potbelly’s shares opened at $28.66 and touched a high of $33.78 in early trading, valuing the company at about $946 million. The IPO was priced at $14 per share, above expectations. Restaurant chains such as Potbelly and Noodles are attracting diners by using higher quality ingredients than fast-food chains and offering meals at lower prices than casual dining chains such as Darden Restaurants Inc’s Olive Garden. Investors have also taken a liking to these chains, often categorized as “fast-casual”. Noodles shares doubled in their debut in June and are up 34 percent so far. “The overall trend is to go for speed and money,” said Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst of market research firm NPD Group Inc. Sales at fast-casual eateries jumped 13.2 percent in 2012, more than double the pace at which fast-food chains increased their sales, according to consulting firm Technomic. Casual dining sales rose just 2 percent during the period. Potbelly’s sales were brisk in 2012, with revenue rising more than 15 percent to $274.9 million and profit tripling to $24 million. The company has posted positive same-store sales growth in twelve of the last thirteen quarters. The stock was trading at a multiple of about 40 times trailing 12-month earnings, higher than that of most competing casual restaurant chains but below Noodles, which trades at a whopping multiple of 113. Potbelly started in 1977 as a food counter in a small antique store in Chicago. Potbelly’s 295 outlets are mostly concentrated in the Midwest, although it is also a popular fast meal in Washington D.C., where it has a cluster of outlets within a few blocks of the White House. “It is gaining a lot of interest in areas outside the Mid-West where it seems to be focused currently, and expansion potential seems to be reminiscent of popular food chains that are going to succeed in markets,” said David Menlow, president of IPOFinancial.com. The company is headed by Aylwin Lewis, whose resume includes titles such as chief executive of Sears Holdings Corp  and chief operating officer of Yum Brands. He is also on the board of Walt Disney Co and Starwoods Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. Starbucks’ Schultz owns 20 percent of the company through his venture capital firm Maveron Equity Partners. Other casual dining chains readying to go public include Mediterranean style restaurant chain Zoe’s Kitchen and hamburger chain Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc. BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters to the offering. Robert Baird & Co, William Blair and Piper Jaffray are also among the underwriters.

364,SBUX,Starbucks founder urges CEOs to push for end to federal shutdown,"(Reuters) - Howard Schultz, Starbucks Corp’s outspoken CEO, on Monday urged fellow business leaders to ratchet up the pressure on U.S. political leaders to end the stalemate that has partially shut down the federal government since last week. “This weekend I heard from several business leaders who shared their concern about our relative silence and impact in urging the political leadership to act on behalf of the citizenry,” Schultz wrote in a letter posted on the company’s website. “It is our responsibility to address the crisis of confidence that is needlessly being set in motion.” Starbucks released the letter after Schultz sent it to top business executives, whom the company did not name. Schultz, who was not available for further comment, said he was “utterly disappointed by the level of irresponsibility and dysfunction we are witness to with our elected political leadership.” Since leading the world’s biggest coffee chain through a painful but successful restructuring a few years ago, Schultz has waded into several hot-button national debates. During the battle over raising the debt ceiling in August 2011, Schultz made headlines by calling for Americans to stop making political contributions until lawmakers struck a bipartisan deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending. Just last month Schultz wrote an open letter to Starbucks customers, asking them voluntarily to stop bringing their firearms into its stores. The company’s long-standing policy had been to default to local gun laws, including “open carry” regulations that allow licensed gun owners to wear their weapons in public. Schultz’s call followed a series of mass shootings across the country that have fanned a fractious national debate over gun rights. The deeply polarized U.S. Congress on Monday appeared no closer to finding a political solution to end the government shutdown than when it began last Tuesday, raising concerns about the economic consequences of a prolonged stalemate. “I don’t pretend that both parties are equally to blame for this crisis. But I do think they are equally responsible for leading us to a solution,” Schultz said in the letter. Schultz, a registered Democrat, has not donated to political campaigns since he called for the contribution boycott two years ago, a Starbucks spokesman said. “We have to do what we can to mitigate and avoid the unintended consequences that the current political direction is leading the country and world toward,” Schultz wrote. Schultz’s letter follows an unsuccessful attempt in September by U.S. executives who belong to a group called “Fix the Debt” to persuade lawmakers to avert another standoff and to raise the U.S. borrowing limit. Starbucks, which has nearly 7,000 company-operated U.S. stores, is planning “actions” to galvanize its large base of customers, the letter said without being more specific. Late last December, the company used its ubiquitous coffee cups to urge Washington politicians to “come together” and find a deal to avoid going over a “fiscal cliff” of automatic tax hikes and government spending cuts. Workers wrote the words “come together” on the cups they served to customers, aiming to push President Barack Obama and federal lawmakers to revive budget and tax negotiations that collapsed before the holiday recess. Starbucks backed the initiative with national “Come Together” ads in The Washington Post and The New York Times. It said millions of cups were signed as part of the action.

Just last month Schultz wrote an open letter to Starbucks customers, asking them voluntarily to stop bringing their firearms into its stores. The company’s long-standing policy had been to default to local gun laws, including “open carry” regulations that allow licensed gun owners to wear their weapons in public. Schultz’s call followed a series of mass shootings across the country that have fanned a fractious national debate over gun rights. The deeply polarized U.S. Congress on Monday appeared no closer to finding a political solution to end the government shutdown than when it began last Tuesday, raising concerns about the economic consequences of a prolonged stalemate. “I don’t pretend that both parties are equally to blame for this crisis. But I do think they are equally responsible for leading us to a solution,” Schultz said in the letter. Schultz, a registered Democrat, has not donated to political campaigns since he called for the contribution boycott two years ago, a Starbucks spokesman said. “We have to do what we can to mitigate and avoid the unintended consequences that the current political direction is leading the country and world toward,” Schultz wrote. Schultz’s letter follows an unsuccessful attempt in September by U.S. executives who belong to a group called “Fix the Debt” to persuade lawmakers to avert another standoff and to raise the U.S. borrowing limit. Starbucks, which has nearly 7,000 company-operated U.S. stores, is planning “actions” to galvanize its large base of customers, the letter said without being more specific. Late last December, the company used its ubiquitous coffee cups to urge Washington politicians to “come together” and find a deal to avoid going over a “fiscal cliff” of automatic tax hikes and government spending cuts. Workers wrote the words “come together” on the cups they served to customers, aiming to push President Barack Obama and federal lawmakers to revive budget and tax negotiations that collapsed before the holiday recess. Starbucks backed the initiative with national “Come Together” ads in The Washington Post and The New York Times. It said millions of cups were signed as part of the action.",10082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-shutdown-starbucks/starbucks-founder-urges-ceos-to-push-for-end-to-federal-shutdown-idUSL1N0HX20520131008
366,SBUX,Starbucks CEO starts petition against government shutdown,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) plans to circulate petitions to customers across the United States urging lawmakers to reopen the partially closed government and avoid a looming default, the coffee chain’s CEO Howard Schultz said on Thursday. Schultz said he was acting because of a “sad and striking realization that the American people have no platform with which to voice their frustration and outrage” over the shutdown, which began last week after Democrats rejected Republican efforts to undercut the Affordable Care Act. The “voluntary, non-partisan” petition asks Congress and the White House to reopen the government, pay U.S. debts on time, and pass a long-term bipartisan budget deal by the end of the year. Copies will be available in Starbucks stores, online, and in tear-out ads due to run on Friday in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and the Washington Post. From this Friday through the weekend, people can take a signed petition to a Starbucks store or sign it in a store. They can also sign the petition online. Schultz also sent letters on Thursday morning to business leaders, encouraging them to sign onto his initiative. He said that he had spoken with leaders of half of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and “every CEO I spoke to shared my concern and my outrage about the situation in Washington.” Schultz would not specify which companies he had contacted. In addition, Schultz said he had talked to the White House, to Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and to Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), the chairpersons of the Senate and House Budget committees in charge of negotiations over the federal debt limit. “It was apparent to me that we are on a collision course with time. That is why we made the decision to proceed” Schultz said, of those discussions. Schultz, one of the most prominent CEOs in the United States, said he was acting primarily as an American citizen, not an executive whose company’s profits rely heavily on consumer confidence and spending. “I’m not doing this because of the business angle,” Schultz said. Still, in times of extreme political dysfunction, “the responsibility of a company of any kind is changing because we have to provide for employees, help the communities we serve, and obviously, the government is not providing the leadership it once did.” “In this case we’re leveraging the sense of community among our customers and providing a vehicle for their voices to be heard,” Schultz added. The White House has a similar online petition platform called We the People. Launched by the Obama administration in 2011, it guarantees responses to petitions that accrued 100,000 signatures within 30 days. That site is currently offline, a casualty of the far-reaching shutdown that has closed down national parks, forced federal employees into furloughs, and halted the issuance of benefits to the poor. Schultz, a registered Democrat, is not the only business leader speaking out against the shutdown. Around 250 business groups sent a letter to lawmakers on Monday pleading with them to fund the government and raise the debt limit while cutting entitlement spending. Big business, which often sides with the Republican party, has found itself marginalized by conservative groups opposed to compromise in the country’s current fiscal crisis. Companies fear that a prolonged shutdown and subsequent default would have a catastrophic effect on the U.S. economy. Schultz is typically more outspoken on political issues than his fellow executives. During the battle over raising the debt ceiling in August 2011, Schultz called for Americans to stop making political contributions until lawmakers struck a bipartisan deal on the country’s debt, revenue and spending. He has not made a contribution since and says this is unlikely to change in the future. After a series of mass shootings across the country, Schultz wrote an open letter to Starbucks customers in September, asking them to voluntarily stop bringing their firearms into its stores. Schultz says Starbucks shareholders have not complained about his sometimes polarizing outspokenness because the company has shown it is a “a performance-driven company through the lens of humanity.” ",10102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-shutdown/starbucks-ceo-starts-petition-against-government-shutdown-idUSBRE9990YA20131010

370,SBUX,Starbucks under media fire in China for high prices,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) has been charging higher prices in China than other markets, helping the company realize fat profit margins, the official China Central Television (CCTV) said in a report. Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain, is the latest foreign company to come under fire from official Chinese media, which have targeted other prominent foreign names like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and it comes amid a pricing crackdown by regulators. CCTV, in a report that aired on Sunday, said a medium-size latte at the U.S. coffee house in Beijing costs 27 yuan ($4.43), or one-third more than at a Starbucks in Chicago. “Starbucks has been able to enjoy high prices in China, mainly because of the blind faith of local consumers in Starbucks and other Western brands,” Wang Zhendong, director of the Coffee Association of Shanghai, told CCTV. The report echoed a critique by the official China Daily newspaper published last week. Starbucks said its prices reflect higher costs in China, for expenses ranging from coffee and milk to rent and supply chain operations. “It is true that a Starbucks latte is more expensive in China than in the United States,” John Culver, president of Starbucks’ China and Asia Pacific region, told Reuters. He said Starbucks’ pricing in China is competitive and that margins from its roughly 1,000 China cafes are not greater than margins on U.S. sales. Higher food costs, coupled with significant investments for items such as training employees and securing ample and safe locally sourced ingredients means that “our bottom line operating margin is not any higher than what it is in the United States,” Culver said. Starbucks, which estimates that China will be its second-biggest market after the United States by 2014, does not break out operating margins by country, though it does break out margins on a regional basis. In its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, Starbucks’ most recent results, the company had an operating profit margin of 36.2 percent in the China-Asia Pacific region; 22.3 percent in the Americas; and 3.2 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Starbucks cafes in China tend to be much larger than in the United States because most Chinese customers tend to linger, while 80 percent of U.S. customers take their orders to go, Culver said. “Our stores are crowded and they need to be bigger,” he said. Imported products often cost more in China because of high import duties and tax rates. Roasted coffee beans, for example, draw an import duty of 15 percent and a sales tax of an additional 17 percent, according to DutyCalculator.com. China has been cracking down on pricing in markets ranging from milk powder to drugs, with the high premiums enjoyed by imported goods attracting much of the ire from local watchdog groups and media. Apple has also come under criticism in China for high prices, and the company was stung in a media report last year that said it treated Chinese consumers differently from those from other regions. Retail sales of coffee in China grew more than 90 percent between 2007 and 2012, hitting 7 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) last year, according to data from Euromonitor. The China-Asia Pacific region led sales for Starbucks in 2012, and company is considering opening 600 new outlets in the region this year, targeting 1,500 stores in China alone by 2015. Analysts said while Chinese consumers were becoming increasingly price aware, the latest reports were unlikely to dull demand for high street coffee in China anytime soon. “Consumers are increasingly aware of these prices differences. It’s become a very hot (topic) and is really common knowledge at this point,” said James Button, Shanghai-based senior manager at SmithStreetSolutions. “But branded coffee is something people are treating as a luxury and they are willing to pay for that luxury experience.” China’s influential netizens seemed to support Starbucks. “Those who are saying Starbucks is expensive are probably those who don’t drink much coffee,” said user Wang Shuo on China’s Twitter-like microblog Sina Weibo. “The prices are competitive and the quality makes people feel safe.” ($1 = 6.0968 Chinese yuan) ",10212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-china-pricing/starbucks-under-media-fire-in-china-for-high-prices-idUSBRE99K17H20131021

Analysts said while Chinese consumers were becoming increasingly price aware, the latest reports were unlikely to dull demand for high street coffee in China anytime soon. “Consumers are increasingly aware of these prices differences...it’s become a very hot (topic) and is really common knowledge at this point,” said James Button, Shanghai-based senior manager at SmithStreetSolutions. “But branded coffee is something people are treating as a luxury and they are willing to pay for that luxury experience.” China’s influential netizens seemed to support Starbucks. “Those who are saying Starbucks is expensive are probably those who don’t drink much coffee,” said user Wang Shuo on China’s Twitter-like microblog Sina Weibo. “The prices are competitive and the quality makes people feel safe.” ",10212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-china-pricing/starbucks-under-media-fire-in-china-for-high-prices-idUSL3N0IB18120131021
375,SBUX,Manhattan to get first Teavana tea bar since Starbucks deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coffee pot, meet tea kettle. Starbucks Corp, which has doubled down on its tea bet, is opening its first Teavana tea bar in New York City this week, aiming to do for tea, the world’s second most popular beverage after water, what it has done for coffee. “This is not your mother’s Lipton tea, just as Starbucks wasn’t Folgers. The difference between the quality of tea at Teavana is the difference between fresh squeezed juice and concentrate,” Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said on Wednesday at a press preview at the new store on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to The Tea Association of the USA, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world next to water. But while tea is the more popular beverage, coffee is king when it comes to sales. Global coffee retail sales were $75.7 billion in 2012 versus $40.7 billion for tea, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Still, Starbucks said it sees tea as a $90 billion market opportunity. Seattle-based Starbucks’ $620 million purchase of tea store chain Teavana Holdings Inc last year was its largest acquisition to date. Starbucks’ Manhattan Teavana store is due to open on Thursday, and aspires to have a “zen-like” atmosphere fragrant with spices. The shop will also sell food such as chocolate brioche. Schultz said the average purchase per customer at Teavana stores is higher than at Starbucks, where consumers typically spend $5 per visit. The company is not concerned that Teavana will cannibalize Starbucks business because “most people who are tea drinkers are not crossing over to coffee,” said Schultz. The new tea bar’s competitors include Chicago-based Argo Tea, which has cafes in U.S. cities as well as Beirut, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Dubai and Kuwait City. When it was bought by Starbucks, Teavana had about 300 stores in the United States, Mexico, Canada and Kuwait that sold loose-leaf, exotic teas. Starbucks said it would decide later whether to add tea bars to existing Teavana stores. Schultz said the company would likely add overseas locations while it expanded its U.S. business. “Some of the highest volume stores are in the Middle East,” Schulz said. Tea is not new territory for Starbucks. It bought Tazo tea for $8.1 million in 1999 and built it into a billion-dollar brand through sales at Starbucks stores and grocery stores. The company opened a Tazo tea store in Seattle last year and plans to convert it to a Teavana location that will open in mid-November.

379,SBUX,"UPDATE 2-Norway oil fund to invest more in China, urges openness","* Will not address tax avoidance with Google, Apple, Starbucks * Sharply cuts French, Canadian government bond holdings * Hikes holdings in Mexican, Brazilian, South Korean debt * Returns 5 pct in Q3, in top 10 of fund’s best quarters By Joachim Dagenborg and Gwladys Fouche OSLO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Norway’s $810 billion sovereign wealth fund, one of the world’s biggest investors, will increase its investments in China by 50 percent to $1.5 billion and would like to do even more, its chief executive told Reuters. The head of the fund, a major investor in Google, Starbucks and Apple, also said on Friday he would not take up the issue of tax avoidance with the firms it invests in, despite the fund’s ethical profile. The fund, which invests Norway’s vast surplus of oil money,  is the world’s richest sovereign wealth fund and holds about 1 percent of all global equities. It has been shifting away from European assets towards Asia and emerging markets to seek higher returns. Investing in the world’s second-largest economy is a key part of that strategy. But until recently it was only allowed to invest up to $1 billion in China. This has now increased to $1.5 billion. “We want to invest considerably more in the Chinese market,” Yngve Slyngstad said in an interview. “We have applied (to China’s authorities) for a bigger quota (than $1.5 billion) but we have not been able to receive it.” He urged China to open its domestic markets more to foreign investors: “It is in China’s own interest, as the world’s largest exporter of capital, to let ... investors in when they also want to invest in other countries.” The fund, worth some $160,000 for every man, woman and child in Norway, invests in about 7,500 companies worldwide. It bans investments in some industries - tobacco, nuclear arms, anti-personnel landmines and cluster bombs - and focuses in discussing with the firms it invests in on issues such as children’s rights or the equal treatment of shareholders. Tax avoidance has become a growing ethical issue recently, with multinationals such as Google, Apple and Starbucks under scrutiny for the way they pay taxes in the countries where they operate. They have denied any wrongdoing. Slyngstad said he would not take up the issue with companies the oil fund invests in, adding that international accounting standards should be clearer. The fund is Apple’s 10th-biggest investor, with a stake of 0.80 percent, while the tech firm is the fund’s eighth-biggest equity holding. The fund is the 18th-biggest investor in both Starbucks and Google, in which it holds stakes of 0.81 percent and 0.80 percent respectively. “We will not work with the individual companies on this issue,” Slyngstad told Reuters. “We will work towards the standards that apply to all companies. “It is important to agree on international accounting standards in this area so that we have clear rules for how internal pricing takes place. “This must be a work of international cooperation between countries and organisations that make international accounting standards,” he said. In the third quarter, the fund’s portfolio returned 5.0 percent, beating its own benchmark index by 0.1 percentage point. That put July-to-September among the 10 best performing quarters for the fund. Reflecting a growing focus on emerging markets, it bought more bonds issued by booming emerging economies in the third quarter but dumped French and Canadian debt. Among the biggest changes in the fund’s portfolio was a 28-percent increase in its holdings of Mexican government bonds. It also increased purchases of Brazilian and South Korean bonds, now its ninth and 10th biggest debt holdings respectively. The fund’s sales of French and Canadian government bonds pushed both countries out of its top 10 holdings, from fifth and 10th place respectively in the second quarter. Between April and June, it had dropped British government bonds in favour of Japanese paper and increased the share taken by equities in its investment portfolio. The fund publishes the list of its top 10 government bond holdings only.

380,SBUX,"Starbucks 2014 profit forecast falls short, shares drop","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) conservatively forecast 2014 profit below Wall Street’s view, despite fourth quarter profits that jumped 34 percent on strong traffic gains and an increase in spending by its customers. Shares in the world’s biggest coffee chain, one of the economy-defying growth companies such as burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O, fell 2.5 percent after hours to $78.80. Expectations run exceedingly high for high-flying companies like Starbucks, and any perceived stumble is often punished in the form of a share selloff. Starbucks on Wednesday repeated its forecast for fiscal 2014 earnings in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Analysts’ average estimate had called for a full-year profit of $2.67 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We are more optimistic about our future than ever before and at the same time we are realistic and practical in our expectations and I would encourage you to be as well,” Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told analysts on a conference call. Given the company’s “stunning” growth in recent quarters and the inherent challenge associated with topping that performance, “it would be unreasonable to plan for or to set expectations any higher,” Alstead said. On Wednesday, the Seattle-based company reported that profit increased to $481.1 million, or 63 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 29, from $359 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Starbucks’ consolidated operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 17.6 percent during the fourth quarter, with increases from every operating unit. Global sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 7 percent during the latest quarter, driven by a 5 percent increase in traffic. That figure included a stronger-than-expected 8 percent rise for the U.S.-dominated Americas region that contributes nearly three-fourth of Starbucks revenue. Seasonal pumpkin spice drinks, new pastries from La Boulange and cold-pressed drinks from Evolution Fresh contributed to the rise in U.S. sales, executives said. Chief Executive Howard Schultz scolded analysts for pressing the company to set ever-loftier targets for same-store sales growth. “It’s not going to happen,” he said. “The guidance we’re giving is the most responsible guidance we could possibly provide you, especially when you consider the maturation of our store base and the number of stores.” ",10302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-results/starbucks-2014-profit-forecast-falls-short-shares-drop-idUSBRE99T1C420131030
381,SBUX,US STOCKS-S&P; 500's rally ends after Fed; Facebook soars late,"* Fed holds steady with bond buying, gives weaker growth view * Private-sector employment below expectations, inflation muted * General Motors rallies, profit leaps on strong demand * Facebook and Expedia rally in extended trading, Starbucks falls * Dow off 0.4 pct, S&P; 500 down 0.5 pct, Nasdaq off 0.6 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, with the S&P; 500 snapping a four-day streak of gains after the Federal Reserve said it had a weaker growth outlook for the economy, even as it held steady with its stimulus program for the time being. Trading was volatile following the release of the statement, with the major U.S. stock indexes cutting losses to turn flat and dropping to session lows. Almost 70 percent of stocks on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq declined, while all 10 S&P; 500 sector indexes fell. While it had been widely expected that the U.S. central bank wouldn’t announce any adjustments to its bond-buying program, the statement wasn’t enough to extend a rally that has driven both the Dow and the S&P; 500 to repeated record highs, including in early trading on Wednesday. “While there were essentially no changes between this statement and previous ones, it is clear that even this wasn’t as dovish as some investors were expecting, especially with the bull market getting a bit long in the tooth,” said Michael Mullaney, who oversees about $10.7 billion as chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston. While the Fed’s stimulus has kept a floor under stock prices this year, there have been signs that growth is slowing, including weak economic data and an earnings season marked by tepid revenue growth. In trading following the market’s close, Facebook Inc  soared 9.7 percent to $53.78 after the social networking company reported revenue that was stronger than expected. Expedia Inc  surged 18 percent to $58.50 after reporting its results. On the downside, Starbucks Corp shares fell 2.8 percent to $78.60 after the bell because the world’s biggest coffee chain gave a 2014 profit outlook that was below expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 61.59 points, or 0.39 percent, to end at 15,618.76. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 8.64 points, or 0.49 percent, to finish at 1,763.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 21.72 points, or 0.55 percent, to close at 3,930.62. The Dow industrials hit a record intraday high of 15,721 shortly after Wednesday’s opening bell, while the S&P; 500 also reached a lifetime intraday high of 1,775.22 early in the session. Many analysts expect the Fed to delay until at least March in easing the stimulus measures that have encouraged investors to buy riskier assets, like stocks, contributing to the S&P; 500’s gain of more than 20 percent this year. The central bank has held interest rates near zero since late 2008 and quadrupled the size of its balance sheet to more than $3.7 trillion through three rounds of bond buying. Private-sector employers hired the fewest workers in six months in October, according to a report released on Wednesday, while the U.S. consumer price index showed benign inflation. Both indicators supported the Fed’s stimulus policy. In the latest batch of earnings, General Motors Co  rose 3.2 percent to $37.23 after the U.S. automaker reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit because of strength in its core North American market and a smaller-than-anticipated loss in Europe. On the downside, Yelp Inc dropped 2.6 percent to $67.05 a day after it reported a wider third-quarter loss, while Western Union shares slid 12.4 percent to $16.85 after the company posted a steep drop in third-quarter earnings. “Earnings haven’t been amazing, but they’ve been steady and sustainable, which the market likes enough to help us reach all-time highs,” said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York, which has $400 billion in assets under management. “When the season ends and we focus on the macro again, that probably won’t be good for the market.” Of the 313 companies in the S&P; 500 that had reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 68.4 percent have topped Wall Street’s expectations, above both the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 66 percent rate for the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue performance has been mixed, however, with 53.7 percent of S&P; 500 companies beating expectations, well below the 61 percent average since 2002, but slightly above the 49 percent rate for the last four quarters.",10302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-sp-500s-rally-ends-after-fed-facebook-soars-late-idUSL1N0IK2EQ20131030

384,SBUX,"Starbucks wants to recruit 10,000 vets, spouses","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp is looking for thousands of good men - and women. The world’s biggest coffee chain said on Wednesday it would commit to hiring at least 10,000 veterans and spouses of active military in five years. It also said five new and existing U.S. Starbucks cafes on or near military bases will share a portion of each sale with non-profit organizations that help veterans re-enter the workforce. Many U.S. companies have committed to hiring thousands of military veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Companies can find workers of different skill levels among veterans and can also claim tax credits of up to $9,600 until year-end for each hire as part of a work opportunity program. On the same day as Starbucks, U.S. telecom giant AT&T; Inc said it doubled its hiring goal for veterans to 10,000 from 5,000 for the next five years as part of a commitment to equal opportunity employment. Seattle-based Starbucks said it will have specialized recruiters to match the unique skills of veterans and their spouses with company jobs. “This demographic represents one of the most underutilized talent pools in our country,” said former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, now a Starbucks director. Announced ahead of the U.S. Veterans Day holiday on November 11, Starbucks’ new effort aims to expand and strengthen its existing mentoring program through the Armed Forces Network. “This is not only about hiring baristas,” Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters. Starbucks is seeking individuals with experience in everything from leading teams to building and managing complex, global supply chains, Schultz said. As the company expands globally and gets coffee and tea from around the globe, veterans offer international experience and foreign language skills, Gates added. “They bring an understanding of other cultures and they’re accustomed to working with diverse and international partners,” Gates said. Starbucks employs roughly 134,000 people in the United States, including “thousands” of veterans and their spouses. It did not offer a more precise breakdown. The five revenue-sharing stores near bases will donate 10 cents from every transaction, with a minimum annual gift of $100,000. The first two will be in San Antonio, Texas, and Lakewood, Washington. Donations from the stores will benefit Goodwill Industries International Inc programs Operation Good Jobs, in San Antonio, and Vested in Vets, in Lakewood.

386,SBUX,Starbucks to pay $2.76 billion in Kraft grocery rift,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp must pay Kraft Foods $2.76 billion after it ended the companies’ grocery deal at least three years early, the coffee chain said on Tuesday. Mondelez International Inc spun off Kraft Foods, its North American grocery operations as an independent company in October 2012. Under an agreement between those two companies, Mondelez will receive all proceeds from the Starbucks-Kraft dispute. An arbitrator ruled that Starbucks must pay $2.23 billion in damages plus $527 million for interest and legal fees, Starbucks said. Based on the rules of binding arbitration, Starbucks cannot appeal. The payment was larger than Wall Street expected, but roughly in line with the nearly $3 billion Kraft had sought, two analysts told Reuters. Shares in Starbucks were down 1.2 percent at $79.41 in extended trading. Mondelez shares were up 3.3 percent at $33.51. “We strongly disagree with the arbitrator’s conclusion,” Starbucks said in a statement. Starbucks has adequate liquidity both in the form of cash on hand and available borrowing capacity to fund the payment, which will be booked as a charge to its fiscal 2013 operating expenses, the company said in a statement.

389,SBUX,Starbucks says $2.76 billion Kraft split was necessary,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Wednesday said breaking up with Kraft was hard to do, but worth the high price, after an arbitrator ruled it must pay a whopping $2.76 billion for ending the companies’ grocery coffee partnership early. The world’s biggest coffee chain will restate results for the latest quarter to show an operating loss and issue debt following the bigger-than-expected award. The payment resolves a three-year spat between the two U.S. brand titans and illustrates how costly it can be to sever a contract. “It’s difficult when a decision like this goes against you. But it is a one-time charge in a single moment in time, and now it’s behind us,” Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. Starbucks has been posting strong revenue and profit gains despite the lackluster U.S. economy, and Schultz said the split cleared the way for the chain to significantly expand packaged coffee product sales in the grocery aisle. It “was, without question, the right strategic decision for Starbucks, our brand and our shareholders,” Schultz said. Starbucks shares closed up 1.1 percent at $81.46, after several analysts said the company’s long-term growth prospects remained promising. Kraft Foods Inc split into two companies in October 2012, Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez International Inc. Under an agreement between those two companies, Mondelez will receive all proceeds from the resolution of the Starbucks-Kraft dispute. Shares of Mondelez, which makes Cadbury chocolates, Oreo cookies and Trident gum, , gained 2.7 percent to close at $33.31. An arbitrator ruled on Tuesday that Starbucks must pay $2.23 billion in damages plus $527 million for interest and legal fees for terminating its retail packaged coffee sales, marketing and distribution agreement with Kraft at least three years early. Restated results for Starbucks’ fourth quarter ended on September 29 would show a net loss of $1.64 per share, the company said on Wednesday. The Seattle-based company previously reported a fourth-quarter profit of 63 cents per share. Starbucks said it had enough cash on hand and available borrowing capacity to fund the payment, which was bigger than Wall Street expected. The company will issue $750 million in new debt in the next three months, Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said on the analyst call. Starbucks also said it would not change its investments as a result of the ruling and repeated its forecast for fiscal 2014 earnings. Kraft began marketing and distributing bags of Starbucks coffee in grocery stores in September 1998, but Starbucks ended the contract in March 2011, giving the business to privately held Acosta Inc. The deal was set to expire in March 2014. But if it was not terminated by either party, it would renew automatically for successive 10-year terms. Schultz first alerted Kraft to his unhappiness with the partnership in January 2010. The company accused Kraft of multiple material breaches of contract, including mismanaging the brand, and in August 2010 proposed a payment of $750 million to end the deal. Kraft rejected that offer, denied any breach and said that if Starbucks wanted out, it must pay a fair value for its share of the business that brought in annual revenue of $500 million. Kraft said fair payment would be closer to $3 billion. Based on the rules of binding arbitration, Starbucks cannot appeal the decision. The date of the payment to Mondelez has not yet been determined, Alstead said.

390,SBUX,Starbucks eyes more German store openings in European push,"BERLIN, Germany (Reuters) - Starbucks plans to open more stores at train stations and on motorways in Germany to make a profit in Europe’s largest economy, the U.S. group’s European boss said. The world’s largest coffee chain has struggled to expand as quickly as it wanted in the European Union’s biggest and most prosperous economy. When Starbucks originally entered the country in 2002, it said it wanted 200 stores. Now, 10 years on, it has 160 stores in 40 towns and management has previously admitted they took the wrong path by opening stores in expensive town center locations near shops. “We will definitely open more stores,” Kris Engskov, who has headed the group’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) division since May, told Reuters in an interview. He said the chain would concentrate on big cities like Berlin, Munich and Duesseldorf. Starbucks has been reviewing its stores in Europe over the last five quarters, closing 72 in that time, but said at its fourth-quarter results last month it now plans to open 150 new ones in the EMEA region in its new fiscal year. The U.S. group will mostly look to open new stores in train stations, motorway service stations and so-called Corner Cafes, which are self-service areas within offices, said Engskov, who used to head the group’s UK & Ireland business. Starbucks currently has 100 Corner Cafes in four countries, including Switzerland. “We want to open Corner Cafes in 10 countries and Germany has priority,” Engskov said. He also said Starbucks would look to open more stores under a franchise system. The group has just started franchising in Britain and plans to award a first license in France this year. The franchising system, where franchise holders take on more of the risk of investing and running individual stores, is popular with fast-food chains such as Burger King and Domino’s Pizza. “We will also examine whether this makes sense in Germany,” Engskov said. He said these efforts should make Starbucks profitable in countries like Germany and Britain, where it has come under fire over accusations that it has not paid enough tax. The group said last month that sales rose 3 percent in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and its fourth-quarter operating income of $27 million was the highest achieved since it started separating out EMEA profits in 2010. It did not give details of profits for the individual countries. “I am certain that our new strategy will lead to long-term profitability in Germany, France and Britain,” Engskov said.

394,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Extended Stay shares rise in debut as U.S. hotel market recovers,"* Extended Stay valued at about $4.7 bln at day’s high * Backed by Blackstone, Paulson and Centerbridge * Headed by former Starbucks CEO James Donald   (Adds details, updates share movement) Nov 13 (Reuters) - Shares of Extended Stay America Inc  rose as much as 19 percent in their market debut on Wednesday, valuing the hotel chain at about $4.8 billion as investors bet on the recovery in the U.S. hotel sector. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company raised $566 million after its initial public offering of 28.3 million shares was priced at $20 per share. Extended Stay shares opened at $22.75 and touched a high of $23.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, headed by James Donald, former chief executive of Starbucks Corp, was bought for $3.9 billion at a bankruptcy auction in October 2010 by a group including Paulson & Co, Centerbridge Partners and Blackstone Group LP. Blackstone and Paulson each hold about 27.8 percent in Extended Stay. The private equity owners did not sell any shares in the offering. Extended Stay, which operates 682 hotels in the United States and Canada, reported a revenue of $313.7 million and a net income of $46.6 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30. The proceeds of the share sale will be used to help repay its debt, which stood at about $3.6 billion as of June 30. The company, which operates Crossland Economy Studios and Hometown Inn brands, is betting on a rebound in business travel that has boosted the rates hotels can charge for rooms. The hotel industry’s revenue per available room, a measure of room rates and occupancy levels, is expected to grow by 5.9 percent in 2013 and by 6.2 percent in 2014, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The U.S. lodging industry generated a revenue of more than $162 billion in 2012, according to Smith Travel Research. The Dow Jones U.S. Hotels index has risen 26 percent this year to Tuesday’s close. Shares of Marriott International Inc rose 25 percent in the period, while those of Starwood Hotels and Resorts are up about 29 percent. Private equity firms have been selling or listing assets to take advantage of a surging IPO market as low interest rates and a rally in the stock markets attract investors. Blackstone has also filed IPO plans for U.S. hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Inc and is seeking a valuation of about $30 billion, including debt. Another Blackstone-owned real estate company, Brixmor Property Group Inc, raised about $825 million in October. However, Brixmor Property shares are now trading below their offer price. Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters for Extended Stay’s offering.

397,SBUX,Starbucks loses 'Charbucks' appeal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has failed to persuade a federal appeals court to stop a small, family-owned New Hampshire roaster from selling coffee known as “Charbucks.” Ruling in a case that began in 2001, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Black Bear Micro Roastery and its owner, Wolfe’s Borough Coffee Inc, may keep selling “Charbucks Blend,” “Mister Charbucks” and “Mr. Charbucks” coffee. Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier wrote for a three-judge panel that Seattle-based Starbucks did not deserve an injunction to stop Charbucks sales, having failed to prove that consumers would be confused through a “blurring” of its brand. The New York-based appeals court let stand a December 2011 finding by U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan that Charbucks was “only weakly associated with the minimally similar” Starbucks trademark. Many retailers, especially those selling luxury or premium products, file trademark lawsuits against large and small rivals they believe are misusing their brands, potentially reducing profit and revenue and damaging their reputation. A centerpiece of Starbucks’ case had been a phone survey of 600 people by the pollster Warren Mitofsky, which found that “the number one association of the name ‘Charbucks’ in the minds of consumers is with the brand ‘Starbucks.’” But the 2nd Circuit said the survey was “fundamentally flawed” and drew its conclusions from how consumers thought of “Charbucks” in isolation, not its real-world context. It said that while 39.5 percent of participants thought of “Starbucks” or “coffee” when asked what came to mind upon hearing “Charbucks,” just 4.4 percent said “Starbucks” or “coffee house” when asked who might sell a “Charbucks” product. “Grocery store” was the most popular answer to that question. “Viewed in light of Starbucks’ fame,” Lohier wrote, “the fact that more survey participants did not think of ‘Starbucks’ upon hearing ‘Charbucks’ reinforces the district court’s finding that the marks are only minimally similar.” Zack Hutson, a Starbucks spokesman, said, “We are respecting the court’s decision.” Christopher Cole, a lawyer at Sheehan, Phinney, Bass & Green representing Black Bear, said in an interview, “This is a sound decision. It flows from the dramatic dissimilarity between how the different products actually appear in commerce and are seen by consumers.” Starbucks has grown since 1971 from a single store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market into the world’s largest coffee shop chain, with close to 18,000 stores in 60 countries and more than $14.8 billion of annual revenue. Black Bear is based in Tuftonboro, New Hampshire. It created “Charbucks Blend” in 1997 and now sells dark-roast coffee as “Mister Charbucks” and “Mr. Charbucks.” The 2nd Circuit noted that one reason Black Bear used “Charbucks” was the public perception that Starbucks uses an unusually dark roast for its coffee.

400,SBUX,Fitch Rates Starbucks' Proposed $750MM Notes Issuance 'A-',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Starbucks Corporation's (Starbucks; NASDAQ: SBUX) proposed $750 million  aggregate issuance of fixed-rate three-year and five-year senior unsecured  notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. At Sept. 29, 2013, Starbucks had  approximately $1.3 billion of total debt.   The notes will be issued under Starbucks' Aug. 23, 2007 indenture and will rank  equally with Starbucks' existing senior unsecured debt. Terms include a change  of control triggering event provision. Proceeds will be used for general  corporate purposes, including helping to fund Starbucks' $2.8 billion settlement  with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (KRAFT).  Key Rating Drivers:  Low Financial Leverage For the LTM period ending Sept. 29, 2013, total debt-to-operating EBITDA and  total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR (or rent-adjusted leverage by  capitalizing leases at 8x gross rents) were 0.4x and 2.2x, respectively.  Operating EBITDAR-to-gross interest expense plus gross rents was 4.2x and funds  from operations (FFO) fixed-charge coverage was 3.9x. Starbucks' total debt pro  forma for the above mentioned debt issuance is $2.1 billion. Pro forma total  debt-to-operating EBITDA is 0.7x and rent-adjusted leverage is 2.4x.  Ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that Starbucks will maintain rent-adjusted  leverage in the low 2.0x range over the near- to intermediate-term due to its  strong operating EBITDA and cash flow from operations growth. Starbucks' capital  structure framework is guided by its desire to maintain an 'A-' credit rating.  Significant and Growing Cash Flow Cash flow from operations has grown at an 18% compound annual growth rate since  2008 to $2.9 billion in 2013, exceeding Fitch's expectations. Annual free cash  flow (FCF - defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and  dividends) has averaged $752 million over the same period. Starbucks' cash flow  priorities include investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders  via dividends and share buybacks. The firm is targeting a dividend payout of  35%-45% and share repurchases will be mainly opportunistic.   Strong Operating Performance Starbucks' record operating performance is being driven by mid-single digit same  store sales (SSS) growth, new unit development, channel development, and a  favorable coffee cost environment. Fitch views Starbucks' long-term annual  revenue growth target of at least 10% as achievable, given multiple platforms  for growth. Global SSS have increased 6% or more for 15 consecutive quarters,  due to transaction growth and modest increases in average check, and net new  unit development is progressing at a mid-single-digit rate or higher.  During fiscal 2013, revenue grew 12% to $14.9 billion and consolidated operating  income, excluding the $2.8 billion litigation charge associated with the Kraft  Foods Group, Inc. settlement, increased approximately 25% to $2.5 billion.  Consolidated operating margin expanded to 16.5% from approximately 15% in 2012.  Results were the by-product of 7% global SSS growth, new unit development, and  lower commodity coffee prices which will continue to benefit the company in  fiscal 2014.   Market Leadership, Brand Equity With 19,767 units globally at Sept. 29, 2013, Starbucks is a leader in the U.S.  restaurant industry and the fast-growing U.S. beverage-snack category.  Starbucks' well-respected brand, additional food, tea and juice sales layers,  and ability to engage customers with its rewards program and mobile payment  systems should help sustain SSS growth. Moreover, expanding points of  distribution via grocery and other retail outlets is additive to sales and helps  strengthen Starbucks' overall brand equity and customer loyalty. Liquidity and Debt Structure Starbucks' liquidity is supported by its good cash flow generation and ready  access to capital markets. At Sept. 29, 2013, liquidity totaled $3.3 billion.  Starbucks had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and equivalents, of which a  significant portion will be used to fund the firm's settlement with Kraft.  Starbucks also had $729 million of availability, excluding $21 million of  letters of credit, under a committed $750 million revolver that serves as backup  for commercial paper and expires Feb. 5, 2018.   The firm's financial flexibility is complemented by a $729 million borrowing  limit under its $1 billion commercial paper program. At Sept. 29, 2013, there  was no CP outstanding. Upcoming maturities are limited to $550 million 6.25%  notes due Aug. 15, 2017 and $750 million 3.85% notes due Oct. 1, 2023.  Ratings Sensitivities Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --An upgrade of Starbucks' ratings is not anticipated in the near- to  intermediate-term due to significant levels of off-balance-sheet lease  obligations and the potential for additional debt issuances over the  intermediate term. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Rent-adjusted leverage sustained at the mid-2.0x or higher level as a result  of higher debt and a weakening of operating trends would trigger a downgrade.  SSS declines, margin contraction, and materially lower FCF would be viewed  negatively. Fitch currently rates Starbucks' debt as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Bank Credit facility 'A-'; --6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial Paper 'F2'.

401,SBUX,Insight: China CCTV Starbucks report set off storm inside network,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A China state television investigative report accusing Starbucks of overcharging local customers for coffee triggered enormous disquiet among journalists at the network and even some soul-searching after it aired. The October segment - the brainchild of a network executive who noticed Starbucks coffee cost more in China than in Britain - was mocked by Chinese Internet users and criticized by economic experts. But the reaction inside China Central Television (CCTV), which has targeted numerous foreign firms this year, was just as harsh, said a person with direct knowledge of how the Starbucks report came together, and a former employee who left weeks ago. However, those misgivings were all expressed in private or on a Chinese mobile phone chat application, illustrating how journalists in China are still reluctant to challenge editors in a system beholden to the ruling Communist Party. “I couldn’t find you a single person at CCTV who genuinely agreed with that report. Everybody thought it was very silly,” said the person with direct knowledge of the segment. “Of course, during meetings, the higher-ups all said it was right to do the report and no one disagreed.” The person didn’t want to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. CCTV did not respond to requests for comment. The network has taken many foreign firms to task this year over pricing, poor quality and shoddy customer service. They include Apple, Samsung Electronics, the KFC restaurants of Yum Brands Inc and British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC. Last week, CCTV accused foreign carmakers of charging local customers more for repairs than in other markets, singling out Audi, Subaru, and Jaguar Land Rover. In some cases, the reports have won plaudits from viewers and forced companies to change their practices. For example, Apple apologized to Chinese consumers for poor communication over its warranty policy and changed some of the terms. The two sources said they were not aware of any government directive to CCTV to target foreign firms. At the same time, CCTV editors were praising reports focused on the rights of Chinese consumers, they said. Chinese government bodies and state-owned firms are usually too sensitive to investigate, putting foreign companies in the firing line for hard-hitting corporate stories, experts said. “Criticizing foreign companies is very safe,” said Zhan Jiang, a journalism professor at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. “Leaders don’t pay any attention to it, people will support it, and it won’t bring the network any trouble.” Indeed, notes summarizing an editorial meeting before the Starbucks report aired shows how much foreign firms are in the cross-hairs. “It’s not just coffee. At the same time, it’s lots of luxury goods, like cars, international brands, they’ve all come to China to dig for gold,” said the notes, taken by an employee at the meeting and obtained by Reuters. “For most of them, their prices in China are the highest in the world.” CCTV is China’s state broadcaster. Its Chinese-language news channel, CCTV 13, functions as a primary vehicle for government propaganda as well as a platform for legitimate reporting, including on crime, social issues and business, experts say. The 18-minute Starbucks report, which appeared to use hidden cameras, showed CCTV reporters in Beijing, Chicago and Mumbai asking people on the street what they thought about the price and value of Starbucks coffee. It criticized the Seattle-based company for charging higher prices than in others markets, which it said helped Starbucks earn “fat” profit margins given its costs in China were not very high. In an e-mailed statement, Starbucks said it understood the concerns raised in the CCTV report, but that its prices are based on local market costs including infrastructure, labor, ingredients and rent, which are different in each market. A separate internal CCTV memo describing the thinking behind the report, also obtained by Reuters, shows staff believed Starbucks was taking advantage of a lax Chinese regulatory environment. “We need a lawyer to explain what punishment Starbucks would receive in the U.S. if it just hiked its prices as it pleased - this section should be as complete as possible,” said the memo. The broadcast report did not use any U.S. lawyers. In a market economy like the United States, companies are free to charge whatever they want for their products. According to the memo, the CCTV reporters overseas were told to ask passers-by outside Starbucks: “Is it reasonable to sell at such an expensive price in a low-income country? In the U.S., does this violate any principle?” When the report aired, Internet users chided the network for tackling a minor issue compared to China’s many challenges. Economists said CCTV had failed to grasp the concept of supply and demand, noting it was normal for a company to charge different prices for its products in different countries. “Of course Starbucks has the right to charge premium prices - if that’s what consumers want, that’s what they’ll go to,” said Mark Tanner, managing director of China Skinny, a marketing, online and research agency. CCTV’s expertise also came under scrutiny last month when it said local property developers owed as much as 3.8 trillion yuan ($624 billion) in unpaid land taxes. The tax bureau, while not naming CCTV, said the estimates were inaccurate and a misreading of tax policy. The person with direct knowledge of the Starbucks report said many journalists thought it was a bad idea to begin with. “There wasn’t a single person before the broadcast who was brave enough to stand up and say this report is problematic and we can’t do it like this,” the person said. After it was broadcast, journalists lambasted the report within the corridors of CCTV’s headquarters in Beijing or in groups on the popular WeChat app run by Tencent, a Chinese Internet company, said the two sources. The story idea was put forward by the network executive, who both sources declined to identify. The project was given to reporters in the economics editorial team, they said. According to the internal memo, it became part of the team’s push to report on the “windfall profits by foreign brands”. “U.S. enterprises hike prices as they please in China, but in the U.S., Chinese enterprises don’t dare to do the same,” the memo said. After the widespread criticism of the report, it was raised quietly as a cautionary tale in low-level editorial meetings, said the former CCTV employee, who left the network for personal reasons and who also declined to be identified. She said a senior producer who did not work in the economics department told reporters after the Starbucks report aired that they should use discretion and judgment in choosing topics to avoid a viewer backlash, including from social media. Still, senior editors see foreign firms as key targets for investigative reports. “It was not a cohesive theme, but was suggested at general meetings - the idea that we have to be vigilant against these foreign companies that are short-changing Chinese people,” said the former employee.

403,SBUX,Starbucks' growth cooled in latest quarter,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) on Thursday reported that sales at established stores in its U.S.-dominated Americas region cooled more than analysts expected in its latest quarter as consumers spent more time holiday shopping online than at physical stores. Nevertheless, the world’s biggest coffee chain boosted its fiscal 2014 earnings per share forecast to a range of $2.59 to $2.67, from $2.55 to $2.65 previously, sending shares up 0.9 percent to $74.02 in after-hours trade. Global sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 5 percent, versus analysts’ average estimate for a 5.9 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix. That figure included a 5 percent increase for the Americas region that contributes the lion’s share of Starbucks revenue. Analysts, on average, expected a 6.4 percent rise from the region. Last fiscal year, Starbucks’ Americas region sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were up 8 percent in the fourth quarter and up 9 percent in the third quarter. “It’s hard to really be too critical, especially when you compare what we’ve seen and what we’re about to see in the coming weeks,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said, referring to the recent spate of disappointing earnings reports and profit warnings from restaurants and retailers. Those included McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), which earlier on Thursday reported a steeper-than-expected drop in December sales at established restaurants in the United States and put some of the blame on frigid winter weather. “Growth is hard to find,” Russo said. Expectations had been muted ahead of the release of Starbucks’ results, in part because the Seattle company has been on a growth tear that many analysts said could not go on forever. “Holiday 2013 was the first in which many traditional brick and mortar retailers experienced in-store foot traffic give way to online shopping in a major way,” Starbucks President and Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in a statement. Data firm ShopperTrak last week said U.S. shopper traffic fell 14.6 percent during the holiday season. Starbucks’ net earnings increased 25 percent to $540.7 million, or 71 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended on December 29. Excluding a litigation credit of 2 cents a share, Starbucks’ profit matched Wall Street’s average estimate of 69 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. There has been a growing concern among analysts that the U.S. roll-out of pastries from La Boulange, a San Francisco-area bakery Starbucks bought in 2012, has slowed service because workers are taking the time to warm up baked goods. La Boulange products are sold in half of Starbucks’ company-operated stores in the United States, which works out to about 3,500 stores. Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters that Starbucks has added staff and revamped workers’ duties to accommodate the additional labor. “There may be a perception that there is a slowdown, but when we measure it, there is no change,” Alstead told Reuters. Starbucks is one of the best-performing companies in the restaurant category and its shares have run up more than 30 percent in 12 months.

Financials and materials stocks were the day’s biggest losers while telecom services was the only positive sector as investors sold growth-oriented stocks and bought defensive ones. Trading volume was heavier than in recent sessions. The market sentiment was dented by a report on manufacturing in China which showed a mild slowdown at the end of 2013 in the world’s second-largest economy had continued into the new year. U.S.-traded Chinese stocks were down sharply after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission judge ruled that the Chinese units of the world’s top accounting firms should be suspended from auditing those companies. Among the biggest losers were Internet services provider Baidu Inc, down 6.2 percent, and SINA Corp, down 5.9 percent, on heavier-than-usual volume. The U.S. shares of Petrochina , the country’s largest stock by market value, fell 3.1 percent. The CBOE Volatility index VIX often used as a fear gauge on Wall Street, closed up 7.2 percent at 13.77 after rising more than 11 percent earlier. “The day’s panic was largely associated with China and I think it’s a temporary reaction,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “If we have good corporate earnings from a couple of big names or good economic reports, I think we will be right back up to where we were a couple days ago.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 175.99 points or 1.07 percent, to 16,197.35, the S&P; 500 lost 16.4 points or 0.89 percent, to 1,828.46 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 24.126 points or 0.57 percent, to 4,218.875. Trading volume was higher than usual with 7.4 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms compared to a five-day average of 6.7 billion shares, according to BATS exchange data. Both on the NYSE and Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by a ratio of about 2 to 1. After the bell, Microsoft Corp said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 3 percent, as strong sales of its Office software to businesses offset another weak quarter for its flagship Windows system, and as consumers increasingly favor tablets over personal computers. The stock rose 3.7 percent in extended trade. Starbucks Corp’s sales at established stores in its U.S.-dominated Americas region cooled more than analysts expected in its latest quarter as consumers spent more time holiday shopping online than at physical stores.  The stock rose 1 percent in extended trade. Apple Inc rose 0.8 percent to $556.18. Activist investor Carl Icahn picked up another $500 million of Apple shares, taking the billionaire’s total investment in the iPhone maker to $3.6 billion. In other earnings, McDonald’s Corp reported weaker-than-expected revenue as fewer customers ate at its restaurants. Shares rebounded from earlier losses to close up 0.5 percent to $95.32. Netflix Inc shares surged 16.5 percent to $388.72 as the best performer on the S&P; 500. The world’s largest video-streaming company said Wednesday it added more than 2.3 million U.S. customers in the fourth quarter. Shares of Herbalife fell 10.3 percent to $65.92 in heavy volume after Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey asked for more information about its business practices.

408,SBUX,Starbucks boosts profit forecast despite slower growth,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) on Thursday reported that sales at established restaurants in its U.S.-dominated Americas region cooled more than analysts expected in its latest quarter as online shopping kept more consumers at home and reduced their visits to its coffee bars. With fewer shoppers going to all types of stores to buy gifts, Starbucks executives said sales at its cafes open at least 13 months softened, particularly in December Nevertheless, the world’s biggest coffee chain boosted its fiscal 2014 earnings per share forecast to a range of $2.59 to $2.67, from $2.55 to $2.65 previously, sending shares up more than 1 percent to $74.15 in after-hours trade. Global sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 5 percent, versus analysts’ average estimate for a 5.9 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix. That figure included a 5 percent increase for the Americas region, which contributes 70 percent of Starbucks revenue. Analysts, on average, expected a 6.4 percent rise from the region. In the two prior quarters, Starbucks’ Americas region same-restaurant sales were up 8 percent and 9 percent. “It’s hard to really be to critical, especially when you compare what we’ve seen and what we’re about to see in the coming weeks,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said, referring to the recent spate of disappointing earnings reports and profit warnings from restaurants and retailers. Those included McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), which earlier on Thursday reported a steeper-than-expected drop in December sales at established restaurants in the United States and put some of the blame on frigid winter weather. “Growth is hard to find,” Russo said. Expectations had been muted ahead of the release of Starbucks’ results, in part because the Seattle company has been on a growth tear that many analysts said could not go on forever. In a conference call with analysts, Starbucks Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Schultz predicted that December 2013 would go down as the turning point in the way consumers shop. “People spent much more time on the web than ever before,” Schultz said. Overall U.S. online sales in the period between November 2 and December 23 grew 10 percent compared with a year earlier, according to data firm comScore SCOR.O. ShopperTrak last week said U.S. shopper traffic at brick and mortar stores fell 14.6 percent during the holiday season. Schultz pointed to the Americas region’s 4 percent traffic increase in the latest quarter as proof that Starbucks would successfully weather the change - in large part because online sellers can’t replicate the experience of having a croissant and coffee at one of its shops. Starbucks’ net earnings increased 25 percent to $540.7 million, or 71 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended on December 29. Excluding a litigation credit of 2 cents a share, Starbucks’ profit matched Wall Street’s average estimate of 69 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also has $1 billion in deferred revenue on the books from Starbucks gift cards purchases and reloads in the first quarter. That money will be booked as revenue as it is spent. There has been a growing concern among analysts that the U.S. roll-out of pastries from La Boulange, a San Francisco-area bakery Starbucks bought in 2012, has slowed service because workers are taking the time to warm up baked goods.

409,SBUX,UPDATE 2-Starbucks strengthens technology brew with executive shift,"By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz on Wednesday said he was promoting Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead to the new position of chief operating officer, allowing Schultz to focus on keeping the coffee shop chain ahead of the curve in retail technology including mobile payments. Alstead will assume oversight of the company’s day-to-day operations. Scott Maw, senior vice president of corporate finance, will succeed Alstead as CFO. Starbucks, already a leader in mobile payments, gift cards, loyalty programs and digital marketing, for years has been finding ways to strengthen results by linking its cafe business and product sales through grocery stores and other retailers. Schultz said such efforts helped the Seattle-based company  outshine other U.S. retailers during the 2013 holiday season, when shopper visits to overall brick-and-mortar stores dropped and online sales increased. Starbucks’ traffic rose 4 percent during the quarter that included the holiday season. The chain also saw a record $1.4 billion loaded onto gift cards during that quarter. The CEO expects the company’s latest move to further strengthen Starbucks’ business. It is an opportunity for Starbucks “to create new channels of revenue and profit outside four walls of stores .. amid a seismic shift” in the way consumers are shopping, Schultz who is also chairman, told Reuters in a telephone interview. Schultz, who will be working closely with executives  including Chief Digital Officer Adam Brotman and Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan, declined to give specifics on the company’s plans. “This is not about succession planning and this is not about me in any planning to or even thinking about leaving he company,” he said. Starbucks is an investor in mobile payments provider Square. When asked if Starbucks would buy Square, which counts the coffee company among its users, Schultz said Starbucks has no near-term acquisition plans. He did say that future efforts would include the use of “Starbucks currency in other retailers outside Starbucks.” Starbucks already allows registered Starbucks card users to earn “stars,” or points, when they buy coffee at a participating grocery store.

410,SBUX,Starbucks promotes CFO to new post in e-commerce push,"LOS ANGELES, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp  Chief Executive Howard Schultz on Wednesday said he was promoting Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead to the new position of chief operating officer, allowing Schultz to focus on expanding the coffee shop chain’s e-commerce business. Alstead will take over oversight of the brick-and-mortar shops, where traffic rose 4 percent during the quarter that included the holiday season. Starbucks also saw a record $1.4 billion loaded onto gift cards during that quarter. The company, a leader is mobile payments and digital marketing, for years has been finding ways to link and strengthen its sales by tying together its cafe business with selling its products at grocery stores and other retailers. “This is not about succession planning and this is not about me in any planning to or even thinking about leaving he company,” Schultz, Starbucks founder and chief executive, told Reuters in a telephone interview. The intensified emphasis on e-commerce, including mobile payments and gift cards, is an opportunity for Starbucks “to create new channels of revenue and profit outside four walls of stores .. amid a seismic shift” in the way consumers are shopping, Schultz said. The new initiative includes mobile payments projects, said Schultz, who declined to elaborate. Seattle-based Starbucks is an investor in mobile payments provider Square. When asked if Starbucks planned to buy that company, which processes mobile payments for Starbucks and  other retailers, Schultz said Wednesday’s announcement was not about an acquisition. Schultz did say that future programs would include the use of “Starbucks currency in other retailers outside Starbucks.” Starbucks already allows users of its loyalty and payment card to earn “stars” - or points - when they buy coffee at a participating grocery store.

411,SBUX,"FEATURE-McDonald's looking to heat up U.S. sales with breakfast, coffee","By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Raymond Tremblay, a loyal McDonald’s Corp customer from Los Angeles, thinks the fast-food chain sells tasty food at reasonable prices and he cannot think of a quick fix that would help end the company’s disappointing U.S. performance. “I know it’s there and it’s always good,” Tremblay, 46,  said of McDonald’s. “Maybe we just kind of take it for granted.” Such customer feedback underscores the challenges faced by the world’s biggest restaurant company, which has reported 19 months of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, stepped-up competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service. In a recent call with analysts, McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson vowed to “create more of a coffee culture through high-quality McCafe products” as well as to double-down on breakfast and sales of food priced around $1 — in a bid to bolster sales. Once or twice a week, Tremblay makes a slight detour from his morning commute to pick up coffee and a sausage McMuffin with egg or a sausage burrito. He has bought the company’s flavored coffees, but never orders the espresso drinks made from pricey McCafe machines that McDonald’s franchisees installed to compete with Starbucks Corp . Tremblay, a production artist for an animation firm, is happy when his favorite items are on sale - but he and other customers say that discounts are not enough to change their morning routines. Mel Yu, a 32-year-old automotive industry consultant from Grand Blanc, Michigan, still goes to McDonald’s three to four times a week — but that is down significantly from a decade ago, when McDonald’s was just about the only place to grab a quick morning meal. These days, breakfast competition is fierce. Starbucks is introducing new pastries, fast-food chains Burger King  and Dunkin’ Donuts have come on strong with food and drinks, and bakery chain Panera Bread has rapidly expanded. McDonald’s owners in Yu’s area have been couponing and matching discounts from competitors. Still, Yu said that has not increased the frequency of his visits to the Golden Arches: “I’m going there anyhow.” McDonald’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment via telephone or email. McDonald’s on Monday said U.S. sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 3.3 percent in January - more than twice as steep as the drop that analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected. McDonald’s blamed the frigid cold and snow that hit large parts of the United States, but analysts said McDonald’s domestic patrons continue to be pinched by the slow economy. It is a trend playing out across the industry. McDonald’s and other restaurants that cater to the financially strapped low-to-middle income masses — including Darden Restaurant Inc’s Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains — are struggling to bring in sales. At the same time, Starbucks, Panera, Chipotle Mexican Grill  and Darden’s Capital Grille steak house, which cater to somewhat wealthier diners, are outperforming. McDonald’s was the undisputed leader in the U.S. quick-service breakfast category with 19 percent market share in 2013, according to Nielsen Co consumer data firm Scarborough. Its closest rivals last year were Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, each with 7 percent market share. “When you’re No. 1, you’ve got one direction to go and that’s down. Everybody’s got a target on your back,” Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West said. Some analysts expect investors to give Thompson, McDonald’s CEO who took the helm in July 2012, most of this year to turn the ship. Thompson championed the McCafe push during his tenure as president of McDonald’s USA from 2006 to 2010. That program required franchisees to renovate restaurants to create space for equipment, such as an espresso machine that cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per restaurant. The McCafe expansion — which also included blended fruit smoothies and other drinks — is widely viewed as a success. While regular coffee sales are reported to be brisk, some franchisees have complained in surveys that sales of espresso drinks fall far short of covering the cost of the high-maintenance machines that crank out lattes and mochas with the press of a button. Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, said McCafe is at the heart of McDonald’s operational woes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Penney says the McCafe business has been slowing down service and that the recent roll-outs of too many new food products and limited-time offers have only exaggerated the problem. For now, McDonald’s is focusing on making its food preparation more efficient. It has called on restaurant operators to install a $25,000 to $50,000 “high density table” that stores sandwich toppings and other items. Executives say that new equipment will help workers turn out sandwiches and other food faster.

413,SBUX,"Mondelez profit disappoints, 2014 outlook above Street view","Feb 12 (Reuters) - Cadbury chocolate seller Mondelez International Inc on Wednesday reported quarterly profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates amid weak global demand for packaged food and vowed to do better in 2014. Mondelez, which also makes Oreo cookies and Trident gum, said fourth-quarter net earnings totaled $1.7 billion, or $1 per share, including a 91-cent gain from the resolution of arbitration over Kraft’s grocery coffee sales battle with Starbucks Corp. Adjusted earnings for the latest quarter were 42 cents per share, including a two-cent-per-share hit from currency translation. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of 44 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue was down 0.1 percent to $9.49 billion, but organic net revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions and other items, rose 2.5 percent. Mondelez on Wednesday said its organic revenue growth rate would be “at or above our category growth rate,” which it forecast at about 4 percent in 2014. “We’re disappointed that our results were below what we and our shareholders originally expected,” Mondelez Chairwoman and Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said in a statement. “We’re committed to improving results in 2014 and beyond.” Mondelez, which was spun off from Kraft in 2012, has estimated full-year earnings of $1.78 to $1.78 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected profit of $1.71 per share in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

415,SBUX,"RPT-G20 agrees on push to close tax loopholes, make multinationals pay","By Jane Wardell SYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The world’s top economies agreed on Sunday to develop stricter rules on cross-border taxation to close loopholes that have allowed multinationals such as Starbucks Corp, Google Inc, Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc to avoid paying taxes. The Group of 20 endorsed a set of common standards for sharing bank account information across borders with automatic exchange of information among its members to take effect by the end of 2015. “Some multinational companies aren’t paying their fair share of tax anywhere,” Australian Finance Minister Joe Hockey, who hosted the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Sydney, said at the close of the gathering. “We want a global response.” Reports of profit shifting by companies away from high tax countries to more relaxed tax regimes have sparked public inquiries in the United States and Britain. Global tax evasion could be costing more than $3 trillion a year according to researchers from Tax Justice Network, while as much as $32 trillion - twice the size of U.S. gross domestic product - could be stashed away in tax havens. Tightening tax loopholes has gained urgency in the aftermath of the global financial crisis when developed nations’ efforts to avert economic meltdown left them with gaping budget holes and record debt. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has targeted fiscal consolidation as a key part of its growth strategy for the G20, but that will be hard to achieve if tax bases are eroded further. Corporate tax evasion is also a challenge for poor countries, which typically have the least developed tax systems and enforcement. Around $160 billion each year fail to reach developing nations because of multinationals’ tax avoidance, according to a recent report by Christian Aid. That is more than they receive in aid from rich nations. The push on tax reform at the Sydney G20 meeting was firmly backed by Washington and Australia and the United States signed a deal on the eve of the meeting under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act that targets “non-compliant” taxpayers using foreign bank accounts. Tightening the tax rules would prevent so-called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting by multinationals that exploit gaps and mismatches in national tax rules to make profits “disappear” from high tax regimes and shift to low tax locations. “What we are doing is not to say, well, we need to close down Bermuda,” Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD’s Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, told reporters. “There will be a neutralisation of these types of schemes and that is what we are doing and that where we think we can succeed, because if you try to dictate to countries what they have to do domestically, if you try to impede on their sovereignty, you cannot succeed.” French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said he intended to make Europe a leader in such efforts with France ready to sign agreements with Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, within the next few weeks. Divisions remain within the G20 on issues such as whether technology companies should be taxed at the source country, where the customer is and value is created, or at the residence country, where the product originated. But Australia’s Hockey said there was consensus that companies had to pay. The push also has some business support. “The Amazons of the world that operate in other countries don’t pay taxes in Australia and don’t employ people in Australia; those things concern me,” said Richard Goyder, Chief Executive of Australian retail giant Wesfarmers Ltd and president of the B20 Australia forum of business leaders that liaises with the G20. The OECD standard builds on U.S. rules, which ask foreign financial institutions to report on all accounts held by U.S. citizens, or pay a punitive 30 per cent withholding on all U.S. income. Quentin Grafton, a professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra, welcomed the G20 commitment, but warned that achieving a global standard would be difficult given tax havens like Bermuda and Ireland are not part of the grouping. “This is a win-lose proposition, so that makes it a difficult proposition,” he said. “Those countries that will lose out will try and oppose it.” Grafton said the OECD has been trying for more than a decade to bring about tax reform and the next test would come in September when it reports on planned actions.",2232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/g20-australia-tax/rpt-g20-agrees-on-push-to-close-tax-loopholes-make-multinationals-pay-idUSL1N0LS0DF20140223

Keurig Green Mountain shares rose 8 percent on Friday to $114.71 on speculation changes to the agreement will open the door for it to secure licenses with other leading coffee brands with which it does not already have such arrangements. “We think the amended agreement allows Green Mountain to pursue a relationship with Peet’s, the largest unlicensed super-premium not currently on the Keurig system,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan said in a research note.

U.S. dairy prices are at record highs and could move up a bit more in March before easing as a result of increased production, said Jerry Dryer, editor of the Dairy & Food Market Analyst.

General Mills Inc (GIS.N), which sells Yoplait yogurt and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, earlier on Wednesday said that its Yoplait business was the main driver behind an 11 percent decline in its U.S. retail segment operating profit in the latest quarter. Roughly two-thirds of that profit decline was due to dairy inflation and higher merchandising and marketing investments in its domestic yogurt business, Don Mulligan, General Mills’ chief financial officer, said. “We’ve been assuming that it will top off for the last few months and it hasn’t yet,” Mulligan said, referring to dairy prices. Elsewhere, coffee prices recently hit a two-year high due to crop-damaging drought in Brazil, the top producer. “I’m not concerned about where coffee is going,” Schultz said. “I think the market has significantly overreacted to the issue in Brazil and I don’t see coffee prices spiking at very much higher levels than they are today, over the long term.” Schultz said Starbucks has managed through prior commodity cost hikes and “can absolutely do it again.” During the annual meeting, Schultz promised more growth in the years ahead, vowing to turn Starbucks into a “$100 billion company” by an unspecified date in the future.

422,SBUX,Oprah gives Starbucks tea push a celebrity shot with chai drink,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp will add a celebrity blend to its big tea push when it debuts “Oprah Chai,” a tea-based drink created by media mogul Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey and Starbucks’ chief Howard Schultz clinked tea cups on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting as they announced the new brew, which will go on sale at Starbucks and Teavana stores in the United States and Canada on April 29. Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, is looking to tea as a way to keep expanding its sales as competition grows in the coffee market and it continues moving into new global markets. “We are going to elevate the tea experience in the same way we did for coffee,” Schultz said, adding that partnering with Oprah “is a strong next step forward in accomplishing this objective.” Starbucks said Winfrey developed the tea with Teavana’s teaologist Naoko Tsunoda. Winfrey, a tea aficionado, said her taste runs toward the spicy, robust and fuller-bodied. And to that end, “Oprah Chai” is a blend of tea infused with cinnamon, ginger, cardamom and cloves, and will be sold in tins or as prepared tea lattes. For each Teavana “Oprah Chai” product sold, Starbucks will make a donation to the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation to benefit youth education. According to The Tea Association of the USA, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world next to water. While tea is the more popular beverage, coffee is king when it comes to sales. Global coffee retail sales were $75.7 billion in 2012 compared to $40.7 billion for tea, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.

424,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Oprah gives Starbucks tea push a celebrity shot with chai drink,"(Adds Schultz and Winfrey comments, background on Teavana) SEATTLE, March 19 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp will add a celebrity blend to its big tea push when it debuts “Oprah Chai,” a tea-based drink created by media mogul Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey and Starbucks’ chief Howard Schultz clinked tea cups on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting as they announced the new brew, which will go on sale at Starbucks and Teavana stores in the United States and Canada on April 29. Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, is looking to tea as a way to keep expanding its sales as competition grows in the coffee market and it continues moving into new global markets. “We are going to elevate the tea experience in the same way we did for coffee,” Schultz said, adding that partnering with Oprah “is a strong next step forward in accomplishing this objective.” Starbucks said Winfrey developed the tea with Teavana’s teaologist Naoko Tsunoda.

The move by the European Commission came after Luxembourg failed to provide data on its tax rulings in 2011 and 2012, and also details about the 100 largest companies which came under its intellectual property tax regime. “As Luxembourg failed to adequately answer previous requests for information, the Commission has now adopted two information injunctions ordering Luxembourg to deliver the requested information within one month,” the EU executive said. “Should Luxembourg persist in its refusal, the Commission may refer the issue to the EU Court of Justice,” it said. The Commission said it had asked other EU countries for similar information but did not provide details. Last month European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he was examining corporate tax loopholes across Europe to see if they are anti-competitive. There have been growing criticism of schemes used by Starbucks, Apple, Amazon and others operating within the law to minimise their taxes by shifting their profits into tax havens.

427,SBUX,"Starbucks to move European base to London, pay more UK tax","LONDON (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) will move its European headquarters to London from the Netherlands this year and pay more tax in the UK as a result, the company said on Wednesday. The shift by the world’s largest coffee chain comes after its low tax contributions in Britain provoked widespread criticism, including Prime Minister David Cameron telling a meeting in Davos that companies that avoided paying tax needed to “wake up and smell the coffee”. Starbucks was called to testify before a parliamentary hearing about its tax affairs after Reuters reported in 2012 that the company had told the UK tax authority its British arm was a loss-making business while informing investors that the subsidiary was profitable. The company revealed at the hearing that it had agreed a deal with Dutch tax authorities allowing it to pay “a very low tax rate” there. This agreement meant the group was able to reduce its tax liability by having its European subsidiaries pay large royalties to the Dutch unit for using the Starbucks brand. That system - slammed by UK lawmakers in a report in 2012 -will now be abandoned and the European businesses will pay fees to a British subsidiary, the group’s Europe, Middle East and Africa boss said. “This means we will pay more tax in the UK,” Kris Engskov said in a telephone interview. Engskov said the criticism the company faced had not, as some business leaders claimed, made Britain a less attractive place to invest. “The UK is a great place to do business,” he said. Heather Self, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, said the move to London followed a change in UK tax rules aimed at encouraging international companies to locate their headquarters in Britain, whereby UK-registered companies are no longer taxed on income earned outside the country. A Starbucks spokeswoman said the rule change had no impact on the company’s decision. Starbucks also said it would open 100 new stores in the UK, creating 1,000 new jobs, after the relocation this year. Senior executives will transfer to Starbucks’ head office in Chiswick, west London, though manufacturing jobs will remain in the Netherlands. Engskov insisted that Starbucks retained the support of customers in spite of politicians’ calls for boycotts and a preference among many coffee afficionados for trendy, independent stores. “We are as relevant as ever,” he said.

The results from the world’s biggest coffee chain came after McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Dunkin’ Donuts parent Dunkin’ Brands (DNKN.O) and other major U.S. restaurant operators said last quarter’s severe winter storms chilled results. Starbucks executives said the inclement weather also hit its business, but did not quantify the impact. The company’s shares rose 1.9 percent to $72.47 in extended trading. Global sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 6 percent for the second quarter, versus analysts’ average estimate of a 5.4 percent gain, according to Consensus Metrix. That figure included a 6 percent increase for the Americas region that contributes the majority of Starbucks’ revenue. Analysts also expected a 5.4 percent rise from the Americas. Starbucks’ Americas region sales were up 5 percent in the first quarter. Net earnings rose 9.4 percent to $427 million, or 56 cents per share, for the fiscal second quarter ended March 30, in line with analysts’ average estimate complied by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Starbucks raised its fiscal 2014 earnings per share forecast to a range of $2.62 to $2.68, up from a range of $2.59 to $2.67 previously, after first-quarter results beat internal expectations. Looking ahead, the company said it would roll out new Fizzio carbonated drinks this summer in the U.S. Sun Belt, as well as in Singapore, Korea and several cities of China. “I am convinced it will be a big hit with consumers and drive traffic during the key afternoon day part, just as it did in the test markets last summer,” Chief Executive Howard Schultz said on a conference call with analysts. Oprah Chai, Starbucks’ spiced tea partnership with media mogul Oprah Winfrey, goes on sale in the United States and Canada next week.

Accounts for the group’s main UK subsidiary, Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) Ltd, showed turnover fell in the year to the end of September 2013 to 399 million pounds ($670.3 million) from 413 million pounds the previous year. The drop follows 16 years of consistent strong growth and comes despite the business “being supported by an improving economic environment”, the accounts said. Starbucks said the result was not because of weakness in the business but reflected the closure of unprofitable stores. “The UK business is moving in the right direction: gross profit is up 13 percent ...  We are confident this performance will continue as we continue to reduce costs,” a spokesman said, adding that the group plans to open 100 news stores across the country this year. The U.S.-based company triggered a media storm, store pickets and customer boycotts after Reuters reported in October 2012 that it had told the UK tax authority its British arm was a loss-making business while informing investors that the subsidiary was profitable. Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the international political agenda, partly as a result of public anger at Starbucks’ tax affairs. The company was asked to testify to a parliamentary investigation and Prime Minister David Cameron told a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos that companies that avoided paying tax needed to “wake up and smell the coffee”. In response to the criticism, Starbucks agreed to pay 20 million pounds in tax over 2013 and 2014. It has already paid 15 million, the accounts said. The company has said it follows all tax rules. Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) reported a loss for the year to September 2013 of 20 million pounds after deducting inter-company payments such as royalties for the use of the Starbucks brand, which the company agreed in 2012 not to deduct for tax purposes.

The company reported a profit of 86.8 million pesos (US$6.4 million) in the January-March period, compared with a profit of 65.1 million pesos in the same period a year earlier. Alsea said revenue rose 17.5 percent to 3.992 billion pesos.

443,SBUX,Eastern European restaurant group AmRest swings to profit,"WARSAW, May 9 (Reuters) - Restaurant operator AmRest, the eastern European and Russian franchisee for brands including KFC, Burger King, and Starbucks, swung to a first-quarter profit as rising sales and new outlets outweighed the disruption caused by the crisis in Ukraine. Warsaw-listed AmRest, which has 78 restaurants in Russia out of its total of 745, said on Friday it made a quarterly net profit of $2.82 million compared with a loss in the same period last year. It said it was affected by the fall in the Russian rouble this year, as well as more general concerns about the tensions in Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists and western sanctions on Russia. But the impact of that was off-set by higher sales and new restaurants, the company said. It opened 13 new outlets in Russia in the 12 months to March this year. “Russia is one of the largest markets for AmRest. The management of the company monitors developments in this region with close attention and adjusts strategic decisions in order to minimize the currency risk and address potential fluctuations in consumers’ demand,” the firm said. It said first-quarter revenue grew 11 percent year-on-year to 674 million zlotys ($223 million). Net profit was 8.5 million zlotys versus a 9.4 million loss in the first quarter of 2013. The firm said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by almost 40 percent to 72.8 million zlotys. EBITDA in Russia was 9.74 million zlotys, up from 9.49 million zlotys in the same period last year.

The EU is looking at whether the countries’ tax treatment of multinationals, which help to attract investment and jobs that might otherwise go to where the companies’ customers are based, represent unfair state aid. Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the international political agenda in recent years following reports of how companies like Apple and Google use convoluted structures to slash their tax bills.  “In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes,” Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said on Wednesday.   Governments have promised to rewrite the rules that govern international tax, but experts said the European Commission would struggle to challenge deals Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had agreed under existing rules. Apple said on Wednesday it has not received any selective tax treatment from the Irish authorities, while Starbucks said it complied with all tax rules. Fiat declined comment.  The Irish government said it was confident that it has not breached state aid rules and will defend its position vigorously.  Eric Wiebes, the Dutch Secretary of State for Finance said he was confident the investigation would find the country had not broken EU rules. A spokesman for the Luxembourg finance ministry declined comment. Sheila Killian, assistant Dean in the Accounting & Finance department of the University of Limerick, Ireland, said the naming of individual companies represented a more aggressive stance from the Commission. “It’s upping the ante from the EU’s point of view,” she said. The Commission said it was looking at whether the pricing for transactions between company subsidiaries - known as transfer pricing - that were approved by the Irish, Luxembourg and Dutch tax authorities, and which allowed the companies to reduce their tax bills, were selective and thereby represented unfair incentives. While the Commission has often forced countries to change tax rules which it deemed would distort intra-bloc trade, a Commission spokesman was unable to name any successful challenges to a country’s transfer pricing decisions. Killian said existing international tax rules gave companies wide flexibility in choosing transfer prices. “It’s almost impossible to prove that the transfer pricing is any way favourable ... but in launching a high-profile investigation, it puts a spotlight on those companies’ tax affairs, which acts as a deterrent to companies against engaging in aggressive tax planning,” she said. Philip Kermode, Director, Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, speaking to an Irish parliamentary hearing on Wednesday said that in principle the companies could be forced to repay money if they were deemed to have received state aid.

It was more likely, he said, that the Commission would issue an unflattering report which might encourage the three countries to take a stiffer line with multinationals in future. The Commission said it was investigating the tax treatment of Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV, which operates a coffee roasting plant in Amsterdam. The Dutch operation buys raw coffee beans from an affiliate in Switzerland and sells roasted coffee to operating units across Europe. It also receives fees from subsidiaries for the right to use the Starbucks brand.    Starbucks told a UK parliamentary investigation in 2012 that the deal it received in the Netherlands allowed it to enjoy a “very low” tax rate. A U.S. Senate probe last year revealed that Apple had sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profits from tax by using Irish companies that had no tax residence anywhere.    Apple in the United States entered into deals with the Irish subsidiaries whereby the Irish units received the rights to certain intellectual property that were subsequently licensed to other group companies.

The action comes just weeks after J.M. Smucker Co raised list prices of its well-known Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts brands, for the first time since 2011 because of soaring green coffee costs.  Dunkin’ Brand Group Inc also has said it expects “modest increases in coffee prices” at its Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. Starbucks’ more than 7,100 company-owned U.S. stores will raise the price of some drinks by 5 to 20 cents on June 24. For example, the cost of grande (16 oz) and venti (24 oz) brewed coffee will increase 10 to 15 cents in most markets.  The coffee chain characterized the drink price increases as limited, saying they would affect fewer than 20 percent of customers.      The price increase for some drinks, including grande brewed coffees, are the first in almost 4 years. Prices of Starbucks’ most popular drinks, the grande latte, tall (12 oz) brewed coffee and Frappuccino, will not go up in most stores. There also will be no price increases on food at this time, the company said. Separately, the Seattle-based chain is boosting the price of  Starbucks-brand whole bean and ground coffee sold in supermarkets and other stores by an average of 8 percent on July 21.   That means that shoppers likely will see prices go up about $1, to $9.99 for a 12-oz bag and $13.99 for a 20-oz bag. Starbucks had lowered prices on packaged coffee by about 10 percent in April 2013.

452,SBUX,EU closes tax loophole for multinational firms,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union on Friday moved to close a loophole that has allowed multinational companies to reduce their tax bills by exploiting differences in national tax rules, ending months of negotiations and potentially boosting EU states’ tax revenues. Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot issue in industrialised nations. Campaigners have drawn support from public anger at companies avoiding taxes at a time of austerity.  “The aim is to close a loophole that currently allows corporate groups to exploit mismatches between national tax rules so as to avoid paying taxes on some types of profits distributed within the group,” finance ministers said in a statement. The change in the so-called parent-subsidiary directive addresses “hybrid loan arrangements”, a combination of equity and debt often used as a tax-planning tool. Some member states classify profits from such tools as a tax-deductible debt; others do not. That has prompted some multinational companies to open subsidiaries in other member states so they pay little or no tax. “Using an (EU) directive that was based on common sense - avoid double-taxation - a few cunning devils had managed to pay no tax at all,” French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said, welcoming the move. “That will mean a bit more money in state coffers, which as you know we’re quite keen on.” All EU tax law requires unanimity among member states, and getting all states on board has been an uphill struggle. Europe has been torn between the demands of small countries fiercely resisting change to low-tax regimes that attract foreign investment, and others wary of driving away big employers. Earlier this month, the European Commission increased pressure on Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg over their corporate tax practices, saying it would investigate deals they cut with Apple(AAPL.O), Starbucks (SBUX.O) and FiatFIA.MI. Member states will have until the end of 2015 to turn the change into national law. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the EU should go even further and tackle what he said was the growing abuse of patent boxes — countries adopting lower taxation for companies to commercialise their patents and R&D.; Governments which offer them say they encourage innovation and high-value jobs in research and development. Critics see the scheme as government-sanctioned tax avoidance.  “We have to decisively move forward on this in Europe or we will not live up to our own expectations,” he told reporters. In another move towards more cooperation on tax issues, the Swiss government reaffirmed on Friday its willingness to abolish some corporate tax regimes, such as the different treatment of domestic and foreign revenues. Disagreements over corporate taxation have strained relations between the EU and Switzerland for almost a decade. “In return, the EU member states confirm their intention to lift corresponding countermeasures as soon as the regimes in question have been abolished,” it said.

454,SBUX,"CORRECTED-Starbucks to raise prices on some drinks, packaged coffee","(Corrects venti drink size in fourth paragraph to 20 ounces, not 24 ounces) By Lisa Baertlein and Marcy Nicholson June 20 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Friday said it will raise prices on some drinks offered by its U.S. shops and also boost list  prices on its own brand of packaged coffee sold in supermarkets and other retail outlets. The action comes just weeks after J.M. Smucker Co  raised list prices of its well-known Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts brands, for the first time since 2011 because of soaring green coffee costs. Dunkin’ Brand Group Inc also has said it expects “modest increases in coffee prices” at its Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. Starbucks’ more than 7,100 company-owned U.S. stores will raise the price of some drinks by 5 to 20 cents on June 24. For example, the cost of grande (16 oz) and venti (20 oz) brewed coffee will increase 10 to 15 cents in most markets. The coffee chain characterized the drink price increases as limited, saying they would affect fewer than 20 percent of customers. The price increase for some drinks, including grande brewed coffees, are the first in almost 4 years. Prices of Starbucks’ most popular drinks, the grande latte, tall (12 oz) brewed coffee and Frappuccino, will not go up in most stores. There also will be no price increases on food at this time, the company said. Separately, the Seattle-based chain is boosting the price of  Starbucks-brand whole bean and ground coffee sold in supermarkets and other stores by an average of 8 percent on July 21. That means that shoppers likely will see prices go up about $1, to $9.99 for a 12-oz bag and $13.99 for a 20-oz bag. Starbucks had lowered prices on packaged coffee by about 10 percent in April 2013. Prices will not change on K-cups, Starbucks Via instant coffee and Seattle’s Best Coffee. Further, the change does not apply to bags of coffee sold in Starbucks’ stores. Arabica coffee prices on ICE Futures U.S. soared nearly 90 percent between January and April on concern about crop damage in top grower Brazil, where an unprecedented drought in its growing region took place while the beans were developing on the trees. The drought surprised the entire coffee industry and caused speculators to pour into the futures market, lifting the benchmark price to $2.19 per lb by late April, the highest in more than two years. The futures price has since fallen more than 20 percent, to a four-month low at $1.6655 per lb on Thursday, as Brazil’s harvest got under way. Starbucks repeatedly has stated that it bought plenty of coffee when prices were low in 2013, and had secured coffee for the current fiscal year and 40 percent for next fiscal year.

456,SBUX,"Starbucks opens in Colombia, home of Juan Valdez","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp opened its first shop in Colombia on Wednesday, 43 years after the world’s biggest coffee chain first started buying beans from the country famous for its premium arabica coffee named after fictional coffee farmer Juan Valdez. The first of 50 Starbucks stores planned for the coming five years will be in Bogota’s Parque de la 93, one of the city’s most exclusive neighborhoods. This store and all other Starbucks locations in Colombia will be the Seattle-based company’s first to serve only locally sourced coffee. Starbucks is the world’s largest buyer of Colombia high-grade arabica coffee in the world, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz told Reuters in a telephone interview.  Its new stores will compete with the roughly 200-unit Juan Valdez coffee-shop chain owned by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia. In addition, Nestle SA’s Nespresso plans to begin selling home brewers this fall and open a boutique coffee shop in Colombia sometime this year. “We think we can exist in a very complementary way,” said Schultz, noting that his company’s arrival often expands a market and improves business for competitors.   The Colombia business is run by a joint venture between Starbucks and two of its long-time business partners in Latin America, Alsea SAB de CV of Mexico and Grupo Nutresa SA of Colombia. Colombia is the world’s biggest producer of high-quality arabica coffee. The last few years, though, have been rocky.  Heavy rains and a replanting program that took many trees out of production drastically cut Colombia’s coffee crop in 2008. That was followed by four more crop years that were well below average, in part because of an outbreak of a leaf rust disease. As a result, many U.S. dealers were forced to look elsewhere for their high-quality arabica beans, causing Colombia to lose some of its loyal customers. Two years ago, Starbucks opened a Farmer Support Center in Manizales, Colombia. Last summer, the company announced a public-private partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development that is investing $3 million to increase Colombian coffee yields. More than half of the 400 million pounds of coffee purchased by Starbucks last year came from Latin America, where the chain has more than 700 stores.

460,SBUX,"China food scandal spreads, drags in Starbucks, Burger King and McNuggets in Japan","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The latest food scandal in China is spreading fast, dragging in U.S. coffee chain Starbucks, Burger King Worldwide Inc and others, as well as McDonald’s products as far away as Japan. McDonald’s Corp and KFC’s parent Yum Brands Inc apologized to Chinese customers on Monday after it emerged that Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had supplied expired meat to the two chains. On Tuesday, Starbucks said some of its cafes previously sold products containing chicken originally sourced from Shanghai Husi, a firm that was shut down on Sunday by local regulators after a TV report showed staff using expired meat and picking up meat from the floor to add to the mix. A Tokyo-based spokesman at McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. Alternative supplies of chicken have been found in Thailand and China, he added. The company’s shares briefly fell as much as 1.4 percent to a 15-month low before closing down 0.4 percent. China’s food watchdog said it ordered regional offices to carry out spot checks on all firms which had used Shanghai Husi products, and would inspect all of parent OSI’s sites around China to see if enough has been done to ensure food safety. It said the case could be handed over to the police. The regulator’s Shanghai branch said in a statement on Tuesday it had demanded production, quality control and sales records from OSI. It added it already ordered McDonald’s to seal over 4,500 boxes of suspected meat products and Yum’s Pizza Hut to seal over 500 boxes of beef. Fast-food chain Burger King and Dicos, China’s third-ranked fast food chain owned by Ting Hsin International, said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets. Pizza chain Papa John’s International Inc said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier. Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick. Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years, and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards.  China is McDonald’s third-biggest market by number of restaurants and Yum’s top market by revenue. McDonald’s is due to report quarterly earnings later on Tuesday. The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online among the country’s influential ‘netizens’, with some users spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished. The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight early this year after a supplier’s donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011. Starbucks said on its Chinese microblog site that it had no direct business relationship with Shanghai Husi, but that some of its chicken acquired from another supplier had originally come from Husi for its “Chicken Apple Sauce Panini” products. This had been sold in 13 different provinces and major cities. The company added that all the products had already been removed from its shelves. Burger King said in a Weibo statement posted late on Monday that it had taken off its shelves all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi Food and had launched an investigation. Dicos said it pulled all ham products supplied by Shanghai Husi, and would stop serving its ham sandwich product for breakfast. “We will continue to carry out a probe into Shanghai Husi Food and its related firms, to understand whether or not it followed national regulations,” Dicos said in a statement. Swedish furniture firm IKEA [IKEA.UL], which has in-store food outlets, said on Weibo that Shanghai Husi had previously been a supplier, but had not provided the firm with products since September last year. Domino’s Pizza Inc and Doctor’s Associates Inc’s Subway brand, which were named in online reports as being supplied meat from Shanghai Husi, said their outlets in China did not use meat products from the firm.

465,SBUX,Starbucks locks in prices on 60 percent of its coffee for 2015,"July 24 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp, the world’s biggest coffee chain, has locked in coffee prices for 60 percent of its 2015 needs and expects its full coffee costs for the year to be close to 2014 prices, a company executive said on Thursday. “We have about 60 percent of our coffee price locked for next year and those prices are roughly flat to this year, up perhaps a little bit,” said Starbucks Chief Operating Scott Maw, , speaking on a conference call to discuss the company’s third-quarter financial results. “Where we actually end up for the year, we still think it’ll be roughly neutral but will depend how we lock in that last 40 percent.” Coffee futures prices are notorious for their volatility but this year, the benchmark contract on ICE Futures U.S. has been more wild than usual. Starbucks benefited from  a 2-1/2-year downtrend that bottomed out in late 2013. But in late January, an unprecedented drought in top grower Brazil took the entire coffee industry by surprise as the benchmark contract nearly doubled in price within three months to a 26-month high above $2 per lb in April. The contract has since fallen and finished the April-June quarter down about 5 percent. “Next year, we expect commodity cost to be roughly neutral or have a minor unfavorable impact,” Maw said, referring to the company’s fiscal year that begins in October. A July 23 Reuters poll of 26 traders, roasters and analysts forecast the ICE spot arabica futures contract a will end 2014 at $1.80 per lb, up just 1 percent from Thursday’s settlement.

467,SBUX,UPDATE 2-Starbucks sales in Americas region up slightly more than expected,"(Adds details from call, executive comment) July 24 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Thursday said quarterly sales at established stores in its dominant Americas region grew a somewhat stronger-than-expected 6 percent, including a 7 percent rise for the United States that was helped by food sales. The third fiscal quarter report from the world’s biggest coffee chain followed disappointing quarterly results from McDonald’s Corp and Dunkin’ Donuts parent Dunkin’ Brands . But Starbucks’ sales gains did not rival those from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. The burrito chain, which has a lot of customer overlap with Starbucks, on Monday posted an eye-popping 17.3 percent rise in same-restaurant sales and its stock soared to all-time highs. Shares in Starbucks were down 2.4 percent to $78.50 in extended trading following its results. Chipotle and Starbucks are two of the top-performing U.S. restaurant chains and their shares can be punished by investors when results do not far exceed expectations. Seattle-based Starbucks’ net income was $512.6 million, or 67 cents per share, for the fiscal third quarter that ended June 29. That was up from $417.8 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Results from the latest quarter topped analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue grew 11 percent to $4.15 billion, boosted in part by the roll-out of new breakfast sandwiches and pastries from its La Boulange bakery. Analysts, on average, expected Starbucks quarterly same-store sales to rise 5.1 percent globally and for the Americas region, according to Consensus Metrix. Starbucks raised U.S. prices by roughly 1 percent near the end of the quarter, due to higher costs for things like coffee and milk. Few restaurant operators are willing to take that risk given still-weak overall demand. Indeed, high meat prices recently forced McDonald’s to push through some price increases and its traffic has taken a hit. Starbucks said U.S. traffic was up 2 percent in the latest quarter, when customers spent 5 percent more per visit. Troy Alstead, Starbucks’ chief operating officer, told Reuters in an interview that Starbucks had not noticed any customer push-back on its price increase. Chipotle customers shrugged off a price increase in the latest quarter. In fact, more people flocked to the popular chain that sells food made with organic produce and antiobiotic-free meat.

Amazon tumbled 10.7 percent to $320.11 after reporting an unexpectedly big loss for the second quarter, citing greater expenses on investments. With more than 7 million shares traded in the first 45 minutes of action, volume was already above the average for the past 10 days. “Earnings have been the driving force of this market all week. We had a series of good reports but Amazon in particular was a disappointment and has led to some profit taking,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Amazon dragged on the consumer discretionary sector , which lost 0.9 percent. Visa was the largest decliner on the Dow industrials with a 4.5 percent drop to $212.63 after the world’s largest credit and debit card company cut its revenue forecast for the year. The blue-chip index was down 100 points, and Visa - the costliest stock in the price-weighted index - accounted for 66 percent of the drop. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 104.58 points or 0.61 percent, to 16,979.22, the S&P; 500 lost 6.24 points or 0.31 percent, to 1,981.74 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 17.86 points or 0.4 percent, to 4,454.25. Starbucks fell 1.9 percent to $78.94 even as quarterly sales at established stores in its Americas region grew a stronger-than-expected 6 percent. Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than expected in June, supporting expectations of a strong economic rebound in the second quarter. The S&P; 500 closed Thursday at a record high and was within 0.5 percent of hitting 2,000. Pandora Media dropped 13 percent to $24.91 after it forecast adjusted profit below analysts’ estimates for the current quarter.

471,SBUX,Tim Hortons to battle Starbucks; price rises likely,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons, which has offered only one coffee blend in its 50-year history, hopes to lure new coffee drinkers and fend off rivals such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) with the launch throughout North America of its new dark roast blend. Tim Hortons, which announced the move on Thursday, may also increase prices to tackle rising costs and competition from U.S. rivals expanding in Canada. “Looking at the coffee market, I would suggest that, given the degree of cost increases, that we are looking at prices going up sometime in 2015,” Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO chief executive Marc Caira said on Thursday. Tim Hortons, which says it serves nearly 8 out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada, outlined a plan in February to kick-start growth and improve returns by fine-tuning its menu to encourage more spending, improving service and opening new restaurant formats. Last week, the chain reported market-beating quarterly growth that showed its strategy, which includes higher priced and new menu items, is paying off. Still, traffic declined for the ninth consecutive quarter in Canada and is flat in the United States.  Caira expects the new dark brew, which will also be available for home brewing in formats such as Keurig Mountain Inc’s single serve pod, to contribute to results, but he declined to give details. The alternative brew was first sold late last fall in Columbus, Ohio and London, Ontario, and then in the province of Quebec in June. It will be offered at all 4,496 restaurants across Canada and the United States starting Friday. “There’s about 38 to 40 percent of coffee drinkers that are looking for a darker roast,” said Caira. “Those are very intriguing numbers for us ... If we weren’t pleased with the (initial) numbers, we wouldn’t be launching it.” Caira, a former top Nestle SA executive who took over at the Canadian chain a little more than a year ago, plans to tackle inflationary pressure from higher coffee bean prices and labor costs by cutting waste and improving efficiencies. “The last thing that we want to do is arbitrarily increase prices,” said Caira, but he conceded the chain will likely raise prices in 2015. He could not say what products might be affected. Caira said the company was also working with Ottawa to address labor shortages in some parts of Canada following tighter rules on hiring temporary foreign workers in the restaurant industry.  “There must be flexibility in the system to address labor issues in certain parts of the country,” Caira said. He added that in some markets there are not enough people to work in the company’s restaurants. “That is a fact proven out by number,” he said. “In those cases, there’s a need for this program.” ",8142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tim-hortons-ceo/tim-hortons-to-battle-starbucks-price-rises-likely-idUSKBN0GE2FN20140814

475,SBUX,"Starbucks plans new store designs - upscale in Seattle, speedy in New York","Sept 5 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Friday announced two new types of stores aimed at capturing the growing demand for upscale reserve coffee and a separate test of an “express” store in Manhattan offering speedy service in a city where a “New York minute” is more like a nanosecond. The moves from the world’s biggest coffee chain come as it faces growing competition from high-end craft coffee sellers such as Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Blue Bottle Coffee and Intelligentsia, as well as from fast-food chains ranging from McDonald’s to Dunkin Donuts to newcomer Chick-fil-A. Starbucks said it plans to open a “first of its kind” 15,000-square-foot small-batch reserve roastery in the hipster Capitol Hill neighborhood of its Seattle home market in December. The company will consolidate roasting of its reserve offerings, including Geisha and Jamaica Blue Mountain, in the facility, which will house a store, a tasting room and a cafe devoted to its reserve coffees. The new roastery is expected to give Starbucks the potential to expand its reserve lineup from 15 to 30 offerings. Some recent Starbucks reserve coffees sell for $15 to $50 for an 8-ounce package. Starbucks also plans to open at least 100 reserve-only cafes globally over the coming five years. It declined to give more details. “We plan to take this super premium experience to cities around the world,” Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in a statement. Starbucks also plans to test its first “express” store in Manhattan in 2015. The company said the New York store would be small and convenient, with a limited food and beverage menu. It will use digital payment and mobile ordering to speed up service. Starbucks declined to say how many express stores are planned.

478,SBUX,"As music sales fall, sax player Kenny G turns to stockpicking","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kenny G, the best-selling jazz musician who once played at President Bill Clinton’s inaugural ball, wakes up every morning to Starbucks. The saxophonist doesn’t drink coffee. Instead, the man whose real name is Kenny Gorelick obsessively checks the company’s stock price. Gorelick was one of the first investors in the Seattle-based chain. He was introduced to Starbucks chief Howard Schultz through an uncle, before the company went public, and soon bought a stake. Shares are up more than 12,000 percent since beginning public trade.  That success helped spark a stockpicking habit that consumes his attention as his music earning potential is eaten away by digital music, which pays less than physical album sales, and online piracy. These days, Gorelick spends his mornings in front of his computer screen, trading blocs of shares of the approximately 30 companies in his portfolio. Over the last decade, he has earned about as much money from stock trading as from music, he said.  “Most people in the music business don’t make as much money as we used to,” said Gorelick, who topped the contemporary jazz sales charts for several years running in the 1990s and whose 2010 album cracked jazz’s top ten. “You have your 1 percent of Beyonce and U2, who are playing stadiums, who are going to make tons of money. I’m going to put myself in the normal category of a music person who has been successful.” Gorelick, who holds a degree in accounting from the University of Washington, keeps his assets in two main accounts: one for his own trading and one that is overseen by Todd Morgan, a founder of Los Angeles-based firm Bel Air Investment Advisors. Morgan said that it was common for his clients, all of whom must meet the firm’s $20 million minimum in investable assets, to keep a portion of their portfolios for stock trading.  “We encourage them that if they are active traders to open an account away from us. Why get in the middle of it?” Morgan said. Wealthy investors with more than $1 million in their accounts are unusual in their affection for trading individual shares, according to data from E*Trade and other brokers.  Wealthy investors are the most likely to prefer individual shares, with 30 percent or more of portfolios invested in single company positions, according to a study from E*Trade Financial. Smaller accounts, meanwhile, tend to keep roughly 20 percent of total portfolios in individual stocks, a figure that has dropped since 2008 with the rise of index funds and low-cost exchanged traded funds that track the performance of the broad market. Picking stock winners is not easy. Only 30 percent of professional fund managers outperformed the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index over the last decade, according to data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company.  Yet individual shares do have advantages, advisers say, including the ability to defer tax liabilities during an investor’s lifetime and favorable tax treatment for their heirs. Wealthy investors who trade a portion of their own accounts may also be able to increase the diversity of their portfolios. Gorelick has been more fortunate than other musicians when it comes to the income he’s lost to streaming and digital downloads. His 2010 album, “Heart and Soul”, sold nearly 12,000 copies in its first week, with an unusually high 86 percent of sales coming in higher-priced compact discs, according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan, which tracks music purchases. His next solo album is due later this year.  As far as stock performance goes, “I have a good batting average but I’m definitely not perfect,” Gorelick said. He asks people he considers smart about what is happening in their fields. If he comes across a company that looks promising, he watches it for a while, reading coverage of the companies and doing other research, and then might buy on a dip. One of his biggest recent winners was a stake in Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc, one of the world’s largest fertilizer exporters. He heard about the company from a friend in Canada. The friend was a successful stock picker and that “made his advice easy to follow,” Gorelick said. He watched the stock for two months, and bought significantly when it dipped one day to around a split-adjusted $30 per share in 2010. The shares shot up to a split-adjusted $62 per share the following year as the company fought off unsolicited takeover bids. Gorelick sold on the way back down, at $60 and below. “I made a lot of money on that stock,” he said. Nearly the opposite happened with his stake in biotech Dendreon Corp, recommended by a friend. Gorelick began buying shares around $35 in early 2011. Not long afterward, the company announced that sales of its prostate cancer vaccine Provenge were not meeting expectations. Gorelick sold for less than $5 a share. It now trades at less than $2 per share.  “I don’t listen to tips from friends as much anymore,” Gorelick joked. Gorelick still has “a fair amount” of his original shares in Starbucks Corp and watches the stock price every day, he said. Yet he tries to keep himself from getting caught up in every change of the ticker.  “I can get emotional in my music, and try to make more sense when it comes to trading,” he said.

480,SBUX,"Amid coffee rivalry, McDonald's Canada to sell java in grocery stores","TORONTO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is making its McCafe ground coffee available in Canadian grocery stores this month, the fast-food giant said on Tuesday, part of its broader campaign to win market share in a country long dominated by rivals like Tim Hortons Inc and Starbucks Corp. The competition to woo Canadian coffee drinkers has intensified in recent years, while rivals have pushed into McDonald’s territory by expanding their own breakfast and lunch menus in order to attract new customers and drive up spending per visit. “Everybody’s trying to scramble for customers,” the chief executive of McDonald’s Canada, John Betts, told Reuters. Tim Hortons, which claims to brew nearly eight out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada, last month announced a new coffee blend, marking its introduction of a second blend after 50 years in business. Betts says that since taking over operations in Canada in 2008, his focus has helped McDonald’s double its market share in coffee and triple its coffee sales. McDonald’s launched the McCafe brand in Canada in 2011. “You might say it’s the thing that turned our business around here, in Canada,” said Betts. “We’ve had double-digit growth on a compounded basis over the last five years at breakfast time, in terms of traffic and sales. That’s a significant category growth for us.” Betts, who started as a part-time worker at McDonald’s 44 years ago, said in his six years in Canada, McDonald’s has grown its share of the coffee market while opening only a handful more restaurants, compared with the hundreds opened by competitors. But with 78 percent of coffee drinking done at home, according to the Canadian Coffee Association, there’s a bigger market that McDonald’s wants to tap into. McDonald’s Canada is partnering with Kraft Canada to sell its bagged medium roast ground coffee, as well the single-serve formats for Tassimo and Keurig in grocery stores. The world’s largest fast-food chain began testing McCafe grocery sales in the United States last year and will launch nationwide in the United States in early 2015.  The push into grocery stores comes as sales at established restaurants at McDonald’s globally have declined. The company has been grappling with internal missteps, brutal competition and shifting consumer preferences.  But Betts said Canada is one of McDonald’s top-performing markets, and it is still seeing “significant positive momentum” in growth, though he declined to provide data. In Canada, McDonald’s restaurants have had to address tougher government restrictions on bringing in temporary foreign workers following an outcry over perceived abuses of the system. Betts said McDonald’s was working with franchisees to adapt to changes, though he said that there were labor challenges in parts of the country.

484,SBUX,Starbucks buying full control of Japan unit for $914 million,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) on Tuesday said it plans to buy the remaining 60.5 percent share of Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd 2712.T that it does not already own in a two-step deal valued at about $913.5 million. Starbucks Japan has operated as a joint venture between Starbucks and its partner Sazaby League since 1995. Over the summer, Sazaby approached the world’s biggest coffee chain about selling its ownership stake in Starbucks Japan, Starbucks said in a statement. There are roughly 1,050 Starbucks cafes in Japan, which Starbucks said will be its second-largest market in terms of revenue from its coffee shops. Despite Japan’s economic difficulties, those shops have profit margins that are among the highest in the world, Starbucks executives said on a conference call with analysts.

489,SBUX,Mexico's Alsea posts flat third-quarter profit,"MEXICO CITY, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Mexican restaurant operator Alsea, which runs Starbucks, Domino’s Pizza and Burger King franchises, on Wednesday said its third-quarter profit was flat compared to a year ago as new acquisitions were offset by higher interest payments. The company reported a profit of 185 million pesos ($13.782 million) in the July-September period, compared with a profit of 184 million pesos in the same period a year earlier. Alsea said revenue rose 39.7 percent to 5.701 billion pesos, principally because of the inclusion in its results of the purchase in May of Vips chain. Sales at stores open more than a year increased 2 percent. The company said that the cost of financing increased to 91 million pesos, from 38 million pesos in the third quarter last year, while operating expenses rose because Alsea opened new stores across Latin America. The company announced in August the acquisition of a 71.76 percent stake in Spanish firm Grupo Zena, which operates more than 400 restaurants in Spain, in a 107 million euro deal. Alsea shares closed down 0.02 percent at 40.40 pesos on Monday before the company reported its results.      ($1 = 13.4235 Mexican pesos at end-Sept.)

490,SBUX,Starbucks Americas sales disappoint on softer traffic,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) early re-launch of its popular Pumpkin Spice latte drink failed to heat up business at its U.S. cafes, disappointing Wall Street and sending the company’s shares down almost 5 percent. The world’s biggest coffee chain said a 1 percent increase in traffic contributed to a 5 percent gain in sales for Americas-region cafes open at least 13 months.  But that result fell short of the 6.2 percent same-store sales gain expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. The U.S.-dominated Americas region contributes the majority of Starbucks revenue. Sales for the region rose 6 percent for the third quarter, bolstered by a 2 percent increase in traffic. “We grew traffic, but it was at a bit of slower clip,” Troy Alstead, Starbucks’ chief operating officer, told Reuters. Free coffee giveaways and other battles for breakfast customers were not to blame for Starbucks’ traffic deceleration, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said on a call with analysts. “This is not a Starbucks issue. There is nothing external in terms of competitive issues,” said Schultz, who added that the rise of online and mobile shopping has resulted in fewer people visiting shopping malls and other retail areas during the  winter holiday season and the weeks leading up to it. The report from the world’s biggest coffee chain came on the heels of disappointing news from breakfast rivals McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Dunkin’ Donuts parent Dunkin’ Brands (DNKN.O).  While Starbucks reported stronger same-store sales than those chains, its growth paled in comparison to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc’s (CMG.N) outsized 19.8 percent jump in same-restaurant sales for the latest quarter.  The Seattle-based company’s net income was $587.9 million, or 77 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Sept. 28. That compared with a loss of $1.23 billion, or $1.64 per share in the year ago quarter, when it booked a large charge related to ending its grocery coffee distribution deal with Kraft.     Starbucks also forecast fiscal 2015 revenue growth of 16 to 18 percent, including more than $1 billion in incremental revenue from the planned acquisition of Starbucks Japan. It now expects earnings excluding items in the range of $3.08 to $3.13. The company previously forecast earnings growth at the low end of a range of 15 to 20 percent. The new forecast falls in the middle of that range, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw told Reuters. This holiday season, the company is giving away 13 “Starbucks for Life” passes to North American users of its Starbucks loyalty card or mobile pay service.

493,SBUX,Starbucks sees no coffee shortages despite Brazil's drought,"NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp, the world’s biggest coffee chain, sees no supply shortages in beans, even as drought and disease hinder crops in Latin America and prices remain near 2012 highs. Starbucks still needs to buy one-third of its coffee needs for 2015, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw told analysts on a conference call about fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 earnings. “We see nothing in current supply dynamics that indicates a fundamental market shortage, including origin-related concerns in Brazil,” Maw said. An unprecedented drought early this year reduced the current 2014/15 crop in the world’s biggest coffee producer Brazil. This situation made arabica coffee trading wildly volatile on ICE Futures U.S., with the price nearly doubling within three months to a 26-month peak in April. Continued dryness there during the following flowering season for the next crop sent prices soaring again in September to $2.2550 per lb, the highest since January 2012. The drought caused the International Coffee Organization to forecast in September that global coffee production will fall short of demand, with an arabica coffee deficit around 4 to 5 million 60-kg bags. “We have largely stayed out of the market this year when the coffee prices have spiked, and we will continue to be patient as we lock in the final one-third of our needs in 2015,” Maw said. Coffee represents roughly 10 percent of Starbucks’ total costs. “We do not expect coffee prices to impact our current EPS (earnings per share) target for 2015,” Maw said.

497,SBUX,EU says Starbucks' 'very low' Dutch tax deal may be illegal,"BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - A tax deal the Netherlands cut with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) may be illegal state aid, European Union regulators said on Friday, part of a crackdown on members attracting investment by helping companies to avoid tax. Luxembourg, Ireland, Malta, Belgium, Cyprus and Gibraltar are also facing scrutiny over tax deals they have struck with multinational companies. The inquiries have overshadowed the early days of the new European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg for more than two decades, and intensified calls among lawmakers and EU countries for a more harmonised tax system in the 28-country bloc. The European Commission said it suspects the Dutch tax ruling allows Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, to lower its taxable profit, and thereby its tax bill, in a way that is at odds with accepted accounting rules. “The Commission’s preliminary view is that the advanced pricing arrangements in favour of Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV constitutes state aid,” the EU executive said. Deputy Finance Minister Eric Wiebes said that the Starbucks deal “is fully in line with international transfer pricing standards, is consistent with the policy framework applied by the government in its efforts to create an attractive business climate”.   Starbucks said it was confident EU regulators would  conclude that it had not received a selective advantage. The Commission said the Dutch tax authority had allowed a Starbucks subsidiary called Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV to declare a taxable profit equal to a percentage of its costs, but also allowed the company to exclude most of its costs when making the calculation.  This was partly achieved by excluding the cost of coffee beans. The Dutch justified this, saying the beans remained the property of another Starbucks subsidiary.  However, the Commission noted the beans appeared on Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA’s balance sheet.  In 2012, the company’s Chief Financial Officer told a UK parliamentary hearing that the Dutch tax deals were “an attractive reason” to be based in Amsterdam. “It is a very low tax rate.... they do offer very competitive tax rulings,” Troy Alstead said. If the EU investigation finds Starbucks did receive an unfair advantage, the company could be forced to repay unpaid tax but the amounts are unlikely to be large.  The tax saving achieved by excluding costs from Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA’s cost base in the years examined, was under 20 million euros, according to Reuters calculations. The probe is one of four into so-called sweetheart deals which the Commission said may give the companies an unfair advantage. The other three firms are online retailer Amazon (AMZN.O), Italian carmaker Fiat (FCHA.MI) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O).

The comments by the European Commission came five months after it opened an in-depth investigation into the case involving the company’s Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV. “The Commission’s preliminary view is that the Advanced Pricing Arrangements in favour of Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV constitutes State aid... The Commission has doubts about the compatibility of such aid with the internal market,” the EU executive said. The probe is one of four into so-called sweetheart deals which the Commission said may give the companies an unfair advantage. The other three firms are online retailer Amazon , Italian carmaker Fiat and iPhone maker Apple . In addition to the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, Malta, Belgium, Cyprus and Gibraltar are also in the regulatory sight over tax deals which substantially lower some firms’ tax bills. Regulators said this favourable treatment could breach EU state aid rules.

503,SBUX,Starbucks says wrongly accused of fighting Vermont GMO labeling law,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp said on Monday it has been wrongly accused in online petitions of supporting a Grocery Manufacturers Association lawsuit to block Vermont’s GMO labeling law. Petitions posted to websites such as Sumofus.org and Care2.com accused Starbucks of teaming with fellow GMA member Monsanto Co to kill GMO labeling in Vermont, which in May became the first U.S. state to pass a mandatory GMO labeling law that did not require another state to go first. “Starbucks is not part of any litigation pertaining to GMO labeling. ... We don’t support the lawsuit,” Starbucks said in a statement.  “Neither Starbucks nor Monsanto is participating in our lawsuit to overturn Vermont’s GMO labeling law,” GMA spokesman Brian Kennedy said in an email to Reuters. Internal GMA documents filed last year as part of a lawsuit  in Washington State revealed members contribute to a “Defense of Brands Strategic Account” designed “to help the industry fund programs to address the threats from motivated and well financed activists” and to “shield individual companies from criticism for funding of specific efforts.” Kennedy, the GMA spokesman, did not respond to questions related to that account.  Petition backers on Monday were more than halfway to their goal of collecting some 500,000 online signatures. Supporters include singer-songwriter Neil Young, who vowed on his website to boycott Starbucks over the GMO issue. The petitions also call on Starbucks to cut ties with GMA and to switch to GMO-free organic milk. Starbucks said its continued membership in the GMA gives it a voice in industry debates. The chain also said limited supplies prevent it from changing to organic milk. The GMA, along with members such as Monsanto, PepsiCo Inc and Kellogg Co, has spent millions of dollars to  defeat GMO-labeling ballot measures in Oregon, Colorado, Washington and California. While proponents and critics debate the safety, environmental impacts and effectiveness of genetically engineered crops, some major companies are shunning GMOs.

505,SBUX,"Starbucks scoops up coffee beans from China for blends, Asia sales","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has this year bought coffee beans from China at its highest volume ever, shipping data show, reflecting the country’s burgeoning role as bean supplier amid supply concerns among traditional exporters. The world’s biggest coffee chain imported nearly 14,000 bags of arabica beans from China into the United States in the first nine months of 2014, more than five times last year’s total, according to data from shipping intelligence firm PIERS, which aggregates cargo manifest details from customs data. That is a fraction of total coffee imports by Starbucks - also the leading overall importer - from across the globe in the January-September period, but the company’s purchases represent more than half of China’s coffee imports in the United States. The jump this year from less than 2,600 60-kg bags in 2013 partly reflects growth in Starbucks’ nascent retail business in China, where a growing urban population is drinking more coffee. Some of the beans are roasted in the United States and then shipped back to China for sale in the fledging consumer market, a spokeswoman said in an email. The rest are included in blends available globally, she said. Starbucks two years ago launched its first operation in Yunnan, China’s main coffee-growing province, but does not have a roasting facility in Asia, she said. Nestle SA has been active in the region for decades. News last month that Volcafe, the coffee arm of London-based commodities trader ED&F; Man, will set up shop in Yunnan was the strongest sign yet that merchants are taking China seriously as a supplier of high-quality arabica beans on the global market. Yunnan’s catimor beans, a hybrid of arabica and lower-quality robusta, have in the United States and Europe mainly been mixed into commercial-grade blends, importers said. Another big buyer has been Miami-based family-owned trader Coex, which the data show has purchased between 2,000 and 7,000 bags each year since 2011. CEO Ernesto Alvarez said China is not a reliable high-volume supplier, but that its beans are an option when they are available. Yunnan is unlikely to catch up with output in top grower Brazil’s Minas Gerais state anytime soon, but the inflow comes as some roasters look for alternative supplies as drought and disease threaten output in Brazil and Central America. China’s coffees have also begun to catch the eye of the U.S. specialty market. “Given what’s going on in Central America with leaf rust and the drought in Brazil, you want to look at other options,” said Craig Holt, owner of Seattle-based Atlas Coffee Importers, which caters toward specialty U.S. roasters. Holt has never purchased Chinese coffee before, but plans to travel to the country’s Yunnan province in December after sampling a coffee that he described as clean, bright and free of defects. In 2014, the United States is on track to import almost 75,000 60-kg bags from China, more than 2013 and up from an average of 5,700 bags a decade ago, according to U.S. International Trade Commission data.

The man, who has not been identified, robbed a GameStop store of several Xbox One and PlayStation 4 video game consoles at gunpoint, according to police.  There were 10 people in the Starbucks in Bellaire, a suburb just outside of Houston. One customer suffered minor injuries, police added.  Officials for Starbucks said the injured customer was treated and the store will remain closed until the building has been inspected for safety. “A man was sitting inside at a small table by the windows of that outer wall where the car struck and he managed to escape with minor abrasions from flying glass and debris,” said John Cannon, a Houston police spokesman. Police said a patrol car pursued the suspect’s vehicle after he was seen leaving the GameStop in Houston with several Xbox systems in his arms. Houston police believe the man was responsible for a dozen robberies involving cell phone and video game stores.  Photographs from local news outlets show extensive damage to the building and debris scattered around the vehicle.  ",12032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-texas-starbucks/suspected-texas-robber-killed-after-getaway-car-slams-into-starbucks-idUSKCN0JH02G20141203

511,SBUX,Starbucks debuts high-end Reserve roastery and cafe in Seattle,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz, who introduced Americans to espressos, Frappuccinos and pumpkin spice lattes, is not about to let a bunch of well-funded independent coffee sellers beat his global chain at the super premium game.   Speaking at preview events ahead of Friday’s public debut of the company’s 15,000-square-foot reserve coffee roastery and tasting room in Seattle, Schultz vowed to stay one step ahead of  rivals, which include “third-wave” coffee chains such as Blue Bottle, Intelligentsia and Stumptown.     “We are never going to allow any coffee company, domestically or around the world, to put us in a subordinate position in terms of quality and access to the highest grade arabica coffee,” Schultz said. Starbucks’ industrial-chic Reserve facility turns out small batches of Peaberry Sumatra and other limited-supply Starbucks Reserve coffees that sell for anywhere from $13 to $50 per 8-ounce package. Some of those beans will be brewed and sold alongside food prepared by James Beard Award-winning chef Tom Douglas, while others will be packaged for sale in more than 1,500 existing Starbucks shops around the globe.  Schultz plans to open a second “Star R” branded Reserve roastery and tasting room in Asia in 2016. He also promises to add 100 reserve-only coffee shops in the coming years. “This is an opportunity for us to educate our core customer and new customers about the exotic nature of these rare, small-lot coffees,” said Schultz, who added that he was inspired by fictional chocolate factory owner Willy Wonka to “take people on a magical coffee ride.” The CEO says he does not track the moves of his small rivals, which have been reaping millions of dollars in venture funding from high-profile investors such as Google Ventures, TSG Consumer Partners and Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter Inc and Square. Those purveyors have won over the likes of Los Angeles-based  photographer Jesse DeFlorio, 26, who frequently buys chestnut praline lattes and other flavored coffee drinks at Starbucks.

513,SBUX,Fitch: Starbucks' 5-Yr Growth Plan Could Yield $7B Plus Total FCF,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 08 (Fitch) According to Fitch Ratings, Starbucks Corporation's  (Starbucks: Fitch IDRs 'A-/F2') five-year plan to accelerate profitable growth  is more than achievable. Based on Fitch's preliminary estimates, which  conservatively assume annual capex of roughly 7% of revenue and the maintenance  of Starbucks' 35%-45% dividend payout target, cumulative free cash flow (FCF)  could exceed $7 billion over the next five years.    On Dec. 4, Starbucks detailed a well-articulated plan to increase annual revenue  to nearly $30 billion from $16.4 billion by the end of fiscal 2019. The company  also outlined a strategy to grow cost of goods sold and G&A; expense at a slower  rate than revenue. The run-rate of cost of goods sold is expected to be reduced  by a cumulative $1 billion over the next four years due to efforts around supply  chain, sourcing, waste, product mix, and other items.   Fitch expects revenue growth to continue to benefit from favorable global coffee  consumption trends and further strengthening of the Starbucks' brand while being  driven by the company's multiple sales platforms. Starbucks is experiencing  system-wide net new unit growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range, further  expanding into food across the lunch and evening day parts, growing in consumer  packaged goods, and launching mobile order-and-pay nationally in 2015. The  launch of the Starbucks Reserve super-premium brand and the company's ahead of  the curve progress in digital are examples of how it is protecting its strong  brand equity. Meanwhile, the acquisition of the remaining 60.5% share of Starbucks Coffee  Japan, Ltd will add just over $1 billion of annualized revenue. Annual revenue  growth of at least 10% due to mid-single-digit same-store sales and global new  unit development along with the addition of supply chain savings, reduced  overhead, and working capital efficiency should result in double-digit operating  income growth, margin expansion and improved operating cash flow.   Fitch views Starbucks' strategy favorably but believes some operating risks  exist, including increased competition in global coffee and service-related  challenges caused by advance mobile ordering and continued expansion in food.  Credit risk, however, continues to be minimal due to the company's strong 'A-'  credit profile and balanced financial strategy.  Ratings reflect Starbucks' low-risk financial structure, ample liquidity,  improving profitability, significant scale, market leadership, and strong brand  equity. At Sept. 28, 2014, Starbucks had 21,366 stores globally and, as part of  its five-year plan is targeting more than 30,000 by the end of fiscal 2019. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 28, 2014, total adjusted  debt-to-operating EBITAR (rent-adjusted leverage) was 2.1x and operating  EBITDAR-to-gross interest expense plus gross rents was 4.5x. Excluding the $2.8  billion one-time fiscal 2013 charge and corresponding fiscal 2014 payment  related to the Kraft Foods Group, Inc. arbitration matter, operating income  increased 25% to $3.1 billion and FCF totaled $1.4 billion.  Fitch expects rent-adjusted leverage to remain in the low 2.0x range in the near  term. However, total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR remained near or below  2.0x due to above-average same-store sales trends and cash flow growth, and  continued strong FCF generation would warrant a positive rating action.  Fitch currently rates Starbucks as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Bank Credit facility 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Starbucks had approximately $2 billion of total  debt at Sept. 28, 2014.

519,SBUX,Starbucks' COO Alstead taking 'extended unpaid leave',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Thursday said Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead, who as finance chief helped lead the coffee chain’s extensive restructuring a few years ago, is taking an extended unpaid leave to spend more time with his family. The announcement comes amid concerns on Wall Street that Starbucks later this month could report disappointing results from the holiday quarter, traditionally its biggest for sales.     In October, Starbucks said the early re-launch of its popular Pumpkin Spice Latte seasonal drink failed to heat up business at its U.S. cafes in the quarter that ended Sept. 28. Last month, Starbucks announced it would add beer and wine, lunch and evening food selections and roll out mobile ordering in a bid to jolt U.S. traffic.  “My expectation is that the company will miss the (fiscal first) quarter, which will be the second quarter in a row, and Troy is taking the heat for that,” said Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney, who is bearish on Starbucks. Penney said traffic to Starbucks cafes has decelerated as the chain’s food menu has expanded. McDonald’s Corp, which has not posted growth in sales at established U.S. restaurants since October 2013, also is struggling with bloated menus, he said.  “I want to be clear that Troy’s decision to take his Coffee Break/Sabbatical and suggestions that his departure is somehow linked to his health or our financial performance last quarter are false, off-base and irresponsible,” CEO Howard Schultz wrote in a memo to employees that was seen by Reuters. Alstead has been with Starbucks for 23 years, the company said, and his last day in his current role will be March 1. “The next year is for my wife and children, to give them my dedicated time and attention,” Alstead said in an employee memo that was obtained by Reuters.

The world’s biggest coffee chain also announced that director Kevin Johnson would become Starbucks president and chief operating officer, effective March 1, replacing long-time executive Troy Alstead, who said he is taking an extended sabbatical to spend time with his family.  Starbucks shares jumped $3.36, or 4.1 percent, to $86.10 in extended trade. Sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 5 percent for the U.S.-dominated Americas region in the first quarter that ended Dec. 28. Traffic was up 2 percent, an acceleration from the 1 percent gain posted in the previous quarter. Starbucks’ Americas region contributes the majority of company revenue. Customer visits to Starbucks’ Americas-region cafes had cooled for five straight quarters, causing some investors and analysts to worry that the company’s increased focus on food had slowed service. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said traffic increased steadily over the quarter, which is Starbucks’ most important for sales. Starbucks had 9 million more customer transactions in the United States during the quarter, versus the year earlier. Among other things, executives attributed the rise to the popularity of Starbucks new Chestnut Praline Latte, Teavana teas and the addition of new loyalty card members.   Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters that Johnson’s appointment was about adding depth to the company’s management bench, not succession. “I’ve never been more committed,” he said. “I’m all in.”   Schultz said he had been speaking with Johnson, who had offered the company particularly helpful advice on its digital and mobile efforts, about taking a job with Starbucks for about a year.

524,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Starbucks price set for 94 pct of 2015 coffee supply -CFO,"(Adds market background) NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has fixed the price it will pay for most of its coffee beans this year after going on a buying spree late last year when prices were under pressure, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said on Thursday. The move reflects a strategy by major coffee buyers to protect against potential spikes in arabica coffee prices amid concerns over prolonged dry weather in top grower Brazil and the impact of leaf disease in Central America. Maw said Starbucks has now fixed prices on 94 percent of its coffee needs for 2015 after buying a “significant” amount of coffee in the last six weeks of 2014. The company said in October it had covered two-thirds of its bean needs for 2015. The purchases came as the price for front-month arabica coffee on ICE Futures U.S. fell as low as $1.64 a lb on Dec. 31 from more than $1.90 a lb in late November. Maw said that, over the last year, Starbucks has tended not to buy coffee when the price exceeded $1.90 a lb. He has not seen any indication that bean supplies have been disrupted, but opportunity buying under $1.90 might indicate the world’s roasters are preparing for a sustained period of high prices. That level is well off the 2-1/2-year highs above $2.20 seen in October last year, but is still well above historic averages. “We don’t see or hear anything that indicates a slowdown in supply,” Maw said. “Everything indicates that the coffee market is still healthy in origin.”    (Reporting By Lisa Baertlein; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Andre Grenon)",1222015,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-coffee/update-1-starbucks-price-set-for-94-pct-of-2015-coffee-supply-cfo-idUSL1N0V136T20150122

The ECB will buy 60 billion euros worth of assets per month, more than markets had been hoping for, in a program that will last through September 2016. The choppiness seen early during the Wall Street session was due to some lingering questions about the effect of the announced measures on U.S. markets, said David Lebovitz, Global Market Strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. But as investors digested the details of the program it became more clear that the ECB was accomplishing exactly what it intended to. “This is really the bazooka people had been looking for in the past years,” Lebovitz said. He said the sectors most likely to gain from the ECB move would be “anything that benefits from a stronger European economy,” with bank and other cyclical stocks leading. Banks led gains on Thursday with the S&P; 500 financials  up 2.45 percent. Wells Fargo and Bank of America rose 3.2 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 259.7 points, or 1.48 percent, to 17,813.98, the S&P; 500 gained 31.03 points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,063.15 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 82.98 points, or 1.78 percent, to 4,750.40. Shares in Europe jumped 1.6 percent to close at a seven-year high. After the closing bell, Starbucks shares rose 3.2 percent to $85.41 after sales at established restaurants in its Americas region were slightly stronger than analysts’ estimate. American Express was the largest points weight on the S&P; 500, down 3.8 percent to $84.37, a day after it said it would cut more than 4,000 jobs this year as expenses and provisions for bad loans rose. F5 Networks Inc slumped 10 percent to $113.40. The network equipment maker’s revenue missed expectations for the first time in eight quarters. It also forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below estimates. Avon Products shares jumped as much as 20.1 percent after Dealreporter said the company was in talks with private equity firm TPG Capital about a potential transaction, citing three industry sources. Avon shares closed up 14.6 percent at $8.66. Volume was slightly above the norm with about 7.7 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 7.27 billion so far this month.

Sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 5 percent for the U.S.-dominated Americas region in the fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 28. Traffic was up 2 percent, an acceleration from the 1 percent gain posted in the previous quarter. Starbucks’ Americas region contributes the majority of company revenue. Customer visits to Starbucks’ Americas-region cafes had cooled for five straight quarters, causing some investors and analysts to worry that the company’s increased focus on food had slowed service. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw told Reuters that traffic increased steadily over the holiday quarter, which is Starbucks’ most important for sales. The world’s biggest coffee chain reported quarterly net income of $983.1 million, or $1.30 per share, up from $540.7 million, or 71 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding items related to its acquisition of Starbucks Japan, Starbucks earned 80 cents per share in the latest quarter. The Seattle-based company reiterated its fiscal 2015 revenue growth forecast of 16 percent to 18 percent. It also set its forecast for full-year earnings, excluding items, at $3.09 to $3.13 per share. Shares in Starbucks jumped $2.65, or 3.2 percent, to $85.39 in extended trading.

The ECB will buy 60 billion euros worth of assets per month, more than markets had been hoping for, in a program that will last through September 2016. The choppiness seen early during the Wall Street session was due to some lingering questions about the effect of the announced measures on U.S. markets, said David Lebovitz, Global Market Strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. But as investors digested the details of the program it became more clear that the ECB was accomplishing exactly what it intended to. “This is really the bazooka people had been looking for in the past years,” Lebovitz said. He said the sectors most likely to gain from the ECB move would be “anything that benefits from a stronger European economy,” with bank and other cyclical stocks leading. Banks led gains on Thursday with the S&P; 500 financials  up 2.45 percent. Wells Fargo and Bank of America rose 3.2 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 259.7 points, or 1.48 percent, to 17,813.98, the S&P; 500 gained 31.03 points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,063.15 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 82.98 points, or 1.78 percent, to 4,750.40. Shares in Europe jumped 1.6 percent to close at a seven-year high. After the closing bell, Starbucks shares rose 3.2 percent to $85.41 after sales at established restaurants in its Americas region were slightly stronger than analysts’ estimate. American Express was the largest points weight on the S&P; 500, down 3.8 percent to $84.37, a day after it said it would cut more than 4,000 jobs this year as expenses and provisions for bad loans rose. F5 Networks Inc slumped 10 percent to $113.40. The network equipment maker’s revenue missed expectations for the first time in eight quarters. It also forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below estimates. Avon Products shares jumped as much as 20.1 percent after Dealreporter said the company was in talks with private equity firm TPG Capital about a potential transaction, citing three industry sources. Avon shares closed up 14.6 percent at $8.66. Volume was slightly above the norm with about 7.7 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 7.27 billion so far this month. NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,428 to 651, for a 3.73-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 2,015 issues rose and 746 fell, for a 2.70-to-1 ratio.

Materials shares weighed on the S&P; 500, falling 1.3 percent in afternoon trading. Goldman cut its price target on Freeport McMoRan by 42 percent to $18 and cut prices on other miners, and separately slashed forecasts on commodity prices including aluminum, copper and nickel. UPS was the largest drag on the S&P; 500, followed closely by Exxon Mobil. On Friday Credit Suisse cut Exxon to “underperform.” A jump in Starbucks shares on the back of strong quarterly earnings results helped partly offset losses. Declines were capped, moreover, by bullish investor sentiment after Thursday’s move from the European Central Bank, which detailed a bigger-than-expected bond-buying program to lift the region’s sagging economy and fight deflation.

UPS gave a fourth-quarter earnings outlook that was below expectations, citing a disappointing performance in U.S. domestic ground shipments. Shares slumped 9.6 percent to $103.30.

Starbucks rose 6.3 percent to $87.98 a day after the coffee chain reported same-store sales growth that was better than expected in its Americas region. GoPro shares jumped 7.2 percent to $51.85 after a partnership with the U.S. National Hockey League paved the way for players to wear GoPro cameras during league games.

538,SBUX,Starbucks' U.S. shops turn to coconuts as non-dairy demand soars,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Wednesday that its 12,123 U.S. shops would begin offering coconut milk on Feb. 17, as it seeks to keep pace with soaring demand for non-dairy and non-soy milk alternatives.   Starbucks began offering soy milk in 1997. Consumer tastes have since evolved, driving strong demand for other non-dairy  alternatives made from products such as coconuts, hemp, rice, almonds and other nuts.  The move from the world’s biggest coffee chain also comes as smaller rivals such as Peet’s Coffee and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf also offer non-soy dairy milk alternatives.    Starbucks declined to name its coconut milk supplier.  As it does with soy milk, Starbucks will add a 60 cent charge to drinks made with coconut milk. U.S. retail sales of non-dairy, non-soy milk alternatives are expected to nearly double to almost $2.4 billion by 2019, according to research firm Euromonitor International. Those gains appear to be coming at the expense of cow and soy milk.  Euromonitor expects U.S. dairy milk sales, which were $14.7 billion in 2014, to fall about 11 percent to around $13.2 billion by 2019.   Soy milk sales, which hit $577 million last year, are expected to drop 30 percent from that level in 2019, according to Euromonitor.

544,SBUX,Starbucks brews backlash with debate on U.S. race relations,"LOS ANGELES/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Howard Schultz has deftly navigated thorny issues such as gay marriage, gun control and Congressional gridlock, but his move to weigh in on U.S. race relations has brewed up a social media backlash. The world’s biggest coffee chain kicked off the discussion when it published full-page ads in major U.S. newspapers earlier this week with the words “Shall We Overcome?” at center page and “RaceTogether” and the Starbucks logo near the bottom.  Employees behind the counter were also given the option of writing “Race Together” on customers’ coffee cups to help initiate dialog amid simmering racial tensions in the United States.  The issue flared following the August shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old male by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, and reignited with the subsequent police-involved deaths of other unarmed black men in New York City, Madison, Wisconsin, and elsewhere.  The campaign, however, has been met with snark and skepticism on social media, with many complaining the company was overstepping it boundaries with a campaign on sensitive cultural topics that had no place in the coffee shop’s lines.     “Our intent is to try to elevate the national conversation,” Schultz told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in Seattle on Wednesday. “Because we’re willing to jump into the deep end of the pool ... I think others will follow us.”    While some customers, and shareholders, appreciated the effort of a large company to engage on ground-level social issues, they questioned how workers such as baristas, many of them young adults who are not trained to navigate such difficult conversations, would manage. “Not sure what @Starbucks was thinking. I don’t have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train. #RaceTogether,” April Reign, a 44-year-old media consultant from Washington, D.C., wrote on Twitter under the name @ReignOfApril. “I will be wary of these conversations and would prefer that Starbucks not continue the program or revamp it significantly,” she said.   Other users pointed out that photos for the campaign only featured white baristas holding cups bearing the hand-written  “Race Together” message. Some came up with satirical names under the hashtag #NewStarbucksDrinks, such as “iced white privilege mocha” and “by any beans necessary”. Starbucks Senior Vice President of Global Communications Corey duBrowa said in a post on Medium.com that he temporarily deactivated his Twitter account earlier this week because he “felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity” in response to the campaign.    Former NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar praised Schultz and the campaign in a Time.com column: “I’m in awe that he’s willing to endure the snarky ridicule and lame coffee jokes from pundits as well as the inevitable death threats from clueless trolls.” Still, Abdul-Jabbar, a Hall of Fame player who has been outspoken on racial issues for decades, questioned the execution of the plan: “He’s picked the wrong venue with the wrong audience using the wrong spokespersons.” Schultz said that the company would move forward with its plans despite the reaction.  An eight-page insert in the USA Today newspaper on Friday will ask readers questions to start conversations on race, such as how many friends of a different race they have? Starbucks did not say whether this was a one-time event.  “We knew this wouldn’t be easy, but we feel it is well worth the discomfort,” the company said in a statement. Shareholder Evie Scribner, a Seattle-area retiree who turns 75 this month, said at the annual meeting that the campaign forced her to rethink her views.   “I thought I was doing well, but maybe I’m not, I think I can do better.

The new efforts, announced at Starbucks’ annual meeting on Wednesday, come as U.S. restaurant chains ranging from McDonald’s Corp to Panera Bread Co turn to technology to increase sales, speed up service and connect with young, tech-savvy consumers.  Tenants in Manhattan’s Empire State Building will be the first to be offered Starbucks’ new “green apron” delivery service later this year.  The coffee chain will also partner with delivery service Postmates Inc in its hometown of Seattle, said Adam Brotman, Starbucks’ chief digital officer.

551,SBUX,"UPDATE 4-Premera Blue Cross breached, medical information exposed","(Adds Starbucks comment) By Jim Finkle BOSTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Health insurer Premera Blue Cross said on Tuesday it was a victim of a cyberattack that may have exposed medical data and financial information of 11 million customers, in the latest serious breach disclosed by a healthcare company. Premera said the attackers may have gained access to claims data, including clinical information, along with banking account numbers, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data in an attack that began in May 2014. It is the largest breach reported to date involving patient medical information, according to Dave Kennedy, an expert in healthcare security who is chief executive of TrustedSEC LLC. About 6 million of the people whose accounts were accessed are residents of Washington state, where customers include employees of Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp  and Starbucks Corp, according to Premera. The rest are scattered across every U.S. state. The insurer said it has so far uncovered no evidence to show that member data was “used inappropriately.” Medical records are highly valuable on underground criminal exchanges where stolen data is sold because the information is not only highly confidential but can also be used to engage in insurance fraud. “Medical records paint a really personal picture of somebody’s life and medical procedures,” Kennedy said. “They allow you to perpetrate really in-depth medical fraud.” A Starbucks spokesman told Reuters that Premera notified the coffee chain on Tuesday that Starbucks may have been affected by the attack. A representatives from Amazon did not respond to requests for comment, and a representative at Microsoft declined comment. Although a breach at Anthem disclosed earlier this year and another large one disclosed last year by hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc involved larger numbers of records, those companies said they believed the attackers did not access medical information. The Premera breach was uncovered on Jan. 29, the day that insurer Anthem Inc disclosed a cyber attack involving records of some 79 million members in Blue Cross Blue Shield plans across the country. Premera spokesman Eric Earling said the two attacks were unrelated and that his company independently identified its breach. Still, experts expect that other healthcare companies will find that they have been breached as the latest attack prompts them to look for intrusions. “I think other insurance providers are compromised today and we still don’t know it. More and more are going to disclose attacks,” Kennedy said. Premera hired FireEye Inc to investigate the matter and is also working with the FBI. The attack affected Premera Blue Cross, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, and affiliated brands Vivacity and Connexion Insurance Solutions.

552,SBUX,Starbucks partners drinks maker Tingyi to expand in China,"SHANGHAI/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) will partner Taiwanese drinks maker Tingyi Holding Corp (0322.HK) to produce and sell ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages in China, becoming the latest global firm to latch on to a local peer to expand in the tricky market. Starbucks will have Tingyi manufacture the drinks for China and help extend its distribution on the mainland, the U.S. coffee giant’s fastest-growing overseas market, the pair said in a joint statement on Thursday. Starbucks announced its deal with the No. 2 soft drink seller in China at its annual shareholder meeting earlier in Seattle. Multinationals in China often turn to local partners as the easiest way to target the country’s huge consumer market, where bureaucracy, developing infrastructure, fragmented distribution and occasionally murky business practices can make it challenging for foreign firms to navigate alone. “China is a tough market to crack logistically. It’s hard to get beyond a few cities without a distribution network you’ve built up yourself, which takes a lot of investment,” said James Roy, associate principal at China Market Research Group. “The best way is to partner with somebody that has a network ready to go.” Starbucks’ China and Asia-Pacific president John Culver said the tie-up would “unlock” the ready-to-drink coffee and energy beverage market in China, which the firms said was worth $6 billion and set to grow by 20 percent over the next three years. “Tingyi will leverage its strength in production and distribution to increase the market share of Starbucks’ RTD products in the Chinese market,” said Tingyi CEO James Wei. Analysts said the tie-up would help lower the cost of Starbucks’ RTD coffee products and boost the company’s footprint in smaller cities, potentially giving it access to an army of new consumers. Starbucks currently lags far behind RTD coffee market leader Nestle SA NESN.VX, according to 2014 data from researcher Euromonitor. U.S. drinks maker The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), French dairy firm Danone SA (DANO.PA) and British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L) all have tied-up with local partners to boost China sales. PepsiCo Inc PEP.N already works closely with Tingyi in China. A number of firms have struggled alone. Tesco eventually partnered China Resources Enterprise Ltd (0291.HK) in 2013 to turn around its loss making business, and U.S. retailer Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) sold its struggling China unit last year. Starbucks said it has more than 1,500 stores in nearly 90 cities in China and over 25,000 employees.

The rollout comes as Starbucks seeks to double food sales and as Danone’s popular Dannon yogurt brand wrestles with Chobani in the popular Greek yogurt category. The partners each declined to give sales estimates. The coffee chain, which has about 12,000 U.S. shops, will offer smoothies made with its own Evolution Fresh juices and an exclusive-to-Starbucks Dannon Greek yogurt at shops in Washington state, Oregon, Alaska, Northern California and Idaho. Priced at $5.95 for a 16-ounce size, the smoothies will come in three flavors and can be customized by adding ingredients such as protein powder and fresh kale, said Jeff Hansberry, president of Starbucks’ Evolution Fresh brand. In early May, Starbucks and Dannon will begin selling Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt parfaits in about half of Starbucks’ U.S. stores. Then, this summer, the partners will start selling fruit-on-the-bottom Greek yogurt cups at U.S. supermarkets. Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt is a proprietary blend for Starbucks that includes three yogurt cultures, instead of the traditional two, said Jeffrey Rothman, vice president of marketing for Dannon. Rothman added that it is the mildest, creamiest Greek yogurt Dannon makes. U.S. yogurt sales totaled $8.3 billion in 2014 and were dominated by Dannon, according to research firm Euromonitor International, which does not break out sales in popular Greek yogurt category.

558,SBUX,Starbucks expands college tuition benefit for workers,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp is expanding its employee college tuition assistance program to cover the entire cost of getting an online bachelor’s degree, the chief executive of the coffee chain said on Monday.  The Seattle-based company, known for offering benefits such as healthcare and stock options, launched the “Starbucks College Achievement Plan” with Arizona State University in June 2014. It previously limited the program to juniors and seniors seeking to complete their degrees. The enhanced tuition reimbursement program from Starbucks comes at a time when an improving U.S. labor market is forcing major restaurant chains and retailers, including McDonald’s Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, to raise hourly wages and improve benefits to compete for the best workers. Chief Executive Howard Schultz said Starbucks expects to spend $250 million or more over a decade on tuition reimbursement, a perk he said Starbucks employees had requested. “The unfortunate reality is that too many Americans can no longer afford a college degree, particularly disadvantaged young people, and others are saddled with burdensome education debt,” said Schultz, who added that Starbucks hopes to help 25,000 employees earn their degrees by 2025.       Starbucks employees working 20 hours per week or more, which account for roughly 80 percent of the company’s U.S. workforce of more than 140,000, are eligible. Nearly 2,000 Starbucks employees, known as partners, already have enrolled in the program.  The students, who need not complete a degree or stay with the company after earning a diploma, will be reimbursed for the cost of their classes at the end of every semester, Starbucks said. Starbucks, which recently raised worker pay but did not disclose the size of the increases, said it expects to have “several hundred” graduates by the end of 2016.

560,SBUX,China's JD.com sets up cross-border e-commerce platform in challenge to Alibaba,"BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - JD.com Inc, China’s No. 2 e-commerce player, on Wednesday launched its JD Worldwide cross-border online shopping platform, a challenger to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Tmall Global service. JD Worldwide will allow Chinese shoppers to buy imports from U.S. firms such as Nike Inc, Starbucks Corp and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc, as well as products from countries like Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, JD.com said in a press release. Overseas suppliers will provide more than 1,200 brands, without those merchants requiring a presence in China. The venture adds to a host of online retail rivals for Alibaba and Amazon.com Inc catering to fears about the quality and safety of Chinese goods after a number of scares, and comes on the back of a Chinese government push to promote e-commerce and relax import restrictions. But JD.com still trails far behind Alibaba in Chinese e-commerce. Alibaba’s high profile since its record-breaking $25 billion U.S. listing in September is a huge lure for brands looking to enter or raise their presence in China, which some analysts estimate as the world’s biggest online shopping market. “Imported goods have always been huge sellers on JD.com, and this massively expands the range of products available to Chinese consumers,” said Leo Li, who oversees JD Worldwide, in an e-mail to Reuters. Using China’s e-commerce free trade zones and the firm’s own logistics network, JD.com can “offer international brands a direct channel to Chinese consumers with preferential tax rates to make prices highly competitive,” he said, adding that JD.com would also do marketing for its overseas partners. “We are currently providing free advertising so that they get good traffic and don’t become ghost stores. We’re playing the long game with our partners.” JD.com, backed by Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings Ltd , also said it launched with eBay Inc a programme to allow Chinese shoppers to buy select goods from U.S. eBay sellers. A spokeswoman for eBay confirmed the partnership. Shares of JD.com, which markets itself as a seller of authentic goods, have risen 44 percent since the beginning of the year. Alibaba’s stock price, on the other hand, has fallen 18 percent in the same period. Analysts have expressed concern over counterfeits on the world’s largest e-commerce firm’s platforms, as well as lacklustre earnings and investor excitement wearing off after the initial public offering.

561,SBUX,"Starbucks' strong results quash growth woes, shares rise","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp said on Thursday sales at its coffee shops in the Americas region grew more than expected, boosted by sales of breakfast sandwiches, lunch and new drinks, such as Flat White. The strong quarterly results from the world’s biggest coffee chain helped quiet nagging worries that its growth was cooling, and shares jumped 5.4 percent to $52.12 in after-hours trading. Starbucks, which is expanding its menus with food, beer and wine, tea drinks and fruit and vegetable smoothies, plans to begin offering delivery service in New York City and Seattle this year. The Seattle-based company also said it is expanding its U.S. mobile order and pay service after a successful test launch.  The efforts come as U.S. restaurant chains ranging from McDonald’s Corp to Panera Bread Co are turning to technology to increase sales, speed up service and connect with younger, tech-savvy consumers. Sales at Starbucks shops open at least 13 months were up 7 percent in the Americas region for the fiscal second quarter ended March 29. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a rise of 5.1 percent. The Americas quarterly same-store sales included a 2 percent rise in traffic. Starbucks’ Americas region, which includes the United States, Canada and Latin America, contributes the majority of company revenue. Customer visits to Starbucks’ Americas-region cafes have decelerated in the last year and a half, causing some investors and analysts to worry that the company’s increased focus on food had slowed service. The chain’s quarterly net earnings grew 16 percent to $494.9 million, or 33 cents per share, up from $427 million. Total revenue was up almost 18 percent to $4.56 billion. Although the company said the strong dollar is expected to take a bigger bite out of earnings and revenue, it stood by its fiscal 2015 revenue growth forecast of 16 percent to 18 percent as well as its call for full-year earnings, excluding items, of $1.55 to $1.57 per share.

562,SBUX,Starbucks CFO says prices locked in for 70 percent of 2016 coffee needs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has locked in prices on 70 percent of 2016 coffee needs at “favorable” levels when compared to its 2015 coffee costs, its chief financial officer said in a call to announce the company’s fiscal second-quarter results. The recent drop in coffee prices to 13-month lows prompted Starbucks to begin extensively covering its 2016 needs, said Starbucks CFO Scott Maw. The world’s largest coffee chain’s hedging approach reflects a new, more cautious buying strategy among U.S. roasters taking advantage of current price levels to protect against the possibility of a price surge as a result of a potentially weak crop in top-grower Brazil. Roasters are fixing prices farther into the future than they have in three years, traders and roasters say, and the commercial long position in arabica coffee on ICE Futures U.S. hit a record high late last month, though it has since declined slightly.  In January, Starbucks had said it had locked in prices for 94 percent of its 2015 coffee needs.  Maw said this resulted in coffee costs for fiscal 2015 that were below average market prices. “Our coffee team’s patience around coffee pricing paid off,” he said, noting that the company’s buying team waited out spikes above $1.90 a lb. Starbucks said its net earnings grew 16 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to $494 million as sales at its coffee shops in the Americas region grew by more than expected, sending shares up 5.4 percent to $52.12 in after-hours trading. Second-month coffee futures ended Thursday at $1.4150 a lb, after falling to a 13-month low of $1.2875 on March 13. Prices had hit 2-1/2-year highs at $2.2910 in October 2014. Maw also said Starbucks expects overall commodity costs to be “roughly neutral” in 2015 compared to 2014.

572,SBUX,UPDATE 1-EU to delay decisions on tax deals with multinationals,"(Adds details) By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, May 5 (Reuters) - EU regulators will miss a June deadline to decide whether tax deals granted by individual member states to companies including Apple and Starbucks are legal because they lack some data, the EU’s antitrust chief said on Tuesday. The investigations launched last year centre on Luxembourg’s tax rulings for carmaker Fiat Chrysler and online retailer Amazon, as well as coffee chain Starbucks Corp’s deal with the Netherlands and iPhone maker Apple’s Irish arrangements, and whether they are paying a fair share of tax. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who had previously set a second quarter deadline for her decision, said it was taking longer than expected to get the relevant information. “It is clear that obtaining information is both challenging and time consuming. We do not necessarily get the information the first time or the second time. Therefore we will not meet the first deadline to be done by the end of the second quarter. We will do our best,” Vestager told lawmakers in the European Parliament. “I will not give deadlines for the finalisation of these cases,” she added. The European Commission can order authorities to recover unfair state aid, which in the case of the four companies could run to millions of euros. Apple in a regulatory filing last week said a negative decision could have a material impact. Vestager said Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic have yet to provide details of the companies granted tax rulings between 2010 to 2013. The EU competition authority asked all 28 EU countries for information on the issue in December last year as part of a broader probe into corporate tax avoidance. Vestager said she was reviewing the information provided by trade unions accusing U.S. fastfood chain McDonald’s of avoiding taxes in a deal with Luxembourg to see whether it merited an investigation. The Commission is also investigating Belgium’s tax arrangements for multinationals.

575,SBUX,Starbucks moves Ethos water bottling out of drought-hit California,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Friday said it would stop sourcing water for its Ethos Water brand in California, which is in the fourth year of a serious drought that has prompted the state’s first-ever mandatory cuts in water use.  Beginning in May and over the next six months, Starbucks said it plans to move production to its Pennsylvania supplier. The Seattle-based coffee chain also is looking for a new source and supplier for its West Coast Ethos Water distribution. The announcement comes a week after the magazine Mother Jones published a report showing that Ethos Water was sourced in areas deemed to be in “exceptional drought.” Starbucks bought privately held Ethos Brands LLC for $8 million in April 2005. It does not break out sales for Ethos.  Starbucks donates 5 cents for every bottle of water sold to the Ethos Water Fund, which is part of the Starbucks foundation. Starbucks says that so far, more than $12.3 million has been granted to help support water, sanitation and hygiene education programs in water-stressed countries in Africa, Indonesia and Latin America. Starbucks says its California cafes have cut their water use by 26 percent since 2008. Several other large bottled water sellers source water from California, among which are Coca-Cola Co’s Dasani brand and PepsiCo Inc’s Aquafina.  Coca-Cola’s California facilities no longer use water for things like truck washing and landscaping, spokeswoman Nancy Limon said in an email. But Coca-Cola is not moving bottled water operations out of the state.  “We are committed to keeping jobs in California, while reducing our water use and replenishing water back to nature,” Limon said, adding that Coca-Cola is involved in several water stewardship projects around the state.  Representatives from PepsiCo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The total volume of bottled water consumed in the United States hit 11 billion gallons last year, up more than 7 percent from 2013. That translated into an average of 34 gallons per person, according to the International Bottled Water Association, citing data from the Beverage Marketing Corp.

580,SBUX,UPDATE 3-McDonald's European meal deals help offset weak U.S. May sales,"(Adds link to graphic, analyst comment) June 8 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp posted a smaller-than-expected drop in worldwide sales at established restaurants in May after a lift from value meal deals in Europe helped offset continued weakness in the United States, its top market for profit. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue is fighting to lure back customers lost to slower service, more nimble rivals and increasing consumer demand for fresh, less-processed food. Shares of the world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue inched up 0.2 percent to $95.39 in midday trading. Global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in May, marking a full year of monthly sales declines. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a decline of 0.9 percent. European sales were up a better-then-expected 2.3 percent. The biggest boost came from the United Kingdom, which served up strong results from its “Great Taste of America” campaign, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a client note. Germany and France each were up slightly after promoting “everyday value” and premium food. Analysts had expected sales in Europe to rise just 0.6 percent. U.S. same-restaurant sales disappointed, dropping 2.2 percent in May. Traffic to its domestic restaurants fell again as rivals, ranging from sandwich chain Chick-fil-A to burrito seller Chipotle Mexican Grill, continued to pick off customers. Analysts had expected a decline of 1.7 percent. McDonald’s USA is running a variety of tests aimed at luring back customers. Those tests include extended breakfast hours, custom burgers and new food such as breakfast bowls made with kale and spinach. Frustrated franchisees are clamoring for the company to trim and simplify its massive menu, which they blame for service slow-downs that turn off diners. May sales were off 3.2 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region, less than analysts’ estimate for a 3.8 percent drop. Japan and China, which are still grappling with fallout from food safety scandals, weighed on APMEA results. McDonald’s new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook recently said the fast-food giant would join other companies that only report quarterly same-store sales. June will be the final monthly sales report for the chain. Most major U.S. restaurants and retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Starbucks Corp, report only monthly same-store sales. Those companies say monthly sales reports add costs and put too much emphasis on short-term performance.

584,SBUX,EU executive to propose common tax base for multinationals - again,"LONDON (Reuters) - Four years after failing in an initial attempt at common company tax rules across Europe, the EU is set to have a second go as it tries to tackle the low-tax arrangements of some states that have benefited the likes of Amazon, Starbucks and Apple. The EU’s executive European Commission is due on Wednesday to set out plans for a so-called common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB), after its previous attempt met member state opposition to what many saw as a first step to harmonizing tax rates, still regarded as a sovereign issue. Yet corporate taxes have remained in the headlines because of the way multinationals can legally reduce their bills by basing themselves in low-tax centers and the EU is already investigating the tax arrangements of Apple, Starbucks and Amazon in some member states. It said on June 11 those investigations are at an advanced stage and decisions could be announced in coming months.  In a paper to be published on Wednesday, the Commission says its first CCCTB proposal in 2011 was for an optional system, which limited its effectiveness as a tool for preventing profit shifting by cross-border companies. “The Commission will therefore work on a proposal to make the CCCTB compulsory, at least for multinational enterprises,” it says in the document seen by Reuters, which could still face last-minute changes ahead of publication. The plans are designed to prevent “aggressive” tax planning, such as artificially shifting profits to the country where rates are lowest or beneficial tax rulings can be secured. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at accounting body ACCA, said the plan would likely end up in the form of enhanced cooperation. “The main thing is to make sure that any CCCTB tax regime is fully compatible with global initiatives and that we need as many member states involved as possible,” Roy-Chowdhury said. The Commission says it would advocate a step by step approach. “The primary focus should be on securing the common tax base,” the document said. “The Commission will present a new legislative proposal as soon as possible ... introducing the mandatory element and providing for a staged approach to the CCCTB.” The proposal could also address the more favorable treatment currently given to corporate debt over shares.

593,SBUX,Starbucks to enter sub-Saharan Africa next year,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Coffee giant Starbucks SBUK.O will open stores in sub-Saharan Africa for the first time next year after agreeing a deal with Taste Holdings (TASJ.J) on Tuesday, sending the South African company’s shares soaring 20 percent. Under the exclusive agreement, Taste, which acquired the license for Domino’s Pizza (DOM.L) in South Africa last year, can operate Starbucks coffee shops for 25 years. “We are proud to be bringing Starbucks to South Africa next year,” Starbucks EMEA President Kris Engskov said in a statement. “The coffee market here is vibrant and growing fast – we want to be part of that growth,” Engskov said. Starbucks operates in about 66 countries with over 22,000 retail stores. The Starbucks deal includes rights to other African countries, Taste said, without giving specifics. Starbucks currently sources coffee from nine African countries: Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Cameroon, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya. Global restaurant brands are increasingly investing in Africa to tap into the continent’s growing middle class. U.S. coffee and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme KKD.N said in May it will open 31 stores in South Africa within five years. Investors are often drawn to South African companies who can offer a gateway into faster-growing economies elsewhere on the continent. “It’s quite a big market in South Africa. We have got established players with lots of experience,” said Wayne McCurrie, portfolio manager at Momentum Wealth. “Maybe more importantly, if Africa shows the growth potential over the next decade that everyone expects, then this is a good base to start from,” McCurrie added.

594,SBUX,UPDATE 2-Starbucks to enter sub-Saharan Africa next year,"* First Starbucks store to open in South Africa in Q1 2016 * Deal with Taste Holdings includes other African countries * Global brands tapping into growing African middle-class   (Adds details, analyst comment) By Tendai Dube JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Reuters) - Coffee giant Starbucks  will open stores in sub-Saharan Africa for the first time next year after agreeing a deal with Taste Holdings  on Tuesday, sending the South African company’s shares soaring 20 percent. Under the exclusive agreement, Taste, which acquired the licence for Domino’s Pizza in South Africa last year, can operate Starbucks coffee shops for 25 years. “We are proud to be bringing Starbucks to South Africa next year,” Starbucks EMEA President Kris Engskov said in a statement. “The coffee market here is vibrant and growing fast - we want to be part of that growth,” Engskov said. Starbucks operates in about 66 countries with over 22,000 retail stores. The Starbucks deal includes rights to other African countries, Taste said, without giving specifics. Starbucks currently sources coffee from nine African countries: Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Cameroon, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya. Global restaurant brands are increasingly investing in Africa to tap into the continent’s growing middle class. U.S. coffee and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme said in May it will open 31 stores in South Africa within five years. Investors are often drawn to South African companies who can offer a gateway into faster-growing economies elsewhere on the continent. “It’s quite a big market in South Africa. We have got established players with lots of experience,” said Wayne McCurrie, portfolio manager at Momentum Wealth. “Maybe more importantly, if Africa shows the growth potential over the next decade that everyone expects, then this is a good base to start from,” McCurrie added.

597,SBUX,"Starbucks' cafe sales hotter than expected, boost profit","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) reported higher quarterly profit on Thursday as new food, drinks and technology helped the world’s biggest coffee chain attract more customers. Sales at Starbucks shops open at least 13 months were up 7 percent globally in the latest quarter, with an estimated 23 million more customer transactions than in the year-earlier quarter as various sales-boosting projects took hold.     Same-store sales jumped a bigger-than-expected 8 percent in the Americas unit for the fiscal third quarter ended June 28. New drinks like the “Flat White” and the limited-time “S’mores Frappuccino” as well as breakfast sandwiches and bistro boxes helped perk up sales in the region.   Starbucks’ Americas unit, which includes the United States, Canada and Latin America, contributes the majority of company revenue. Starbucks said its new mobile order and pay technology is boosting sales and profit at the roughly 4,000 U.S. cafes where it has been introduced. The technology has the potential to lure in customers who may have been turned off by long lines and waiting times.  “In those stores where mobile order and pay has been deployed, lines are shorter, service is faster and in-store operations are more efficient,” said Chief Executive Howard Schultz, who added that the service will be available nationwide in time for the important winter holiday season. Starbucks is also testing smaller-format express stores and delivery in the United States. The Seattle-based company’s net earnings jumped 22 percent to $626.7 million, or 41 cents per share, during the quarter as lower costs for key commodities such as milk helped offset rising U.S. labor costs. Schultz said the company is working to reproduce the results from the latest quarter, but urged analysts to continue targeting same-store sales growth in the mid-single-digit percentages.     Seattle-based Starbucks separately said its board had  authorized the buy back of an additional 50 million shares under its ongoing stock repurchase program.  Shares in the company, which also got a boost from its loyalty program, rose 4.4 percent to $59.04 in after-hours trading.

603,SBUX,"Wall Street slides to end rough week on macro, earnings concerns","(Reuters) - The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq posted their largest weekly drops since March on Friday as slowing global growth dragged commodity-related stocks lower while an earnings-fueled drop in Biogen took down the biotech sector. Biogen (BIIB.O) more than halved its revenue growth forecast for 2015 and its stock lost 22 percent to close just above $300.  Stocks in the energy and materials sectors weighed heavily on the market after weaker-than-expected economic data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth. Oil prices hit their lowest since March. “You got underwhelming revenue growth on balance and then you layer on top of that concern over a global economic slowdown, that becomes self-fulfilling,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said of the stock market weakness. Amazon (AMZN.O) was the bright spot on Friday, rising more than 20 percent at one point and closing up 10 percent at $530.50. The online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit and its market cap ballooned to $247 billion, making it the tenth-largest U.S. company by market value. However, Amazon’s spike highlighted the thinning of leadership in the S&P; 500. Gains on the index so far this year can be attributed to Amazon and just three more companies. At the close of trading on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 163.39 points, or 0.92 percent, to 17,568.53, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 22.5 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,079.65 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 57.78 points, or 1.12 percent, to 5,088.63. For the week, the S&P; fell 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq slid 2.3 percent in their largest weekly drops since the last week of March. The 2.9 percent fall on the Dow was the largest for any week since January.  Selling in stocks accelerated after a report from the Wall Street Journal said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments. Second-quarter S&P; 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts’ profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P; 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months’ earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Dow component Visa (V.N) ended up 4.3 percent at $74.80 after the credit and debit card company’s results handily beat expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,246 to 831, for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,144 issues fell and 660 advanced for a 3.25-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 13 new 52-week highs and 54 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 200 new lows. Some 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.6 billion so far this month.

Amazon.com shares jumped as much as 20.4 percent to a record of $580.57 after the online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit. The jump catapulted Amazon’s market value to about $270 billion, overtaking Wal-Mart. Metal prices hit multi-year lows as weaker-than-expected data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth while oil prices neared four-month lows. The three major indexes were poised to end the week in the red as Biogen’s 19 percent slump weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 and dragged down other health stocks. Adding to the day’s pressure, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments, the Wall Street Journal reported. Second-quarter S&P; 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts’ profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. RBC Capital Markets said investors were treating disappointing stocks harshly. While only 20 percent of companies have missed expectations, below the 23 percent over the past three years, there was a 3.5 percent selloff versus the 2.4 percent seen historically, a note said. Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P; 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months’ earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. “We are not going to see a lot of earnings growth in the second half of the year as the economic data hasn’t been very strong,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “The fall in commodities is also a concern that global growth is slowing and that ties into U.S. growth too.” Data on Friday showed new U.S. single-family home sales fell in June to their lowest level in seven months and May’s sales were revised sharply lower. Other data showed manufacturing activity nudged up in July after slowing for three straight months. At 12:43 p.m. ET (1643 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 100.26 points, or 0.57 percent, at 17,631.66, the S&P; 500 was down 11.81 points, or 0.56 percent, at 2,090.34 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.61 points, or 0.32 percent, at 5,129.80. Six of the 10 major S&P; 500 indexes were lower with the materials index’s 1.79 percent fall leading the decliners. Dow component Visa was up 4.3 percent at $74.87 after the credit and debit card company’s results handsomely beat  expectations. Starbucks rose 2.4 percent to $57.96 after the world’s biggest coffee chain reported a higher quarterly profit. Stancorp Financial Group soared 48.1 percent to $113.59 after Japan’s Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance said it has agreed to buy the company for $5 billion. Truecar slumped 34.9 percent to $6.98 after the online car-shopping service provider cut full-year revenue forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,046 to 911. On the Nasdaq, 1,815 issues fell and 870 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 12 new 52-week highs and 51 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 44 new highs and 141 new lows.

606,SBUX,INSIGHT-Americans' taste for cold brew transforms summertime coffee market,"* Click here for video: reut.rs/1M775J1 * How to make cold brew: reut.rs/1MAmgKJ * Ready to drink coffee sales: reut.rs/1IyyIb9   (Adds video link) By Luc Cohen NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - For U.S. coffee shops, business usually cools down as the weather heats up. But as the latest craze, cold brew coffee, moves from a hipster infatuation to mainstream staple, that traditional seasonal pattern is unraveling. Since cold brew often uses more beans than traditional iced coffee, it could boost overall U.S. demand for coffee beans, partially offsetting the effect of the more efficient single-serve pods popularized by Keurig Green Mountain. Peet’s Coffee & Tea, one of the nation’s biggest coffee chains with about 400 stores, replaced traditional iced coffee with cold brew in June, and has seen cold brew sales exceed last year’s iced coffee sales by as much as 70 percent. “We went all in on cold brew,” Peet’s general manager Tyler Ricks said, noting that the newer product is smoother, more refreshing and lacks iced coffee’s “harsh, bitter note.” For Peet’s, which reported total revenue last year of $540 million, focusing on cold brew was part of an effort to slow the seasonal decline in coffee sales, which several roasters estimated at between 15 and 20 percent. Others have jumped on board, including the nation’s largest coffee chain, Starbucks, which launched cold brew at 2,800 stores this summer. Hector Mai, manager of a Guy & Gallard cafeteria in midtown Manhattan, began serving cold brew this summer and has already noticed iced tea sales declining. “One day, there will be no regular iced coffee,” Mai said, while pouring a nitrogen-infused cold brew made by Brooklyn-based Gillies Coffee from a tap, just like beer. Cold brew is made by steeping fresh ground coffee in cold water for between 12 and 24 hours, while traditional iced coffee is made by cooling hot-brewed coffee and serving it over ice. The cool temperature and lack of movement, however, mean not as much flavor and strength is extracted from each bean compared to hot or traditional iced coffee, prompting roasters such as Peet’s, Gillies and Brooklyn Roasting Company to use a larger dose of ground coffee in cold brew blends. Michael Pollack, managing partner of Brooklyn Roasting, uses a double dose of coffee in his cold brew, and says he goes through beans twice as fast during the summer as other seasons. Peet’s makes up for higher raw material costs by charging $2.45 for a small cold brew, compared with the $2 it used to charge for a small iced coffee. Starbucks charges customers $3.25 for a grande cold brew, 60 cents more than a grande iced coffee. Gillies, which has been roasting coffee in Brooklyn for 175 years, has gotten in on the trend, launching cold brew on tap to supply local coffee shops and restaurants like Guy & Gallard in April. It now ships about 65 kegs a week to about 50 customers, Gillies president Donald Schoenholt said from the company’s roasting plant near Brooklyn’s waterfront. That’s only about 3 percent of the 1 million pound-a-year roaster’s business, but Schoenholt said entering the space was crucial for capturing summertime coffee drinkers. “We think 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now, we’re going to see a significant bump” in summer coffee sales, Schoenholt said while pouring a cold brew from a tap this week. To be sure, not all cold brewers use a higher dose, and some specialty roasters argue it fails to extract quality beans’ full flavor potential. Still, Americans’ thirst for cold coffee has been rising for years. Last year, they consumed 90 million gallons of ready-to-drink coffee beverages, ranging from bottled Starbucks Frappuchinos to cartons of Stumptown cold brew, up 52 percent from 2009, data from Beverage Marketing Corporation show. By contrast, sales of carbonated soft drinks, which still swamps the coffee market, dropped for five straight years to 12.8 billion gallons last year. That was down 9 percent from 2009. In addition, the percentage of coffee shops and restaurants serving iced coffee rose from 19 percent in 2009 to 24 percent in 2013, data from market research firm Mintel show. Cold brew was popularized when Portland-based, private equity-backed Stumptown Coffee Roasters started selling ready-to-drink coffee in a “stubby” bottle in 2011. Now with Starbucks’ entrance, cold brew has hit the mainstream. “Having Starbucks come into it is the 5,000-pound gorilla in every conversation about coffee,” Pollack of Brooklyn Roasting said. The popularity growth of this stronger brewing method may support overall U.S. coffee demand, providing a counter-weight to the growth of single-serve coffee pods, which are widely seen as limiting demand by reducing coffee waste. U.S. coffee consumption will fall next year for the first time in six years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast. “If we can make cold a more compelling thing, that will take out a little bit of the sting,” said Brett Struwe of Caribou Coffee. Schoenholt recalled entering a Brooklyn convenience store this summer and noting the large quantities of ready-to-drink cold coffee drinks for sale on shelf space once dominated by more traditional American summertime favorites. “We’re winning,” he said.

608,SBUX,INSIGHT-Americans' taste for cold brew transforms summertime coffee market,"NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - For U.S. coffee shops, business usually cools down as the weather heats up. But as the latest craze, cold brew coffee, moves from a hipster infatuation to mainstream staple, that traditional seasonal pattern is unraveling. Since cold brew often uses more beans than traditional iced coffee, it could boost overall U.S. demand for coffee beans, partially offsetting the effect of the more efficient single-serve pods popularized by Keurig Green Mountain. Peet’s Coffee & Tea, one of the nation’s biggest coffee chains with about 400 stores, replaced traditional iced coffee with cold brew in June, and has seen cold brew sales exceed last year’s iced coffee sales by as much as 70 percent. “We went all in on cold brew,” Peet’s general manager Tyler Ricks said, noting that the newer product is smoother, more refreshing and lacks iced coffee’s “harsh, bitter note.” For Peet’s, which reported total revenue last year of $540 million, focusing on cold brew was part of an effort to slow the seasonal decline in coffee sales, which several roasters estimated at between 15 and 20 percent. Others have jumped on board, including the nation’s largest coffee chain, Starbucks, which launched cold brew at 2,800 stores this summer. Hector Mai, manager of a Guy & Gallard cafeteria in midtown Manhattan, began serving cold brew this summer and has already noticed iced tea sales declining. “One day, there will be no regular iced coffee,” Mai said, while pouring a nitrogen-infused cold brew made by Brooklyn-based Gillies Coffee from a tap, just like beer. Cold brew is made by steeping fresh ground coffee in cold water for between 12 and 24 hours, while traditional iced coffee is made by cooling hot-brewed coffee and serving it over ice. The cool temperature and lack of movement, however, mean not as much flavor and strength is extracted from each bean compared to hot or traditional iced coffee, prompting roasters such as Peet’s, Gillies and Brooklyn Roasting Company to use a larger dose of ground coffee in cold brew blends. Michael Pollack, managing partner of Brooklyn Roasting, uses a double dose of coffee in his cold brew, and says he goes through beans twice as fast during the summer as other seasons. Peet’s makes up for higher raw material costs by charging $2.45 for a small cold brew, compared with the $2 it used to charge for a small iced coffee. Starbucks charges customers $3.25 for a grande cold brew, 60 cents more than a grande iced coffee. Gillies, which has been roasting coffee in Brooklyn for 175 years, has gotten in on the trend, launching cold brew on tap to supply local coffee shops and restaurants like Guy & Gallard in April. It now ships about 65 kegs a week to about 50 customers, Gillies president Donald Schoenholt said from the company’s roasting plant near Brooklyn’s waterfront. That’s only about 3 percent of the 1 million pound-a-year roaster’s business, but Schoenholt said entering the space was crucial for capturing summertime coffee drinkers. “We think 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now, we’re going to see a significant bump” in summer coffee sales, Schoenholt said while pouring a cold brew from a tap this week. To be sure, not all cold brewers use a higher dose, and some specialty roasters argue it fails to extract quality beans’ full flavor potential. Still, Americans’ thirst for cold coffee has been rising for years. Last year, they consumed 90 million gallons of ready-to-drink coffee beverages, ranging from bottled Starbucks Frappuchinos to cartons of Stumptown cold brew, up 52 percent from 2009, data from Beverage Marketing Corporation show. By contrast, sales of carbonated soft drinks, which still swamps the coffee market, dropped for five straight years to 12.8 billion gallons last year. That was down 9 percent from 2009. In addition, the percentage of coffee shops and restaurants serving iced coffee rose from 19 percent in 2009 to 24 percent in 2013, data from market research firm Mintel show.

610,SBUX,"Pop Gourmet CEO on sriracha, Starbucks and life after prison","(Reuters) - David Israel’s four-year old company, Pop Gourmet, has a deal to sell snacks at Starbucks and a sought-after licensing agreement with uber-hip sriracha seller Huy Fong Foods, but it is his prison time that makes the brand stand-out in a crowded field.  Starbucks Corp, which helped popularize Kind bars and other snack brands, recently began selling Pop Gourmet in 3,400 U.S. stores. The company, which sells sweet, savory and low-cal snacks, soon expects to expand its line-up of Huy Fong sriracha-flavored popcorn, potato chips and croutons with hummus and mayonnaise. It also sells Huy Fong dry seasoning in grocery stores as well as sriracha ketchup.  Pop Gourmet’s 2015 sales are forecast to roughly triple from around $5 million last year, said Israel, who has attracted $11 million from investors. They include former federal prosecutor Ron Neubauer, who first refused to meet with Israel, then changed his mind after reviewing his court case. Neubauer has put in $300,000 and convinced a half dozen friends to follow.  “People love the story,” said Israel, 54, who owned a chain of pawnshops when he was ensnared in a prosecution stemming from several Seattle-area robberies in the early 1990s. Israel maintains that he was not involved. He spent several years and more than $1 million fighting the charges. In 2003, he pleaded guilty while maintaining his innocence.  “I was tapped out,” said Israel, who since has declined Neubauer’s offer to help clear his name.  “It’s not where I want to focus my energy. It’s part of my fabric,” said Israel, who dreamt up his business plan while in prison. The Seattle-based snack shop debuted in June 2011 with “the ultimate original big house,” inspired by an inmate concoction of microwave popcorn, breakfast cereal, melted M&M;’s, peanut butter and marshmallows.  “People used to stand in line to get this stuff,” said Israel, who served time from August 2003 to June 2007 and now offers jobs and guidance to former inmates.  Neubauer says he expects the company, which has nationwide grocery distribution and offers several products with sought-after natural, gluten-free and non-GMO labels, to get gobbled up by a bigger player. There were 10 merger and acquisition deals in the snack category in just the first six months of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. An initial public offering seems off the table as China’s cooldown spooks U.S. markets. Still, Pop Gourmet rival Amplify Snack Brands Inc, known for its SkinnyPop product, has said it will soon be on the acquisition trail after raising $270 million in its August IPO.

611,SBUX,Taco Bell joins fast-food booze bandwagon with new U.S. eateries,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc’s <YUM.N > Taco Bell chain next week will debut a new restaurant concept that dumps the drive-thru and brings on the booze as it seeks to appeal to hip, young city dwellers and fend off popular rival Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. The first of the chain’s new Taco Bell Cantina restaurants will open in Chicago’s hipster Wicker Park neighborhood on Sept. 22, with a second later this month in San Francisco. The Wicker Park restaurant will serve beer, wine, sangria and twisted freezes - frozen drinks spiked with rum, vodka or tequila. The San Francisco outlet will serve beer and wine only. The Cantina restaurants, like Chipotle’s roughly 1,900 restaurants, will have open kitchens. The Cantina restaurants also will offer a tapas-style menu of shareable appetizers during designated hours each evening, in addition to the standard Taco Bell menu. Chipotle already offers alcohol at about 1,000 restaurants. Most of those sell both beer and margaritas, while some sell only beer. The move from Taco Bell comes as U.S. restaurant chains experiment with new ways to add sales and lure customers. Taco Bell, which recently had a huge hit with its Doritos Locos tacos, debuted a Chipotle-like “Cantina” menu a few years ago and is testing a separate urban taco concept called U.S. Taco Co in Huntington Beach, California. On other fronts, 75 Starbucks Corp cafes offer that chain’s “evenings” menu that includes craft, local and regional beer, wine and small plates of food. Starbucks goal is to have “evenings” in roughly 2,000 Starbucks locations by 2019. Taco Bell, which now has more than 6,000 restaurants, plans to add 2,000 new restaurants by 2022. It did not say how many new or remodeled restaurants would become Taco Bell Cantinas.

612,SBUX,Starbucks expands sales-boosting Mobile Order & Pay across U.S.,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Tuesday said its sales-boosting Mobile Order & Pay service is now available in all of its nearly 7,500 U.S. company-operated shops, a nationwide roll-out completed about three months ahead of schedule. The expansion includes some 3,400 cafes - including those in major cities such as San Francisco, Boston, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. - and extends the service to Android mobile device users.  Mobile Order & Pay is a feature on the Starbucks app, which the company says has 16 million active users on Apple and Android devices in the United States. Up until now, the app could only be used in-store to pay for a purchase. The new service allows users to place orders and pay for them from a remote location, and then pick up the order at the store. Adam Brotman, Starbucks’ chief digital officer, said the coffee chain refined a variety of features before the expansion.  Those help customers customize food and beverage orders, check local inventories for the availability of product and accurately calculate pick-up times. “We’re hearing (from users) that is creating a whole bunch of new occasions” to visit Starbucks, Brotman said. In particular, he said, it makes it easier for time-crunched workers and parents to drop in and for speech- and hearing-impaired customers to customize orders.  Starbucks, which declined to say how much the new feature has increased sales, plans to introduce it in select company-owned stores in the United Kingdom and Canada in October, Brotman said. Licensed stores in places such as restaurants, hotels and transit stations in the United States and elsewhere will follow. At the end of the latest quarter, Starbucks had          7,457 company-operated stores in the United States, as well as 1,006 in Canada and 476 in the United Kingdom. It had 4,888 licensed stores in the United States. Starbucks tested Mobile Order & Pay in Portland, Oregon, last December. It released it across the Pacific Northwest in March and gradually expanded its reach.  In July, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said Mobile Order & Pay was bolstering sales and profit at the roughly 4,000 U.S. cafes where it was available. He said the  technology had the potential to lure customers who may have been turned off by long lines and waiting times. “Lines are shorter, service is faster and in-store operations are more efficient” at cafes where the service is available, Schultz said at the time.

613,SBUX,Eurozone heavyweights resume tax offensive on multinational companies,"BRUSSELS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Finance ministers of euro zone’s major economies renewed on Tuesday their commitment to curb multinational corporations’ tax avoidance and called for more consistent rules to reduce “harmful” tax competition. Multinational companies have long been in the sights of European Union authorities because of the way they can legally reduce their bills by basing themselves in low-tax centres. Ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Spain agreed that more coordination at EU level are needed to prevent corporations from shifting profits to countries where they pay lower taxes. “We need collective rules to tackle harmful tax competition and aggressive tax planning,” French finance minister Michel Sapin told European lawmakers in a joint hearing in the EU Parliament in Brussels. His call was echoed by his counterparts from Germany, Italy and Spain. “Harmful tax competition increases profits in one state but compromises them in other states, preventing them from getting legitimate tax revenues,” Italy’s finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan said. These calls come as Europe’s Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is urging EU finance ministers to agree on sharing information about specific arrangements with corporations, known as tax rulings, at their next regular meeting on October 5. Tax rulings provide companies with information about their future tax bills when they settle in a country. “This in itself is neither illegal nor problematic but, if misused, tax rulings can facilitate or even encourage aggressive tax planning, resulting in a serious loss of revenue for member states,” Moscovici said in his blog. The EU is investigating the tax arrangements of Amazon  and Fiat in Luxembourg, Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands and may start new investigations. “Tax rulings should no longer be implemented to allow harmful tax planning,” German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers in the joint conference organised by a special committee set up in the European Parliament to tackle harmful tax rulings. As a disincentive against future aggressive tax deals, Moscovici wants states to set up a mechanism next year to  automatically exchange data on deals struck with corporations. He is also pushing for the disclosure of arrangements made up to at least 5 years ago. The Commission, the EU executive, also plans to launch a new proposal next year on a “common consolidated corporate tax base” (CCCTB) for multinational companies. The plan will have a first phase where only a common tax base would be introduced. Consolidation, the most contentious issue, would be introduced later and entail the elimination of tax avoidance practices. A previous attempt to bring in CCCTB drew opposition from member states who saw it as a first step towards harmonising tax rates, regarded as a sovereign issue.

Starbucks signed an agreement with Taste Holdings  in July that licensed the South African restaurant operator to develop and run Starbucks-branded coffee shops in Africa’s most advanced economy.

Taste, which also operates Domino’s Pizza outlets in South Africa, said it would start with at least 12 outlets in the next year before expanding further. Global restaurant brands are increasingly investing in Africa to join established international players such as McDonald’s Corp in tapping a growing middle class.

620,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Starbucks to switch to 100 pct cage-free eggs by 2020,"CHICAGO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp will switch to using only eggs laid by cage-free chickens at its North American locations within five years, the company told Reuters on Thursday. The company said it has been steadily working on making the switch since it began buying cage-free eggs in 2008. The pledge follows similar moves by McDonald’s Corp, Burger King Corp and food services company Sodexo SA . It is happening as North American egg suppliers are slowly starting to rebuild flocks after the worst bird flu outbreak in U.S. history. “While there is still work to be done across the industry to increase supply to address market conditions, we are committed to working with our suppliers toward our goal to be 100 percent cage-free by 2020,” Starbucks said in a statement. Cage-free eggs are produced by hens free to moved around inside a barn, as opposed to conventional eggs produced by hens that are packed in cages with other bird. The overall shift to phase out eggs laid by caged hens is expected to increase competition for limited supplies of cage-free eggs. It carries higher costs that may, at least initially, sting farmers. Starbucks set the 2020 deadline last Friday, when it updated its “Animal Welfare-Friendly Practices” on its company web site, a company official said.

624,SBUX,Starbucks in talks to bring brand to Italy: source,"MILAN (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), the world’s biggest coffee chain, is in talks with an Italian partner to open branches in Italy, one of the few major markets where it has yet to make an entrance, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Corriere della Sera newspaper reported that the U.S. company was negotiating with Italian businessman Antonio Percassi to bring the Starbucks brand to Italy. The paper said a deal was expected to be signed by Christmas. A source confirmed to Reuters that talks were underway. Asked about the report, Starbucks spokesman Corey duBrowa said: “Rumors and speculation only. We have nothing to say about it.” The Percassi group is based in Bergamo, near Milan, and owns cosmetics chain Kiko, which has more than 700 shops across Europe and the United States. It also has a franchising deal in Italy with U.S. lingerie chain Victoria’s Secret. The chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, has written in the past that he was inspired to open his first coffee shop after visiting Milan and admiring the city’s thriving cafe culture. His group has since opened cafes in dozens of countries, but has never ventured into Italy, despite the fact that it has the seventh highest per capita coffee consumption in Europe, according to the European Coffee Federation. Analysts have speculated that Italians might not take to Starbucks because they are used to short, sharp shots of caffeine which cost considerably less than Starbucks’ brews and are usually drunk in one or two gulps at a bar counter. If Starbucks does venture into Italy, it would be the second major U.S. brand to try to take on the locals at their own game in swift succession. Earlier this month the American pizza chain Domino’s opened a restaurant in Milan. Pizza is a national dish in Italy and Italians view foreign variations with suspicion.

639,SBUX,Stumptown in a K-Cup? Keurig deal brings margin opportunity,"NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Taking coffee maker Keurig Green Mountain Inc private will give JAB Holding Co an opportunity to press for higher margins and even increase prices for the single-serve K-Cups used in about 21 million U.S. homes, analysts and industry bankers said. JAB said on Monday it would buy Keurig for $13.9 billion, its biggest acquisition in a quest to build a global coffee powerhouse to better compete with Switzerland’s Nestle SA . The announcement prompted comparisons on Wall Street between JAB’s strategy and that of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev , though some industry watchers were sobered by the high price paid for Keurig, which is struggling with competition in single-serve pods and a failed product launch. While some of the more immediate benefits of a deal would come from JAB’s heightened leverage in sourcing coffee beans, the bigger opportunity lies in the greater profit of distributing JAB’s expanding portfolio of brands, including higher-end “craft” names like Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Caribou and Stumptown Coffee Roasters, analysts and bankers said. Some of those brands already produce K-Cups for Keurig machines under licensing agreements, but as company-owned brands those arrangements would provide higher margins. Overall, Keurig’s dominance of the U.S. single-serve market is a clear competitive advantage, said Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Athlos Research. “They (JAB) can handle the brand strategy, the partner strategy, any way they want.” JAB could also raise prices on pods, especially since Keurig will be privately held and face far fewer requirements to disclose how it runs its business, Feeney said. As a result, partners who have licensing agreements with Keurig to make the pods, such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin’ Brands Group , would not know how much Keurig is making from those deals and could find it harder to demand a greater cut. Whether Keurig will help JAB make greater inroads in Europe at the expense of Nestle remains a question, industry experts said, particularly in the single-serve market where Nestle serves espresso-style drinks rather than the American-style K-Cup which more closely resembles filter coffee. “I suspect they would need a modified machine,” said Robert Waldschmidt, a research analyst at investment bank Liberum. Others see room for more filter-style coffee in Europe. “Every meeting you go to, there is still a pot of coffee on the table that’s not espresso,” said one industry banker who was not involved in the deal. “There’s a lot of people drinking Americanos in Europe. There should be a market for this machine.” While significant risk exists that brands like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts could cut ties with Keurig once it is owned by JAB and opt for other partners to manufacture branded pods, analysts and bankers said it was unlikely. “These are significant streams of cash flow to these companies,” Feeney said. “It’s not trivial for them to say ‘OK we’ll just do this ourselves.’” Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment. Dunkin’ said in a statement that “we anticipate no change in how we work with Keurig.” JAB’s plan does not come cheap, as it will pay a 78 percent premium to Keurig’s closing share price as of Friday. “I do suspect they wanted to act quickly and in this instance certain key minority partners like (Coca-Cola Co ) are made whole,” Waldschmidt said. “This likely ensures that they get the deal done quickly with no competing bids.” ",12082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/keurig-ma-jab/stumptown-in-a-k-cup-keurig-deal-brings-margin-opportunity-idUSL1N13X2MI20151208

The U.S.-listed coffee chain paid 8.1 million pounds ($12.18 million) in tax, down from 11.4 million pounds for the same period last year.  Profit before tax grew to 34.2 million pounds for 2015 compared with 2 million pounds for the same period last year, the company said.

644,SBUX,Starbucks stock slips after profit forecast misses Street estimates,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) forecast current-quarter earnings below Wall Street estimates and reported slower growth in Asia than many had hoped, sending its shares down nearly 4 percent in extended trade despite a strong holiday performance.    Investor expectations are usually high for the company after a more than 46 percent run-up in its stock in 2015, and Starbucks is betting heavily on China expansion despite some signs of cooling growth in the Asian market. The company’s shares slipped to $56.35 in extended trade from a close of $59.03. Global sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 8 percent in the first quarter, while it rose 9 percent in the Americas division, its largest. Both handily beat analysts’ estimates. But sales in Europe were hit on a drop in tourists following the November Paris attacks and the strong dollar, which also hurt sales in its Asia/Pacific region, Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson said on an earnings call. Sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 5 percent in Asia/Pacific in the first quarter ended Dec. 27, missing the 6.10 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. “The concern is that some of this is related to a general slowdown in China which, if part of a longer term trend, could harm company earnings,” Carter Harrison, analyst at research firm Conlumino said.      Operating margins also declined 240 basis points to 19.4 percent in the region, primarily due to the impact of the company taking full ownership of Starbucks Japan in the quarter. Starbucks’ new mobile order and pay technology has boosted sales and profit in recent quarters. The technology has the potential to lure in customers who may have been turned off by long lines and waiting times. Sales in the United States were spurred by menu tweaks, which saw the inclusion of some more expensive drinks options and an enhanced range of food breakfast items, Harrison said. The company forecast second-quarter adjusted earnings to be between 38 cents to 39 cents per share, below analysts’ average estimate of 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total net revenue rose 11.9 percent to $5.37 billion in the first quarter.  Net income attributable to the company fell 30 percent to $687.6 million, or 46 cents per share.

649,SBUX,Starbucks still hot on China despite muted sales,"(Reuters) - Tepid growth in Asia might have taken some steam out of Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) latest quarterly sales, but both the company and analysts remain upbeat about the coffee chain’s prospects in China. Starbucks has been investing heavily in the world’s most populous country despite signs of cooling economic growth, and Chief Executive Howard Schultz said on Thursday that business in the country had never been stronger. “We believe one day (China) could very well be larger than the U.S. business,” Schultz said on a post-earnings call. Analysts said muted sales in the quarter were a blip. China is Starbucks’ largest market outside the United States. While comparable sales were muted in China in the latest quarter, Starbucks’ return on investment on its newest stores has strengthened, Cowen & Co analyst Andrew Charles noted. This, he said, is a more important indicator of the company’s growth prospects in China. Starbucks, whose shares were down 0.6 percent at midday on Friday, reported a 5 percent rise in comparable sales in the Asia-Pacific region in its first quarter ended Dec. 27. Analysts had expected a rise of 6.1 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Starbucks does not break out China sales.  Investor expectations are high for Starbucks, whose sales have risen at double-digit percentage rates for almost two years, so its shares get hit at the slightest sign of trouble. The stock fell as much as 5 percent after-hours on Thursday after the release of the results and a second-quarter earnings forecast that fell short of market expectations. Starbucks’ stock, which was trading at $58.65 on Friday, is far more expensive than peers, trading at 29.81 times forward 12-month earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with a median 23.61 in a sector that includes McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O). Still, analysts said it was a good time to buy Starbucks. “I recommend buying on the dip; not many restaurants can boast 8 percent comps, nearly 20 percent adjusted operating margins and 15 percent EPS growth. Who does that?” Argus Research analyst John Staszak said in an email to Reuters.     None of the 27 brokerages covering the company recommend selling the stock, and the median price target is $69, well above current levels, according to Thomson Reuters data. While Starbucks shares have risen 24 percent over the last 200 days, on Friday they came close to slipping below their 200-day moving average price for the first time in 15 years. This suggests the stock is cheaper than it has been for most of the past year.     <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Link to Graphic: Starbucks share performance vs. peers:  bit.ly/1S97TP6 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",1222016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-results-research/starbucks-still-hot-on-china-despite-muted-sales-idUSKCN0V028R

651,SBUX,Fitch Rates Starbucks' Proposed $500MM Note Issuance 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to  Starbucks Corporation's (Starbucks; NASDAQ: SBUX) proposed $500 million  aggregate issuance of fixed-rate five-year senior unsecured notes. At Dec. 27,  2015, Starbucks had approximately $2.3 billion of total debt. A full list of  Starbucks' ratings is provided at the end of this release. The notes will be issued under Starbucks' Aug. 23, 2007 indenture and will rank  equally with existing senior unsecured debt. Terms include a change of control  triggering event provision. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS Robust Operating Trends:  Starbucks robust operating trends are being enabled by mid to high single-digit  comp growth, increased points of distribution as the company opens new units and  expands via the grocery channel, and effective management of coffee costs.  Starbucks has locked in nearly all of its 2016 coffee needs at slightly  favorable year-over-year prices and is beginning to price its needs for 2017.  Global comparable sales (comps) have risen 5% or more for six consecutive years,  and net units have increased at a high single-digit rate. Comps increased 8% in  the first quarter ended Dec. 27, 2015 with transactions up 4% and average ticket  rising 4%. Fitch projects comps will increase 7% in fiscal 2016. Balanced Financial Strategy:  Starbucks has maintained strong financial discipline. Cash flow priorities are  to invest in its business and return cash to shareholders. The company has  maintained a dividend pay out to earnings in line with its 35% - 45% target and  has been prudent with share repurchases, funding buybacks mainly with internally  generated cash.  Starbucks good operating performance and balanced financial strategy has  resulted in strong credit metrics that are in line with Fitch's expectations.  For the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended Dec. 27, 2015, total adjusted  debt/operating EBITDAR (defined as total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating  EBITDA plus gross rents) was 2.0x and operating EBITDAR/gross interest expense  plus rent was 4.7x. Fitch expects leverage to remain near current levels for  fiscal 2016.  Strong Brand Equity, Leadership Starbucks market leadership in coffee, highly-respected brands, growing food,  tea and juice menu offerings, and ability to engage customers with the My  Starbucks Rewards program and mobile payment systems should help the company  continue to generate mid to high single-digit comp growth over the near-term.  Moreover, increased distribution within grocery and other retail outlets helps  strengthen Starbucks brand equity and customer loyalty. Food currently  represents approximately 20% of sales in U.S. stores and is contributing 2% - 3%  to comps. The company rolled out the final phase of Mobile Order & Pay  nationally across company-owned stores in September 2015 and expects to continue  to deploy the capability in key markets globally. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Starbucks include: --Revenue grows 11% - 12% in 2016 and 2017 driven by 6% - 7% comps and  high-single-digit net unit growth; --Modest EBITDA margin expansion in fiscal 2016 and 2017 due to higher gross  margins and slightly lower G&A; expenses; --Annual free cash flow (FCF) exceeds $1 billion annually; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR remains stable in the 2.0x range in  2016 and 2017.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action in the near term is not anticipated. However, a public  commitment to maintaining total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR in the  mid-1.0x range and a continuation of currently strong operating trends could  result in an upgrade.  A negative rating action would be considered if total adjusted debt-to-operating  EBITDAR is sustained above the 2.0-2.2x range due to a more aggressive financial  strategy, meaningful deceleration in comp growth, or material margin  contraction. Materially lower than expected FCF could also contribute to a  negative action. LIQUIDITY Starbucks had an estimated $3.9 billion of liquidity at Dec. 27, 2015 consisting  of $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and full availability under a  $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Nov. 6, 2020. Approximately $1.3  billion or 48% of Starbucks cash and investments, which totalled $2.7 billion,  was held in foreign subsidiaries. Terms of the facility include a minimum fixed  charge coverage ratio of 2.5x. Amounts outstanding under the company's $1  billion commercial paper (CP) program are backstopped by available commitments  under the revolver. At Dec. 27, 2015, there was no CP outstanding.

652,SBUX,UPDATE 4-PepsiCo revenue beats estimates as sales rise in North America,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N reported better-than-expected quarterly net revenue on Thursday as higher sales of snacks and non-fizzy beverages such as Gatorade in North America helped reduce the impact of a strong dollar. PepsiCo increased its annual dividend to $3.01 per share from $2.81 and said it would return about $7 billion to shareholders this year, with about $3 billion through buybacks. However, the company forecast 2016 adjusted earnings below many analyst estimates, citing a strong dollar and the exclusion of its Venezuelan business from its financial statements. Revenue from PepsiCo’s North American beverages business rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, accounting for 31.5 percent of total revenue. Wells Fargo Securities said in a pre-earnings note that its research showed that PepsiCo’s beverage sales in U.S. convenience stores rose 3.2 percent in the quarter, helped by aggressive pricing and “solid” sales of Gatorade and Starbucks (SBUX.O) ready-to-drink coffee, which Pepsi distributes. PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said warmer-than-usual weather also helped the company’s drinks business. “Gatorade does well when the temperature’s above normal,” she said on a conference call with analysts. Higher prices and reduced pack sizes helped boost revenue by 2 percent in the company’s North America snack foods business, which includes Frito-lay and Doritos chips. “Pricing in North America is a key bright spot for PEP,” Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic wrote in a note. PepsiCo, whose shares were down 1.3 percent at $96.33 in morning trading, reduced the size of its Frito’s promotional potato chip bags in the United States last year, but retained pricing. Traditional rival Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit on Tuesday, helped by sales of smaller cans and bottles, aggressive cost-cutting and lower commodity costs. Frito-Lay North America and the North America beverage business were the only two PepsiCo units to report higher revenue in the quarter. Net income attributable to PepsiCo rose 31 percent to $1.72 billion, or $1.17 per share in the period. Excluding items, the company earned $1.06 per share, in line with analysts estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue fell 7 percent to $18.59 billion, but beat analysts average estimate of $18.51 billion. PepsiCo forecast 2016 adjusted earnings of $4.66 per share. This was short of the average I/B/E/S estimate of $4.76, although it was not immediately clear if the figures were strictly comparable. PepsiCo said it expected organic revenue growth of about 4 percent in 2016. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic:  Coca-Cola and Pepsico earnings    (here) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",2112016,http://www.reuters.com/article/pepsico-results/update-4-pepsico-revenue-beats-estimates-as-sales-rise-in-north-america-idUSL3N15Q2OU

655,SBUX,Starbucks tightens rewards program rules,"LOS ANGELES, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Monday announced changes to its North American loyalty program that will mean some customers will have to spend more money at the coffee chain to earn free food and drinks. Under Starbucks’ current rewards program rules, customers earn redeemable points for every purchase. The new program will award points for every dollar spent, a change that is sure to spark complaints from customers who are used to accumulating points with frequent purchases of drip coffee and other lower-cost items. The widely anticipated change from the Seattle-based company comes as airlines and other companies have been tweaking their rewards programs to make them generally less generous to consumers. Starbucks customers now earn one “star” per purchase and may redeem 12 stars for a free food and drink item. Starting in mid-April, customers will get two stars for every $1 spent and need 125 stars to get a free item. Matthew Ryan, Starbucks global chief strategy officer, said the change was not a way to weaken Starbucks’ rewards program. However, he acknowledged that 1 percent of the chain’s total transactions now come from customers who request two or more transactions to earn stars more quickly.

Alstead had resigned from his position effective Feb. 29, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. (bit.ly/1T6ApTi) Alstead, who helped lead Stabucks’ extensive restructuring a few years ago, had been with the company for more than two decades. The company named director Kevin Johnson chief operating officer in January last year.

664,SBUX,Dunkin' Donuts to target Starbucks customers after loyalty scheme shake-up,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Donuts is on a drive to win customers from Starbucks after the rival coffee and snacks chain changed its loyalty scheme to favor higher spending customers over frequent buyers.  Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), told Reuters he expected some Starbucks (SBUX.O) customers to be angered by the move, creating an opportunity for his company’s doughnut and coffee shops to win them over.  “We feel excited about the change to Starbucks’ loyalty program,” he said in an interview during a trip to Frankfurt. “We’ve been targeting customers with $5 gift cards,” he added, while declining to quantify the possible impact on the Dunkin’ Donuts business. Under Starbucks’ previous rewards program, customers earned redeemable points for every purchase, whereas the new program awards points for every dollar spent, putting customers who buy cheaper items at a disadvantage. Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said after Starbucks’ announcement last month that its customers would have to spend $62.50 to receive their first beverage reward, compared with $40 under Dunkin’ Donuts’ loyalty program. He estimates customer defections from Starbucks could add roughly 0.25 to 0.4 percentage points to sales growth at Dunkin’ Donuts, excluding new outlets. That would be a welcome boost for Dunkin’ Donuts, which saw same-store sales in the United States slip by 0.8 percent last quarter, as the launch of all-day breakfast by McDonald’s (MCD.N) and value-meal offers by rivals lured customers away. British-born Travis, who previously held executive positions at video rental chain Blockbuster and pizza group Papa John’s (PZZA.O), also said his group was eyeing growth in Europe. The Canton, Massachusetts-based company added a net 55 Dunkin’ Donuts franchise stores across Europe in 2015, bringing the total there to 221. In Germany, where it has 70 outlets, Dunkin’ aims to add about 20 a year, said Travis, who drinks seven cups of coffee a day. He also said he was confident Dunkin’ could make its business in Britain work, where it has had a rough start after announcing in 2013 a return to the market nearly two decades after exiting.

668,SBUX,UPDATE 1-Coffee wars: South Korea's cafe boom nears saturation point,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s coffee shop craze is frothing over. In fashionable retail and commercial districts of southern Seoul, nearly one in every two buildings boasts a coffee shop - evidence of a boom that has delivered dizzying growth for the likes of Starbucks and local chains. But now the market is getting even more crowded, as convenience stores such as 7-Eleven offer 1,000 won (87 cents) cups, and smaller players are feeling the heat. “We declared an emergency situation, gathered all employees eight times to debate strategies,” Moon Chang-ki, CEO of mid-priced coffee chain Ediya, the country’s largest operator by location with about 1,800 stores, told reporters recently. “If we sell at that price, our store owners won’t earn any margins.”  To compete, Ediya says it has instead focused on improving the quality of its coffee, and actually raised prices last year. Other chains have responded to growing competition by cutting back on store numbers and staff, or expanding overseas. The number of chain and stand-alone coffee shops in South Korea more than tripled to about 49,600 in 2015 from 12,400 in 2011, according to Korea Contents Media - far faster than overall consumption of coffee, which Koreans have been drinking for decades. With more than 17,000 coffee shops in a city of over 10 million, or about 17 per 10,000 people, Seoul has more coffee shops per capita than Starbucks’ hometown Seattle, at 15 per 10,000, or San Francisco, at 14.7, according to city of Seoul data and research providers FindTheHome and FindTheCompany. South Korea’s per capita coffee consumption has nearly doubled since 1990 to 2.3 kg (5 lb) per person, according to the International Coffee Organization - still roughly half the 4.5 kg that Americans consume. Revenue growth at coffee chains in the country slowed to about 8 percent in 2014, however, from more than 20 percent annually between 2008 and 2012, analysts say. While the number of new coffee shops in Seoul increased, so did closures, according to city data. Brewed coffee sales at 7-Eleven, run by Lotte Shopping’s Korea Seven Co Ltd, jumped 88 percent in 2015 after it introduced drip coffee early last year costing about a dollar, almost one-fifth the cost of an average Starbucks cup. McDonald’s Corp stores cut coffee prices to 1,500 won from 2,100 won early last year, and have seen sales of the beverage almost triple, the company told Reuters. By contrast, local chain Cafe Droptop, with about 225 shops, cut about 20 percent of its workforce at the end of 2015. Another chain, Coffine Gurunaru, with about 100 shops, incurred combined operating losses of 2.5 billion won ($2.2 million) in 2013 and 2014 after being profitable in the previous two years, filings show. “Even fried chicken restaurants and pubs are adding coffee, trying to be a cafe, while espresso machines are spreading in offices,” said Lee Kyung-hee, who heads the Korea Business Strategy Institute, a consultancy. “The coffee industry is fighting a war without borders.” Starbucks entered the market in 1999, and is widely credited with starting the country’s habit for splurging on higher-quality coffee and creating a cafe industry SK Securities said was worth about 2.5 trillion won ($2.2 billion) in 2014.  Starbucks Coffee Korea, a 50-50 joint venture between the world’s biggest coffee chain and South Korean hypermarket operator E-Mart, now has 860 stores, putting the country behind only China and Japan as the company’s biggest markets in Asia, with sales more than doubling between 2011 and 2014. It posted a 20 percent increase in net profit to 30.77 billion won in 2014, the most recent year for which results are available, on revenue of 617 billion won, up 28 percent. But with industry growth slowing, some chains have been pushing abroad. Caffe Bene, which reached 932 domestic stores in 2014 before trimming back to 850 at the end of March, posted a 3.3 billion won net loss in the first three quarters of 2015, according to the latest public data.  Last month, a joint venture between Singapore’s Food Empire and Indonesia’s Salim Group acquired a 38 percent stake in Caffe Bene, becoming the second biggest shareholder after South Korean private equity fund K3 Equity Partners. The chain said it was looking to expand in Southeast Asia to drive growth. Zoo Coffee, with 65 domestic shops, has opened about 200 franchise stores in China since entering the country in 2013 and in December announced a tie-up with China’s giant Dalian Wanda Group to open 50 stores per year there.  Cafe Droptop in November opened its first overseas outlet in Shanghai.

670,SBUX,"UPDATE 5-Starbucks cafe sales growth falls short, shares fall","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Thursday posted quarterly cafe sales that missed analysts’ growth estimates for every region where it operates and issued a disappointing full-year forecast, sending its shares down about 4 percent. The world’s largest coffee chain said global sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 6 percent in the fiscal second quarter ended March 27, compared with the year-ago period. Analysts had expected an overall same-cafe sales gain of 6.7 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Starbucks is one of the industry’s best performers, delivering steady growth by entering new markets and finding diverse ways to boost revenue. Even with the sell-off, the stock was trading at $58.20 after hours, near its all-time high of $62.57 on Oct. 1. Sales at established cafes in the Americas region grew 7 percent, after rising 9 percent in the first quarter. Starbucks, which is investing in mobile ordering and payments to win more business, recently irked some customers by tweaking its popular loyalty program to give rewards based on dollars spent rather than number of purchases. “We may see some noise in Q3 comps as customers react to the new changes of the program,” Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson told analysts on a conference call after earnings were released. Program membership grew 16 percent year-over-year to 12 million in the United States, Starbucks said. The China/Asia Pacific region (CAP), where Starbucks has expanded aggressively in recent years, posted 3 percent sales growth. Company executives said Starbucks’ China business remains strong even as the economy there cools. The inclusion of results from slower-growing Japan weighed on the results, they said. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) had sales growth of 1 percent. “This was in an extremely challenging consumer, economic, geopolitical environment across the region,” Johnson said. Analysts had expected gains of 4.6 percent from CAP and 3.4 percent from EMEA. Seattle-based Starbucks narrowed its full-year profit forecast to $1.88 to $1.89 per share, from a previous range of $1.87 to $1.89. Analysts’ estimates were at the top end of that range, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Second-quarter net income was $575.1 million, or 39 cents per share, matching the average of analysts’ profit estimates complied by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year earlier, Starbucks had net income of $494.9 million, or 33 cents per share.

673,SBUX,"Analysts look past Starbucks vanilla numbers, focus on mobile push","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) quarterly numbers may not have been enough to satisfy investors craving a stronger cup of joe, but analysts believe its long-term growth prospects remain solid. Shares of the world’s largest coffee chain fell nearly 6 percent on Friday, a day after Starbucks reported second-quarter comparable sales growth below Wall Street’s expectations.  Yet, the stock is not too far from the record high it hit in October. It has risen 16 percent from its 2016 low touched on Feb. 8, staying more expensive than shares of Dunkin Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N). “We remain convinced that Starbucks’ digital platform, including the rapidly growing Mobile Order & Pay, continues to be a significant competitive advantage and long-term sales driver,” BTIG analysts wrote in a note. “We see any near-term sales disruption as minor compared to the significance of the program,” BTIG analysts wrote.  Starbucks irked some customers by tweaking its popular loyalty program, giving rewards based on dollars spent rather than number of purchases.  Growth in sales at Starbucks cafes in the Americas open for at least a year slowed to 7 percent in the quarter from 9 percent in the first quarter. The company gets about two-thirds of its total revenue from the region. Investors had likely expected an increase of 8 percent, Nomura analysts said. Starbucks has been investing in digital initiatives such as Mobile Order & Pay, which lets customers place orders and make payments through an app and pick their orders up from an outlet.  The bet seems to be paying off. Mobile Order & Pay usage doubled in the second quarter, with the company processing 8 million transactions per month. “We believe Starbucks mobile platform is truly in a league of its own,” analysts at Wells Fargo Securities said. Consumers are increasingly using their smartphones to shop and they are eating out more regularly, and Starbucks is in a pole position to capitalize on these trends, the analysts said. Of the 29 brokerages covering Starbucks shares, 24 have a “buy” or higher rating, according to Thomson Reuters data. None recommends selling the stock. The median price target on the stock is $69. Starbucks shares touched a low of $57.07 in late morning trading on Friday. The stock’s intrinsic value is $39.83, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

674,SBUX,US STOCKS-Wall Street ends flat; Alphabet and Microsoft tumble,"(Reuters) - Wall Street finished flat on Friday after disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft and Alphabet slammed tech stocks, while a surge in oil prices lifted energy shares. The S&P; technology sector dropped 1.9 percent, its worst decline since early February, with Facebook down 2.5 percent and Intel falling 1.03 percent. Microsoft dropped 7.17 percent, contributing the biggest drag to the S&P; 500, and Google-parent Alphabet lost 5.41 percent as investors punished both companies for missing profit and revenue estimates. It was Alphabet’s worst day since 2012. Helped by a softer dollar and a recovery in oil prices, the S&P; 500 has rebounded from a steep selloff earlier this year and is only about 2 percent short of last May’s record high.  Wall Street has rock-bottom expectations as companies post their first-quarter results over the next few weeks, with S&P; 500 companies on average seen reporting a 7.1-percent fall in profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Crude rose over 1 percent on signs of strong U.S. gasoline consumption, declining production around the world and oilfield outages. Oil prices have moved in lockstep with U.S. stocks for several months and some investors expected more gains next week.  So far, 77 percent of first-quarter earnings have exceeded expectations, which is superior to the 63-percent beat rate in a typical quarter. “What’s driving the market right now is earnings and oil,” said Thomas Wilson, Managing Director of Wealth Advisory at Brinker Capital.  “If earnings results come in above the very low bar of expectations that are out there, and you combine that with a continued rising price of oil, that should equate to an upward trend in the market next week.”  The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.12 percent to end at 18,003.75 points, while the S&P; 500 finished flat at 2,091.58. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8 percent to 4,906.23, reflecting the selloff in tech shares. Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors rose, with energy up 1.33 percent.

678,SBUX,"Analysts look past Starbucks vanilla numbers, focus on mobile push","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) quarterly numbers may not have been enough to satisfy investors craving a stronger cup of joe, but analysts believe its long-term growth prospects remain solid. Shares of the world’s largest coffee chain fell nearly 6 percent on Friday, a day after Starbucks reported second-quarter comparable sales growth below Wall Street’s expectations.  Yet, the stock is not too far from the record high it hit in October. It has risen 16 percent from its 2016 low touched on Feb. 8, staying more expensive than shares of Dunkin Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N). “We remain convinced that Starbucks’ digital platform, including the rapidly growing Mobile Order & Pay, continues to be a significant competitive advantage and long-term sales driver,” BTIG analysts wrote in a note. “We see any near-term sales disruption as minor compared to the significance of the program,” BTIG analysts wrote.  Starbucks irked some customers by tweaking its popular loyalty program, giving rewards based on dollars spent rather than number of purchases.  Growth in sales at Starbucks cafes in the Americas open for at least a year slowed to 7 percent in the quarter from 9 percent in the first quarter. The company gets about two-thirds of its total revenue from the region. Investors had likely expected an increase of 8 percent, Nomura analysts said. Starbucks has been investing in digital initiatives such as Mobile Order & Pay, which lets customers place orders and make payments through an app and pick their orders up from an outlet.  The bet seems to be paying off. Mobile Order & Pay usage doubled in the second quarter, with the company processing 8 million transactions per month. “We believe Starbucks mobile platform is truly in a league of its own,” analysts at Wells Fargo Securities said. Consumers are increasingly using their smartphones to shop and they are eating out more regularly, and Starbucks is in a pole position to capitalize on these trends, the analysts said. Of the 29 brokerages covering Starbucks shares, 24 have a “buy” or higher rating, according to Thomson Reuters data. None recommends selling the stock. The median price target on the stock is $69. Starbucks shares touched a low of $57.07 in late morning trading on Friday. The stock’s intrinsic value is $39.83, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

679,SBUX,US STOCKS-Wall St flat as earnings fail to excite investors,"* S&P; tech sector worst performer on S&P; 500 * Microsoft drag on all three indexes * McDonald’s up on profit beat * Dow up 0.07 pct, S&P; down 0.07 pct, Nasdaq down 0.72 pct   (Updates to open) By Abhiram Nandakumar April 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were flat on Friday after poor quarterly reports from technology bellwethers Microsoft and Alphabet outweighed gains from steadying oil prices. Microsoft was the biggest drag on all three major indexes. Crude rose about 1 percent on signs of strong gasoline consumption in the United States. With recent economic data indicating a sluggish pace of economic growth globally and crude prices hovering near five-month highs, earnings have become a swing factor for stocks. The S&P; 500 has staged a sharp recovery from a steep selloff earlier this year and is inching towards its all-time high, helped by a recent rebound in oil, a cautious Federal Reserve and companies beating tempered expectations. The index is up half a percent for the week, having posted gains on the first three days. “We’re back to the every other day theory, bouncing around a little, but I don’t see too strong a sentiment either way,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “It’s still a very cautious environment,” Brown said, adding that the negative tone from the quarterly reports were expected. At 9:42 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 11.91 points, or 0.07 percent, at 17,994.43, the S&P; 500  was down 1.52 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,089.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 35.84 points, or 0.72 percent, at 4,910.05. Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, but the index was under pressure by a 1.4 percent decline in the technology sector Alphabet and Microsoft were down 3.7 and 6.5 percent respectively after both missed profit and revenue estimates. S&P; 500 companies are seen posting a 7.2 percent fall in first-quarter profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and shares of companies failing to beat the already lowered expectations are getting hammered. McDonald’s rose 0.7 percent to $126.63 after the company’s profit beat estimates. General Electric was off 1.1 percent at $30.63 after it reported lower organic revenue. Caterpillar shares were down 0.6 percent at $78.16 after its results. Starbucks slipped 3 percent after missing sales expectations, while Visa was down 2.3 percent after it cut full-year revenue forecast. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,885 to 761. On the Nasdaq, 1,460 issues rose and 740 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed six new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and six lows.

694,SBUX,Starbucks customers may seek damages over underfilled lattes: judge,"(Reuters) - A federal judge said two Starbucks (SBUX.O) customers may pursue a lawsuit accusing the coffee chain of cheating patrons by underfilling lattes. In a decision on Friday, U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco said the California plaintiffs may seek damages from Starbucks Corp in their proposed nationwide class action, including for fraud and false advertising. Starbucks was accused of overcharging customers by systematically serving lattes that are 25 percent too small, based on a recipe it adopted in 2009 to save money on milk. The plaintiffs, Siera Strumlauf of San Francisco and Benjamin Robles of Carlsbad, said Starbucks requires baristas to use pitchers for heating milk with etched “fill to” lines that are too low, and to leave 1/4 inch of free space in drink cups. They said this shorts customers because Starbucks’ cups for tall, grande and venti lattes hold exactly 12, 16 and 20 ounces. “This is not a case where the alleged deception is simply implausible as a matter of law,” Henderson wrote. “The court finds it probable that a significant portion of the latte-consuming public could believe that a ‘Grande’ contains 16 ounces of fluid.” Henderson did not rule on the case’s merits. He dismissed three of the plaintiffs’ eight claims against Seattle-based Starbucks, as well as their request for injunctive relief. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges on Monday said the company believes the lawsuit is without merit and is prepared to defend itself against the remaining claims.

699,SBUX,Starbucks workers petition for more hours amid labor cuts,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An online petition accusing Starbucks Corp of “extreme” cutbacks in work hours at its U.S. cafes, hurting both employee morale and customer service, has been signed by more than 9,000 people. The world’s biggest coffee chain, trying to address cooling growth at its U.S. shops, recently introduced technology that  allows customers to order and pay from mobile devices. That service aims to boost sales and reduce bottlenecks in stores. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz and other top brass  have spoken with Jaime Prater, a Southern California barista and the online petition’s creator, the Seattle-based company said. It declined to give details but Starbucks spokeswoman Jaime Riley said it is not uncommon for Schultz to reach out to members of its 160,000-strong U.S. workforce. She also said no nationwide cutback in labor hours or jobs was underway at Starbucks stores. Starbucks has a software system that determines labor needs based on business trends. Store managers can work with leadership in their respective regions to determine labor needs based on any factors not taken into account by the system, Riley said. Prater told Reuters he is cautiously optimistic after executives said they are looking into the issues raised in the petition. “There is a small window right now” to act, he said. Comments on the petition painted a picture of broad discontent at the company known for offering better wages and benefits than other chains, including healthcare coverage, retirement account contributions and paid vacation days. Prater and many signers say they noticed cutbacks in U.S. staffing hours after Starbucks in April reported a deceleration in quarterly cafe sales growth. Several of them said store managers were under pressure to comply with the dictates of  Starbucks’ software system. Almost 7,000 signers of the petition described themselves as employees, according to Prater. They did not give their full names and Reuters was not immediately able to confirm that signers worked for Starbucks. “The labor situation has gone from tight to infuriating,” Prater said. One central California store has seen its labor allotment shrunk by about 10 percent, even though sales are up, its manager, who asked not to be identified for fear or reprisal, told Reuters.

700,SBUX,Starbucks accused of slashing employee work hours amid cost cuts,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An online petition accusing Starbucks Corp of “extreme” cutbacks in work hours at its U.S. cafes, hurting both employee morale and customer service, has been signed by more than 9,000 people. The world’s biggest coffee chain, trying to address cooling growth at its U.S. shops, recently introduced technology that  allows customers to order and pay from mobile devices. That service aims to boost sales and reduce bottlenecks in stores. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz and other top brass  have spoken with Jaime Prater, a Southern California barista and the online petition’s creator, the Seattle-based company said. It declined to give details but Starbucks spokeswoman Jaime Riley said it is not uncommon for Schultz to reach out to members of its 160,000-strong U.S. workforce. She also said no nationwide cutback in labor hours or jobs was underway at Starbucks stores. Starbucks has a software system that determines labor needs based on business trends. Store managers can work with leadership in their respective regions to determine labor needs based on any factors not taken into account by the system, Riley said. Prater told Reuters he is cautiously optimistic after executives said they are looking into the issues raised in the petition.  “There is a small window right now” to act, he said. Comments on the petition painted a picture of broad discontent at the company known for offering better wages and benefits than other chains, including healthcare coverage, retirement account contributions and paid vacation days. Prater and many signers say they noticed cutbacks in U.S. staffing hours after Starbucks in April reported a deceleration in quarterly cafe sales growth. Several of them said store managers were under pressure to comply with the dictates of  Starbucks’ software system.  Almost 7,000 signers of the petition described themselves as employees, according to Prater. They did not give their full names and Reuters was not immediately able to confirm that signers worked for Starbucks.  “The labor situation has gone from tight to infuriating,” Prater said. One central California store has seen its labor allotment shrunk by about 10 percent, even though sales are up, its manager, who asked not to be identified for fear or reprisal, told Reuters. Similar complaints were heard from many signers of the online petition. “No matter what we do to save on labor at my store, the system tells us EVERY SINGLE DAY that we are at least 8 hours over in labor for the day and have to cut even more,” wrote   signer Aaron I. “We’re suffering, & so are our customers.

704,SBUX,Starbucks to raise wages for U.S. workers in October,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp said it will raise worker pay in its U.S. stores this autumn, after employees accused the coffee chain of “extreme” cutbacks in work hours that they say are hurting morale and service. The world’s biggest coffee chain will increase base pay for all U.S. baristas and managers at company-operated stores by at least 5 percent starting Oct. 3, Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in a letter to employees on Monday. Starbucks, which recently announced price increases for some drinks, also will double the annual stock reward to hourly employees who have worked at company-operated stores for at least two years. Combined, the steps will result in a wage hike of 5 percent to 15 percent for roughly 150,000 workers in 7,600 U.S. cafes, Starbucks said. More than 12,800 people, including many self-identified Starbucks workers, have signed an online petition laying out the employee complaints.  Beyond worries about customer service and morale, petition commenters said they were not getting enough hours to make ends meet or to afford Starbucks benefits, including healthcare and college tuition reimbursement. CEO Schultz said the company would address scheduling concerns.  “You have my personal commitment that we will work with every partner (employee) to ensure you have the hours you need,” he said. The company, which has been grappling with cooling sales growth at its popular cafes, has repeatedly said there is no nationwide reduction in labor hours at the chain. Schultz did not directly reference the petition or employee concerns about labor hour cuts in his letter on Monday.      “Howard Schultz did not acknowledge or validate the labor crisis in the stores,” said petition author Jaime Prater, a Los Angeles-area Starbucks barista. “Until that is addressed, or simply acknowledged, my job isn’t finished.”  Seattle-based Starbucks has a reputation for offering better pay and benefits than many other chains. As a result, it has been largely unaffected by a union-supported multiyear restaurant worker wage campaign that has helped spur minimum wage increases in major cities and states, as well as pay raises at companies like McDonald’s Corp. Still, Starbucks is not immune from the pressure that rising wages is putting on restaurant operators, who now must compete to hire and keep the best workers. “Restaurants have to step up and pay people more,” said BTIG restaurant analyst Peter Saleh. Starbucks’ new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. A company spokeswoman said it is moving merit increases to October 2016 from early 2017, but declined to say how this round of raises would differ from prior annual adjustments.  Starbucks already has announced $275 million in incremental employee and digital investments for 2015 and 2016. A significant portion of that is earmarked for wages.   The chain recently introduced potentially labor-saving technology that allows customers to order and pay for drinks and other products via mobile phones and other devices.

715,SBUX,"Starbucks cafe sales miss targets as growth cools, stock falls","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) reported quarterly cafe sales growth that fell short of expectations in all major markets as customers made fewer visits, sending its shares down almost 3 percent on Thursday. Results from the United States, which contributes the lion’s share of sales and profits, missed targets due to the delayed start of a popular Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion and weaker demand that executives attributed to a contentious U.S. presidential election campaign, terrorist attacks and civil unrest. The world’s largest coffee chain reported that global sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 4 percent in the fiscal third quarter ended June 26, well short of the 5.6 percent gain analysts had expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The U.S.-dominated Americas region posted 4 percent growth, short of analysts’ call for a 6.1 percent gain, after rising 7 percent in the second quarter and 9 percent in the first quarter. Customer transactions in the Americas were flat for the quarter, when Starbucks also changed its rewards program to remove the incentive to split orders to accumulate points faster. Chief Executive Howard Schultz called the U.S. cafe results “an anomaly,” and said Starbucks was confident that it could again achieve quarterly same-restaurant sales growth of 5 percent or more.

716,SBUX,"UPDATE 4-Starbucks cafe sales miss targets as growth cools, stock falls","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) reported quarterly cafe sales growth that fell short of expectations in all major markets as customers made fewer visits, sending its shares down almost 3 percent on Thursday. Results from the United States, which contributes the lion’s share of sales and profits, missed targets due to the delayed start of a popular Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion and weaker demand that executives attributed to a contentious U.S. presidential election campaign, terrorist attacks and civil unrest. The world’s largest coffee chain reported that global sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 4 percent in the fiscal third quarter ended June 26, well short of the 5.6 percent gain analysts had expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The U.S.-dominated Americas region posted 4 percent growth, short of analysts’ call for a 6.1 percent gain, after rising 7 percent in the second quarter and 9 percent in the first quarter. Customer transactions in the Americas were flat for the quarter, when Starbucks also changed its rewards program to remove the incentive to split orders to accumulate points faster. Chief Executive Howard Schultz called the U.S. cafe results “an anomaly,” and said Starbucks was confident that it could again achieve quarterly same-restaurant sales growth of 5 percent or more.

The S&P; 500 and Dow are trading at record highs on upbeat sentiment over second-quarter corporate earnings, with analysts now expecting smaller profit declines and more companies topping those estimates. However reports from Intel and transport companies sapped some of the momentum on Thursday, while reports overnight and on Friday were also tepid. Dow component GE’s shares fell 2.3 percent to $31.85 premarket after the company reaffirmed its full-year operating forecast. Honeywell dropped 2.3 percent to $115.85 after lowering its full-year sales forecast, despite a market-beating quarterly profit. “The market is digesting a very strong post-Brexit rally,” said Adam Sarhan, Chief Executive of Sarhan Capital. “At this stage of the game, it deserves a bullish benefit of the doubt and has the right to just pause as investors assess a slew of earnings.” Dow e-minis were up 25 points, or 0.14 percent at 8:20 a.m. ET (1220 GMT), with 22,403 contracts changing hands.

Starbucks declined 1.7 percent to $56.62 after its sales growth fell short of expectations in all major markets.

Tingyi, owner of the Master Kong brand, said profit fell to $12 million in the three months through June, from $91 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue dropped 18 percent to $2.092 billion. “In the second half of the year, there still exists relatively great pressure on economic development,” Chairman Wei Ing-Chou said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

737,SBUX,Dunkin' partners with Coca-Cola on bottled coffee,"(Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Thursday its doughnut chain will partner with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to launch a line of bottled coffee beverages in the United States, its first foray into the ready-to-drink coffee market dominated by rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). The Dunkin’ Donuts chain operator said the beverages, set to launch in early 2017, will be manufactured, distributed and sold by Coca-Cola. The bottled iced coffees, which will include milk and sugar in a variety of flavors, will be sold at supermarkets, convenience stores and in Dunkin’ Donuts shops. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Dunkin’ Brands Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters that the new venture will appeal to existing customers and also build brand recognition.  “Some of our Dunkin’ consumers were drinking other people’s products because we weren’t there,” Travis said.     The cold beverages, like the packaged coffees Dunkin’ Donuts already sells through various retail channels, also are expected to introduce consumers to the chain’s flavor profile. That can help build interest in the brand as it expands into new U.S. markets, Travis said.  Dunkin’ will split net profits from the sales of ready-to-drink coffee sold outside its shops with U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees, with the highest revenue-producing operators receiving the largest percentage of that share. Starbucks, which has sold canned and bottled coffee drinks in North America since 1994, controls about 97 percent of the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee market in a 50-50 partnership with PepsiCo Inc PEP.N. (bit.ly/2dcRuvU) Starbucks reaped more than $2.1 billion from its division that includes packaged drink and coffee sales during the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, 2015.  Travis declined to forecast sales for Dunkin’s ready-to-drink products. Dunkin’ has partnered with Coca-Cola since 2012 to serve Coke beverages at its coffee chains in the United States and certain other countries.

744,SBUX,Starbucks plans new 'Reserve' targets in super-premium battle,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz on Thursday unveiled new growth plans for the chain’s upscale Reserve brand as it fights off competition from super-premium coffee rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. Starbucks, which was instrumental in shifting U.S. consumers to higher-quality coffee and espresso-based drinks, will have Reserve coffee “bars” in up to 1,000 Starbucks cafes by the end of 2017 in a bid to one day dominate the so-called “third wave” coffee movement. Most of those Starbucks Reserve bars will be in the United States, and a handful already have opened in New York City, Schultz said in an interview with Reuters. Over time, Starbucks also expects to open as many as 1,000 cafes that exclusively sell Reserve coffees, Schultz said. Starbucks opened its first Reserve coffee roastery and tasting room in Seattle in late 2014. That 15,000-square-foot facility, which Schultz has described as a “magical coffee ride,” roasts limited-supply Reserve coffees that sell for up to $50 per 8-ounce package. Roastery baristas prepare coffee using a variety of uncommon methods, such as siphon brewing, which was popularized by Blue Bottle and other super-premium cafe operators. Starbucks plans to open its second roastery in Shanghai in 2017. New York City and Tokyo will follow in 2018, Schultz said.

745,SBUX,Starbucks plans new 'Reserve' targets in super-premium battle,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Howard Schultz on Thursday unveiled new growth plans for the chain’s upscale Reserve brand as it fights off competition from super-premium coffee rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. Starbucks, which was instrumental in shifting U.S. consumers to higher-quality coffee and espresso-based drinks, will have Reserve coffee “bars” in up to 1,000 Starbucks cafes by the end of 2017 in a bid to one day dominate the so-called “third wave” coffee movement. Most of those Starbucks Reserve bars will be in the United States, and a handful already have opened in New York City, Schultz said in an interview with Reuters. Over time, Starbucks also expects to open as many as 1,000 cafes that exclusively sell Reserve coffees, Schultz said. Starbucks opened its first Reserve coffee roastery and tasting room in Seattle in late 2014. That 15,000-square-foot facility, which Schultz has described as a “magical coffee ride,” roasts limited-supply Reserve coffees that sell for up to $50 per 8-ounce package. Roastery baristas prepare coffee using a variety of uncommon methods, such as siphon brewing, which was popularized by Blue Bottle and other super-premium cafe operators. Starbucks plans to open its second roastery in Shanghai in 2017. New York City and Tokyo will follow in 2018, Schultz said. Blue Bottle, known for its exotic, micro-lot coffees, has shops in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo. Its backers include Fidelity Management and Research Company, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and Oscar-winning actor Jared Leto.

751,SBUX,Key week for Tata tussle as Mistry faces Tata Motors board,"* Tata Motors board to meet on Monday to discuss Q2 results * Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman in board coup last month * Tata drags shareholders of group cos into fight against Mistry * Mistry tried to streamline corporate governance at Tata By Aditi Shah and Abhirup Roy MUMBAI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Tata Motors, owner of Jaguar Land Rover and makers of India’s cheapest car, will on Monday become the latest piece of the Tata empire to be dragged into a battle over its future, in a test case for parent Tata Sons’ efforts to tighten control. The $100 billion Tata group has been mired in a public spat with former holding company chairman Cyrus Mistry since last month, when he was abruptly ousted from the top job - an acrimonious tussle that has revived debate around India’s corporate governance and Tata’s complex structure. Removing him from individual group companies, however, has been trickier, and Mistry is still at the helm of several key Tata boards, including Tata Motors, whose board meets on Monday, and Tata Steel - among the best known units of the sprawling salt-to-software group. “Tata Motors ... generates a substantial profit and revenues, so it is important for Tatas to have control over the board,” said Shriram Subramanian, managing director of InGovern Research Services, a firm advising institutional investors. Tata on Thursday wrenched Mistry out of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), 73 percent controlled by the group and the conglomerate’s star performer. But it has struggled with other subsidiaries where ownership is closer to 30 percent. Boards at Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals voted to keep Mistry as chairman last week. The board of Tata Motors will meet later on Monday to consider second-quarter earnings before those are reported later in the day. Directors of Tata Global Beverages, which co-owns and runs Starbucks coffee stores across India, meet on Tuesday. If the Tata Motors board does not oust Mistry, Tata Sons will have to turn to shareholder meetings. Tata Sons has already called for extraordinary general meetings across its companies to remove Mistry as a director, including Indian Hotels Co , Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Motors. Tata Sons has blamed Mistry’s abrupt exit on what it called breach of trust and poor performance, accusing him of eroding shareholder value. It has also said Mistry tried to reduce the role of Tata Sons, controlled by a series of charitable trusts. Mistry has argued he tried to create internal barriers for better governance - a move that would reduce Tata trusts’ involvement in operational issues of group companies, which he said should be controlled by their own boards of directors. The Tata trusts collectively own about two thirds of Tata Sons. “A philanthropy running a commercial business creates its own paradoxes,” said Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy advisory, in a note about the feud. Tata Sons on Sunday said it was “crucially important” for the board members, including independent directors, to consider the future of Tata companies and its stakeholders. A spokesman declined to comment further. ",11142016,http://www.reuters.com/article/tata-sons-management/key-week-for-tata-tussle-as-mistry-faces-tata-motors-board-idUSL1N1DD0AZ

757,SBUX,Indian shares rise in line with Asian peers; banknotes withdrawal weighs,"* NSE index up 0.51 pct, BSE 0.69 pct higher * Stability likely to be temporary - analyst * Cooling retail inflation boosts rate-cut odds By Samantha Kareen Nair Nov 16 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Wednesday, in line with Asian peers as a pause in the global bond rout and rally in the dollar lifted risk sentiment, while cooling retail inflation back home bolstered the chances of a rate cut next month. Consumer prices rose by an annual 4.20 percent last month in their slowest pace in 14 months, data released after market hours on Tuesday showed, increasing the odds of another rate cut after a 25 basis point reduction last month. But some analysts reckon an impending interest rate increase in the United States could force a status quo until February. Uncertainty surrounding the impact of the government’s last week move to withdraw higher-denomination bank notes and slow replenishment in new bills, also prevailed. “The market continues to grapple with the impact of demonetisation. In weeks ahead, we will get a clearer picture on how different sectors react to the withdrawal of high currency notes. The common consensus is that the whole economy will be hit by this monetary shock,” said Jay Shankar, chief India economist & director, Religare Capital Market. “The stabilisation we see today is a reaction to the broader global sentiment, but the recovery is likely to be temporary and we can expect some volatility shortly.” Asian shares won a reprieve from a rally in Wall Street shares as the sell-off in global bonds and sharp gains in the dollar halted. India’s broader NSE index was up 0.51 percent at 8,149.65 as of 0522 GMT after rising as much as 1.25 percent earlier in the session.

759,SBUX,UPDATE 2-India's Tata Steel removes Cyrus Mistry as chairman,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Tata Steel (TISC.NS) said it removed Cyrus Mistry as chairman at a special board meeting on Friday, the third Tata group company to depose him since his ouster as head of the conglomerate’s holding company. Mistry was ousted as chairman of holding company Tata Sons in a boardroom coup in October after the company criticized his performance.  Since then both Mistry and Tata Sons have been involved in a war of words blaming each party for problems in the $100-billion salt-to-software Tata conglomerate. The Tata Steel board, in a statement, also said on Friday that it would hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Dec. 21 to remove Mistry and independent director Nusli Wadia as directors on the board. Mistry was removed earlier this month as chairman of Tata Global Beverages (TAGL.NS), which co-owns and runs Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores across India, and as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS), India’s biggest software company and a cash cow of the group.  A source close to Mistry said in a statement that removing him as chairman of Tata Steel was a “new low” in the corporate governance standards of the Tata group and said representatives of Tata Sons were behind the decision. O P Bhatt, independent director on the board of Tata Steel and former head of State Bank of India [SBINY.UL], has been elected as chairman of the board of Tata Steel until the outcome of the EGM, the company said. “The board appointed the independent director as the chairman keeping in mind principles of good corporate governance,” it said. Tata Consultancy Services, as well as Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), which owns the Jaguar Land Rover brand, and Indian Hotels Co Ltd (IHTL.NS), which runs the Taj group of hotels, have also called for EGMs in December to remove Mistry as directors of their companies. Tata Sons had criticized Mistry’s performance and accused him of being responsible for rising expenses and impairment provisions and falling dividends. Mistry sought to defend his record at Tata Sons in a statement on Nov. 15 and said allegations that he oversaw rising expenses and impairment provisions were “another brazen attempt to mislead the public and shareholders.”     ",11252016,http://www.reuters.com/article/tatasons-management-steel/update-2-indias-tata-steel-removes-cyrus-mistry-as-chairman-idUSL4N1DQ3OH
760,SBUX,Starbucks' CEO transition unlikely to stymie growth: analysts,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz’s decision to step down is unlikely to hamper growth at the world’s biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said.     Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. The company’s shares were down 2.5 percent at $57.02 on Friday as investors worried that the exit of one of Wall Street’s most regarded CEOs would spell trouble for the company. Analysts, however, downplayed these concerns. “Howard can’t be in that position forever,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Reuters. Hottovy said the timing of the handoff made sense because the company had a strong management team and Johnson had more retail experience than the market was giving him credit for. Johnson worked with Schultz for nearly two years and has been on Starbucks’ board since 2009. He also has a strong technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N), which sets him up to lead Starbucks at a time when the company is looking to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. “Johnson appears to have been an important behind-the-scenes contributor to Starbucks’ post-recession turnaround, and his background in technology should position him well,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a research note.  To be sure, the last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company’s shares had plunged.   Schultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company’s annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. “Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz’s previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,” RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. Starbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) and Panera Bread Co PNRA.O to follow suit. The mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks’ latest quarter was through mobile phones. Starbucks’ quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of at least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin’ and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N). Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note that Schultz’s plans to “premiumize” the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive. The outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world, which analysts said was a worthwhile endeavor. Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. The company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks’ birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo.

761,SBUX,"Starbucks CEO steps down to focus on high-end coffee, shares fall","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive. Schultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand’s “social impact agenda” that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. Starbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company’s decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. “Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,” said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. “We’re in a much better position on every level,” said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the “Great Recession,” when Starbucks’ stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. Many of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz’s status as a national figure. “The idea that he’s replaceable, I think that’s erroneous,” said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world’s biggest restaurant company.  The announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry’s stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.   Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.  Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). On a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the “merchant gene.” “Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,” said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. “I’m not leaving the company and I’m here every day,” said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson’s. Traffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company’s loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales. The company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics.  “He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,” a spokeswoman said.

762,SBUX,Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp Chief Executive and co-founder Howard Schultz’s plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world’s largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers.   Schultz in April will move into the role of executive chairman to focus on opening 1,000 new “Reserve” brand stores and adding Reserve bars to 20 percent of its traditional cafes, which now number 25,000 around the globe.   Starbucks also envisions as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world.  Schultz’s transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. “Starbucks is the millennials’ parents’ coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,” said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Its Reserve projects are “a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,” said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. Reserve stores will be about twice the size of typical stores and exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. The first are planned for Seattle and Chicago.  The new Reserve stores and Roasteries will serve wine, beer and spirits and bake their own pastries from Princi, a boutique Italian bakery and Starbucks partner.   Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more at Reserve cafes, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. Schultz told attendees at the company’s investor meeting on Wednesday that the halo from Reserve will make Starbucks a more compelling destination while providing an antidote to customers spending more of their time and money online. “If Starbucks was a 20-chapter book, I still think we’re in chapter 4 or 5,” said Schultz.     Starbucks already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities, including New York, Chicago and Atlanta.  Reuters recently visited a Reserve bar on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 “flights” of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu.  Twenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. “I’d probably just stick to the regular, I’m not too picky,” said Sauer, who showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. “If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I’d do it,” she said. “I think people want it, too.” The new Reserve stores could boost Starbucks’ revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein’s Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz’s new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. Seattle-based Starbucks debuted the first Roastery in its hometown two years ago, spending a reported $20 million on the  15,000-square-foot industrial-chic playground for coffee enthusiasts. The Shanghai Roastery, which will be twice that size, is slated to open in about a year, with Manhattan to follow about six months later.  But as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks.  “There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,” said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

763,SBUX,"Starbucks sets five-year growth targets, to open 12,000 more stores","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) unveiled a five-year growth plan, under which it would open more stores around the world, including several high-end coffee shops, while targeting annual revenue growth of 10 percent. The company said it would add 12,000 stores globally by 2021 and target comparable sales growth in mid-single digits and profit growth of 15-20 percent a year. The world’s largest coffee chain also unveiled a new feature within its mobile app that uses voice command or messaging to place orders. The feature will be tested first on Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iOS operating system in early 2017, Starbucks said at its investor conference on Wednesday.  The company also plans to open an outlet of its high-end coffee chain, Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, in Europe, bringing the number to five globally. Details of that launch will be announced early next year, the company said. Starbucks said last week that Chief Executive Howard Schultz would step down to focus on the company’s high-end coffee shops.    Starbucks opened its first Reserve coffee roastery and tasting room in Seattle in late 2014, which roasts limited-supply Reserve coffees that sell for up to $50 per 8-ounce package.  The company plans to open a roastery and tasting room in Shanghai next year, followed by launches in Tokyo and New York City in 2018. Starbucks also said it would accelerate the opening of Reserve coffee “bars” selling premium coffee within Starbucks cafes to 7,400 stores by 2021. The company had set a target of opening these bars in up to 1,000 cafes by the end of 2017. Starbucks’s revenue has been growing at an average rate of 12.76 percent over the past five years.

765,SBUX,"EU court ruling on Spanish tax breaks eyed for clues on Starbucks, Apple appeals","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s top court will decide next week on Spanish tax breaks for foreign takeovers in a ruling that may give clues as to how judges will deal with more complex tax cases involving Starbucks (SBUX.O) and Apple (AAPL.O). The European Commission, in two rulings in 2009 and 2011, said the scheme, which applied to Spanish companies holding a stake of at least 5 percent in a foreign company for at least a year, broke EU state aid rules, and ordered Spain to recover the money. Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Autogrill Espana, which is now known as World Duty Free Group, and Santusa Holding challenged the decisions at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, which ruled in the companies’ favor. The EU competition enforcer then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), arguing the lower court was wrong to demand that it specify the type of companies that benefited unfairly from the tax breaks. The court’s verdict in the Spanish case on Wednesday could give insight into the ECJ’s stance on high-profile rulings by the European Commission against tax breaks for multinationals such as Starbucks and Apple, which have already been appealed to the General Court by the Dutch and Irish governments. The Commission ordered Apple in August to pay Ireland a record 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in unpaid taxes, ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. The Commission has also ruled that Starbucks, Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) and 35 other companies benefited from illegal sweetheart deals with several EU countries. The Spanish corporate tax scheme allowed companies that were tax resident in Spain to write down goodwill resulting from the acquisition of stakes in companies that were tax resident abroad. While the Spanish case is different in substance and facts from those involving Starbucks and Apple - as the latter two involve individual rulings on specific companies rather than a scheme - the verdict could show whether the ECJ is taking a conservative approach to state aid which could constrain the Commission’s investigations. A Commission official made light of the implications of the court’s ruling. “If it is the general mood that we have over-reached, then that is bad but you cannot really deduce it from the question at hand in this particular case because it is such a specific question,” the Commission official said. “We would not see it as good news, that is obvious, but I think it is difficult to infer too much from it.” A Commission spokeswoman added: “We cannot comment on judgments that have not yet been issued.” The cases are C-20/15 P Commission v World Duty Free Group, C-21/15 P Commission v Banco Santander and Santusa.

The world’s biggest coffee seller said visits to U.S. stores, the heart of the Americas region, were down in a sign the company may be succumbing to the stubborn slump bedeviling the broader restaurant industry. Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson told Reuters the disappointing Americas results were primarily due to operational challenges caused by congestion at drink pickup sites after the number of cafes reaping more than 20 percent of transactions from mobile order and pay doubled to 1,200 during the fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan. 1. Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said on a conference call: “We are now laser-focused on fixing this problem, but the nature of it, too much demand, is an operational challenge we have solved before and I can assure you we will solve again.” Sales at Americas region cafes open at least 13 months were up 3 percent for the first quarter, missing analysts’ average estimate of a 3.9 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-store sales were also up 3 percent, driven exclusively by higher spending, while the actual number of transactions was down. Starbucks attributed some of that decline to its decision to change its loyalty program to focus on dollars spent rather than transactions. Adjusting for that program change, Starbucks said traffic was flat. The Seattle company forecast 2017 revenue would rise 8 to 10 percent, down from its target issued three months ago of a double-digit rise for the year. Johnson, the COO, also pinned some blame on macroeconomic weakness that is causing pain throughout the restaurant industry. Revenue in the fiscal first quarter of $5.7 billion was shy of the $5.8 billion average target of analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents met expectations. “We view this as a reminder that, despite (Starbucks’) relative consistency and outperformance vs. peers, it isn’t completely immune to a meaningful deterioration in retail traffic,” Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a client note. The Americas region contributed 62 percent of Starbucks’ total net revenue in the latest fiscal year. Much of that came from the United States, where Starbucks and other chains have been battling direct rivals as well as unusually low grocery prices.

The statement came after disparate social media campaigns directed at U.S. companies based in Mexico gained traction, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to build a border wall along the country’s southern border and promise to make Mexico pay for it.  In a statement, Starbucks (SBUX.O) said its Mexican operator Alsea (ALSEA.MX) has some 560 stores across Mexico, representing an investment of 5 billion pesos ($239 million), and sells Arabica coffee beans harvested in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas around the world. Even so, a campaign urged Mexicans not to buy products from the world’s biggest coffee seller, with the hashtag #AdiosStarbucks trending on Twitter earlier this week.  Social media users have also called for boycotts of U.S. companies including McDonald’s (MCD.N), Wal-mart (WMT.N), and Coca-Cola (KO.N).  Earlier this month, a Mexican state governor said his administration would no longer buy cars from U.S. auto maker Ford (F.N), calling on others to do the same after the company abruptly canceled a planned investment in the country.  “It’s time for Mexicans to show what we’re made of,” Alejandro Moreno, governor of the southeastern state of Campeche, said.   “Actions like this should multiply across the country.”      On Friday, Mexico’s wealthiest man, Carlos Slim, weighed in on the topic, saying he thought attempts to boycott U.S. companies were wrong. “They are American businesses that have come to invest in Mexico, to give employment in Mexico, to produce in Mexico,” Slim said. “What needs to be done really is consuming what the country produces.” Shares of Starbucks closed down 4 percent on Friday to $56.12, the lowest level since Jan. 4.

Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The order sparked widespread international criticism, outrage from civil rights activists and legal challenges. Starbucks in a letter from Schultz told employees it would do everything possible to support affected workers.

Shares in the company, which is China’s largest publicly held restaurant operator with 7,562 units, were up 1 percent at $28.40 in thin after-hours trading. Same-store sales were flat after a 1 percent increase at KFC was offset by a decline of 3 percent at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected a 0.1 percent uptick in same-store sales. Rivals McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) reported same-store sales gains of 7.9 percent and 6 percent, respectively, from China for the latest quarter. Yum China’s fourth-quarter net income was $88 million, or 23 cents per share, on revenue of $1.98 billion. Profit excluding special items was 17 cents per share. Analysts had expected a profit of 8 cents per share on revenue of $2.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Chief Executive Officer Micky Pant said on a conference call with analysts that he was “cautiously optimistic” about the company’s business amid rising costs for labor and commodities, stiff competition and simmering protectionist sentiments. Yum China started trading as a standalone company on Nov. 1. Prior to the separation, it had been the primary profit and sales driver for Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N).

784,SBUX,Fitch Affirms Starbucks at 'A/F1'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of Starbucks Corporation (Starbucks; NASDAQ: SBUX) at 'A/F1'. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. At Jan. 1, 2017 Starbucks had $3.2 billion of total  debt. A full list of Starbucks' ratings is provided at the end of this release.  Starbucks' ratings reflect its consistent sales and operating earnings growth,  balanced financial strategy and market leadership in the global coffee market.  Ratings recognize the recent slowing in comparable store sales (comps) but  incorporate Starbucks' ability to maintain credit statistics in line with an 'A'  rating and Fitch's view that performance will continue to outperform the broader  restaurant industry.  Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR to be maintained around 2.0x, annual  free cash flow (FCF - cash flow from operations less capex and dividends) to  exceed $1 billion, and no change in financial strategy over the intermediate  term.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Comps Slow Slightly But Continue to Lead Industry Starbucks' consolidated comps rose 3% during the quarter ended Jan. 1, 2017, a  modest slowdown from the 5% plus comp growth over the past six years. The  slowdown was due to difficult 8% comparisons during the prior year comparable  period, weak restaurant industry traffic, and in-store congestion at the pickup  area due to stronger than expected mobile order and pay demand. Average ticket  was up 4%, benefiting from positive mix due in part to increased food sales, but  transactions declined 1%. Fitch believes transaction trends and comps can  improve as the company more effectively staffs around peak transaction times.  Starbucks has maintained a competitive advantage in the U.S. restaurant industry  by strengthening its brand and connection with customers via innovation, its  loyalty program, and by leading in digital. Food and beverage innovation such as  the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve coffees, additional varieties on its Cold  Brew platform, and Sous Vide Egg Bites continue to add 1% to 2% to comps. The  company has nearly 13 million active Starbucks Rewards members, up 16% from last  year, and mobile payments represent approximately 27% of total transactions.  Robust Operating Earnings Growth, Substantial Cash Flow  Starbucks' reported revenue and operating income have grown at a 12% and  approximately 20% CAGR since 2010 to $21.3 billion and $4.2 billion,  respectively, in 2016 while cash flow from operations increased to $4.6 billion  from $1.7 billion over the same period. Fitch expects revenue and operating  earnings to grow at a high single-digit rate annually over the next 24 months  due to low single digit comp growth, expansion, and effective management of  coffee costs and general and administrative (G&A;) expenses.  Starbucks has locked in the price on about 80% of its coffee needs for 2017 with  commodity cost being slightly favorable in the first half of the year and  slightly unfavorable in the back half. Moreover, the company is effectively  realizing supply chain savings and intends to limit core G&A; expense growth to  half the rate of revenue growth even while investing in store-level employee  wages and benefits.  At Jan. 1, 2017, the company had 25,734 stores for which 50% were  company-operated and 50% were licensed. Approximately 61% of units were in the  North America, 26% were in the China/Asia Pacific (CAP) region, 11% were in  Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and the remainder were in other  geographies. Starbucks has grown its store base at an 8% CAGR since 2013 and  expects to expand 8% in 2017 by opening about 2,100 new units. Approximately  1,000 of these stores will be in the CAP region, 800 in the Americas, and 300 in  EMEA.  Starbucks five-year plan includes increasing its store base approximately 50% to  about 37,000 stores by 2021. Roughly 50% of net new stores will be in China and  the U.S. Fitch is concerned about store saturation in the U.S., but concerns are  partially mitigated by the fact that unit volumes and store level profitability  continue to increase. AUV for U.S. company operated stores was $1.6 million in  2016, up from just under $1 million in 2008, while store cash profit margin was  a record 31% in 2016.  Balanced Financial Strategy, Stable Leverage Starbucks has maintained a balanced financial strategy over the past several  years. The company is investing in its business with capex averaging roughly 7%  of sales annually since 2013 and returning an increasing amount of cash to  shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while maintaining total  adjusted debt/EBITDAR near 2.0x.  Starbucks raised its targeted dividend pay out to earnings to 40% to 50% in 2016  from 35% to 45% previously, and net share repurchases have increased to $1.8  billion in 2016 from less than $500 million in 2013. Share buybacks have mainly  been funded with FCF which totaled approximately $2 billion in 2016. However,  Fitch anticipates modest incremental debt could be used to partially finance  buybacks going forward as operating earnings grow and Starbucks continues to  target leverage ratios consistent with an A rating.  Strong Brand Equity, Competitive Strength Starbucks is a highly respected brand that is maintaining its market leadership  in coffee, growing its food and beverage menu offerings, and successfully  engaging with customers. Moreover, increased distribution within grocery, other  retail outlets, and with higher end Reserve stores and Roasteries further  strengthen Starbucks' brand equity while reinforcing its competitive strength.  According to Nation's Restaurant News Top 100 2016 survey, Starbucks ranks No. 1  in the U.S. beverage-snack category with approximately 60% share and more than  twice the sales of its largest competitor in the category. Howard Schultz, current CEO and Chairman who is the primary visionary for the  company, joined Starbucks in 1982 after the company was founded in 1971. In  April 2017, Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer, will become  CEO while Mr. Shultz remains chairman and focuses on innovation, design, and  development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world along with the  company's social impact initiatives. Fitch does not expect a change in operating  or financial strategy.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Starbucks include: --Revenue grows at a high single-digit growth rate annually over the next 24  months driven by high-single digit net unit growth and low-single comp growth;  --Operating EBIT, excluding income from equity investees, growth averages high  single-digit over the next 24 months with operating EBIT margin being flat at  19.1% in 2017 and expanding towards 20% over time;  --Annual FCF exceeds $1 billion or more annually; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR is sustained around 2.0x.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action in the near term is not anticipated. However, a public  commitment to maintain total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR in the mid-1.0x  range and a continuation of strong operating trends could result in an upgrade.  A negative rating action would be considered if total adjusted debt-to-operating  EBITDAR is sustained above the 2.0x to 2.2x range due to a more aggressive  financial strategy, meaningful deceleration in comp growth below Fitch's  expectations, or material margin contraction. Materially lower than expected FCF  could also contribute to a negative action. LIQUIDITY Starbucks had $3.7 billion of liquidity at Jan. 1, 2017 consisting of $2 billion  of cash and $140 million of short-term investments along with availability under  an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Nov. 6, 2020. Amounts  outstanding under the company's $1 billion commercial paper (CP) program are  backstopped by available commitments under the revolver. At Jan. 1, 2017, there  was no CP outstanding. Starbucks' only maturity over the next three years is  $350 million of 2% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 5, 2018. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Starbucks' ratings as follows:  --Long-term IDR at 'A';  --Bank credit facility at 'A'; --Senior Unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.  Contact:  Primary Analyst  Carla Norfleet Taylor, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3195 Fitch Ratings, Inc.  70 W.

790,SBUX,Fitch Rates Starbucks' JPY85B (approx. USD750MM) Issuance 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Starbucks  Corporation's (Starbucks; NASDAQ: SBUX) proposed JPY85 billion (approximately  USD750 million) issuance of fixed-rate seven-year senior unsecured notes. At  Jan. 1, 2017, Starbucks had USD3.2 billion of debt. A full list of Starbucks'  ratings is provided at the end of this release. The notes will be issued under an indenture dated Sept. 15, 2016 and will rank  equally with existing senior unsecured debt. Terms include a change of control  triggering event provision. Proceeds will be used for investments related to  eligible sustainability projects connected to coffee sourcing, farmer support  centers, agronomy research and development centers, and Starbucks' global farmer  fund.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Comps Slow Slightly But Continue to Lead Industry Starbucks' consolidated comps rose 3% during the quarter ended Jan. 1, 2017, a  modest slowdown from the 5%-plus comp growth over the past six years. The  slowdown was due to difficult 8% comparisons during the prior year comparable  period, weak restaurant industry traffic, and in-store congestion at the pickup  area due to stronger than expected mobile order and pay demand. Average ticket  was up 4%, benefiting from positive mix due in part to increased food sales, but  transactions declined 1%. Fitch believes transaction trends and comps can  improve as the company more effectively staffs around peak transaction times.  Starbucks has maintained a competitive advantage in the U.S. restaurant industry  by strengthening its brand and connection with customers via innovation, its  loyalty program, and by leading in digital. Food and beverage innovation such as  the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve coffees, additional varieties on its Cold  Brew platform, and Sous Vide Egg Bites continue to add 1% to 2% to comps. The  company has nearly 13 million active Starbucks Rewards members, up 16% from last  year, and mobile payments represent approximately 27% of total transactions. Robust Operating Earnings Growth, Substantial Cash Flow Starbucks' reported revenue and operating income have grown at 12% and an  approximately 20% CAGR since 2010 to $21.3 billion and $4.2 billion,  respectively, in 2016 while cash flow from operations increased to $4.6 billion  from $1.7 billion over the same period. Fitch expects revenue and operating  earnings to grow at a high single-digit rate annually over the next 24 months  due to low single-digit comp growth, expansion, and effective management of  coffee costs and general and administrative (G&A;) expenses. Starbucks has locked in the price on about 80% of its coffee needs for 2017 with  commodity cost being slightly favorable in the first half of the year and  slightly unfavorable in the back half. Moreover, the company is effectively  realizing supply chain savings and intends to limit core G&A; expense growth to  half the rate of revenue growth even while investing in store-level employee  wages and benefits.

Approximately 61% of units were in the  North America, 26% were in the China/Asia Pacific (CAP) region, 11% were in  Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and the remainder were in other  geographies. Starbucks has grown its store base at an 8% CAGR since 2013 and  expects to expand 8% in 2017 by opening about 2,100 new units. Approximately  1,000 of these stores will be in the CAP region, 800 in the Americas, and 300 in  EMEA. Starbucks five-year plan includes increasing its store base approximately 50% to  about 37,000 stores by 2021. Roughly 50% of net new stores will be in China and  the U.S. Fitch is concerned about store saturation in the U.S., but concerns are  partially mitigated by the fact that unit volumes and store level profitability  continue to increase. Annualized unit value (AUV) for U.S. company operated  stores was $1.6 million in 2016, up from just under $1 million in 2008, while  store cash profit margin was a record 31% in 2016. Balanced Financial Strategy, Stable Leverage Starbucks has maintained a balanced financial strategy over the past several  years. The company is investing in its business with capex averaging roughly 7%  of sales annually since 2013 and returning an increasing amount of cash to  shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while maintaining total  adjusted debt/EBITDAR near 2.0x.  Starbucks raised its targeted dividend pay-out to earnings to 40% - 50% in 2016  from 35% - 45% previously, and net share repurchases have increased to $1.8  billion in 2016 from less than $500 million in 2013. Share buybacks have mainly  been funded with FCF which totaled approximately $2 billion in 2016. However,  Fitch anticipates modest incremental debt could be used to partially finance  buybacks going forward as operating earnings grow and Starbucks continues to  target leverage ratios consistent with an 'A' rating.  Strong Brand Equity, Competitive Strength Starbucks is a highly respected brand that is maintaining its market leadership  in coffee, growing its food and beverage menu offerings, and successfully  engaging with customers. Moreover, increased distribution within grocery, other  retail outlets, and with higher-end Reserve stores and Roasteries further  strengthens Starbucks' brand equity while reinforcing its competitive strength.  According to Nation's Restaurant News Top 100 2016 survey, Starbucks ranks No. 1  in the U.S. beverage-snack category with approximately 60% share and more than  twice the sales of its largest competitor in the category. Howard Schultz, current CEO and Chairman who is the primary visionary for the  company, joined Starbucks in 1982 after the company was founded in 1971. In  April 2017, Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer, will become  CEO while Mr. Shultz remains chairman and focuses on innovation, design, and  development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world along with the  company's social impact initiatives. Fitch does not expect a change in operating  or financial strategy.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Starbucks include: --Revenue grows at a high single-digit growth rate annually over the next 24  months driven by high single-digit net unit growth and low single-digit comp  growth; -- Average operating EBIT growth, excluding income from equity investees, in the  high single-digits over the next 24 months with operating EBIT margin being flat  at 19.1% in 2017 and expanding towards 20% over time; --Annual FCF exceeds $1 billion or more annually; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR is sustained at around 2.0x RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action in the near term is not anticipated. However, a public  commitment to maintain total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR in the mid-1.0x  range and a continuation of strong operating trends could result in an upgrade. A negative rating action would be considered if total adjusted debt-to-operating  EBITDAR is sustained above the 2.0x to 2.2x range due to a more aggressive  financial strategy, meaningful deceleration in comp growth below Fitch's  expectations, or material margin contraction. Materially lower than expected FCF  could also contribute to a negative action. LIQUIDITY Starbucks had $3.7 billion of liquidity at Jan. 1, 2017 consisting of $2 billion  in cash and $140 million of short-term investments along with availability under  an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Nov. 6, 2020. Amounts  outstanding under the company's $1 billion commercial paper (CP) program are  backstopped by available commitments under the revolver. At Jan. 1, 2017, there  was no CP outstanding. Starbucks' only maturity over the next three years is  $350 million of 2% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 5, 2018.

791,SBUX,Starbucks CEO's refugee comments sour customer views of chain: survey,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) vow to hire thousands of refugees after President Donald Trump’s first executive order that temporarily banned travel from seven mostly-Muslim nations appears to be hurting customer sentiment of the coffee chain.  Trump supporters have used Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites to call for a boycott since Jan. 29, when Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz vowed to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the countries where it does business. Schultz in a letter to employees said the promise of the American Dream was “being called into question” and that “the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack.” YouGov BrandIndex, which tracks consumers’ sentiment toward companies and their willingness to purchase from those brands, noted that the data around this boycott is different because both measures are declining.  Starbucks’ consumer perception levels took an immediate hit as measured by YouGov BrandIndex’s Buzz score, falling by two-thirds between Jan. 29 and Feb. 13, and have not recovered. Starbucks Buzz score fell to 4 from 12 during that time.    Such scores can range from 100 to -100 and are compiled by subtracting negative feedback from positive. A zero score means equal positive and negative feedback. Prior to Schultz’s refugee comments, 30 percent of consumers  said they would consider buying from Starbucks the next time they made a coffee purchase, that fell to a low of 24 percent and now stands at 26 percent, according to a YouGov spokesman. “Consumer perception dropped almost immediately,” said YouGov BrandIndex CEO Ted Marzilli, who added that the statistically significant drop in purchase consideration data showed that consumers became less keen to buy from Starbucks. “That would indicate the announcement has had a negative impact on Starbucks, and might indicate a negative impact on sales in the near term,” he said. Marzilli noted that the Starbucks holiday “red cup” controversy from November 2015 corresponded with an even larger drop in perception, but no real impact on purchase consideration scores. Among other things, boycott supporters are urging like-minded friends to support Starbucks rival Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O). Representatives from Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts declined to comment on the surveys and the boycott’s impact on sales. The consumer sentiment data comes at a sensitive time for  Starbucks, which reported an accelerated decline in traffic to established U.S. restaurants during the latest quarter.  Starbucks executives pinned much of the blame for its traffic setback on a pileup of mobile orders, which caused bottlenecks at drink pickup stations that thwarted walk-in customers.

793,SBUX,Starbucks says boycott threats over refugee hiring hasn't hurt brand,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Friday said its business has not been hurt by a social media boycott campaign started in response to the chain’s promise to hire 10,000 refugees globally over the next five years. Starbucks made its Jan. 29 refugee hiring announcement on the heels of President Donald Trump’s first executive order that temporarily banned travel from seven mostly Muslim nations. The move angered some Trump supporters, who called on other customers to stop frequenting the coffee chain. Matt Ryan, Starbucks’ chief strategy officer, said results from a YouGov BrandIndex survey suggesting that the boycott had dented the brand, “do not reflect the customer satisfaction and perception trends we are seeing so far in 2017.” Kantar Millward Brown, a market research firm that has provided continuous Brand Equity measurement for Starbucks since 2013, said the chain has not suffered a consumer backlash related to its refugee hiring promise.  “In February 2017 — after the announcement — we did not observe any substantive impact on Customer Consideration, Future Visitation Intent or Brand Perceptions or any other key performance metrics for the Starbucks brand,” Brian James, president of Kantar Millward Brown’s brand and communications practice, said in a letter released by Starbucks. The coffee company declined to release related data, citing confidentiality.

796,SBUX,Starbucks quenches Japanese thirst for SRI bonds,"* Coffee chain brings sustainability bonds to Japan in overseas debut By Taka Okomoto TOKYO, March 13 (IFR) - Starbucks answered Japan’s growing demand for socially responsible investing (SRI) last week when it chose to launch the country’s first sustainability notes in its maiden international bond offering. The US coffee giant priced 85 billion yen ($736 million) Global 0.372 percent seven-year senior notes at 20bp over yen mid-swaps, again choosing Tokyo for its initial foray outside North America, just as it had done when it opened its first overseas coffee shop in the Ginza district of the Japanese capital in 1996. Investors were drawn to the high name recognition of the group, which has now 1,245 stores across the country, and the issue size could have been even larger. “Books built up (to) over 100 billion yen, but the size was capped at 85 billion yen,” said one of the leads on the issue. Marketing started at 20bp–25bp over mid-swaps on March 7, and the range was progressively tightened to 20bp–23bp the following day and, eventually, 20bp on the day before pricing. Starbucks (A2/A/A) chose to issue Global rather than Samurai bonds as the documentation is much easier for the former. “It would take two months of legal work (for a Samurai) and they would need to provide disclosure in Japanese,” said another lead. However, the bonds were sold exclusively in Japan, split between Tokyo-based institutions, including life insurers, and regional investors. The ratio was about 90-10 in volume terms and 50-50 in account terms. The spread translated after swaps to a level higher than the issuer’s US dollar curve, the leads said, pointing out that Starbucks trades very tight in US dollars. As such, the guidance range was based on the coupons of other high-quality US issuers that had done deals in Japan and on domestic yen transactions. Sources close to the deal also hinted that Starbucks was likely to keep the proceeds in Japan to meet funding needs there rather than swap them into dollars. The seven-year tenor was selected based on the issuer’s maturity profile and to invite a wider range of investors.  ORIGINAL FEATURES The bonds have two new features – a par call and the sustainability angle. A par call is common on US deals, but this was a first for yen deals. However, one of the leads said it was not a big hurdle because some Japanese investors had already bought US bonds with the feature. Starbucks created documents in both English and Japanese to introduce the sustainability bond framework and lay out details pertaining to the use of proceeds, the process to select projects, the management of proceeds and reporting. Opinions from Sustainalytics, which helped to formulate the framework in alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2016 and the Social Bond Guidance 2016, were also added in the documents. Starbucks says the bonds “will focus on enhancing its sustainability programmes around coffee supply chain management”. Some of the proceeds, for instance, will be used to purchase coffee from sustainable plantations. The company issued its first corporate sustainability bonds last May with a domestic $500 million 10-year transaction that was also the first issue of such bonds in the US. The environmental, social and governance (ESG) focus helped to attract investors to the yen issue, even some who usually seek longer tenors, such as life insurers. “Some of the insurers say ‘I would rather have 10 years, but, since it is sustainability bonds, even though it is seven years I can use the segregated money put aside’,” said one of the leads. ESG instruments are becoming popular with Japanese investors. French power utility Electricite de France issued the first Green bonds in the country less than two months ago. “Foreign issuers are more responsive than Japanese issuers to the demand for those products”, said Hiroaki Hayashi, general manager of the investment department at Fukokushinrai Life. “For Japanese issuers, it is a bit tortuous to issue such bonds. They don’t need to issue them at all, because they can borrow money as much as they like, as Japanese investors have lots of funds,” Hayashi said. “As interest rates are low here and bonds with that sort of concept can attract demand, foreign issuers are responding more quickly than Japanese issuers to the demand among Japanese investors.” Hayashi also emphasised the advantage of buying ESG products. “I believe, from my experience, it is actually companies that contribute to society that give high returns in the long run,” he said. “It is a good thing that people start to realise that. Demand for such bonds is definitely growing. The fact that Starbucks drew such a large response verifies that.” Morgan Stanley International and MUFG Securities EMEA were underwriters. Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley MUFG sold the bonds to domestic investors.

Kevin Johnson, who succeeded Howard Schultz as CEO this month, on Thursday presided over an earnings call where the company cut its full-year profit target on the heels of disappointing second-quarter sales and stalling growth from its main business in the United States.  Shares in the company fell 4.9 percent to $58.30 after Starbucks also announced that it was reviewing its Teavana business after that chain’s mall stores dragged down overall sales. Johnson nevertheless remained upbeat.   “With our U.S. business accelerating throughout the quarter and strong performance in China, we are poised to deliver strong revenue growth in the second half and into the future,” Johnson said in a statement. Still, Starbucks lowered its full-year net earnings target to a range of $2.06 to $2.10 per share from $2.09 to $2.11 per share.  It also said full-year revenue growth would be at the lower end of its previously forecast range of 8 to 10 percent.  Starbucks net revenue was up 6 percent to $5.3 billion for the fiscal second quarter, but fell just short of the $5.4 billion expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global sales at established restaurants were up 3 percent for the quarter ended April 2, below the company’s 5 percent growth target.  Sales at U.S. cafes open at least 13 months were up 3 percent in the latest quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter. U.S. traffic, referred to as transactions, fell 2 percent for the second quarter in a row and the average amount spent per order was up 4 percent, versus the 5 percent gain in the prior quarter.  Net income rose 13.5 percent to $652.8 million, or 45 cents per share, matching analysts’ target.  Starbucks in January reported disappointing results from U.S. cafes and pinned most of the blame on mobile orders that had piled up at drink pickup stations. The company has since sought to ease congestion by reworking some job duties and giving managers more leeway to add needed labor as part of a broad customer re-engagement program called North Star.

809,SBUX,Starbucks expands rewards program at grocery stores,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Thursday it would expand its  loyalty rewards program at grocery stores to include more products, as it seeks to win more customers amid a soft retail and restaurant environment in the United States. The coffee chain’s move to more than triple the number of products it sells under the rewards program comes following customer backlash after Starbucks overhauled an existing program last year. Companies have been tweaking their rewards programs in recent years to make them less-generous to consumers. Seattle-based Starbucks, which launched its rewards program in 2009, made changes to it last year, which irked some customers and caused a furor on social media. Under the changes, customers earn two “stars” for every $1 spent and need 125 stars to get a free food or drink item, which meant that some customers would have to spend more money to get free items. Customers earlier used to receive one star per purchase and could redeem 12 stars for an item. Starbucks said on Thursday its U.S. customers could now earn stars on a wider range of products, sold mainly at grocery stores, including its K-Cup packs, packaged roast & ground coffee and multi-serve chilled coffee. The move from the world’s biggest coffee chain also comes after its warning last month that full-year revenue growth would be at the lower end of a previously forecast range amid stalling growth in its U.S. business.

811,SBUX,NYC coffee shop sues Starbucks over Unicorn beverage,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp may be in a bit of hot water over its Unicorn beverage as a New York City coffee shop has filed a federal trademark infringement lawsuit against the coffee chain over the popular drink, court documents showed. The End Brooklyn and its owner, Montauk Juice Factory, said it created the Unicorn Latte, its own bright pink and blue drink, and began selling it in December, four months before Starbucks launched the Unicorn Frappuccino, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in New York. Montauk Juice Factory filed a trademark application for the Unicorn Latte on Jan. 20 after the popularity of its drink soared, accounting for about a quarter of the store’s sales since its launch, it said in the suit. In addition to similar names, the similar appearance of the drinks creates confusion within the market, the coffee shop noted in the suit. By creating and marketing such a similar product, Starbucks should be “held accountable for infringing, diluting and otherwise diminishing” the plaintiffs’ intellectual property value, the lawsuit said. The coffee shop and its owner is asking the court to order Seattle-based Starbucks to pay them all profits made from the Unicorn drink and for any losses that they incurred, the lawsuit said. Starbucks said it believed the lawsuit’s claims were without merit. “The Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino blended beverage was inspired by the fun, spirited and colorful unicorn-themed food and drinks that have been trending in social media,” the company said in an email, adding that it was offered for a limited period in April and was no longer available.",5052017,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-lawsuit/nyc-coffee-shop-sues-starbucks-over-unicorn-beverage-idUSL1N1I71NY

821,SBUX,"Starbucks set to hire 2,500 refugees in Europe","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U.S. coffee chain Starbucks Corp said Tuesday it will hire 2,500 refugees in Europe as part of a wider worldwide hiring plan, months after the policy prompted a backlash from some customers. The world’s largest coffee chain said it would hire the refugees at its European stores starting in eight countries over the next five years and had already started recruitment. The move is part of the Seattle-based company’s plan, unveiled in January, to add 10,000 refugees in 75 countries to its workforce.   The company faced backlash soon after, with several people using the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks on social media to urge customers to stay away from its stores. But there appeared to be no similar reaction on Tuesday with only a handful of people on Twitter voicing their disapproval or support of the Europe hires. Starbucks will roll out the initiative in Britain, France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. The refugees will represent about 8 percent of more than 30,000 people currently employed by Starbucks in Europe, data provided by the company showed. A wave of refugee and migrants landing on Europe’s shores in recent years has contributed to a rise of populist nationalist movements. Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have arrived in the European Union since 2014. Refugees have come in large part from war-torn Syria and Iraq as well as Afghanistan and African countries including Eritrea, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Starbucks’ commitment was “proving that businesses like ours can use its scale to make a positive impact in people’s lives,” said Martin Brok, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa in a statement. Earlier this year, Starbucks said that its global hiring plan also included employing at least 1,000 refugees over the next five years in Canada. Other U.S. companies have taken a pro-refugee stance after the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama called on the private sector to assist refugees. They include Accenture, Airbnb, Chobani, Coursera, Goldman Sachs, Google, HP, IBM, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and LinkedIn. And more than 100 companies, including most of high-tech’s biggest names, joined a legal brief opposing a January executive order by current U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily put a hold on allowing refugees into the United States.

823,SBUX,Muslim leader urges Indonesians to boycott Starbucks over LGBT stand,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A leader of Indonesia’s second-largest Muslim organization has called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that the international coffee chain’s pro-gay stand risks ruining the “religious and cultured” core of the Southeast Asian nation. With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. But police raids on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community have risen in the world’s most populous Muslim country. Anwar Abbas of Muhammadiyah, an organization that has around 30 million members, said the government should revoke Starbucks’ operating license as the company’s support for the LGBT community is “not in line” with the nation’s ideology. “If Starbucks only does business, then fine. But don’t bring ideology here,” Abbas told Reuters by phone on Saturday.  PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, which holds the license to run the Starbucks chain, is a legal entity that “always obeys the prevailing regulations and appreciates the cultural values in Indonesia”, an executive at its parent company said. “We also value the religious background of our customers and employees,” Fetty Kwartati, a director at PT MAP Boga Adiperkasa Tbk, said in a text message. Indonesia’s reputation for tolerance and pluralism is already under scrutiny after Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was sentenced in May to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after mass Islamist-led rallies last year. Asked why he had taken a stand against Starbucks, Abbas  said he was informed in a chat group about a pro-LGBT comment made by the company’s senior executive, Howard Schultz. Schultz is now chairman of Starbucks after stepping down from his previous role as chief executive. Forbes reported that when a Starbucks shareholder complained in 2013 that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage, Schultz said it embraces diversity and that ""not every decision is an economic decision"". (bit.ly/2swGTQB) “If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company,” Schultz was reported as saying at that time. A video of the comment was also posted on YouTube. Starbucks customer Annisa Meidiana, who is a Muslim, said she would not stop buying coffee there because of the call for the boycott. “Islam condemns LGBT.

825,SBUX,Starbucks service hurt by understaffing: Coworker.org survey,"(Reuters) - A Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) initiative designed to improve speed and customer service has not fixed staffing shortages, according to an outside survey of company workers released on Thursday. The survey results from Coworker.org, which hosts online petitions, come a year after U.S. Starbucks workers used the site to protest staffing cutbacks that they warned were slowing service and hurting morale at the popular coffee chain. Coworker.org said its poll included 184 self-identified, current U.S. Starbucks cafe workers, supervisors and managers across 33 states. New Chief Executive Kevin Johnson launched the initiative at Starbucks, which has more than 13,000 U.S. coffee shops, with more than 150,000 workers. In January, Starbucks said some of its busiest U.S. cafes were grappling with bottlenecks at drink pick-up stations during peak hours. Executives blamed the delays on an avalanche of mobile orders and said the backups had chased away some walk-in customers.  The company, which has reported two straight quarters of declines in U.S. traffic, reworked tasks to make them more efficient and gave managers more leeway to add staffing as part of a broad customer re-engagement program dubbed “North Star.” That effort is led by Kris Engskov, Starbucks’ president  of U.S. retail, under the guidance of Johnson, who succeeded longtime CEO Howard Schultz in April.  “All of our metrics show we are moving in the opposite direction of what the survey claims,” Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said. “Over the last eight months, we’ve added labor to about 15 percent of our stores and are looking to add more in the months ahead,” he said. Despite that, 75 percent of the Starbucks workers polled by Coworker.org said their stores were not staffed to meet the goals of North Star.  Eighty-nine percent of respondents said staffing levels were still a problem in their stores in the past three months, and 62 percent said their ability to deliver the best customer service possible decreased during that time. Mobile ordering has “added to the work load immensely, and yet again, there aren’t even enough people scheduled to share the workload,” an unnamed Starbucks partner told Coworker.org. A Starbucks employee last year launched a Coworker.org petition, accusing the chain of “extreme” cutbacks in work hours that were crushing morale. The petition currently has more than 18,000 signatures. Workers last year told Reuters they noticed the reduction in hours in April 2016, after Starbucks reported a deceleration in quarterly cafe sales growth.

827,SBUX,Starbucks customer engagement plan hurt by understaffing - survey,"July 6 (Reuters) - An initiative by Starbucks Corp’s new CEO to improve customer engagement and ease congestion at stores is struggling due to staff shortages, hurting baristas’ morale and ability to serve customers, a survey of coffee chain’s employees showed. Three-quarters of the 184 U.S.-based Starbucks employees surveyed by Coworker.org, an online platform which lets workers organize campaigns, said their stores were not adequately staffed to carry out the customer re-engagement program. The program aims to improve customer service by training baristas and providing them technical support. About 62 percent of the employees surveyed said their ability to deliver the best customer service has decreased in the past three months due to understaffing. The customer re-engagement program, the first major initiative by CEO Kevin Johnson who took over in April, sought to address teething issues the company faced following the launch of its mobile ordering and payment technology. Baristas at the company’s busiest cafes had difficulty keeping up with mobile orders, creating bottlenecks at drink delivery stations and leading some walk-in customers to walk out, with the company facing customer backlash on social media. “[Mobile ordering has] added to the work load immensely, and yet again, there aren’t even enough people scheduled to share the workload,” a Starbucks partner who declined to be named told Coworker.org. The survey results come at a time when Starbucks is struggling to boost traffic. Visits to its U.S. stores have fallen for two quarters in a row, which Johnson blamed on operational challenges related to the mobile ordering upgrade. Over 11,800 Starbucks employees have joined a barista-created campaign on Coworker.org, calling for the company to address workers’ problems about its labor practices that is sinking morale at stores, the website said. Starbucks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said in March it would create 68,000 jobs in the United States as it looks to open 3,400 stores by 2021.

Perkasa, a group with about 700,000 members that campaigns for the rights of ethnic Malay Muslims, said it agreed with calls this week by Muhammadiyah, Indonesia’s second-largest Muslim group, for a boycott of Starbucks over its pro-LGBT stand. Perkasa also agreed with the Indonesian group’s call for   Starbucks’ operating license to be revoked, it said. Amini Amir Abdullah, who heads Perkasa’s Islamic affairs bureau, said Starbucks’ position challenged Malaysia’s constitution, which recognized Islam as the country’s official religion. “Our objection is because they are promoting something that is against the human instinct, against human behavior and against religion. That’s why we are against it,” Amini told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.  Muhammadiyah’s call for a boycott has gained support from the Indonesian Ulema Council, its top clerical body.     The religious groups’ opposition to Starbucks came after a video from 2013 circulated online of pro-LGBT comments made by the company’s chairman and former chief executive, Howard Schultz. In the video, Schultz said Starbucks embraced diversity and “not every decision is an economic decision”, in response to a shareholder who complained that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage.  Starbucks Malaysia could not be reached for comment.  PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, which holds the license to run the Starbucks chain in Indonesia, said in a statement it was not affiliated with any political or ideological groups. “We are grateful and proud to have been a part of local communities in Indonesia for 15 years, always maintaining the deepest respect for, and adherence to, Indonesia’s local laws, culture and beliefs,” said Fetty Kwartati, a director at PT MAP Boga Adiperkasa, the parent company of PT Sari Coffee Indonesia. Some Muslims in Indonesia, however, said the boycott call would not stop them from buying Starbucks coffee.  “I love their products, not their CEO,” said Jakarta resident Kornelius Kamajaya. The boycott call got a similar response from some in Malaysia. “Don’t make it such an issue that we have to boycott a company because of one small statement,” said Muhammad Azril Maridzuan, an assistant bank manager in Kuala Lumpur. Muslim groups should not “be so extremist” even though gay rights was against their religious beliefs, he said.

831,SBUX,UPDATE 4-Starbucks puts spotlight on China as U.S. growth cools,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) new chief executive said the world’s biggest coffee chain is making a long-term investment in China, amid worries that growth from its dominant U.S. market is cooling.  Kevin Johnson, who succeeded Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz as CEO in April, is tasked with the difficult job of finding new ways to deliver the robust growth that Wall Street has demanded from the popular chain. The urgency of Johnson’s mandate was underscored on Thursday, when the Seattle-based company posted quarterly profit that just matched analysts’ estimates. Starbucks also tempered expectations for the current quarter as it grapples with softness in the U.S. retail and restaurant industries and said it would close all 379 of its Teavana stores. Shares of the company, which is often punished by investors when it does not exceed Wall Street’s expectations, tumbled 5.5 percent to $56.24 in after-hours trading. The financial report, the first under Johnson’s guidance,  landed just hours after Starbucks said it would buy the remaining 50 percent stake of its East China business from its joint venture partners for about $1.3 billion, in its biggest ever acquisition. Net income fell 8.3 percent to $691.6 million, or 47 cents per share, for the third quarter ended July 2. Excluding items, Starbucks earned 55 cents per share, which matched analysts’ average estimate as complied by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  U.S. restaurants are locked in a bitter fight for market share, battling new competition from non-traditional rivals such as meal kit sellers and convenience stores.  Sales at its mainstay U.S. cafes open at least 13 months rose 5 percent in the latest quarter. Traffic turned slightly positive, reversing three straight quarters of declines that the company attributed in part to changing its loyalty program to focus on dollars spent rather than the number of purchases they make. Still, executives cut Starbucks’ full-year net earnings per share target to a range of $1.96 to $1.97 from a previously lowered forecast of $2.06 to $2.10, following a deceleration in U.S. same-store sales that has continued into July.  “We think it’s a prudent thing to do,” Johnson told Reuters. Same-store sales from China, where there are 2,800 stores in 130 cities, were up a robust 7 percent in the latest quarter. The 16,302 cafes in Starbucks’ U.S.-dominated Americas region contributed $974.8 million in operating income in the quarter. In contrast, the 7,183 cafes from the China/Asia Pacific region posted $223.8 million. Johnson told Reuters that the cash deal in China, which will give it ownership of about 1,300 stores in Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, is part of the company’s “long game” in the country that is its fastest-growing market outside the United States. “Starbucks’ opportunity for growth in China is unparalleled ... and we are just getting started,” Johnson said. Starbucks, which bought Teavana for $620 million in 2012, said most stores will be closed by Spring 2018. It will continue selling Teavana branded products in its Starbucks stores.

China is Starbucks’ fastest-growing market outside the United States by number of stores.

Starbucks is buying the East China stores from JV partners Uni-President Enterprises Corp (1216.TW) (UPEC) and President Chain Store Corp (2912.TW) (PCSC). In a separate deal, Starbucks will sell its 50 percent stake in its Taiwanese JV to UPEC and PCSC for about $175 million. The Taiwan JV operates about 410 Starbucks stores.

The Dow industrials, however, set a record high, buoyed by Chevron (CVX.N) after the energy company’s results. Despite Friday’s share reactions, results overall have come in better than expected for the second quarter and stocks are trading near record highs. More than halfway through reporting season, S&P; 500 companies are on track to increase earnings by 10.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors were also digesting data showing the U.S. economy accelerated in the second quarter as consumers ramped up spending and businesses invested more on equipment. “We have had a good earnings season. We have had pretty good economic results,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. “But I think that there’s a tendency after you have had too long a string of wins, to start looking for the problems in even the good data.

Investors have been counting on earnings to support the relatively high valuations for equities. The S&P; 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months above its long-term average of 15 times. “I would call the market at the high end of fairly valued,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. “It is not blanket good earnings as Amazon exemplifies.” Amazon’s (AMZN.O) shares fell 2.5 percent after the world’s largest online retailer reported a jump in retail sales along with a profit slump. Altria Group (MO.N) shares tumbled 9.5 percent.

The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P.; U.S.-traded shares of British American Tobacco plunged 10 percent, while Philip Morris fell 1.12 percent.

845,SBUX,Starbucks puts spotlight on China as U.S. growth cools,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) new chief executive said the world’s biggest coffee chain is making a long-term investment in China, amid worries that growth from its dominant U.S. market is cooling.  Kevin Johnson, who succeeded Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz as CEO in April, is tasked with the difficult job of finding new ways to deliver the robust growth that Wall Street has demanded from the popular chain. The urgency of Johnson’s mandate was underscored on Thursday, when the Seattle-based company posted quarterly profit that just matched analysts’ estimates. Starbucks also tempered expectations for the current quarter as it grapples with softness in the U.S. retail and restaurant industries and said it would close all 379 of its Teavana stores. Shares of the company, which is often punished by investors when it does not exceed Wall Street’s expectations, tumbled 5.5 percent to $56.24 in after-hours trading. The financial report, the first under Johnson’s guidance,  landed just hours after Starbucks said it would buy the remaining 50 percent stake of its East China business from its joint venture partners for about $1.3 billion, in its biggest ever acquisition. Net income fell 8.3 percent to $691.6 million, or 47 cents per share, for the third quarter ended July 2. Excluding items, Starbucks earned 55 cents per share, which matched analysts’ average estimate as complied by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  U.S. restaurants are locked in a bitter fight for market share, battling new competition from non-traditional rivals such as meal kit sellers and convenience stores.  Sales at its mainstay U.S. cafes open at least 13 months rose 5 percent in the latest quarter. Traffic turned slightly positive, reversing three straight quarters of declines that the company attributed in part to changing its loyalty program to focus on dollars spent rather than the number of purchases they make. Still, executives cut Starbucks’ full-year net earnings per share target to a range of $1.96 to $1.97 from a previously lowered forecast of $2.06 to $2.10, following a deceleration in U.S. same-store sales that has continued into July.  “We think it’s a prudent thing to do,” Johnson told Reuters. Same-store sales from China, where there are 2,800 stores in 130 cities, were up a robust 7 percent in the latest quarter. The 16,302 cafes in Starbucks’ U.S.-dominated Americas region contributed $974.8 million in operating income in the quarter. In contrast, the 7,183 cafes from the China/Asia Pacific region posted $223.8 million. Johnson told Reuters that the cash deal in China, which will give it ownership of about 1,300 stores in Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, is part of the company’s “long game” in the country that is its fastest-growing market outside the United States. “Starbucks’ opportunity for growth in China is unparalleled ... and we are just getting started,” Johnson said. Starbucks, which bought Teavana for $620 million in 2012, said most stores will be closed by Spring 2018. It will continue selling Teavana branded products in its Starbucks stores.

846,SBUX,MOVES-Starbucks' new No.2 starts job by brewing coffee,"CHICAGO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Before taking on her new role as Starbucks Corp’s second in command, Rosalind Brewer got hands-on experience brewing coffee at company cafes to get an idea how the world’s biggest coffee seller could better serve customers. Brewer, appointed chief operating officer at Starbucks on Wednesday, will be using that experience to improve business in key areas such as the company’s U.S. and Chinese operations, as well as its online sales. “I got a chance to spend some time behind the lines and live their (employees’) lives a little bit and learn what it takes to make a cup of coffee, what’s playing in their favor and what’s working against them,” Brewer told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. Brewer, who was already serving as a member of the retailer’s board, will start in her new role on Oct. 2. She will be responsible for Starbucks’ businesses across Canada, the United States and Latin America, as well as its global supply chain, product innovation, and store development. At her former employer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Brewer was the first woman and the first African American to run a top business and was the longest serving CEO of its warehouse chain Sam’s Club from 2012 until January this year. The dialogue between Brewer and Starbucks about the new role started when she was a board member, Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson told Reuters. “Roz really asked great questions and had the insight into her experience from the past to operationalize some of these things as well as new ideas,” Johnson said of one meeting when he briefed the board on Starbucks’ strategic plan. Johnson said Brewer would drive a “broad agenda” as the company builds two growth engines - the United States, which will be a key business driver for the retailer and China, which is the second largest and fastest growing market in the world for the chain. To grow in the United States, one of the key elements will be expanding the chain’s customer reach by using a digital-mobile experience, Johnson said. As part of that, Brewer will focus on the Starbucks app. It accounts for 25 percent of purchases and its popularity has become an issue at stores, where pick-up lines for mobile orders are so long they discourage many customers from entering. Brewer said she hoped to improve customer experience by making sure store employees were in the right place at peak hours to deal with online orders. Brewer drove success at Sam’s Club’s by improving the chain’s e-commerce business through initiatives like drive-through pick up of online orders and scan-and-go, which allows shoppers to scan items with their phones and speed up checkout.

849,SBUX,Coffee consolidation percolates as hipsters drink up,"LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Nestle’s (NESN.S) high-priced purchase of a majority stake in California-based coffee bar chain Blue Bottle this week, highlights how big companies are seeking exposure to fast-growing premium brands driven by millenials. Industry experts are predicting more deals will follow in the highly fragmented coffee market, which provides richer profit margins than mainstream packaged food and drink.  Since 2015 there have been nine coffee deals by JAB Holding Co, owned by Europe’s billionaire Reimann family. With brands like Douwe Egberts and Tassimo sitting alongside Blue Bottle rival Intelligentsia, JAB now owns the second-biggest packaged coffee business behind Nestle, owner of Nescafe and Nespresso. “There are certainly going to be further purchases at all levels of the price tier,” said Matthew Barry, beverage analyst at Euromonitor International, adding that any company that is not doing acquisitions risks falling behind.  Earlier this month, Italy’s Massimo Zanetti (MZB.MI) bought a majority stake in Indonesian roaster Caswell’s and in August, Italy’s Lavazza bought a stake in France’s Espresso Service Proximite, its third acquisition in less than two years.  In May, Lavazza’s chief executive told Reuters the company could put together more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) for acquisitions. Switzerland’s Nestle announced its deal with Blue Bottle late on Thursday. Its few dozen coffee bars are part of the so-called third wave coffee movement in the United States, which emphasizes quality beans and expertly-made drinks. Analysts see the deal as evidence that an energized Nestle, under its new chief executive, is taking steps to reconnect with consumers, particularly young ones.  “It emphasizes the wish to actively work on the portfolio and build on attractive growth areas,” said Patrik Schwendimann, analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank.     The deal gives Nestle entrance to high-end bars that are part refreshment and part theater, with space-age “siphon” or “vacuum” brewers. While niche, these outlets are seen as testing labs for new trends that may eventually go mainstream, such as cold brew, single-origin beans and nitro coffee.  High street chains such as Starbucks and Costa (WTB.L) are already moving in that direction and a front-row seat could help Nestle innovate more quickly.     Nespresso already has a network of shops but Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt sees the Blue Bottle deal as being less about retail and more about Nestle getting a premium brand it may sell in packaged form. “I don’t think they’re trying to reinvent themselves as a retailer,” Waldschmidt said. “They could be looking at going a bit more multi-brand given that JAB is the epitome of multi-brand.”  It remains to be seen if there is enough demand for such exotic drinks outside major urban markets, or whether expanding too much will hurt the Blue Bottle brand’s cachet. For now, Nestle said Blue Bottle would continue as a standalone entity.  “At a national level, there is no evidence of a shift toward independent coffee,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a recent report on third wave coffee. “Independents are largely limited to the largest urban markets, which, while important to both chains (Starbucks and Costa), contribute a fairly small share of revenues or profits.” She estimated that the top third wave players - which include JAB’s Stumptown and Intelligentsia, Philz, Counter Culture, Blue Bottle and La Colombe Coffee Roasters - together generate just $126 million in revenue across 123 stores. By contrast, Starbucks alone generated $21.3 billion in revenue last year from 25,085 stores globally.  BIG MARK-UP  Nestle is the leader in a global packaged food and beverage market that has seen growth slow due to cooling emerging markets, increased competition from upstart brands and changing consumer tastes away from processed food.  The company, which is under pressure to improve returns from activist investor Third Point, has identified coffee as one of its key priorities for investment.  “There’s a big markup on coffee shop coffees,” Liberum’s Waldschmidt said. “Put it all together and you’ve got growth and margin, and in some areas, barriers to entry. Its fragmented so you can consolidate, which usually leads to margins going up.” Nestle’s overall operating margin was 15.3 last year, whereas the margin in its powdered and liquid drinks unit, which includes coffee, was 20.8 percent.

850,SBUX,Seattle off menu as Lavazza brews up plans for 15 coffee shops,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s largest coffee group Lavazza could open up to 15 stores around the world as it takes on Starbucks, but has no plans to go head-to-head in the U.S. chain’s hometown of Seattle. Lavazza’s top executives opened the family-owned company’s first coffee boutique in the center of Milan on Tuesday, close to where Starbucks (SBUX.O) plans to launch its first Italian store, offering specialty blends and fine food, next year.

However, Lavazza’s top managers said they do not see the U.S. group as a direct competitor, adding an expansion by Starbucks in China could even be a positive for the Italian firm as it will help shift customers there to coffee from tea. “If this first cafe is successful, we will open between 10 and 15 stores in the world’s biggest cities in coming years,” vice president Marco Lavazza, said, adding the group would focus on Austria, Britain, France, Germany and the United States. “In the U.S. we will likely open in New York... we are not thinking of Seattle,” he said of the west coast city where Starbucks built its first roastery, an upscale outlet that the U.S. chain plans to replicate in 20 cities, including Milan.

852,SBUX,Fried chicken to crayfish wraps: Philippines' Jollibee eyes deals to grow,"MANILA/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Filipino billionaire Tony Tan Caktiong, who has built Jollibee Foods Corp (JFC.PS) into a near-4,000 store purveyor of sweet-style spaghetti, burgers and fried chicken, is looking to buy existing brands in mature markets to help fuel future growth. Dominant at home, where Jollibee has 1,000 eponymous stores welcoming diners with its smiling bee logo, Tan now wants to reshape the $5 billion group as a global fast-food company, bankers and fund managers say. Primary targets include the United States and China, where it already has joint ventures, including Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O). Tan, 64, said at a company event in July that half of Jollibee’s total sales would come from overseas stores in the next five years. Currently, foreign stores including joint ventures account for 30 percent of sales. This week, people familiar with the matter said Jollibee was considering bidding for Pret A Manger, a UK-based chain selling organic coffee and wholesome sandwiches to office workers. It is still working out a valuation and has not yet decided to bid, the people said. “Jollibee has to keep chasing growth. They own pretty much every large chain in their home market,” said a regional banker who has dealt with the company. “They are definitely not shy when it comes to looking at mature markets.” Ysmael Baysa, Jollibee’s chief finance officer, told Reuters this week that buying new businesses “has always been part of our growth strategy.” Tan started out with two ice cream parlours in the 1970s, and expanded Jollibee rapidly into a fast food chain dubbed “the McDonald’s of the Philippines”. Forbes ranks him as the country’s eighth-wealthiest man. “They see where they could utilize the knowledge and synergies they have,” said Robert Ramos at Unionbank, who helps manage $795 million in funds and holds Jollibee stock. “They are increasing the revenue stream beyond the businesses they have now... They are choosing businesses in line with their core competence.” As discretionary incomes have grown in Asia, the region has become the second-largest fast food market globally after North America. Jollibee has created new domestic brands and has tie-ups with foreign chains. It bought a stake in Highlands Coffee, which outsells Starbucks (SBUX.O) in Vietnam, and opened its own outlets in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Jollibee’s interest in Pret A Manger - which owner Bridgepoint is said to be preparing for a U.S. listing this year - comes just two years after Tan paid around $100 million for a 40 percent stake in U.S.-based chain Smashburger, his biggest overseas deal to date. “If Jollibee wanted to do a $1 billion acquisition, it will have access to capital. It’s very liquid whether overseas or onshore. Jollibee is a premium credit,” said a person close to the company, who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named.  “Jollibee is very clear where they would like to grow: the Philippines, China and the U.S.” In China, the company operates about 400 stores of various brands, including joint ventures. While Jollibee’s original menu is a hit at home and among the diaspora of millions of Filipinos working overseas, it’s a challenge to broaden its appeal to international diners - hence the drive to acquire global brands. Jollibee’s revenue has more than tripled over the past decade to 113.9 billion pesos ($2.2 billion), its net income has jumped to 6.16 billion pesos, powered by strong consumer spending in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, and its shares trade at around 242 pesos each, up from 51.50 pesos a decade ago. Other Philippine companies, too, have used their plentiful cash and access to bank credit to make overseas deals, such as Universal Robina Corp’s (URC.PS) acquisition of Snackbrands Australia for $462 million last year, and Alliance Global Group’s (AGI.PS) earlier $291 million buy of Bodegas Fundador from Beam Suntory.

860,SBUX,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Starbucks sales disappoint and shares drop 6 percent,"(Corrects year-ago profit to $801 million from $801 billion) By Lisa Baertlein and Uday Sampath Kumar Nov 2 (Reuters) - IStarbucks Corp reported disappointing quarterly results on Thursday, after hurricanes cooled sales and amid a bitter battle with competitors ranging from boutique coffee seller Intelligentsia to lower-price rivals like McDonald’s. Total revenue missed Wall Street targets and sales at established global cafes were up 2 percent, missing analysts’ average target of 3.2 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. The Americas, Europe and Asia all posted rises in sales at established stores that fell short of expectations. Investors, long used to Starbucks beating Wall Street targets, sent shares down 6.3 percent to $51.40 in after-hours trade. Analysts have warned that the Seattle-based company is being “middled” by rising competition on the value and quality fronts and that it must bolster sales of higher-priced specialty drinks and breakfast sandwiches. Chief Executive Kevin Johnson told Reuters in an interview that there was no evidence Starbucks was being hit by competition. “We are not going to be squeezed in the middle,” he said. Johnson noted that U.S. restaurants in general are seeing declining traffic and said that the one area where the company has seen softness is in the afternoons, particularly with regard to sales of its blended beverages such as frappuccinos. Still, U.S. convenience stores and fast-food chains are improving quality and pricing aggressively. McDonald’s Corp recently expanded its McCafe menu with new macchiatos and lattes and is selling small McCafe espresso drinks for $2. Elsewhere, Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc is offering special deals on breakfast sandwiches in its bid to win breakfast. At the same time, upscale craft coffee rivals like Nestle SA’s Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia are opening more shops. The number of competing coffee shops within one mile of Starbucks shops in several large U.S. markets has increased in recent years, BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik said in a note before the earnings. Adding to the pressure, Strelzik said, Starbucks continues to build its own U.S. stores at the risk of cannibalizing sales. Johnson, who succeeded Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz as chief executive in April, is under pressure to continue serving up the kind of growth that Wall Street has come to expect from the world’s biggest coffee chain. In the last 12 months, Starbucks shares are up about 4 percent, while the S&P; 500 index is up more 20 percent. Starbucks’ stock has been trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.8, slightly above McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Brands, but well below the 52.74 ratio for Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc , according to Thomson Reuters data. Total net revenue decreased 0.2 percent to $5.70 billion, compared with analysts’ revenue target of $5.80 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company fell to $788.5 million, or 54 cents per share, in the latest quarter, from $801 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 55 cents per share, in line with Wall Street targets. Starbucks in the third quarter of 2016 changed the basis of its loyalty program to dollars spent from number of orders because customers were buying items individually to get more points. Traffic statistics fell when customers resumed ordering items together. Labor pressure is also heating up. Starbucks has been adding working hours at some U.S. stores to ease backups caused by a flood of mobile orders. Meanwhile, cities and states are boosting the minimum wage and a tightening labor market is forcing some chains to increase pay and benefits to recruit and retain workers. Same-store sales from China were up 8 percent, but the broader China and Asia Pacific region posted a rise of 2 percent, versus expectations of 3.2 percent.

864,SBUX,Starbucks problems to linger but turnaround on track: analysts,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) slow service at stores and rising competition from high-end coffee shops are likely to pressure its performance next year, analysts said, after the U.S. coffee-chain reported disappointing fourth-quarter sales on Thursday. However, the company’s shares were up 3 percent on Friday as analysts said the cut in Starbucks’ long-term forecasts was widely anticipated and expressed confidence in the management’s ability to turn things around. Starbucks’ plan to return $15 billion over the next three years was also termed as a confidence booster for investors, after shares were down in extended trading on Thursday following weaker-than-expected growth in the United States. The company has been struggling to fill orders at stores after it launched a mobile order-and-pay service to reach more customers, but that has caused congestion at its pickup counters, leading to slower service and frustrated customers. The company said on Thursday it was working to improve the time taken to service orders during peak morning hours, open up its mobile order-and-pay service to non-members and bring in more innovative food items. “Starbucks is often criticized for spinning too many plates in the air to drive top line, and we believe management is now signaling a more simplified focused approach going forward,” Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott said. Cowen & Co analyst Andrew Charles, however, said the company should focus on building out its beverage menu as food items have lower margins. “We would prefer to see beverage sales accelerate given outsized food sales growth has weighed on Americas gross margins by 80-90 basis points in the last 3 quarters,” Charles said. Six brokerages, including JP Morgan and Credit Suisse, reduced their price targets on the stock to as low as $52. The median price target on the stock is $62.50. Starbucks has been bleeding customers to boutique coffee sellers like Intelligentsia and lower-price rivals including McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), which is selling small McCafe espresso drinks for $2. The Seattle-based coffee chain said it expects to grow 12 percent or more, compared with its previous estimate of 15 percent to 20 percent. It also cut its global long-term same-store sales growth forecast to 3 percent to 5 percent from 4 percent to 6 percent.

By Lisa Baertlein and Uday Sampath Kumar (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) trimmed its profit forecast and posted disappointing quarterly sales on Thursday, squeezed by competitors ranging from boutique coffee sellers like Intelligentsia and lower-price rivals including McDonald’s.   Investors used to Starbucks beating expectations and raising profit outlooks sent shares down 3.4 percent in extended trading. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma battered same-store sales at more than 1,100 cafes in the United States, which still accounts for the lion’s share of operating income. Sales at U.S. cafes were up 2 percent for the quarter that ended Oct. 1. Excluding the hurricane impacts, they would have been up 3 percent - still just short of analysts’ estimate.  During a conference call, executives also pegged the same-store sales weakness to slower service as workers juggled mobile ordering, complex menus and other issues as well as soft restaurant foot traffic. The Seattle-based coffee chain cut its long-term earnings target to growth of 12 percent or greater per share from its prior call for growth of 15 percent to 20 percent.  Fourth-quarter revenue missed Wall Street’s target after sales at established global cafes gained 2 percent, less than analysts’ average target of 3.2 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.  Starbucks, which is cutting costs, streamlining menus and selling or shuttering some businesses, also announced a deal to sell its Tazo tea brand to Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) for $384 million. Analysts have warned that the Seattle-based company is being “middled” by rising competition on the value and quality fronts and that it must bolster sales of higher-priced specialty drinks and breakfast sandwiches.  CEO Kevin Johnson told Reuters in an interview that there was no evidence Starbucks was being hit by competition. “We are not going to be squeezed in the middle,” he said. But on a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said, “With competitive pressures on the rise, we remain laser-focused on driving profitable share growth as we head into calendar 2018.” U.S. convenience stores and fast-food chains are improving quality and pricing aggressively.  McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) recently expanded its McCafe menu with new macchiatos and lattes and is selling small McCafe espresso drinks for $2. Elsewhere, Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) is offering special deals on breakfast sandwiches in its bid to win breakfast. At the same time, upscale craft coffee rivals like Nestle SA’s (NESN.S) Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia are opening more shops. In the last 12 months, Starbucks shares are up about 4 percent, while the S&P; 500 index is up more 20 percent. Its  stock has been trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.8, slightly above McDonald’s but about half that of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), according to Thomson Reuters data.

869,SBUX,Starbucks problems to linger through next year - analysts,"Nov 3 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s slow service at stores and rising competition from high-end coffee shops are likely to pressure its performance next year, analysts said, after the U.S. coffee-chain reported disappointing fourth-quarter sales on Thursday. The company has been struggling to fill orders at stores after it launched a mobile order-and-pay service to reach more customers, but that has caused congestion at its pickup counters, leading to slower service and frustrated customers. Starbucks shares are up 4 percent over the past 12 months, hugely underperforming the S&P; 500 index that has surged 20 percent. The company’s shares were largely flat in premarket trading on Friday. While the sales environment had been challenged for most chain restaurants in the quarter, Starbucks seemed to be struggling to keep up with the customer flow, as mobile order-and-pay becomes more popular, Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski said in research note. “We do believe that Starbucks may be struggling with in-store customer flow more than the Street believes.” Kalinowski cut his price target to $63 from $67. The median price target on the stock is $63, still 15 percent above its $54.87 close on Thursday. Starbucks has been bleeding customers to boutique coffee sellers like Intelligentsia and lower-price rivals including McDonald’s Corp , which is selling small McCafe espresso drinks for $2.

873,SBUX,"UPDATE 1-China's budding coffee culture propels Starbucks, attracts rivals","* Starbucks opens first overseas “Reserve Roastery” * U.S. firm has 55 pct China market share * Aiming for 10,000 China stores within a decade * Growing cafe culture attracts more competition (Adds comments from executive chairman interview) By Adam Jourdan and Lisa Baertlein SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES, Dec 5 (Reuters) - In Wu Qiong’s small cafe in downtown Shanghai, coffee beans nestle in glass jars on the bar while various brews bubble away behind the counter. The cafe - one of thousands of trendy, artisan coffee shops in the city - reflects a growing cafe culture in China that’s driving growth for chains like Starbucks Corp and attracting more competition. “There are many more choices for consumers in the coffee market here now,” said Wu, 35, who set up the store with her boyfriend this year, the couple’s second outlet. “People can choose chains or go for specialist coffee stores.” Starbucks dominates in China where it has over 3,000 stores and is growing fast, even as in the United States it comes under pressure from a “third wave” of boutique coffee sellers and cheaper rivals. At a Shanghai launch event on Tuesday of its first overseas “Reserve Roastery” - an opulent flagship store with gourmet coffees and a bakery - executive chairman Howard Schultz said store numbers in China would hit 10,000 within a decade. “China is going to be bigger than the United States in less than 10 years,” he told Reuters in an interview at the store. Starbucks held a 54.8 percent share of China’s 25.2 billion yuan ($3.81 billion) specialist coffee shop market last year, far ahead of rivals like McDonald’s Corp’s McCafe and Whitbread Plc’s Costa Coffee, Euromonitor data show. Unlike in the United States, Starbucks’ challenge in China has been winning over traditional tea drinkers to coffee, rather than fending off local rivals. That could be changing. “Right now we notice an increasing number of small brands and independent coffee shops. They are registering explosive growth rates,” said Shanghai-based Euromonitor analyst Yu Limin. Shanghai alone has an estimated 6,500 coffee houses, with small chains, independent stores and bakeries battling for a slice of a market that Mintel says could grow to 79 billion yuan by 2022 from 60 billion yuan this year. Convenience stores, which already offer hot food popular with breakfast crowds, are also rolling out coffee. “There are a lot of new players and the cake is getting bigger,” said Lawrence Ge, founder of Single Patch Coffee, who runs coffee workshops and cafes in Shanghai and Suzhou. International coffee chains are now looking to get in on the act, too - despite Starbucks having a big head start. Peet’s Coffee, a craft chain that rivals Starbucks at home, opened its first China store last month, and has brought in local help from investment firm Hillhouse Capital and Sam Su, ex-China head of Yum Brands Inc, who drove impressive growth for KFC and Pizza Hut in China. “China is top of my priorities for 2018,” Pascal Heritier, chief operating officer of Italian coffee company Massimo Zanetti, told Reuters, adding the firm, which sells Boncafe and Segafredo coffee, was in talks with local partners about expanding its presence. “It’s not only for us, but the whole industry. It’s something that is booming... So for actors in the coffee industry, China will be a country to look at in the future.” Starbucks itself is doubling down on China, where in the latest quarter it saw 8 percent same-store sales growth and said it would buy out its joint venture partner in east China for $1.3 billion. As well as its new Shanghai coffee “roastery”, Starbucks has rolled out higher-end coffee bars in China, is looking to improve its food offering, and has leveraged popular mobile payment platforms from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd. That premium push may be too late to win back consumers like Zhou Hanwen, a market analyst in Shanghai who says she’s a “serious coffee user”, but has switched from Starbucks’ lattes to smaller, trendy coffee houses. “I like quieter venues and so usually go to rather arty, yuppie places,” she said, while sipping a brew at downtown Mellower Coffee, which has coffees with names like “sweet little rain” - an Americano with a “cloud” of candyfloss. Zhou added she also now more often makes coffee at home - another trend analysts say is challenging physical stores. For now at least, China’s developing cafe culture is likely to be more a boost than burden for big names like Starbucks. “I think the more people who are successful with coffee in this market the better it will be for Starbucks because more people will be educated around the product,” said Schultz. “There’s always competition,” he added. “We have competition all over the world.” ",12052017,http://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-china/update-1-chinas-budding-coffee-culture-propels-starbucks-attracts-rivals-idUSL3N1O541M

875,SBUX,"China's budding coffee culture propels Starbucks, attracts rivals","SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In Wu Qiong’s small cafe in downtown Shanghai, coffee beans nestle in glass jars on the bar while various brews bubble away behind the counter. The cafe - one of thousands of trendy, artisan coffee shops in the city - reflects a growing cafe culture in China that’s driving growth for chains like Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and attracting more competition. “There are many more choices for consumers in the coffee market here now,” said Wu, 35, who set up the store with her boyfriend this year, the couple’s second outlet. “People can choose chains or go for specialist coffee stores.” Starbucks dominates in China and is growing fast in the market, while in the United States it comes under pressure from a “third wave” of boutique coffee sellers and cheaper rivals. Executive chairman Howard Schultz, speaking at the launch of Starbucks’ first overseas “Reserve Roastery” - an opulent flagship store with gourmet coffees and a bakery - said China was on track to be “bigger, more powerful and more significant” than the firm’s U.S. business. “With the rising middle class and the opportunity in China, the market is going to be much larger here,” he said, adding Starbucks was looking to hit 10,000 outlets in China within a decade, catching up with the United States in terms of stores. The firm held a 54.8 percent share of China’s 25.2 billion yuan ($3.81 billion) specialist coffee shop market last year, far ahead of rivals like McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) McCafe and Whitbread Plc’s (WTB.L) Costa Coffee, Euromonitor data show. Unlike in the United States, Starbucks’ challenge in China has been winning over traditional tea drinkers to coffee, rather than fending off local rivals. That could be changing. “Right now we notice an increasing number of small brands and independent coffee shops. They are registering explosive growth rates,” said Shanghai-based Euromonitor analyst Yu Limin. Shanghai alone has an estimated 6,500 coffee houses, with small chains, independent stores and bakeries battling for a slice of a market that Mintel says could grow to 79 billion yuan by 2022 from 60 billion yuan this year. Convenience stores, which already offer hot food popular with breakfast crowds, are also rolling out coffee. “There are a lot of new players and the cake is getting bigger,” said Lawrence Ge, founder of Single Patch Coffee, who runs coffee workshops and cafes in Shanghai and Suzhou. International coffee chains are now looking to get in on the act, too - despite Starbucks having a big head start.

877,SBUX,Starbucks wins dismissal in U.S. of underfilled latte lawsuit,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has won the dismissal of a U.S. lawsuit accusing the coffee chain of overcharging customers by underfilling lattes and mochas to reduce milk costs. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Friday found a lack of evidence that Starbucks cheats customers by making its cups too small, using “fill-to” lines on baristas’ pitchers that are too low, and instructing baristas to skimp on ingredients, such as by leaving a quarter-inch of space atop drinks. The Oakland, California-based judge also rejected a claim that milk foam added to lattes and mochas should not count toward advertised volumes. She said reasonable customers expect foam to take up some volume, and the plaintiffs conceded that foam is an essential ingredient in their drinks. “Accordingly, plaintiffs fail to show that lattes contain less than the promised beverage volume represented on Starbucks’ menu boards,” Rogers wrote. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Sunday to requests for comment. Starbucks did not immediately respond to similar requests. Lattes contain espresso, steamed milk and foam. Mochas are similar but also contain a chocolate sauce. Siera Strumlauf and Benjamin Robles, both of California, and Brittany Crittenden of New York had accused Starbucks in their proposed nationwide class action of fraud and false advertising by underfilling 12-, 16- and 20-ounce lattes by about 25 percent, causing unspecified damages. Starbucks countered that its cups hold more than the advertised number of ounces, and that the “fill-to” lines provide guidance to baristas as to how much cold milk, which expands when steamed, to pour into pitchers. In 2016, two federal judges dismissed separate lawsuits accusing the Seattle-based company of cheating customers who bought iced beverages, finding that reasonable customers would understand that ice counts toward their drinks’ contents. The case is Strumlauf et al v Starbucks Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-01306.

879,SBUX,"Starbucks to boost pay, benefits after U.S. lowers corporate taxes","LOS ANGELES, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp will use some of the savings from the new U.S. corporate tax cuts to give domestic employees pay raises, company stock and expanded benefits with a combined worth of more than $250 million, the company said on Wednesday. With the announcement, the world’s biggest coffee chain joins companies like Walmart, Apple Inc, Comcast Corp and American Airlines Group Inc in sharing their tax savings with employees. Starbucks is known for giving its workers, which it calls “partners,” more generous pay and benefits than other mass-market restaurants and retailers. “Investing in our partners has long been our strategy, and due to the recent changes in U.S. tax law, we are able to accelerate some significant partner investments,” Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said in a letter to employees. Starbucks declined to say how much it expected its tax bill to drop under the new plan, and said executives would give details on its earnings call on Thursday. Credit Suisse analyst Jason West recently estimated that Starbucks’ global tax rate could fall to about 24-25 percent from around 33 percent, which would drive roughly $425 million in annual tax savings. Seattle-based Starbucks said it will give hourly and salaried employees, who received pay raises in January, a second wage increase in April. It is giving additional stock grants to eligible employees on April 16. Coffee shop workers will receive a grant of at least $500 and store managers will receive $2,000 grants. Starting July 1, all employees will accrue paid time off to care for themselves and loved ones when they are ill. Starbucks said the national benefit was designed to match or exceed the benefits some partners were already due under existing city or state-mandated paid sick leave laws. Starbucks also expanded its parental leave policy for cafe workers, giving non-birth parents up to six weeks of paid leave when welcoming a new child.

The three main indexes notched their best four-week run since 2016. Intel’s (INTC.O) shares surged as high as $50.15, their highest level since October 2000, and closed up 10.55 percent at $50.08 after results indicated that the chipmaker’s shift to higher-margin data-center business was working. AbbVie’s (ABBV.N) shares jumped 13.77 percent after the drugmaker significantly boosted its 2018 earnings forecast with help from U.S. tax reform and said it hopes to accelerate dividend growth and share buybacks. “We continue to see these positive steps in the right direction and definitely earnings are clearly justifying a lot of the recent move that we’ve had,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Fourth-quarter earnings growth for the S&P; 500 is now estimated at 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 12 percent at the start of the year. Of the 133 companies in the index that have reported through Friday, 79.7 percent have topped expectations. The earnings enabled investors to shrug off a reading on economic growth that came in below expectations.   Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report, below the 3-percent forecast, as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years resulted in a surge in imports. “You have manufacturing and the consumer doing well at the same time and the globe is doing better, so that’s a path for future GDP gains, which has always provided a fertile backdrop for earnings gains,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management in Milwaukee.

Intel’s shares surged about 9 percent to their highest in almost two decades, after results indicated that the chipmaker’s shift to higher-margin data-center business was gaining pace. AbbVie’s shares hit a record after the drugmaker significantly boosted its 2018 earnings forecast. The reports helped investors look beyond data that showed U.S. economic growth unexpectedly slowed in the fourth quarter as strong consumer spending resulted in a surge in imports. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy to expand at a 3 percent rate. “The Q4 print showed that domestic demand is strong – really strong – and perhaps beginning to push against the capacity constraints of the economy,” market economists at BNP Paribas wrote in a note. Another set of data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in December. Markets have moved this week on comments from top U.S. officials at the World Economic Forum in Davos. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s endorsement of a weak dollar earlier in the week had triggered a slide in the currency.

887,SBUX,Starbucks' 2018 may not be as bitter as some fear: analysts,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) shares fell 5 percent on Friday after the company reported weak holiday-quarter sales, indicating near-term troubles were far from over, but analysts said the brand’s strength and a growing Chinese fanbase would help it ride out the rough patch. Over the past year, the world’s largest coffee chain has hit a few bumps as it tries to boost sales - the rollout of mobile ordering that was supposed to attract more customers is still facing issues and it struggles to fill stores in the afternoons and evenings. On top of that, weak limited-time offers and holiday-themed coffees did not resonate with customers, hurting sales during its biggest sales quarter.     “Subpar 1st quarter top-line results, but we ask if this is a ‘broken story’ or just a great brand with huge moats and large growth opportunities rolling through a rough patch,” Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass said in a note. “We’d argue the latter, but acknowledge a year into the comp deceleration, its show-me time,” said Glass, and added that “Starbucks is the retailer with the highest customer frequency of any category we can think of.” Some analysts said the company had made inroads solving its problems. Starbucks has been adding working hours at some U.S. stores and is focusing on workflow, adding one or two more baristas to service orders during peak hours. It is also testing sending text messages to customers when their orders are ready.   The company is also doubling down in the Chinese market - where the cafe culture is taking off - to offset stagnant sales in the United States. China same-store sales were up 6 percent and Starbucks said it is planning to more than triple its over 3,000-store network in the country within a decade. It recently opened a massive, showcase Reserve Roastery in Shanghai. “Our U.S. Starbucks stores, on average, do about $32,000 a week. The Roastery in Shanghai after 8 weeks of operations is doing, on average, twice that, not each week but each day,” Howard Schultz, the company’s executive chairman said on a conference call on Thursday. Schultz stepped down as chief executive last year to focus on Starbucks’ premium business and the pressure is mounting on his successor Kevin Johnson to boost growth. Sales at established Americas region cafes in the quarter to Dec. 31 were up just 2 percent, falling short of Street estimates of a 3.3 percent rise.

Intel’s shares jumped more than 9 percent to their highest in almost two decades, after strong results offered the clearest sign yet that its years-long effort to shift away from a slowing PC business was paying off. AbbVie rose 8.9 percent after reporting upbeat profit on strong sales for its blockbuster drug Humira. The earnings helped investors looked beyond data that showed U.S. economic growth unexpectedly slowed in the fourth quarter, due to a surge in imports. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy to expand at a 3 percent rate. Another set of data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in December. “I was surprised at the headline numbers,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “But when you look at details, GDP growth is much stronger than what the headline number suggests.” The surge in imports looks to be seasonal, he said. Markets have moved this week on comments from top U.S. officials at the World Economic Forum in Davos. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s endorsement of a weak dollar, triggered a slide in the currency that helped prop up the indexes. The greenback clawed back some of the losses after President Donald Trump said he ultimately wants the dollar to be strong. The dollar was last down 0.44 percent against a basket of currencies. Trump in his address at Davos warned trading partners that Washington would no longer tolerate unfair trade, but added that the United States was “open for business”. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 86.9 points, or 0.33 percent, to 26,479.69 and the S&P; 500 rose 14.61 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,853.86.

893,SBUX,Starbucks to skip 'Frappuccino Happy Hour' in U.S. this summer,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) has told employees it is taking its Frappuccino Happy Hour special off the menu in the United States this summer, as it shakes up its promotions in a bid to strengthen sales after a disappointing holiday season.  The world’s biggest coffee chain has been struggling with decelerating same-store sales in its dominant U.S. market and weakness in the afternoon and evening hours - and has put some of the blame on its Frappuccino promotions.     “As part of our updated approach to products, events and offers, a different approach to summer offers will be planned that does not include Happy Hour,” the coffee chain said in its  recently released Spring Partner Planning Kit for U.S. employees.     Company spokeswoman Haley Drage confirmed the language in the communication to employees but said Starbucks is not canning  Frappuccino Happy Hour. She declined to elaborate. Starbucks for several years has offered some form of Frappuccino Happy Hour, which is popular with customers but not baristas. Frappuccinos are sweet, icy, blended drinks that are more labor-intensive than many of the company’s other beverages. Last year’s U.S. promotion offered half-priced Frappuccinos from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., from May 5 to May 14. That special resulted in “a lower-than-expected lift in nondiscounted Frappuccino beverages following Happy Hour,” Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said on a conference call with analysts in July 2017. Executives told analysts last week that Starbucks’ cafe sales in Japan are being weighed down by softness in limited-time offers, particularly on Frappuccino drinks. On Thursday, Starbucks warned that 2018 global same-store sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast, after holiday merchandise and limited-time seasonal drinks fell flat with U.S. customers during what is traditionally a blockbuster year-end quarter. [nL2N1PK21T] Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said Starbucks’ strategy for boosting sales includes focusing on drinks such as iced coffee, tea, cold brew and draft beverages such as Nitro Cold Brew, which are more popular in the afternoon. To that end, Starbucks is speeding up the roll-out of its hipster Nitro Cold Brew to 2,300 stores in the United States by the year from 1,300 stores currently. Nitro coffee, which looks like dark beer, is infused with nitrogen gas, stored in a keg and served from a tap. Starbucks has nearly 14,200 cafes in the United States.

895,SBUX,"CORRECTED-Wrigley lawsuit: Don't use Starburst, Skittles to sell e-cigarette liquid","(Reuters) - The chewing gum and candy company Wm Wrigley Jr Co said in a new lawsuit that a seller of e-liquid for electronic cigarettes should stop trading off its Starburst and Skittles brands in its marketing. In a complaint filed on Monday in Chicago federal court, Wrigley accused Get Wrecked Juices LLC of infringing its trademarks and causing unspecified damages by selling “Pink Starburst” and “Skeetlez” e-liquid in colorful advertising. The unit of privately-held Mars Inc said this included the depiction of a pink square resembling Starburst, and colored round “lentils” imprinted with the letter S resembling Skittles. Wrigley said there was “growing concern” among U.S. regulators and politicians that the marketing of e-cigarette materials in candy flavors “harmfully targets” children. “Defendants have refused to cease their misappropriation of Wrigley’s famous and federally registered Starburst and Skittles trademarks ... in an intentional effort to trade off of the valuable goodwill that Wrigley has built up,” Wrigley said. Wrigley’s lawsuit named Jacksonville, Florida-based Get Wrecked and principal Brian Edward Turner as defendants. They did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. A lawyer for the defendants could not immediately be identified. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration discourages children from using e-cigarettes, many of which contain nicotine, and has said it hopes this year to launch a full-scale education campaign to warn teenagers about the dangers. Wrigley said Get Wrecked has ignored its demands to stop sales of infringing products, though it changed the “Skeetlez” product image to a rainbow. The case is Wm Wrigley Jr Co v Get Wrecked Juices LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 18-00642.

898,SBUX,"Wall Street says Starbucks has too many stores, prices too high","Feb 2 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has too many stores and its prices are too high, Wall Street analysts are starting to agree, as they seek to explain the company’s slowing U.S. growth. The world’s biggest coffee chain now has more U.S. locations than McDonald’s Corp but it has been struggling for more than a year to lure the traffic needed to deliver the growth that investors have come to expect. Executives last week warned that Starbucks’ 2018 same-store sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast. The chain reported a 2 percent U.S. quarterly same-store sales gain that fell short of expectations on flat holiday traffic. Two years ago, those sales jumped 9 percent. Starbucks itself has offered a laundry list of reasons for the deceleration in its domestic business, including weak retail traffic, changes to its rewards program, bottlenecks from a crush of mobile orders, and holiday merchandise and drink specials that failed to “resonate” with customers. Executives concede that Starbucks’ U.S. afternoon business has dragged down results in its most important market. Still, they say that Starbucks - which had 14,163 U.S. locations at year-end, 25 percent more than five years ago and 127 more than McDonald’s - is not cannibalizing its own sales or losing share in a market crowded with coffee sellers ranging from independent cafes to fast-food chains and convenience stores. Analysts disagree. A recent analysis of restaurant industry trends, retail traffic and other factors led Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore to solidify her view that “excess unit growth, at a time when Starbucks is reaching a more mature stage of growth, is the root cause” of the company’s domestic woes. “Rather than a litany of excuses, we believe this is best explained by overcapacity in the industry,” said John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, a Paris-based boutique research firm. “Starbucks is contributing to the problem by opening new units.” Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said the brew of stepped-up competition combined with Starbucks’ recent opening of roughly 700 U.S. stores a year, is weighing on its “ability to re-accelerate growth.” Starbucks said on Friday its new cafes perform well and bring more business to all nearby coffee shops, not just its own. Proliferation of stores is not Starbucks’ only problem, according to analysts. Zolidis also sees another troubling sign: “We believe the company has raised prices too much.” Starbucks did not immediately comment on pricing. McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts, owned by Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc, have been holding down drink prices, said Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson, who analyzes 10 markets in the U.S. Northeast, including New York, Boston and Washington. McDonald’s - now selling $1 coffee and $2 small espresso drinks - has kept prices mostly flat for the last two years. Dunkin Donuts’ has raised prices by roughly 1 percent per year, while Starbucks has raised prices by about 3.5 percent each year, said Anderson, who added that the rivals may be peeling off some of Starbucks’ less-affluent customers.

Starbucks  reported a 2 percent U.S. quarterly same-store sales gain that fell short of expectations on flat holiday traffic. Two years ago, those sales jumped 9 percent. Starbucks has offered a laundry list of reasons for the deceleration in its domestic business, including weak retail traffic, changes to its rewards program, bottlenecks from a crush of mobile orders, and holiday merchandise and drink specials that failed to “resonate” with customers. Executives concede that Starbucks’ U.S. afternoon business has dragged down results in its most important market.  Still, they say that Starbucks - which had 14,163 U.S. locations at year-end, 25 percent more than five years ago and 127 more than McDonald’s - is not cannibalizing its own sales or  losing share in a market crowded with coffee sellers ranging from independent cafes to fast-food chains and convenience stores. Analysts disagree. After a recent analysis of restaurant industry trends, retail traffic and other factors, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore solidified her view that “excess unit growth, at a time when Starbucks is reaching a more mature stage of growth, is the root cause” of the company’s domestic woes. “Rather than a litany of excuses, we believe this is best explained by overcapacity in the industry,” said John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, a Paris-based boutique research firm. “Starbucks is contributing to the problem by opening new units.” Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said the brew of stepped-up competition combined with Starbucks’ recent opening of roughly 700 U.S. stores a year, weighs on its “ability to re-accelerate growth.” Starbucks said on Friday its new cafes perform well and bring more business to all nearby coffee shops, not just its own. Proliferation of stores is not Starbucks’ only problem, according to analysts. Zolidis also sees another troubling sign: “We believe the company has raised prices too much.”  Starbucks on average is increasing prices 1 to 2 percent on an annual basis, while offering discounts through its rewards program, spokesman Reggie Borges said.    Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson, who tracks coffee prices in 10 markets in the U.S. Northeast, including New York, Boston and Washington, said that McDonald’s - now selling $1 coffee and $2 small espresso drinks - has kept prices mostly flat for the last two years. Anderson said that Dunkin’ Donuts, owned by Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O),  has raised prices by roughly 1 percent per year, while Starbucks has increased prices by about 3.5 percent each year. The analyst added that the rivals may be peeling off some of Starbucks’ less-affluent customers.

907,SBUX,"Starbucks opens first Reserve store, sees retail rents easing","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) on Tuesday opened the first of 1,000 planned upscale Starbucks Reserve stores as part of a broad strategy to defend against high-end coffee rivals like Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea and Blue Bottle Coffee Co (NESN.S). Starbucks for the first time in 2017 had more U.S. outlets than McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N). The world’s biggest coffee chain reached that milestone as competition from high- and low-end rivals mounted, and its own cooling traffic trends sparked worries that it was opening too many stores. The new Reserve store is located in Starbucks’ Seattle headquarters building and will expand on the company’s showcase Seattle Reserve Roastery drink menu with new items such as nitro draft lattes. It also will serve food from Princi Italian bakery and alcoholic drinks from a “mixology” bar.  Starbucks co-founder and Executive Chairman Howard Schultz, who stepped down as chief executive in April to oversee the chain’s ultra-premium Roastery and Reserve projects, said the new project will help “re-define customer connection and continue to serve as a halo to the rest of the business.”  Schultz said he has seen an “abundance of empty store fronts across the country” in prime locations and predicted that rents would begin to fall due to the continued shift from brick-and-mortar stores to online shopping.   “This is GOOD NEWS for Starbucks and the future of our unit economics,” Schultz said in a memo to Starbucks executives on Sunday. “This is not going to be a cyclical change in our occupancy expenses, but a permanent lowering of the cost of our real estate.” Starbucks has been opening about 700 traditional U.S. cafes per year. It has long-term plans to open up to 30 Reserve Roastery emporiums, 1,000 Reserve stores and to install Reserve bars at 20 percent of its mainstay stores.

915,SBUX,Starbucks' mobile order push meets resistance from ritual seekers,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) wants more people to use its time-saving mobile ordering app that lets customers buy drinks without waiting in line.  Interviews with more than two dozen Starbucks customers suggest that the move, aimed at countering robust competition from fast-food chains and other coffee sellers, may face obstacles. To start, saving time was not high on some customers’ wish lists. In fact, several said they deliberately slow down their Starbucks visits to indulge in mini catch-up sessions with the “baristas” who take orders and make lattes.       Such comments highlight Starbucks’ cultural conundrum: How can the company meet the demands of tech-savvy, time-crunched customers as well as growth-hungry investors without turning into a commodity fast-food chain?  “I don’t mind standing in line. I like to chat with the baristas,” said Los Angeles business consultant John Mishler, 30, who began using Starbucks’ mobile order app shortly after it launched nationally in September 2015.  He visits a Starbucks virtually every day, but only uses the service roughly once every three weeks. “I have an excuse to be doing nothing,” Mishler said, referring to his wait in line. “It’s part of my morning routine and I don’t want to change it.” “If my life is so complicated that I can’t wait 5 minutes for a cup of coffee, I have to realign my priorities,” said San Francisco Bay Area marketing consultant Diane Schreiber, 49. Kevin Johnson, who succeeded Starbucks’ co-founder Howard Schultz as chief executive in April last year, told shareholders on Wednesday that Starbucks can satisfy both rushing customers and those who prefer to take it easy.  “Some in the industry believe that you must either focus on a retail experience that is about community or a retail experience that is about convenience, you cannot do both,” he said at the company’s annual meeting in Seattle. “We do not buy into the false trade off.”  Shortly after launching the mobile-ordering service, Starbucks suffered a fiasco - bottlenecks at locations where baristas were not prepared for the crush of orders. Baristas worked through the issues, and by the end of 2017 mobile orders accounted for 11 percent of Starbucks’ U.S. transactions. Now, the company wants to offer mobile orderings, previously available only to members of its loyalty program, to all customers.     Its journey is instructive for other restaurants, including McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O), which followed Starbucks into mobile ordering.  Such services might help companies save money by automating tasks. On the other hand, some customers say they can put spending on autopilot - a potentially expensive proposition when Starbucks medium “grande” lattes cost around $5 each.  Molly Harper, 26, stopped using Starbucks mobile order after it became a burden on her wallet.     “Your money runs out pretty fast,” said Harper, a Los Angeles restaurant server and self-described coffee lover. She was spending about $40 a week on mobile order and has cut way back since dropping it.     All of the customers interviewed by Reuters appreciated the appeal of faster service, and some prefer it.   Alex Vorro, 37, who works in downtown Chicago, is satisfied with mobile ordering - except when beverages take significantly longer than the app estimates or he gets the wrong drink because of a mix-up with someone with the same name. Washington, D.C., economist Preston Motes, 49, visits Starbucks weekly, pays with its app but doesn’t use mobile order because he finds it “irritating.”     His beef? Mobile orders go into the queue as soon as they are placed, allowing users to skip ahead of the people who are waiting in line.     “I’m always wondering why my drink takes longer when there’s no one in line and it’s because of the mobile orders,” Motes said.     That is not lost on Robert Street, 33, a former Starbucks barista who is still in the habit of watching customers.     Street sends his mobile order to Starbucks through Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Alexa every morning as he is leaving for work at a private high school in Houston.     Breezing past the line in the store to grab his beverage  waiting on the counter, “I selfishly feel like I won the system and saved a bunch of time,” Street said.     Then, he notices the people in line.     “I always feel like a criminal,” said Street, who admits that he still feels like he is pilfering a drink he already paid for.      He’s heard waiting customers ask baristas what he is doing and wants them to know that he is not Instagram’s @thisisnotmycoffee - a “Bandit” who rates stolen Starbucks mobile order drinks. When reached by Reuters, @thisisnotmycoffee declined comment.

917,SBUX,"UPDATE 3-Starbucks coffee in California must have cancer warning, judge says","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and other coffee sellers must put a cancer warning on coffee sold in California, a Los Angeles judge has ruled, possibly exposing the companies to millions of dollars in fines. A little-known not-for-profit group sued some 90 coffee retailers, including Starbucks, on grounds they were violating a California law requiring companies to warn consumers of chemicals in their products that could cause cancer.  One of those chemicals is acrylamide, a byproduct of roasting coffee beans that is present in high levels in brewed coffee. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle said in a decision dated Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies had failed to show there was no significant risk from a carcinogen produced in the coffee roasting process, court documents showed. Starbucks and other defendants have until April 10 to file objections to the decision. Starbucks declined to comment, referring reporters to a statement by the National Coffee Association (NCA) that said the industry was considering an appeal and further legal actions.     “Cancer warning labels on coffee would be misleading. The U.S. government’s own Dietary Guidelines state that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle,” the NCA statement said. In his decision, Berle said: “Defendants failed to satisfy their burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that consumption of coffee confers a benefit to human health.” Officials from Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O), McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Peet’s and other big coffee sellers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The lawsuit was filed in 2010 by the Council for Education and Research on Toxics (CERT). It calls for fines as large as $2,500 per person for every exposure to the chemical since 2002 at the defendants’ shops in California. Any civil penalties, which will be decided in a third phase of the trial, could be huge in California, which has a population of nearly 40 million. CERT’s lawyer Raphael Metzger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Starbucks lost the first phase of the trial in which it failed to show the level of acrylamide in coffee was below that which would pose a significant risk of cancer. In the second phase of the trial, defendants failed to prove there was an acceptable “alternative” risk level for the carcinogen, court documents showed. Several defendants in the case settled before Wednesday’s decision, agreeing to post signage about the cancer-linked chemical and pay millions in fines, according to published reports.

918,SBUX,Breakingviews - Starbucks’ anti-racism coffee break sets example,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Starbucks is setting an example for corporate America with its anti-racism coffee break. Facing a backlash over the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia shop, the chain will shut all of its company-owned U.S. outlets for an afternoon of racial-bias education. The swift response backs up Starbucks’ social goals and offers a lesson to others. The two men were waiting to meet a friend and hadn’t bought anything when the store manager called police, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “All the other white people are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing,” tweeted customer Melissa DePino, who posted a video of the incident. Executive Chairman Howard Schultz and Chief Executive Kevin Johnson quickly traveled to Philadelphia and met with employees, police and community leaders. One result is that on May 29 Starbucks will close more than 8,000 U.S. outlets for an afternoon to provide anti-bias training to nearly 175,000 employees. That could cost perhaps $20 million in lost latte sales, based on pro-rated recent sales figures. The company has asked civil rights leaders and officials including former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for help developing a curriculum, which it will make available to other companies. That sounds a bit like a PR gimmick but Starbucks deserves credit for its efforts on a broad front. The company was an early U.S. adopter of social-responsibility reporting.

921,SBUX,Starbucks CEO says arrests of two black men 'reprehensible',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) Chief Executive Kevin Johnson hopes to meet with the two black men arrested at one of its Philadelphia cafes last week to apologize for the incident, which has sparked accusations of racial profiling at the coffee chain. The men, who had not made a purchase, were handcuffed and arrested for trespassing on Thursday after a store manager called 911 and reported them for refusing to leave. Witnesses said the men were calmly sitting in the cafe and in a widely viewed video, some patrons asked police whether they were targeted because they are black.  Police released the men, who were not charged. “The circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome in our store on Thursday were reprehensible ... they were wrong,” Johnson told ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday, amid protests and calls for a boycott on social media. The female manager who reported the men to police has left the company, a Starbucks representative said.   The incident came at a time when the company is grappling with flat traffic and lackluster sales growth at its more than 14,000 U.S. cafes. It is a high-profile public relations test for Johnson, a former technology executive who took the helm at Starbucks roughly a year ago. Johnson, who was interviewed from Philadelphia, said it was “completely inappropriate to engage the police.” He added that Starbucks would conduct training to prevent unconscious bias. Representatives for the two men could not immediately be reached. Protesters crowded the store that was the scene of the arrest on Monday morning. It was closed at around midday. More protests and a news conference are expected in the afternoon.  The Reverend Mark Tyler, part of an interfaith group organizing a protest on Monday afternoon, said he had not heard reports of similar issues at other area Starbucks. Still, he said, “the idea of black people being unwanted in downtown Philadelphia is not new ... this is the underbelly of gentrification.” ",4172018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philadelphia-starbucks/starbucks-ceo-says-arrests-of-two-black-men-reprehensible-idUSKBN1HN2AL
922,SBUX,Starbucks' Schultz steps in as outrage over cafe arrests simmers,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) turned to long-time leader Howard Schultz on Wednesday to make the case that the U.S. coffee chain accused of racial profiling is committed to offering a “safe space” to customers despite the arrest of two black men in one of its Philadelphia cafes. Closing 8,000 company-owned cafes on the afternoon of May 29 “to do significant training with our people is just the beginning of what we will do to transform the way we do business and educate our people on unconscious bias,” Schultz, Starbucks’ co-founder and executive chairman, told CBS This Morning.  He joined CEO Kevin Johnson and other executives for a meeting with Philadelphia clergy and community leaders later in the day. Schultz’s appearance on Wednesday marked his return to the  limelight after stepping down as CEO last year. Daily management has been left to Johnson, who lacks his predecessor’s experience with social issues and damage control.  “Howard always comes back when they’re in trouble,” said Robert Passikoff, president of consultancy Brand Keys, referring to Schultz’s 2008 return as CEO during the financial crisis. Starbucks, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, is at the center of a social media storm prompted by a Philadelphia cafe manager’s decision to call police on the two men, who had not made a purchase and were waiting on a friend. They were released without charges.  Video of the Philadelphia arrests spawned protests and calls for boycotts at the chain whose U.S. traffic has flattened in recent years because of intense competition.  “Race is a very difficult subject to discuss. We learned that three years ago,” said Schultz. He was referring to the backlash from Starbucks’ 2015 “Race Together” campaign, which aimed to start a conversation on race relations in the wake of high-profile police shootings of several unarmed black men.     Hugh Taft-Morales, president of the national leaders council of the non-profit American Ethical Union, called on the company to help create a “new wave of justice” during the meeting with Schultz and other executives.  Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan said closing 8,000 stores for training on May 29 could result in $5 million to $7 million in lost sales. Starbucks has directed cafe employees to welcome customers, protesters and people who are “visiting for any reason,” according to a Monday memo viewed by Reuters, which in particular directed employees to let anyone use restrooms.      ",4182018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philadelphia-starbucks/starbucks-schultz-steps-in-as-outrage-over-cafe-arrests-simmers-idUSKBN1HP39L

The company said in the Tuesday announcement that it will also provide training materials for non-company workers at the roughly 6,000 licensed Starbucks cafes that will remain open in locations such as grocery stores and airports.  The announcement from world’s biggest coffee company comes as it tries to cool tensions after the Philadelphia incident last week sparked accusations of racial profiling at the chain, which is the subject of a boycott campaign on social media. The controversy is the biggest public relations test yet for new Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson, who already was fighting to boost traffic to Starbucks amid competition from coffee sellers ranging from hipster cafes to fast-food chains and convenience stores. “While this is not limited to Starbucks, we’re committed to being a part of the solution,” said Johnson, a former technology executive who took the helm about a year ago.

For example, the company’s 2015 “Race Together” campaign to foster a conversation on the topic following the high-profile police shootings of several unarmed black men stirred an intense social media backlash. Johnson has apologized for the “reprehensible” arrests of the two men in Philadelphia on Thursday and took personal responsibility for the incident, which was captured in a customer video that was shared widely.   Starbucks attorneys said Johnson and the men, who were released without charges, have “engaged in constructive discussions about this issue as well as what is happening in communities across the country.”  Philadelphia Police late on Tuesday released the series of calls that led to their arrests.

926,SBUX,Black men arrested at Starbucks hope scandal sparks change,"(Reuters) - A week after their arrests at a Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) cafe in Philadelphia sparked protests and calls for boycotts of the coffee chain, the two black men involved broke their silence and said they wanted the incident to change U.S. racial attitudes. The men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, sat down with ABC’s “Good Morning America” as scrutiny of the popular chain and U.S. police tactics widen.   The arrests have been a “stepping stone to really stand up and show your greatness and that you are not judged by the color of your skin,” Nelson said. A video of the incident, filmed by an onlooker, has been viewed almost 11 million times. Their arrests sparked protests and a decision by Starbucks to close more than 8,000 stores on May 29 for employee racial-tolerance training.  The incident put Starbucks, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, at the center of a social media storm after the cafe manager called police on Nelson and Robinson, who had not made a purchase and were waiting to meet a friend.  The manager, who is no longer with the company, called police within two minutes of the pair’s arrival, according to the men’s account of the incident. They were released without charges. “It didn’t really hit me what was going on, that this was real, until I’m being double-locked with my hands behind my back,” Robinson said. Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who came under sharp criticism for the incident and his defense of the officers, apologized to Robinson and Nelson and said he had made the situation worse. Ross told a news conference he had been unaware that Starbucks’ policy was to allow people to remain in its cafes without making a purchase. Police will draft a policy to deal with similar situations, he said. The men’s attorney, Stewart Cohen, said they are in mediation with Starbucks.  The arrests in Philadelphia have also prompted comments from relatives of a man in Milwaukee who was shot to death four years ago after employees at a Starbucks twice called police to report a man sleeping in a nearby park. While Starbucks referred to the calls as wellness checks, an officer shot the man, who was black, to death.    Then-Chief Executive Howard Schultz met with the man’s family in 2015 and apologized in a private meeting, said Nate Hamilton, the brother of victim Dontre Hamilton, who spoke to media this week after the Philadelphia arrests.  “I’m happy it didn’t turn out the same way,” Hamilton told Reuters. “Starbucks, they talk a good game,” he said of Schultz’s plans. “Is it going to be put into action?” ",4192018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philadelphia-starbucks/black-men-arrested-at-starbucks-hope-scandal-sparks-change-idUSKBN1HQ1VI
927,SBUX,"Starbucks' promotions struggle to attract U.S. customers, shares slip","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) on Thursday reported stagnant store traffic at established U.S. cafes for the second quarter in a row, stirring concerns about intense competition from upscale coffee houses as well as fast-food chains and convenience stores. Shares in the world’s biggest coffee chain fell 1.9 percent in extended hours after stepped-up promotions failed to lure more U.S. customers, who drive the lion’s share of Starbucks profits.  Same-store sales for the U.S.-dominated Americas region rose 2 percent for the second quarter ended April 1. Increased spending per visit drove the same-store sales rise since customer visits, referred to as traffic, were flat. Starbucks’ home market of the United States is its largest, with more than 14,000 stores. During the quarter, U.S. cafes offered 15 percent off new blonde espresso drinks and half-price espresso drinks during afternoon Happy Hour. But China is Starbucks’ biggest growth driver. Same-store sales in that 3,200-store market were up 4 percent in the second quarter, versus gains of 6 percent and 8 percent in the two prior periods. Executives attributed the softer results in the latest quarter to a shift in the timing of Lunar New Year. They said business remains strong, but declined to give traffic results.  Starbucks’ global traffic was down 1 percent for the quarter, with the Europe, Middle East and Africa region falling 4 percent.  Total revenue rose almost 14 percent to $6.0 billion.

932,SBUX,Facebook adds more tools to Workplace to court business customers,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 1 (Reuters) - Facebook has announced a way to plug popular business tools into the social network’s office collaboration service, called Workplace, in an effort to catch up with features in competitors such as Slack. Facebook has long courted business customers but is mostly identified with its consumer brands, including its social network, Messenger and WhatsApp. Workplace collaboration is a fast-growing area but rivals including Slack and Microsoft Teams already offer third-party app integrations as a way to entice and keep customers. The market is projected to be worth $3.2 billion by research firm IDC and is fast becoming crowded with entrants that also include Alphabet Inc’s Google, Cisco Systems Inc and Atlassian Corp Plc. Facebook’s Workplace product will gain a so-called Integration Directory of more than 50 software services including Microsoft Corp’s SharePoint, SurveyMonkey and Atlassian’s Jira, which helps developers manage projects and build software. These workplace collaboration tools stand to serve as influential hubs from which office workers access the business software they use. Facebook, which introduced Workplace in late 2016, claimed in October that more than 30,000 organizations use the product, including Match Group Inc, which owns Tinder, Farmers Insurance Group and Starbucks Corp. The company declined to provide recent figures or share how many organizations pay for the premium service. By comparison, Microsoft Teams is used by 200,000 organizations while Slack claims 50,000 paying organizations. Still, worries about Facebook’s management of private data on its consumer business are undermining interest in Workplace draws from corporations, analysts said. “Companies, for now at least, are being more conscious around Workplace because of the lack of clarity around data usage that has plagued the parent brand,” Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC, told Reuters. With integrations, Workplace is also playing catch-up. Microsoft Teams claims 250 integrations while Slack’s ecosystem stands at more than 1,000. “It’s a competitive market,” said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. Facebook’s vice president of Workplace, Julien Codorniou, said that Facebook decided which apps to allow into the system. “We think that making apps that people already use today work better together is more important than offering one thousand apps to our clients,” Codorniou said, adding that Facebook and a third party were reviewing the apps for security. That may not be enough for corporate customers. “Business buyers want to know their vendors have a thoughtful and adult strategy to support them and ensure their success — and Facebook isn’t perceived as either,” said Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst with Nucleus Research.

Any deal between the coffee giants would not involve any of the Seattle-based chain’s more than 28,000 cafes, according to Bloomberg, which reported the news after Swiss financial blog Inside Paradeplatz. The deal could net Starbucks $3.8 billion after tax, according to Cowen analysts, based on Starbucks’ operating earnings excluding its K-Cups and the multiple recently paid for Keurig Green Mountain. They predicted Starbucks would use that to buy back shares. An agreement will probably be announced on Monday, Bloomberg said.  Nestle and Starbucks both declined to comment.

938,SBUX,Nestle and Starbucks strike $7.15 billion coffee licensing deal,"LOS ANGELES/LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-based Nestle, the world’s largest food and beverage company, will pay Starbucks Corp $7.15 billion in cash for exclusive rights to sell the U.S. chain’s packaged coffees and teas around the world, tying a premium brand to Nestle’s global distribution muscle.  The agreement announced on Monday could rev up Starbucks’ roughly $2 billion business selling packaged Starbucks coffee, Teavana tea and other products through grocery stores and other retailers, including in China.  The alliance, which amounts to a licensing arrangement, frees Seattle-based Starbucks to focus on improving its mainstay U.S. cafe business, where traffic growth has stalled amid competition from fast-food chains and upscale coffee houses, while rapidly adding shops in China. Starbucks will use proceeds to increase planned stock buybacks to $20 billion from $15 billion through fiscal 2020. It said the deal would add to earnings per share by 2021.  The agreement also includes Starbucks-branded capsules for Nestle’s Nespresso and Dolce Gusto single-serve brewers, which should help Nestle curb sales of alternatives from other providers. Nestle expects the alliance to add to its earnings by 2019. It did not alter share buyback plans.  In addition to the cash payment, Starbucks will receive revenue from product sales and royalties. “This global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestle,” said Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson, calling the arrangement a brand amplifier. “That would have taken a lot of capital and years to build outside the U.S.,” John Culver, Starbucks’ group president for international and channel development, said on a conference call with analysts.  Nestle CEO Mark Schneider has made coffee a strategic priority as he tries to convince uneasy shareholders, including activist Third Point, that he can boost the sprawling group’s performance. “This is all about growth,” Schneider told analysts.  He said he expects the alliance to boost Nestle in North America and benefit Starbucks in China, which is Nestle’s second largest market.  Analysts agreed that the alliance could strengthen Nestle’s position as the world’s biggest coffee company in a fast-changing landscape. Rival JAB Holdings, a private investment firm of Europe’s billionaire Reimann family, narrowed the gap with Nestle with a recent series of acquisitions, including Peet’s Coffee & Tea and Keurig Green Mountain. In January, Nestle sold its U.S. confectionery business to Ferrero. It had been losing ground in the United States confectionery sector as rivals moved towards healthier products. Nestle, which will take on about 500 Starbucks employees, will not buy any industrial assets as part of the deal.     Shares in Nestle rose about 1.6 percent in Switzerland, while Starbucks shares slipped 0.4 to close at $57.45 in U.S. trading.  Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks and are willing to pay for exotic beans and specialty drinks that translate into richer profit margins than mainstream packaged food.     The agreement will strengthen Nestle’s position in the United States, where ranks fifth with less than 5 percent of the market. Market leader Starbucks has a 14 percent share, according to Euromonitor International.     Other big players are growing as well, including Italy’s Lavazza, which is now the world’s No. 3.

U.S. crude climbed above $70 per barrel for the first time since November 2014, boosted by Venezuela’s deepening economic crisis and a looming decision on whether the United States will re-impose sanctions on Iran.

944,SBUX,Breakingviews - Nestlé gets welcome jolt from Starbucks deal,"MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nestlé is getting a welcome jolt from Starbucks. On Monday, the Swiss food giant said it would pay $7.2 billion for the perpetual right to sell Starbucks-branded coffee pods, beans and so on. With $2 billion a year in annual sales, the business will help Nestlé in its shift away from junk food. Nestlé is already a big name in coffee, thanks to brands like Nespresso and Nescafe. But Chief Executive Mark Schneider wants to do more. This deal helps it bulk up in the United States, where it is comparatively weak, and means it has more products to sell in fast growing Asia.  Nestlé also rounds out its product range, which at the moment centres on high-end Nespresso capsules and cheap instant drinks. It will now sell more packaged ground coffee and beans, for example. This will make a notable but not huge difference to the group’s top line, which analysts estimate will total nearly 92 billion Swiss francs this year. Based on the limited available financials, the deal looks reasonable. Nestlé is paying 3.6 times the sales of the business it is acquiring: higher than Nestlé’s current enterprise value multiple of 2.9 times sales but bang in line with Starbucks, Thomson Reuters data show.  To complicate things, though, there are probably ongoing royalties too, which would effectively reduce the margins of the acquired businesses. Nestlé did not release any details on this, but it does pay such a fee for its long-standing deal with posh ice-cream brand Haagen-Dazs.  For Starbucks the logic is a bit less clear. Its Channel Development division, which includes some of the out-of-shop products it is selling to Nestlé, delivers chunky margins. And given the group’s huge store footprint, this was an interesting alternative way to pursue growth. Instead, spending the proceeds on buybacks and dividends shows a lack of ambition. Still, retiring $7 billion of stock could give the $80 billion company a bit of a boost.",5072018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nestle-starbucks-breakingviews/breakingviews-nestl-gets-welcome-jolt-from-starbucks-deal-idUSKBN1I817O
